</p>
<p id="p_2">	The petitioners have sought for issuance of a Writ of Certiorari  to quash the order dated 28.2.2007 passed by the  Debt Recovery Appellate  Tribunal, Chennai  in  MA.No.90 of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	2. The facts which led to the filing of the writ petition are  as  follows.      The  first  respondent  is  a  Partnership Firm  and  respondents 2 and 3 are  its  partners.   The first respondent availed loan from the fourth respondent Bank  to the limit of  Rs.90 lakhs on 9.9.1991.   The  respondents 2 and 3 also created  equitable mortgage on their properties by depositing  the  title  deeds  for  the  said  loan.  There was  default  in  repayment  and  for  recovery, the fourth respondent  herein  filed  Original  Application in O.A.No.238 of 1998 on the file of  Debts  Recovery  Tribunal  at  Chennai  and it  was   re-numbered  as  O.A.No.1098 of 2001.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	 3.  Respondents 1 to 3  were  set  exparte on 25.2.1999 and  exparte  Decree also came to be passed  on  20.9.1999.   The respondents 1 to 3  filed  Application in  I.A.No.2240 of 1999 for setting aside the exparte  order  and  Application in  I.A.No.2606 of 1999  for  setting aside  the  exparte  Decree.   The Applications  were  dismissed  for  default  on 20.11.2001.   The  respondents 1  to 3   herein filed  I.A.Nos.897  and  898  of  2001  to  restore  the  Interlocutory  Applications  in  I.A.Nos.2240  and  2606  of  1999 and they were dismissed on 1.5.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	 4. In  the  meanwhile, in execution of the Recovery Certificate,  the  immovable  property  was  brought  to sale  by    public  auction held on 7.3.2003 and the petitioners herein  took  part in the auction and  purchased  the  property.   The  respondents  1 to 3 filed  I.A.No.146 of 2003 for setting aside the auction held  on 7.3.2003  and  I.A.No.150 of 2003  seeking  for  not  to  confirm  the sale.   The  Debts  Recovery  Tribunal  passed  a conditional order, dated 10.4.2003 in   I.A.No.150 of 2003  to defer the  confirmation of sale  on  condition  the  respondents 1 to 3  paying a sum of                 Rs.10 lakhs  to the Bank or to the Recovery  Officer on or before 25.4.2003.   The Tribunal dismissed  I.A.No.146 of 2003 on 15.4.2003 as  not  maintainable.   When the matter was  called on  25.4.2003,  the respondents 1 to 3 sought  for  extension of time and  the Debts Recovery  Tribunal  rejected the request  and allowed  the   Recovery Officer to  proceed  further  in  accordance  with  law.     Sale  Certificates were issued to the petitioners  on 28.5.2003.   
</p>
<p id="p_6">	  5.  The  respondents 1 to 3 herein filed  appeal  in  IN.No.197 of 2003 challenging the orders passed by the Debts Recovery   Tribunal-II, Chennai  in  I.A.Nos.897 and 898 of 2001 and  the   Debts  Recovery  Appellate  Tribunal, by order dated 29.8.2003   directed the appellants  therein/respondents 1 to 3  herein to pay  requisite  Court  fee  if  they want to challenge the final order  of  Debts Recovery Tribunal.   Challenging the abovesaid  order  of  the Appellate  Tribunal,  the respondents 1 to 3  herein  filed  Writ  Petition  in  W.P.No.28235 of 2003  without  notice to the Court  auction  purchasers viz.  the petitioners  herein  and  this  Court  by Order dated 14.10.2003  set  aside  the  exparte  Decree  passed  by  the Debts  Recovery  Tribunal  subject  to payment of  costs  of  Rs.10,000/-  to the  fourth  respondent  Bank.   The  order  was  complied with and the Original  Application is  still  pending.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	   6.  Challenging the  Order  of  this Court  in W.P.No.28235 of  2003,  the  fourth  respondent  Bank  has preferred  Special  Leave  Petition  before the Supreme Court  and  it  was dismissed  by Order dated  8.7.2004.   Thereafter,  the  fourth  respondent  Bank  filed  Review  Application  No.13 of 2004  and the petitioners  herein filed  Review  Application  No.19 of 2004  seeking  for   review  of  the  Order  dated  14.10.2003  passed  in  W.P.No.28235  of  2003 and  this Court  dismissed  the  Review  Applications by Order  dated 5.10.2004 by observing that the auction purchasers  are free to  represent  their  case before the  Debts  Recovery  Tribunal in the main Original Application.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	7.  Based on the above  observation, the petitioners herein   filed Application in  I.A.No.20 of 2005 on the file of  Debts  Recovery  Tribunal-II,  Chennai   seeking  for  delivery  of  possession  of  the property  purchased  by  them.   The  Debts  Recovery  Tribunal,  by  order  dated  28.3.2006,  allowed  the  Application by  directing  the Recovery  Officer  to  put  the petitioners  in  possession  of  the property.    The respondents 1 to 3  herein challenged  the said  order  by preferring Appeal  in M.A.No.90 of  2006 before the  Debts  Recovery Appellate  Tribunal, Chennai  and the Appellate Tribunal  by  order, dated 13.7.2006,  allowed  the  appeal and set  aside  the order and directed the  Debts  Recovery  Tribunal  to take up  the Interlocutory Application  in  I.A.No.20 of 2005  along  with  O.A.No.1098 of  2001 and dispose  of  them  in accordance  with law.   Challenging the said order,  the  petitioners herein preferred  writ  petition  in W.P.No.29356 of  2006  and a  Division  Bench  of  this  Court, by Order  dated  29.11.2006,  set  aside  the  order  of  the Appellate  Tribunal  and remitted the case  to  Debts  Recovery  Appellate Tribunal to decide the issue  whether  the  rights  of  the bonafide  purchasers  stand  curtailed  or not  even  after the  exparte Decree  is   set  aside.   On  remand,  the  Debts  Recovery  Appellate  Tribunal  held  that the petitioners  herein  are  not  bonafide purchasers of the property and  set  aside  the sale  and  directed the respondents 1 to 3 to  deposit  the entire  amount  claimed  in Original Application.   The  said  impugned  order  is  challenged   in  the present  writ  petition.
</p>	
<p id="p_9">	8. Mr.R.Murari,  learned counsel for the petitioners, submitted  that the petitioners were not made parties to any  Application filed  by respondents 1 to 3 and the question of        being aware of any such Application at the time  when the sale was confirmed  in their favour would not arise and the finding of the  Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal that the petitioners were live to the litigation between the Decree  Holder and the Judgment  Debtors  and  purchased the properties with a view to make a capital out  of  it  and  they  are  not  bonafide  purchasers  and  their  purchase  cannot  be  lawfully protected   is  totally  incorrect  and  liable  to  be  set  aside.    It  is   his  further  contention  that  though  the  petitioners  were  not  aware of the  petitions  filed by  the respondents 1 to 3/Judgment  debtors   to   set aside the sale,  it  however  transpires  that  the  Recovery  Officer had  passed  conditional  order  directing  them to  deposit a sum of  Rs.10  lakhs   as  pre-condition  for the  sale  not  being  confirmed and  they  failed  to  comply with such a condition and the petitions  were  dismissed and  the  sale  was  confirmed   and  therefore  the  respondents 1 to 3  could  not  be permitted to rely upon any such  application   at   this  point  of  time and  the petitioners who are strangers to the Court proceedings  have purchased  the  properties  in  the  Court  auction sale and  the  sale has been confirmed  and  they  are  bonafide  purchasers  and  the  sale in their  favour  is  protected   and  they  cannot  be  asked  to  restitute  the  properties  to  the  Judgment  Debtors  even  if  the  Decree  is  set  aside  and  as  bonafide  purchasers,  they are entitled to  possession of the properties  and  the  order  of  the  Appellate Tribunal  is  erroneous  and  liable  to  be  set  aside.    In  support  of  his  submission,  he  relied on the following  decisions  of the   Supreme Court  and    this  Court.</p><pre id="pre_2">

          9. Per  contra,  Mr. T.V. Ramanujam,   learned  Senior  Counsel appearing for the respondents 1 to 3/Judgment  Debtors  submitted  that  the  petitioners  are  not  bonafide  purchasers  for   valid  consideration  and  the  properties  have been sold  for  a  pittance  while the actual value  is  more  than  Rs.8  Crores  and  the  petitioners  were  well  aware  of  the  Applications  filed  by the  respondents 1 to 3  herein for  setting aside  the  exparte  Decree and  to  stay  the  sale  and  with  the  knowledge of  pending  litigation,  the  purchase  has  been  made  and  such  purchase  is  not  legally  protected  and  in  any  event  the  Application  seeking  possession has been filed  beyond  the  statutory  period  of   limitation  viz.      one year,  as  prescribed  under  <a href="/doc/1446285/" id="a_6">Article 134</a> of  the  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_7">Limitation  Act</a>  and  it is hit by limitation and hence   it  is  not  maintainable.   The  learned  Senior  Counsel   further  contended  that  the  auction sale  proceedings  became  void  due  to  operation of   Rule  57  Second  Schedule to  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">Income  Tax Act</a>,  1961,  when the   Auction Purchasers failed  to  deposit  25%  of  the    auction amount  on the date of  auction  after   declaration  as  successful  bidders  and even  after default of such deposit,  the property  was not   re-sold  and further the Auction purchasers  had  failed to deposit  the balance of purchase money  within  a  period  of  fifteen days  as  mandated in Rule  57 as well as in the  Terms  and Conditions of  sale   and  the  Sale  had  become null and void  and  the  Sale  proceedings  are completely  wiped  out   as if  they  do  not  exist  in  the  eye  of  law and  the  petitioners  are  not  entitled  to  possession  and    order of  the  Appellate  Tribunal  is   sustainable.    In  support  of  his  submission,  the  learned  Senior  Counsel   relied  on the  following  decisions   of  the  Apex  Court  and  High  Court.

"1. <a href="/doc/1984005/" id="a_9">MANILAL MOHANLAL SHAH  AND OTHERS V. SARDAR SAYED AHMED SAYED MAHMAD AND ANOTHER</a> (AIR  1954 SUPREME COURT 349)

	10. In  reply,  Mr. Murari,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  submitted  that  the  respondents  1 to 3/Judgment Debtors  have  for  the  first  time  raised  the  plea  that  the  sale  had  become  null  and  void  because  of  non-compliance  of  provisions of   Rule  57 of  Second Schedule to  the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">Income-Tax  Act</a>, 1961 in the  additional  counter  filed  by  the  respondents  1 to  3   on   5.11.2009  and  the  sale  proceedings  would  be  conducted  by the  Recovery  Officer  as per the  procedure  contained in        Second  Schedule to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_14">Income-Tax  Act</a> and the Recovery  Officer  would  follow such  Rules  contained  in  Second Schedule   as  far  as  possible  with necessary  modifications  to  the  extent  necessary and there is a discretion  conferred on  the  Recovery  Officer  under  <a href="/doc/1444810/" id="a_15">Section 29</a> of the  Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993,  to follow  Rule  57  as  far  as  possible and    it  makes   Rule  57  as  directory  only  and  the  petitioners  had  deposited  25%  of  the    bid  amount  by  Draft  and  Cheque  on the date of  sale  itself  and the balance  of  the purchase money  has  also  been  deposited  and  it  is not  open to the  respondents to  challenge  the sale  proceedings on the ground  of  violation in conduct  of  sale  and  valuable  rights  have  accrued  to the    Auction  purchasers and there is  no  force  in the  submission made by the  learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the  respondents 1 to  3.   In support  of  this submission,  the  learned  counsel  for      the petitioners relied  on  the decision of  a Division Bench of    Andhra  Pradesh  High  Court   in   P.MOHANREDDY AND ORS.     VS. DEBTS RECOVERY APELLATE TRIBUNAL AND ORS.           (AIR  2004  AP  94).

	11.  From  the  submissions  made  at  the Bar,  it  would  emerge that  the  sale  proceedings  are  challenged  on  the  ground of  non-compliance  of  provision  of  Rule 57  of Second Schedule  to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_16">Income-Tax  Act</a>, 1961  for  recovering the amount of  debt  due.

          12.  <a href="/doc/1444810/" id="a_17">Section 29</a> of  Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 makes the Second and Third Schedules  to the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_18">Income-Tax  Act</a> , 1961  applicable  for recovery  of  debt  due under the Act.    Rules 57 and 58 of Second Schedule  to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_19">Income-Tax  Act</a>, 1961  are relied upon to have the        auction sale set aside  for  breach of the said  Rules.   The  said  Rules  read  as  under.


</pre><p id="p_10">	"57. Deposit by purchaser and resale in  default:- (1) On every sale of immovable property, the person declared to be the purchaser shall pay, immediately after such declaration,  a deposit of twenty five per cent   on  the amount of his purchase money, to the Officer conducting the sale; and, in default of such deposit, the property  shall  forthwith  be  resold.
</p>

<p id="p_11">(2) The full amount of purchase money payable shall be paid by the purchaser to the Tax Recovery Officer on or before the  fifteenth day  from the date of sale of the property.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	58.  Procedure in default of  payment:-  In default of payment within the period mentioned in the preceding rule, the deposit  may, if the Tax Recovery Officer thinks fit, after defraying  the expenses of the sale, be forfeited to the Government, and  the property shall be resold, and the defaulting purchaser shall forfeit all claims to the property or to any part of the sum for which it may subsequently be sold."
</p>
<p id="p_13">Similar provisions are contained in Code of  Civil Procedure, 1908 also.  Rule 57 is identically worded as that of Rules 84 and 85 of  Order 21 of  CPC and Rule 58 is identically worded as that of  Rule 86 of  Order  21  of  CPC.   The principles and decisions interpreting  Rules 84, 85  and 86 of Order 21  of  CPC  would squarely apply        in case of  Rules 57 and 58 of  Second Schedule  to  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_20">Income-Tax  Act</a>, 1961.  
</p><p id="p_14">               13.  The  Supreme Court  considered  Rules  84, 85 and 86 of Civil Procedure  Code in the decision in   MANILAL MOHANLAL SHAH'S CASE (AIR 1954 SUPREME COURT 349) and laid down as  follows.
</p><p id="p_15">   "8. The provision regarding the deposit of  25 per cent by the purchaser other than the decree-holder is mandatory as the language  of the rule suggests.   The  full amount of the purchase money must be paid within fifteen days from the date of the sale but the         decree-holder is entitled to the advantage of a            set-off.  The provision for payment is, however, mandatory  (Rule 85).  If the payment is not made  within the period of fifteen days, the court has the discretion to forfeit the deposit and there the discretion ends but the obligation of the court to re-sell the property    is imperative.    A  further consequence of      non-payment is that the defaulting purchaser forfeits all claim to the property ... (Rule 86).
</p>
<p id="p_16">    9.  .....   There was default in depositing    25 percent of the purchase money and further there was no payment of the full amount   of  the purchase money within   fifteen days from the date of the sale.  Both the deposit and the payment of the purchase money being mandatory under the combined effect  of  rules 84      and 85, the  Court has the discretion to forfeit the deposit but it was bound to  re-sell the property with the result that on default the purchaser forfeited all claim to the property.   These provisions leave no doubt that unless the deposit and the payment are made as required by the mandatory provisions of the rules  there is no sale in the eye of law in favour of the defaulting purchaser and no right to own and possess the property accrues to him.
</p><p id="p_17">      10.  ....
</p><p id="p_18">    11.  Having examined the language of the relevant rules and the judicial decisions bearing upon the subject we are of opinion that the provisions of the rules requiring the deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase money immediately on the person being declared  as a purchaser  and the payment of the balance within         15 days of the sale are mandatory and upon non-compliance with these provisions there is no sale at all.   The rules do not contemplate that there can be any sale in favour of a purchaser without depositing  25 per cent of the purchase money in the    first instance and the balance within 15 days.   When there is no-sale within the contemplation of these rules, there can be no question of material irregularity in the conduct of the sale.  Non-payment of the price on the part of the defaulting purchaser renders the sale proceedings as a complete nullity.   The very fact that the court is bound to re-sell the property in the event of a default shows that the previous proceedings for sale are completely wiped out as if they do not exist  in the eye of law.       We hold, therefore, that in the circumstances of the present case  there was no sale and the purchasers acquired no rights  at  all."
</p>
<p id="p_19">The above decision has been followed by the Supreme Court in the subsequent  decision in BALRAM SON OF BHASA RAM'S CASE (AIR 1996 SUPREME COURT 2781) and it was held that the duty to pay the full amount of purchase money within the prescribed period of    15  days from the date of sale is cast on the purchaser by virtue of Rule 85 of  Order XXI  CPC  and therefore, the entire responsibility   to make  full compliance of the mandatory provision is his and      non-compliance of the same would render the sale a nullity.
</p>
<p id="p_20">          14. The Auction Sale Notice, in the present case, is found in the typed set filed by respondents 1 to 3 and the Upset Price fixed was  Rs.1,15,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore and Fifteen Lakhs only) and the Conditions mentioned therein are as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_21">"1.  The intending bidders should pay 10% of the upset price of the property as EMD by means of a D.D. Drawn in favour of the Recovery Officer, Chennai Debts Recovery Tribunal-II, Chennai payable at Chennai before 12 Noon on the date of auction.  They can inspect the property between 11.00 A.M., and 3.00 P.M.  on  8.2.2003.
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">2. The successful bidder should pay 25% of the           bid amount (less the E.M.D) immediately on the sale being knocked down in his favour and the balance money within 15 days.

3. The successful bidder should bear the charges/fee payable for conveyance such as Registration fee, stamp duty etc as applicable as per law in addition to poundage fee.

4. The Recovery officer has the absolute right to accept or reject a bid or postpone/cancel the sale.

5. ......."

The auction was held on 7.3.2003 at 3.30 pm and the petitioners    bid for a sum of Rs.1,15,50,000/- (Rupees One Crore and Fifteen Lakhs and Fifty thousand only) was accepted.

</pre><p id="p_22">	15.  The petitioners claim that they have paid the deposit of 25% on the amount of purchase money on the date of sale itself.   As per the order of the Recovery Officer dated 7.3.2003, a copy of which is found in the typed set filed by the respondents 1 to 3, the deposit of  25% of the purchase money is made by the petitioners in the following manner and for better appreciation, the order is reproduced below.
</p><p id="p_23">"DRC 164/2001	
      Received Rs.28,87,500/- (Rupees twenty eight lakhs eighty seven thousand five hundred only) consisting      2 DDs for 11,50,000/- and 2 cheques for Rs.17,37,500/- towards 25% bid amount from  Mr.C.N.Paramasivam, 16,  TTK Road, 1st Cross Street, Alwarpet,    Chennai-18 and Mr.E.M.C.Palaniappan, 46, Prakasam Street, T.Nagar, Chennai-17 for the properties auctioned on    7-3-2003 in the above DRC proceedings and the balance bid amount and 1% poundage payable by the bidders within 15 days is  Rs.87,78,000/-."
</p>

<pre id="pre_4">From the above, it is seen that the petitioners have paid a sum of  Rs.17,37,500/- (Rupees seventeen lakhs thirty seven thousand five hundred only) by  two cheques while making the deposit of 25%      of the amount of the purchase money.

	16.  The Supreme Court, in the decision in RAO MAHMOOD AHMED KHAN'S CASE (AIR 1995 SUPREME COURT 2195), while interpreting  Rule 285-D of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Rules, which is regarded as parimateria to Rule 84 of      Order XXI  of  CPC  held that the deposit of 25 per cent of  bid amount by cheque will not be a valid tender within the meaning of the Rule and the Rule does not contemplate any payment by cheque but a cash deposit of 25 per cent of the bid amount and there was non-compliance of the rule.   For better appreciation, the relevant observation made by Their Lordships in the said decision are as follows:
</pre><p id="p_24">   "11. Thus, it is settled law that the provisions of Order 21, Rule 84, 85 and 86 of the Code of Civil Procedure are mandatory and the provisions of Rules 285-D and 285-E being similar in terms of the aforementioned corresponding provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and in view of the aforesaid discussion there is no escape from declaring the sale a nullity if  Rule 285-D is not complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_25">    12. ..... The question is whether such a payment by cheque could be regarded as a valid deposit within the meaning of   Rule 285-D.   As discussed above  Rule 285-D is a mandatory rule according to which if        25 per cent of the bid amount is not deposited  immediately the land shall forthwith be again put up and sold.   In other words on the failure of the purchaser to deposit 25 per cent of the bid amount immediately the land shall be resold immediately after such failure the very same day.  If for instance the 25 per cent of the bid amount is accepted by cheque and subsequently the purchaser changes his mind and advises his banker not to encash the cheque or there is no amount in the account of the purchaser in the bank and the cheque is bounced, the purpose of Rule 285-D would be frustrated and thus the mandatory provisions would be rendered nugatory.   The result would be that neither the authorities would be in a position to forfeit any amount of the purchaser nor the authority would be in a position to defray the expenses of the sale as contemplated by Rule 285-E.   The other consequence that will follow is that the re-sale of land will have to be delayed and a fresh proclamation for sale has to be issued as provided by Rule 285-G.   It, therefore, appears to us that Rule 285-D does not contemplate any payment by cheque but a cash deposit of 25 per cent of the bid amount has to be made in accordance with the requirement of the rule, otherwise the very purpose of the mandatory rule 285-D would be frustrated and rendered nugatory.   In these facts and circumstances we are of the view that deposit of 25 per cent of the bid amount by cheque  will not be a valid tender within the meaning of the rule."

<p id="p_26">      17.  Rule 57 of  Second Schedule to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_21">Income-Tax Act</a>, 1961 is a mandatory Rule directing a deposit of 25 per cent on the amount       of the purchase money immediately on being declared to be the purchasers  and it does not  contemplate any payment by cheque  but a cash deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase money and hence      part payment of deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase money         by cheques will not be a valid tender within the meaning of the      Rule and there was no compliance of Rule 57(1) as well as the Conditions of  auction sale.
</p>
<p id="p_27">	18.  The second limb of the contention of the learned  Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents 1 to 3 pertaining to  non-compliance of provision of  Rule 57(2) is that the  Auction purchasers viz.  the petitioners had failed to deposit  the balance purchase money within a period of fifteen days from the date of sale and hence there was no sale at  all.
</p>
<p id="p_28">	19.  The payment of balance of purchase money within fifteen days from the date of sale is mandatory as per  Rule 57 and it is also mandatory condition stipulated in the Auction Sale Notice.  Moreover, the Recovery Officer in his order dated 7.3.2003, referred above, has also reiterated that the balance of bid amount and         one per cent poundage fee  payable by the petitioners within 15 days  is  Rs.87,78,000/- (Rupees eighty seven lakhs and seventy eight thousand only).   The period  of  fifteen days  from the date of  sale lapsed on 22.3.2003.  Admittedly, the auction purchasers/petitioners  did not pay the balance  of  purchase money  till  22.3.2003.   They did not  also file any petition  seeking for  extension  of  time.
</p>
<p id="p_29">	20.  The  petitioners in their  letter dated 2.5.2003 addressed to the  Recovery Officer,  a  copy  of  which is  found in the typed  set, have stated that  after the payment of  deposit of          25 per cent of the purchase money,  they have paid a sum of       Rs.10 lakhs on 30.4.2003  and  they  are  remitting on the said  date, viz. 2.5.2003, a sum of  Rs.15,00,000/- (Rupees fifteen lakhs only)  by  Pay Order  dated  2.5.2003, drawn on  Indus Ind Bank;               a  Cheque   for  Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakhs only)  dated  2.5.2003 , drawn on  HDFC  Bank  and  a  Cheque  for  Rs.1,89,000/- (Rupees one lakh and eighty nine thousand only) dated 2.5.2003, drawn on Citi  Bank and they have further stated  in  their  letter that  there is a balance of  purchase money to the tune  of  Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees fifty lakhs only) as on that  date and a loan has been sanctioned to them by  LIC Housing  Finance Limited, Teynampet  Branch for a sum of  Rs.50,00,000/-   (Rupees fifty lakhs only)  subject to  condition that the Debts  Recovery Tribunal  would register the property individually in the names of the petitioners conveying   50% undivided share of the property in each  person's  favour        and the balance amount of  Rs.50  lakhs  would  be  remitted by           LIC Housing  Finance Limited, Teynampet  Branch on their behalf and the petitioners  requested  for issuance of  letters  individually to them  stating  the balance and that the property would be registered individually in their names as undivided share of  land.   The petitioners also filed  individual memo  dated 6.5.2003 before      Debts Recovery Tribunal-II  stating that they have paid a sum of   Rs.59 lakhs approximately constituting  50% of the bid amount and the balance of 50% remains to be paid  and LIC Housing  Finance Limited, Teynampet  Branch  has sanctioned  loans in their  individual names for the above amount  and they pray for issuance of  Certificate of Sale  representing  50% of undivided  share in respect of the property  to each of them.   Pursuant to the above request of the petitioners, the  Recovery  Officer  issued  individual  Certificate  to each of the petitioners  certifying   that  they are  joint    successful bidders of the properties  in the  Auction  held on 7.3.2003  and  balance of  Rs.25  lakhs  is  payable by  each of  the  petitioners.   Thereafter,  on 28.5.2003, individual  Sale  Certificate in the     names   of the petitioners  were  issued  by  the  Recovery  Officer.   From the above, it  is  clear  that  the  Auction purchasers/petitioners  did  not  pay the balance of  purchase  money  within  fifteen days of  sale  viz. 22.3.2003  and no payment was made during that period and they have paid the full amount  of  purchase  money  only in the month of  May, 2003.    There  was  clear  non-compliance of  Rule 57 and  also  the   Conditions  of   sale.
</p>

<p id="p_30">	21.  A  Division Bench of  the  Bombay  High  Court  in the decision in  NARAYAN  KARWA'S  CASE  [2008]  296  ITR  545)  considered  Rule  57  of  Second Schedule of Income-Tax  Act, 1961   and held that failure to deposit the entire purchase money on or before the fifteenth day from the date of sale not  only  renders the sale invalid  but also renders the 25 per cent  purchase price deposited  on the date of auction liable  to  be  forfeited.   For  better  appreciation,  the relevant  portion of the above decision  is  extracted  below.
</p>
<p id="p_31">   "However,  in  the present case, it is an admitted  fact that  respondent No.4  has  failed to deposit  the  entire  purchase  price within the  time stipulated  under  the  Act.  According to the petitioners,  failure  to deposit the  entire purchase price  within the stipulated time, not only renders the sale invalid but  also  renders the      25 per cent deposit  made on the date of auction liable to be forfeited.
</p><p id="p_32">   It is not necessary for us to go into the question as to whether the failure on the part of the auction purchaser to deposit  the  entire purchase price within the stipulated  time renders  the 25 per cent purchase price  deposited on the date of auction sale liable  to be  forfeited.   Suffice it to say that the order of the  Tax  Recovery  Officer in confirming the auction  sale on   July 11, 1991, is wholly  unjustified because, in the present  case, respondent No.4  has not  deposited the entire purchase price on or before the fifteenth day from the date of sale, in spite of the specific provision contained in rule 57 of the Second  Schedule to the Act and in spite of  specific  clause  No.24 contained in the terms and conditions  of  sale.
</p><p id="p_33">.....  .....
</p><p id="p_34">There is no merit  in this contention, because there is neither any provision under the Act which permits the auction purchaser to deposit the entire purchase price beyond the period of  fifteen days from the date of sale nor there is any  provision empowering  any       authority    to grant extension of time.   Therefore, the Tax  Recovery  Officer could not  have  accepted the balance purchase price beyond the period  of         fifteen days from the  date of  sale.   The  argument  that  respondent No.4 had the  requisite  money  and that he was ready and willing to pay the entire purchase price within the stipulated time  cannot be  accepted, because, in our opinion, under  rule  57  read with the terms and conditions of sale, it was mandatory on the part of  respondent  No.4 to  deposit the entire  purchase price on or before the  fifteenth day from the date of sale.  Once  it  is  admitted that the entire purchase price has not been deposited within the stipulated  time, then, it must be held that  the sale had become  invalid  and  the  Tax  Recovery  Officer  could not  have confirmed the  sale."
</p>
<p id="p_35">The ratio of the  above decision  is  applicable to the facts of the present  case.
</p>
<p id="p_36">	22. There is no separate  procedure  laid  down in    Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993  for recovering the debt due.   <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_22">Section 29</a> of the Act  makes       Second and Third  Schedules to  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_23">Income-Tax   Act</a>,  1961  and the Income-Tax (Certificate Proceedings)  Rules, 1962  as  in force     from time to  time,  as  far  as  possible   applicable with necessary modifications as if the said provisions and the Rules  referred  to the amount of debt  due under the Act  instead of  to  the  Income-Tax.
</p>
<p id="p_37">	23.  A  Division  Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court  in the decision in P.MOHANREDDY AND OTHER'S CASE (AIR 2004 AP 94)  held that <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_24">Section 29</a> of the  Act  does not enjoin upon the Recovery  Officer to follow  the  provisions  of Recovery of  Tax  Rules  provided in Second Schedule to  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_25">Income-Tax  Act</a> in letter and spirit  but  gives him discretion to follow the same as  far as  possible  and  <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_26">Section 29</a> of the Act  makes  Rule 57 as directory only and the belated  payment of purchase money will not  affect the legality and  validity of the sale.
</p>
<p id="p_38">	24. With respect,  we  are not  in  agreement  with the view taken by the Division Bench of  Andhra Pradesh High Court in the above decision.
</p>
<p id="p_39">	25. <a href="/doc/1444810/" id="a_27">Section 29</a> of the  Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 makes the Second Schedule to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_28">Income Tax Act</a>  applicable for  recovery of the debt due and the   Recovery  Officer is bound to follow the said rule.   In the absence of any rule under the   Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and        Financial Institutions Act, 1993  modifying the  Second Schedule to  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_29">Income-Tax  Act</a>, 1961,  it  is  not open to the Recovery  Officer to deviate from the said  rules and make modifications of his own.   The   rules  do not contemplate that there can be any sale in favour of  a purchaser without  depositing 25% of the purchase money in the    first instance and the balance within 15  days.   The very fact that  the  Recovery  Officer is bound to resell the property in the event of default  shows that the previous  proceedings  for  sale  are completely  wiped  out.    The only discretion conferred on the Recovery  Officer is  whether to forfeit  the deposit of defaulting purchaser or not.  
</p>
<p id="p_40"> 	26.  Keeping  in view the  intent and object of  Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, in  our  view,  the  Recovery  Officer is  obliged to follow the provisions of  Second  and  Third  Schedules  to  the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_30">Income-Tax  Act</a>, 1961 with regard to recovery of  debt due and in the absence of any modification,  Rule 57  is  mandatory only.
</p>
<p id="p_41">	27.  The petitioners, being auction purchasers,  failed to deposit 25% of the purchase money on the date of sale and the full amount of purchase  money  within  15  days  from the date of  sale and having not complied with the mandatory provision under Rule  57 read with the conditions of sale  have  forfeited  all claim  to the properties. 
</p>
<p id="p_42">          28. In view of  our  conclusion that there was no sale and the purchasers  acquired  no rights  at all to the properties,  there is     no need to go into the merits of the contentions as to whether the petitioners are bonafide  purchasers and as to whether the claim of the petitioners  is  barred by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_31">Limitation  Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_43">	29.  The conclusion of the Debts Recovery Appellate  Tribunal that the sale in favour of the petitioners  cannot  be legally protected and liable to be set  aside,  is  sustainable  albeit  for the reasons  stated  above.
</p>
<pre id="pre_5">	30.  The  Writ  Petition   is   dismissed.   However,  there         shall  be no order  as  to  costs.   Connected  M.P.Nos.1  and  2  of  2007 are  closed.
