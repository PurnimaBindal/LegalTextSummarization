<p id="p_2">1.       The present proceedings are a classic example of a statute being given

an effect, which perhaps the legislature never intended it to have. The

controversy concerns the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory

Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act) and the effect thereof on Rajkiya Pratibha

Vikas Vidyalayas (RPVVs).

 of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD). To understand the intent

and thought process which went into establishing the RPVVs, it is necessary

to reproduce in toto the said Cabinet Note:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "The schooling pattern in Delhi is clearly divided into
           two streams. On the one hand we have the so called public
           schools which charge high fees and on the other hand we have
           the Govt. and aided schools which provide free education.
           Those who are being deterred by the poor standard of
           education in Govt. schools, are forced to send their wards to
           high fee charging schools. The poor are also forced to send
           their wards to Govt. schools. In such a situation, very bright
           children are grouped with less than average children.
           Consequently, even bright children having potential suffer.
           This situation has to be corrected. Majority of the people are
           not bothered about status symbols and shall willingly prefer
           Govt. schools provided good education is available there. A
           Govt. school or a public school should be a matter of choice
           not of compulsion, as it is today.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   Directorate of Education has given serious thought to
           this situation and has decided to make de-novo efforts to raise
           the standard of education in Govt. schools to a level
           acceptable to most of the parents. It has been proposed to
           select certain Government schools in different areas of the
           National Capital Territory of Delhi for upgrading to this level
           by making necessary addition to the school, making changes

            in the staff, selection of good principals and giving them
           certain more powers within the existing framework. For
           giving good educational facilities, emphasis will be given on
           the selection of the teachers, the head of school, the students,
           the quantum of autonomy and system of achievement
           evaluation. These schools will also be provided extra facilities
           for co−curricular activities and for inculcation of values. It is
           because of the lack of these ingredients that the majority of
           the Government schools are not able to provide quality
           education.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   In order to have at least some Govt. schools, to begin
           with, having standards comparable to those available in the
           so-called better public schools, we shall have to incorporate
           the following ingredients in our schools on the basis of current
           achievement but also taking into account his previous record
           and his ability to build up an institution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         2.        Teachers: We shall have to choose teachers who have
         given a consistently good performance over the year and who
         are well versed in the language they are expected to teach in.
         All teachers shall be very carefully selected from among those
         available in the government schools. On being posted in the
         pace setting schools, they will not be transferred for at least 5
         years, except on extreme administrative grounds. There will,
         however, be no transfer on request.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         3.        Resources: Education will be absolutely free. However,
         with the increased rates of the pupil‟s fund and the PTA fund,

          the schools should have adequate funds to take care of
         incentive and minor facilities.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         4.        Management: Each such school shall be adopted by an
         officer to be decided by the D.E. The adoptive officer will be
         authorized to issue orders in respect of administrative matters
         connected with that school and no separate orders from the
         district Dy. Director will be necessary in this regard. He will
         also be responsible for inspection and supervision of the
         schools.          The Principal of the school shall be directly
         accountable to the officer adopting the school.

          beginning of each academic session, the school will prepare an
         institutional plan laying down the objectives, strategies and the
         resources available. After the session is over, a self evaluation
         exercise shall be undertaken and review of the work shall be
         done by the Advisory Committee. Accountability of the staff
         will be enforced and appropriate action taken.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">         6.        Pupils Achievement Evaluation: In order that continuous
         and comprehensive evaluation of the pupils is done, it will be
         necessary to keep a proper record of the students‟ work and
         conduct during the year and to ensure that cumulative record
         cards are maintained for each student and shown to his
         guardian after every terminal test.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">         These schools shall also be given freedom to adopt more strict
         criteria of promotion of students and their admission to
         different streams in Class−XI.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">         7.        Infrastructure &amp; facilities: Every such school shall
         provide Computer Education as a compulsory subject of study
         for all students and also for those interested, as an elective
         subject.        Complete modern technological hardware will be
         made available to these schools. This will include OHP, VCR
         Projector, latest PA system etc.       The schools shall also be
         provided with a hall, playgrounds and all the three streams at
         the +2 level.

         be allowed only to class VIth to IXth and XIth. From the IInd
         year, admission will be open to all the classes for children who

          have studied for at least last two years in the Govt. or aided
         schools. Children will be admitted strictly on the basis of
         performance in the admission test which will be of the level of
         class to which admission is desired and, for this purpose, these
         schools shall be excluded from the Admission Plan. All the
         aspirants for admission will be tested in English, Hindi, Maths
         and Gen. Science. The enrolment in each section shall not
         exceed 35 under any circumstances and each class shall not
         have more than three sections. The pace setting schools shall
         run in single shift.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                   To begin with, it is proposed to have one such pace-
         setting school at the rate of one school in 3-4 zones from the
         session 1997-98. No new school will be established but one
         such existing school preferably located in a cluster of schools
         will be selected for conversion into a pace setting school.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                   The proposal has no legal implications and does not
         involve any additional financial liability. As such the same is
         being placed before the Cabinet for consideration and approval
         on the following counts:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">         1.        To allow 9 schools at the rate of one each in 3-4 zones to
         run on the above mentioned lines w.e.f. the academic session
         1997-98;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">         2.        To allow admission of students to classes VI to IX &amp; XI
         during 1997-98 and to all classes from VI onward from 1998-
         99 onward, purely on merit to be determined through a suitable
         admission test.

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">          3.        To give additional facilities to these schools as
         mentioned in the above note.

         Education and the Chief Minister."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">3.       It is the uncontroverted position that the intent and thought process

that had gone into establishing RPVVs bore fruit and the examination

results of the students of RPVVs vis-à-vis students of other Government

schools have been far superior.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.       However when the RPVVs published the admission notice for

Classes VI and IX for the Academic Session 2010-11, by holding entrance

test consisting of objective type questions to test numerical ability, mental

ability, general knowledge and language comprehension, the Member

Secretary of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights

(NCPCR) [constituted under the Commissions for <a href="/doc/506243/" id="a_1">Protection of Child

Rights Act</a>, 2005 (CPCR Act)] protested, averring the said procedure, of

admission by holding a selection test, to be violative of Section 13 of the

RTE Act and demanded withdrawal of the said admission notice.


</p><p id="p_8">5.       The Director of Education of the GNCTD responded as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                   "In the year, 1997, it was realized that in Government


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CM No. 5202/2012 in W.P.(C) No. 7796/2011                             Page 7 of 33</span>
          Schools, there are many students who have potential to excel
         given right environment. It was also realized that such students
         from low economic strata but having potential cannot afford to
         attend public schools. It was proposed to shape their excellence
         and provide a platform to cater to their higher needs of
         academic excellence. Accordingly, Government proposed to
         establish pace setting Government Schools of special category
         to provide better conditions of teaching learning environment
         and better infrastructure and thus Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas
         Vidyalayas came into existence with the approval of the
         Cabinet.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                   The entry level of admission in RPVVs is Class-VI. The
         students are taken from the lot of students who are already
         getting education in any Government / Government Aided
         Schools as well as schools managed by Local Bodies to provide
         them further excellence in education. In this way, the selection
         of such students from above category of schools to the RPVVs
         by the way of test is not an infringement to their Right to
         Education. To admit them in RPVVs means to shape their
         potential as the RPVVs were established with the view to cater
         to those students who belong to low economic strata of the
         society but have potential and excellence.

<p id="p_9">6.       NCPCR was however not satisfied with the response aforesaid and

exercising its powers under Section 13(1)(j) of the CPCR Act initiated

proceedings and issued notice to show cause to the GNCTD to show as to

how the process of holding of selection test for admission to RPVVs was

not in violation of the rights of children and the policies under the RTE Act

framed for their benefit. Ultimately the NCPCR being of the view that the

thrust of RTE Act was on free, compulsory and quality education for all

children and the selection process for admission to RPVVs was resulting in

discrimination and was violative of Section 13 of the RTE Act, vide order

dated 17.06.2010 directed cancellation of all admissions made to RPVVs in

the year 2010-11 and further directed RPVVs to follow only permissible

method of selection of children under Section 2(o) of the RTE Act, i.e. the

random method for admission.

         (RTE) Act. The RTE Act prohibits any selection of students
         through screening process where students‟ intellectual skills
         are tested.          This has been mandated with the objective of
         sending children to neighbourhood schools irrespective of their
         intellectual acumen. This, in turn, is based on the assumption
         that almost all children are endowed with intellectual potential
         which has been realized in the education set up of the schools.
         It also saves the children from going through the trauma
         involved in the process of selection.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">                   The RPV Vidyalayas were set up with the objective of
         providing education to the gifted poor children studying in the
         government schools at par with the best private schools. The
         objective was to nurture and nourish the bright and gifted
         children, mainly poor, in a academic environment which
         cannot be provided in all the government schools.

          The alternative would be to abolish the Pratibha schools and
         treat all children in government schools equally. Since the
         provision of Right to Education Act are applicable only for
         children between 1st to 8th Class, it would be appropriate to
         admit gifted children through a selection process in Class IX so
         that they are able to pursue their studies in an enriched
         environment from Class IX to Class XII. This will also have
         the benefit of admitting more children in RPV Vidyalayas as
         the space presently devoted to Class VI, VII and VIII would be
         available to students of Class IXth and XIIth. This will also

RPVVs will cease to have the cutting edge environment and the advantage

they enjoy; also no purpose will be so served by transferring students, in

Class VI, from one school to another. The students admitted on random

selection in Class VI will necessarily have to be promoted to Class IX in

RPVVs thereby not leaving any vacant seats for admission by selection, as

proposed, in Class IX even. We are further of the view that confining

RPVVs from Class IX to XII, as proposed will also adversely affect the

functioning and result of RPVVs. As aforesaid, there must have been a

rationale in, while establishing RPVVs, providing for admission on

selection basis in Class VI and not in Class IX. A child by the time reaches

Class IX is generally found to have become set in his ways and difficult to

mould; the spark / talent in a child in Class V can be extinguished by the

time reaches Class IX, if not provided the right environment and may not be

capable of rekindling. Once the experts in the field of education had decided

to make admission on selection basis in Class VI, we are of the view that the

 same should not be interfered with.

humungous service in the field of education, at least in the city of Delhi but

we are unable to accept their contention that the best, as RPVVs represent

should either be made available to all or to none. The Courts cannot shut

their eyes to the dependency, of providing the best education, on the

availability of resources financial as well as manpower. From the material

placed before us, it is apparent that the teachers and the principals appointed

to the RPVVs are the best from their respective stocks. The Supreme Court,

in <a href="/doc/1563564/" id="a_12">State of Punjab v. Ram Lubhaya Bagga</a> (1998) 4 SCC 117, <a href="/doc/1577755/" id="a_13">Delhi

(1984) 1 SCC 619 has taken notice of the limited resources available with

the government and of the justifiability of optimum use thereof and the need

for distribution of the scarce resources to achieve and accomplish desired

results including by prioritization. What we have wondered is, whether a

wait for a utopian state of affairs (when all schools can be raised to the level

of RPVVs) should be allowed to come in the way of the small steps which

can be taken in the interregnum. Though the 19 RPVVs form a drop in the

 sea of over 1000 Government, Government Aided, Municipal, Cantonment

Board schools in the city of Delhi but we at the same time cannot shut our

eyes to the difference which they have made. Though the Courts are unable

to issue general directions for raising the level of education in all the

Government, Government Aided, Municipal, Cantonment Board schools to

the best possible or as in RPVVs but the same would not prevent this Court

from, in the exercise of wide jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India, to come to the rescue of an illustrious institution as

the RPVVs represent, from being shut down.

elementary education cannot be denied by adopting a screening procedure

but providing better opportunities and education to those amongst the

elementary level students who show the potential and the spark cannot be

said to be discriminatory. Discrimination can be only amongst those equally

placed. However, when institutions of learning of superior quality are few

and the admission seekers thereto far in excess, nothing wrong can be found

in allowing those few only who are found capable of utilization thereof, to

avail of the best. Every march in the direction of excellence has its own

martyrs and such martyrdom cannot be allowed to thwart or scuttle a step

 taken in public interest. The policy of effecting change in a phased manner

is a well accepted one. The Supreme Court as far back as in <a href="/doc/1264252/" id="a_16">State of Jammu

&amp; Kashmir v. Shri Triloki Nath Khosa</a> (1974) 1 SCC 19 observed that in

this unequal world the proposition that all men are equal has working

limitations, since absolute equality leads to Procrustean cruelty or sanctions

indolent inefficiency and therefore an imaginative and constructive modus

vivendi between commonness and excellence must be forged to make the

equality clauses viable. It was further held that the social meaning of

Articles 14 to 16 is neither dull uniformity nor specious 'talentism'; it is a

process of producing quality out of larger areas of equality. Shortlisting of

candidates on some rational and reasonable basis, though in the context of

employment was upheld in <a href="/doc/702482/" id="a_17">Union of India v. T. Sundararaman</a> (1997) 4

procedure aforesaid, earlier prevalent of admission to RPVVs can be said to

be in violation of Section 13 of the RTE Act inasmuch as, howsoever

laudatory the concept of RPVV may be, if it is found to be in violation of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CM No. 5202/2012 in W.P.(C) No. 7796/2011                         Page 27 of 33</span>
 Section 13 of the RTE Act (as held by NCPCR), it is not in the domain of

this Court to allow the same.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">23.      The preamble to the RTE Act describes the same as an Act to provide

for free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to

fourteen years. The same is not in conflict with RPVVs. <a href="/doc/101747386/" id="a_18">Section 3</a> of the Act

vests in a child of the age of 6 to 14 years, a right to free and compulsory

education in a neighbourhood school till completion of elementary

education. Transfer by selection from a Government, Government Aided,

Municipal, Cantonment Board school to RPVVs does not affect that right.

Section 5 of the RTE Act is relevant and the relevant part thereof is as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">         "5. Right of transfer to other school. − (1) Where in a school,
         there is no provision for completion of elementary education, a
         child shall have a right to seek transfer to any other school,
         excluding the school specified in sub-clauses (iii) and (iv) of
         clause (n) of <a href="/doc/186552640/" id="a_19">section 2</a>, for completing his or her elementary
         education.

<p id="p_40">RPVVs as aforesaid are specified category schools within the meaning of

right of a child already admitted to a school, under <a href="/doc/154784849/" id="a_22">Section 5</a> (supra) to be

 transferred to any other school for completing elementary education is only

where there is no provision for completion of elementary education in the

school to which the child stands admitted. Even where such right exists,

<a href="/doc/154784849/" id="a_23">Section 5</a> excludes therefrom the right to be transferred inter alia to a

specified category school. The selection as aforesaid for admission to Class

VI in RPVVs was from Government, Government Aided, Municipal,

Cantonment Board schools, all of which have a provision for completion of

elementary education. The RTE Act has thus not vested any right in a child

already admitted to a school, to be transferred to RPVVs and that being the

position, transfer by way of selection to RPVVs cannot be said to be

prohibited by RTE Act.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">24.      The aforesaid position including that the bar under <a href="/doc/152894358/" id="a_24">Section 13</a> supra

to admission by selection does not apply to admission by transfer from one

school to another at the level of Class VI becomes further clear from the

Delhi School Education (Free Seats for Students belonging to Economically

Weaker Sections and Disadvantaged Group) Order, 2011 issued under the

provisions of the RTE Act. While Clause 3 thereof mandates all schools to

admit children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in

Class I or at preschool level if available in the school to the extent of 25% of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CM No. 5202/2012 in W.P.(C) No. 7796/2011                           Page 29 of 33</span>
 the strength of that class, Clause 4(b) thereof prescribes the total number of

seats at the entry level i.e. Nursery or Class I to be not less than the total

number of seats in any other class of the school. The transfer by selection at

the level of Class VI to RPVVs thus does not affect the right created under

the RTE Act. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/418213/" id="a_25">Indian Drugs &amp; Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

v. Punjab Drugs Manufacturers Association</a> (1999) 6 SCC 247 negatived

the challenge to the policy on the ground that the same did not affect the

right of others. It is thus clear that the prohibition in <a href="/doc/152894358/" id="a_26">Section 13</a> of subjecting

a child to screening procedure during admission is applicable only to

admission at the entry level which is Nursery or Class I. Mention may be

made of Section 4 of the RTE Act providing for admission in a class

appropriate to the age of a child who has not been admitted in any school or

though admitted could not have completed elementary education. However,

RPVVs do not admit such children. Thus, the admission procedure by

selection in RPVVs is not in violation of Section 13 of the RTE Act and the

decision aforesaid of the NCPCR in this regard cannot be sustained and is

set aside.

 government itself having given up the said challenge in W.P.(C)

No.4973/2010 but it will be a pity if inspite of the matter having been

brought before us and finding RPVVs to have become a victim of

circumstances aforesaid, we, on technicalities fail to interfere and allow the

RPVVs, unarguably established for public purpose, for good of the society,

to die. Even otherwise, the thrust of the establishment of RPVVs is

affirmative and reformatory and, therefore, should be scrutinized under

judicial principles sensitive to the nature of the State‟s efforts. The Supreme

Court in <a href="/doc/1356187/" id="a_27">Union of India v. Rakesh Kumar</a> (2010) 4 SCC 50 held that the

enquiry while examining the validity of affirmative action measures should

be governed by the standard of proportionality though ofcourse such

affirmative action measures should be periodically reviewed. The

establishment as aforesaid of RPVVs is one such affirmative action

measure. This Court is also empowered to suo moto take notice of the

situation which has arisen and to take remedial steps. We are emboldened in

our said endeavour by the recent dicta of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1992267/" id="a_28">Dev Sharan v.

State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (2011) 4 SCC 769. It was held that the courts,

especially the higher courts, cannot afford to act as mere umpires while

 Constitutional invigilators and statutory interpreters are also one of the

trinity of the nation's appointed instrumentalities in the transformation of the

socio-economic order. It was yet further held that the judiciary in its sphere,

shares the revolutionary purpose of the Constitutional order, and when

called upon to decode social legislation must be animated by a goal-oriented

approach. Moreover, the present is not an inter-party dispute and has been

raised by way of PIL. The Apex Court in <a href="/doc/181685796/" id="a_29">Rural Litigation and Entitlement
