<p id="p_5">3.    The case of the Plaintiff is that in view of the instant conversion of
sulphur into sulphate, the sulphate becomes available for immediate
absorption by plants. The patented composition is used as a fertilizer
composition or a nutrient composition. According to the Plaintiff, the
previously available sulphur fertilizer formulations required administration in
high doses, led to uneven coverage and were not compatible with modern
irrigation methods. The patented composition, however, can be used at a
reduced dosage to uniformly deliver sulphur to the soil through drip and
sprinkler irrigation systems.

publication, pre-grant opposition was filed by one M/s. Jaishil Sulfur &amp;
Chemical Industries. Vide order dated 24th October, 2009, the Controller of
Patents rejected the patent for lack of novelty and inventive step. The said
order was challenged by the Plaintiff before the IPAB, which affirmed the
rejection of the patent on 4th April, 2012.
</p><p id="p_8">5.    The order of the IPAB came to be challenged before the Bombay High
Court, which set aside the order and remanded the matter back to the IPAB
on 13th April, 2016. After the remand order, the IPAB again considered the
matter on 21st April, 2016 and remanded it back to the Controller of Patents
for fresh consideration. Both orders i.e., the order of the Bombay High Court
and the second order of the IPAB dated 21 st April, 2016, were rendered on
grounds of non-supply of documents to the patentee and not on merits.
</p><p id="p_9">6.    The IPAB, in its order dated 21st April, 2016, directed the Controller of
Patents to decide the matter within three months. The operative portion of the
order reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             &quot;14. The reading of the above said provisions
             would make it crystal clear that the

             opposition along with the enclosures and thereafter
             by affording prescribed time limit of 3 months for
             submitting their reply and thereafter affording
             opportunity of hearing. It is seen that even the
             application for amendment of claim under Form 13
             was taken on record and the same was considered
             by the Assistant Controller of Patents &amp; Designs,

             claim in part, the Assistant Controller of Patents &amp;
             Designs, Mumbai has not thought it fit to afford
             opportunity to the appellant/applicant. In our

             (6) of the Patents Rules, 2003. We have no
             hesitation, to hold that the Assistant Controller of
             Patents &amp; Designs, Mumbai has adopted a strange
             and unfair procedure contrary to the mandatory
             provisions of the Act and Rules in examining patent
             application of the applicant/appellant herein, which
             resulted in the grave miscarriage of justice to the
             appellant/applicant. At this juncture, it is needless
             to state that the Assistant Controller of Patents &amp;
             Designs, Mumbai while considering the patent
             application acts as a quasi-judicial authority and
             such authority is expected to follow the statutory
             provisions of the Acts and Rules and by following
             the principles of natural justice. As far as the case
             on hand is concerned, in view of the above said
             factors, the applicant/appellant has been deprived
             of their opportunity to put forward their contentions
             and to substantiate their claims for seeking the
             relief of patentability of their inventions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             15. In view of the aforesaid factors, we are
             constrained to set aside the order of the Assistant
             Controller of Patents &amp; Designs, Mumbai dated
             24.10.2009 made in Patent Application No.
             40/MUM/2007. Consequently, the Controller of
             Patents &amp; Designs, Mumbai shall reconsider the
             Patent Application No.40/MUM/2007 filed by the
             applicant/appellant herein by affording reasonable
             opportunity to both sides and put forward their
             respective contentions and thereafter pass orders
             on merits and in accordance with law within a

granted on 11th April, 2017.
</p><p id="p_12">8.      Post-grant oppositions were also filed challenging the grant of the
patent. The same are stated to be pending decision. Defendant No.1 herein
i.e., Dharmaj Crop Guard Limited, also filed a post grant opposition on 7 th
October, 2017. During the pendency of the post grant opposition, the Plaintiff
acquired knowledge of the Defendant No.1&#x27;s agricultural composition,
launched under the brand names &quot;SUFFAR 90&quot; and &quot;COZY WET 90 WDG&quot;.
According to the Plaintiff, the impugned products infringed the Plaintiff&#x27;s
patent. Legal notices were issued to the Defendant No.1 on 26th April, 2018.
In its reply dated 23rd May, 2018, the Defendant No.1 denied infringement.
The Plaintiff thereafter got tests conducted at the Shriram Institute for
Industrial Research, which allegedly confirmed that the Defendant No.1&#x27;s
products were infringing the Plaintiff&#x27;s patent. Another expert opinion
confirming this finding was also obtained by the Plaintiff.

subject to the post grant opposition being withdrawn by the Defendant No.1,
the Defendant&#x27;s counter claim seeking revocation of the Plaintiff&#x27;s patent was
registered.

2018 and has submitted the bank guarantee for a sum of Rs.50 lakhs, which
continues to be renewed in favour of the ld. Registrar General of this Court.
</p><p id="p_15">11.   In the present order, the application for interim injunction is being
considered. The suit was filed in 2018 and was partly heard at the initial stage.
However, owing to the lockdown declared due to Covid-19, there was a delay
in conclusion of arguments. The patent having been filed in 2007, the term of
the patent ends on 7th January, 2027 i.e., in approximately 6 years.
Plaintiff&#x27;s Submissions
</p><p id="p_16">12.   At the outset, Mr. Hemant Singh, ld. Counsel, submits that Defendant
No.1 does not dispute the aspect of infringement but primarily relies on the
plea of invalidity of IN&#x27;429 and misrepresentation before the Commissioner
of Customs and Central Excise, Bharuch (hereinafter, &quot;Commissioner of
Customs&quot;).
</p><p id="p_17">13.   Mr. Hemant Singh, ld. counsel submits that IN&#x27;429 relates to an
agricultural composition which immediately converts sulphur into sulphate.
Various difficulties which were faced by farmers were overcome by the
patented invention. It is submitted that sulphur in its crude form cannot be
absorbed in the soil, only sulphate can. Earlier, several months were
consumed in conversion of sulphur into sulphate and hence, there was a need
for an easy, quick and efficient conversion.

opponents who had opposed the patent and it was granted after huge contest.
He submits that the earlier patent application i.e., 655/MUM/2000, was only
for a fungicidal composition and the content of sulphur was minimum 80%,
as opposed to the range of 82% to 98% covered in IN&#x27;429. Further, it is
submitted that the fungicidal composition is applied on the plant whereas the
fertilizer is applied on the soil. Thus, he submits that IN&#x27;429 would neither be
anticipated nor hit by the earlier patent application.
</p><p id="p_19">15.   Reliance is placed upon the order of the Controller of Patents dated 11 th
April, 2017. According to Mr. Singh, unless this Court finds that the findings
of the Controller are wrong, it cannot be held that there is a credible challenge
to IN&#x27;429.
</p><p id="p_20">16.   Reference is then made to the legal notices dated 26 th April, 2018 and
the reply thereto dated 23rd May, 2018. The case of Defendant No.1 in the
reply is that it is using the invention as disclosed in US5443764. Mr. Singh,
ld. counsel submits that Defendant No.1 is free to use the invention disclosed
in the earlier patent application, however, imitation of the product as disclosed
in IN&#x27;429 is a blatant infringement of the same.
</p><p id="p_21">17.   The affidavit of Dr. P.K. Patanjali, comparing the products of the
Plaintiff and Defendant No.1 is also relied upon to argue that that the product
of Defendant No. 1 infringes IN&#x27;429.
</p><p id="p_22">18.   The submission of Defendant No.1, which ld. counsel for the Plaintiff
wishes to meet is that there is a contradiction between the stand of the patentee
before the Controller of Patents and before the Commissioner of Customs. It
is submitted that the patentee has not indulged in approbate or reprobate. Ld.
Counsel submits that a perusal of the documents would show that the issue
before the Commissioner of Customs is not the same as the issue before the

Controller of Patents. The Commissioner of Customs was looking at the
question as to whether there is &#x27;manufacture&#x27; or not and not whether the
product is &#x27;novel&#x27;. The patentee does not claim any monopoly on the use of
Sulphur as a fertilizer but what is patented by it is a new agricultural
composition with a specific granule size and loading of Sulphur. The patentee,
therefore, does not claim any new use for Sulphur. The stand of the Plaintiff
before the Commissioner of Customs is that the physical and chemical
properties of Sulphur remain the same. According to ld. Counsel, this position
does not change despite the patent having been granted to the patentee.

80% Sulphur loading, as explained in patent application No. 655/MUM/2000,
however, it moved on to manufacture fertilizers as it was informed thereafter
that manufacture of fertilizers does not attract imposition of excise duty. The
Plaintiff then stopped paying excise duty because of which the excise
authorities had issued a show cause notice to the Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_25">21.   In the proceedings relating to the show cause issued by the Excise
authorities, the Plaintiff relied upon the previous order of the CESTAT to
argue that no excise duty was payable. According to the Plaintiff, the raw
material of Sulphur, which was obtained by the Plaintiff, is already charged
to excise and the question is whether the manufacturing process which
Sulphur thereafter undergoes constitutes &#x27;manufacture&#x27; under <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_3">Section 2(f)</a> of
the Central Excise Act, 1944 or not.
</p><p id="p_26">22.   The order of the Commissioner of Customs dated 29 th July, 2016 is
referred to, with a view to urge the Plaintiff&#x27;s position that the basic material
being only Sulphur and no new use being claimed, the same does not
constitute manufacture. Emphasis is laid on the finding of the Commissioner
of Customs that merely adding inert chemicals to Sulphur would not result in
a process of manufacture. It is submitted that the notification exempting
Sulphur from excise payment itself makes it clear that the loading of Sulphur,
being in the range of the notification, the exemption is liable to be given to
the Plaintiff. It is submitted that the question as to whether there is
manufacture or not would not be relevant to the question of patentability.

counsel submits that this is an error which has crept into the order, which
would be easily clarified from a reading of the CESTAT order in its entirety.
It is submitted that this error cannot be the basis to conclude that the Plaintiff&#x27;s
earlier product was a fungicide and is now being used as a fertilizer. It is the
stand of the Plaintiff that IN&#x27;429 was always being used as a fertilizer and not
as a fungicide as wrongly mentioned in paragraph 20.1.
</p><p id="p_29">24.    Insofar as the issue of invalidity is concerned, it is not disputed that
Sulphur has efficacy as a fertilizer. The question is of efficacy of Sulphur in
high dosage and the manner in which it is described in the patent specification.
The submission is that the main prior art which is relied upon is the Plaintiff&#x27;s
own patent application No. 655/MUM/2000. It is submitted that the said
patent had a different particle size and granule size for Sulphur and the same
is not covered in any manner by the patented composition.
</p><p id="p_30">25.    Reference is made to page 3 of the specification to argue that the
disadvantages that existed in the conventional art, including leaching,
clogging etc., have all been explained. The known art used Sulphur in pellets
and wettable form and hence, the need for innovation is clearly mentioned on
page 4 of the specification. The three broad objectives that the patentee
wished to achieve were not there in patent application No. 655/MUM/2000.
</p><p id="p_31">26.    Insofar as the argument of lack of novelty is concerned, the submission
is that the comparison of claim 1 of both patents would itself show that the
80% loading of Sulphur in patent application No. 655/MUM/2000 is not
identical in any manner to the 82% to 98% Sulphur loading in IN&#x27;429. It is
submitted that the allegation of lack of novelty has to be established by
showing the entire patented product in a particular prior art. Even if there is
one difference between the prior art and the patented product, it is not hit by

novelty.
</p><p id="p_32">27.   Insofar as the argument of lack of inventive step is concerned, the first
submission is that IN&#x27;429 proceeds on a footing which is exactly the opposite
of what is taught in patent application No. 655/MUM/2000. The said
application in fact teaches that the particle size of Sulphur should not be
reduced. IN&#x27;429 does the exact opposite, as the particle size is reduced to 2 to
12 microns, while at the same time increasing the loading of Sulphur. This is
where the innovation of the Plaintiff lies, inasmuch as reduction in the particle
size and the simultaneous increase in the loading of Sulphur makes IN&#x27;429 a
very effective and efficient product.
</p><p id="p_33">28.   It is submitted that the very nature of Sulphur being inflammable,
reducing the particle size by increasing the loading of Sulphur also makes it
more dangerous to use. Thus, the patented composition is going against the
basic properties of Sulphur i.e., its inflammable nature. The high loading and
low particle size of Sulphur is the innovation of the patentee which leads to
higher absorption and higher yield. Thus, according to the patentee, IN&#x27;429 is
completely non-obvious and satisfies the requirements of patentability. An
analysis of the claims is thereafter done to show that the two compositions are
completely different.
</p><p id="p_34">29.   Ld. counsel argues that there is no teaching, suggestion or motivation
in the prior art to manufacture an agricultural composition in the process as
has been explained in IN&#x27;429.
</p><p id="p_35">30.   It is submitted that the monopoly being sought is not on Sulphur per se
but on the unique agricultural composition which converts Sulphur to its
Sulphate form and makes it an effective fertilizer leading to a higher yield of
the crop. It is submitted that it is a basic rule while testing inventive step that

hindsight analysis is not permissible.
</p><p id="p_36">31.   Further, it is submitted that a reading of patent application No.
655/MUM/2000 would show that the said application related to manufacture
of a pesticide and fungicide and not a fertilizer. Though both are agricultural
compositions, the use of a fertilizer is completely different.
</p><p id="p_37">32.   The next submission is that the amendments to the claims were within
the permissible limits, as per <a href="/doc/1983731/" id="a_4">Section 59</a> of the Patent Act, 1970. It is
submitted that an applicant is permitted to narrow its claims, though
broadening is not permissible. In any event, it is submitted that under <a href="/doc/444380/" id="a_5">Section
64(1)(o)</a> of the Patent Act, 1970, amendments that can be relied on to support
a challenge to the validity of a patent are those amendments which are
obtained by fraud. Not every amendment can be challenged in a proceeding
under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_6">Section 64</a>, unless and until the same is obtained by fraud. So long as
the amended claim is supported by the complete specification, the same can
be considered and allowed and cannot be raised as a ground under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_7">Section 64</a>.
</p><p id="p_38">33.   A distinction is sought to be made between the purpose, use, function
and object of the earlier patent application No. 655/MUM/2000 and the
present application. It is highlighted that IN&#x27;429 has gone through several pre-
grant oppositions. Thus, unless and until there is something completely
erroneous in the Controller&#x27;s orders, it would be safe to prima facie hold that
the patent is valid. Reliance is placed upon the following judgments:

Defendant No.1 had filed a post-grant opposition, the fair course of action for
the Defendant was to wait till the said opposition was decided.

form of sulphur of a different range, the Defendants business is not affected.
On the other hand, if the injunction is not granted, the Plaintiff&#x27;s patent would
be rendered completely ineffective as very few years of the term of the patent

</p><p id="p_41">Defendant No.1&#x27;s Submissions
</p><p id="p_42">36.   On the other hand, Mr. Akhil Sibal, ld. Senior counsel, places enormous
reliance on order dated 29th July, 2016 passed by the Commissioner of
Customs.
</p><p id="p_43">37.   It is submitted that originally, the Commissioner of Customs had
noticed that the Plaintiff was paying duty on raw Sulphur. The Department
then sought to impose duty on the ground that the conversion of raw Sulphur
into a final product constitutes a process of &quot;manufacture&quot; under <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_11">Section 2(f)</a>
of the Central Excise Act, 1944. While attempting to avoid payment of excise
duty, the Plaintiff clearly took the stand that there is no &#x27;new use&#x27; which
emerges by using the current process. Inert chemicals are added to the
Sulphur, which does not change the property of Sulphur. Hence, it does not
constitute a new manufacturing process. By taking this stand, the Plaintiff was
able to escape payment of excise duty as fertilizers are exempt from excise
duty. The Commissioner of Customs finally arrived at the conclusion that the
product does not constitute &quot;manufacture&quot; as per <a href="/doc/94173204/" id="a_12">Section 2(f)</a> as no physical

or chemical change of Sulphur takes place.
</p><p id="p_44">38.   It is the submission of Mr. Sibal, ld. Senior Counsel, that the Plaintiff
is bound by this finding. He submits that due to the Commissioner of Customs
being a statutory authority, the stand taken by the Plaintiff before such
authority would constitute an admission of fact. The only document available
with the Defendants is the order passed by the Commissioner of Customs and
though an application has been filed seeking disclosure of further documents
relating to this proceeding, no disclosure has been made. Accordingly, it is his
submission that this stand of the Plaintiff ought to be held as binding and the
Plaintiff ought not to be allowed to rescind from the same.
</p><p id="p_45">39.   It is submitted that the difference between a fungicidal and a fertilizer
composition is an artificial distinction. A fungicide kills the bad fungi and a
fertiliser enables better growth. Thus, both compositions enable better growth.
In fact, it is submitted that the earlier patent was also promoted as a fertilizer
and the difference between the two patents is illusory. The patented product
is nothing but a tweaking of the earlier product and admittedly, its physical
and chemical properties are no different from raw sulphur.
</p><p id="p_46">40.   It is submitted that the fact that the earlier product is also used and
perceived to be a fertilizer is evident from the report of the Indian Institute of
Vegetable Research (hereinafter, &quot;IIVR Report&quot;) which has been relied upon
by the Plaintiff to show that the present product leads to an 81.8% increase in
yield as compared with the fungicide product. Further, in IN&#x27;429, the current
product, apart from being described as a fertilizer, is also described as a plant
protectant, which is nothing but a fungicide. According to ld. Senior counsel,
this itself shows that there is no difference between the previous product and
the current product of the Plaintiff. Both are plant protectants, whether they

are used as a fungicide or as a fertilizer.
</p><p id="p_47">41.   It is argued that at this stage what is relevant is vulnerability. It is
submitted that the patent was only recently granted in 2017, is anticipated by
its own earlier application, lacks inventive step and is obvious to a person
skilled in the art. Ld. Senior counsel argues that the Controller of Patents and
the IPAB, have arrived at opposing conclusions, when dealing with the matter
on merits and hence, the present matter would require a trial.
</p><p id="p_48">42.   Reliance is placed on the first order of the Patent Office dated 24 th
October, 2009 refusing the grant of the patent. The rationale of the said order
dated 24th October, 2009 is pressed into service, though the said order has
been set aside. The argument on behalf of the Defendant No.1 is that the range
in IN&#x27;429 was initially &quot;about 40% to about 98%&quot; however after the pre-
grant opposition was filed it was sought to be amended to &quot;about 82% to
about 98%&quot;. This amendment was refused by the Controller and the
Controller has discussed in detail how D-1 i.e., the Plaintiff&#x27;s own earlier
patent application, anticipated IN&#x27;429. Reliance is placed on the table in the
said order to show that each of the elements which are part of IN&#x27;429 are
clearly anticipated by the earlier patent. This, according to ld. Senior counsel,
itself shows that the reasoning in the first order ought to be accepted rather
than the reasoning in the later order granting the patent.
</p><p id="p_49">43.   The rejection of the patent by the Controller was challenged before the

IPAB affirmed the rejection of the patent vide order dated 4 th April, 2012

directed the Controller to examine the matter afresh.
</p><p id="p_50">44.   It was after the remand by the IPAB that the third set of amended claims
were filed by the Patentee wherein the Sulphur range was changed to a precise
percentage i.e., &quot;82% to 98%&quot; and the word &#x27;about&#x27; was removed. There
were a total of seven pre-grant oppositions filed, which were decided vide
orders dated 9th September, 2016 and 11th April, 2017 and the patent was
finally granted in favour of the Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_51">45.   On a query from the Court as to whether the product manufactured by
the Defendant No.1 is currently covered by the claims of IN&#x27;429, Mr. Sibal,
ld. Senior counsel fairly submits that the Defendant No.1 does not dispute
infringement in this case, however, since the test at the interim stage is
vulnerability of a patent, the validity of the patent is being seriously disputed,
as there are a large number of Sulphur based fertilizers which are used by
several companies in the market.
</p><p id="p_52">46.   The logic of the earlier order of the Controller, which notes that there
is no fundamental difference between a plant protectant composition and a
fertilizer or an agricultural composition or a fungicide, is emphasized.
Thereafter, the IPAB order dated 4th April, 2012 is relied upon to submit that
the expert testimony which was given was considered in detail by the IPAB
while upholding the refusal to grant the patent.
</p><p id="p_53">47.   As against these two orders on merits, it is argued that the Bombay
High Court&#x27;s order dated 13th April, 2016 set aside the IPAB&#x27;s order and
remanded the matter back to the IPAB on a procedural issue that some US
judgments which were cited in the IPAB&#x27;s order were not put to the patentee.
In the second order of the IPAB dated 21 st April, 2016, again, it was on a
procedural issue of non-compliance of natural justice due to non-furnishing

of certain documents and no hearing having been afforded for refusal of the
amendment, that the IPAB has remanded the matter back to the Commissioner
of Customs.
</p><p id="p_54">48.   Interestingly, it is pointed out that when the second remand order was
passed by the IPAB, the patentee again sought to amend the claims by
removing the word &#x27;about&#x27; as contained in the claims in respect of the range
of Sulphur content of 82% to 98%. According to Mr. Sibal, ld. Senior counsel,
even the removal of the word &#x27;about&#x27; would not make any difference to the
final conclusion that in the first patent application i.e., D-1, the language used
is &quot;80% minimum&quot; which in itself signifies that 82% or even 98% would be
covered.
</p><p id="p_55">49.   Ld. Senior counsel thereafter takes the Court through the second set of
orders of the Controller dated 9th September, 2016 and 11th April, 2017,
wherein the Controller arrived at a completely opposite finding in respect of
D-1. The Controller holds that narrowing of the particle size can also be an
innovation and D-1 itself does not anticipate IN&#x27;429 as the word &#x27;about&#x27; now
stands deleted.
</p><p id="p_56">50.   It is also highlighted that the claims have been repeatedly amended by
the Plaintiff. The third amendment, by which the range of sulphur active
ingredient was changed to &quot;82% to 98%&quot; is a clear give-away that the
unamended claim would have been fully anticipated by the earlier application.
The Plaintiff&#x27;s attempt to delete the word &quot;about&quot; shows that the attempt was
merely to try and somehow bring it outside the scope of the earlier patent
application. The earlier patent application having been abandoned and the
present specification being on almost identical lines, it is submitted that
IN&#x27;429 is liable to be revoked.

</p><p id="p_58">51.   It is argued that sulphur, being both a fungicide and a fertilizer, was
well within the knowledge of the Plaintiff. Only when the Government issued
a notification dated 28th December, 2006, by which 90% sulphur
compositions have been recognized as fertilizers and exempted from excise
duty, the Plaintiff completely changed its strategy and took a new stand before
the excise authorities and filed a fresh patent.
</p><p id="p_59">52.   Insofar as the particle size is concerned, the earlier patent application
i.e., D-1, is again shown to emphasise the fact that in all the examples, the
range of particle size is between 0.1-20 microns. Thus, the range is quite
varying and the innovation of 2 to 12 microns was clearly contained even in
the earlier patent application. Finally, the table of prior arts and the references
thereto are relied upon by the Defendants.
</p><p id="p_60">53.   Insofar as the judgments are concerned, the proposition canvassed
before the Court is that the test at this stage is of vulnerability and not to
emphatically establish that the patent is invalid. Moreover, no importance can
be granted to the fact that the patent has gone through an examination and the
opposition process as held in <a href="/doc/23928363/" id="a_13">Tenxc Wireless and Anr. v. Mobi Antenna
Technologies</a>, 2011 (48) PTC 426 (Del). The judgment in <a href="/doc/705613/" id="a_14">Glaverbel SA v.
Dave Rose</a>, 2010 SCC Online Del 308 is relied upon to argue that in the case
of objections of obviousness and lack of inventive step, mosaicing is
permissible, however, the fact that mosaicing is done does not mean that the
documents which show the range of the particle size cannot be considered by
the Court. Finally, it is argued that the judgment of the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/1124455/" id="a_15">Mumbai International Airport v. Golden Chariot Airport</a>, (2010) 10 SCC
422 clearly holds that a party cannot approbate or reprobate, in the context of

and has taken a particular stand that there is no difference between the old and
new composition, a contrary stand cannot be taken for the purposes of a
patent.
</p><p id="p_61">54.      Mr. Sibal, ld. Senior Counsel, thereafter relies upon the affidavit of the
expert - Dr. Pietro Zanuccoli to argue that the novelty, according to the
Plaintiff, resides in two elements i.e., high loading of Sulphur and small size
of particles (2 to 12 microns) leading to a higher yield with lesser quantity of
fertilizer i.e., 3kg/acre. It is his submission that all these elements were present
in the first patent application itself and hence, the present patent is invalid and,
in any case, vulnerable, which is all that the Defendants need to prove at this
stage.
</p><p id="p_62">55.      Ld. Senior Counsel, thereafter conducts a detailed analysis of the first
specification, to argue that the examples in the said specification clearly cover
the range of particle sizes as contained in the present specification. Reliance
is also placed on the claims of the first patent to argue that the powder form
and the wettable form which was mentioned to be minimum 80% clearly
shows that the present specification lacks novelty and there are no specific
inventive steps that it is capable of establishing.
</p><p id="p_63">56.      The Court is thereafter taken to IN&#x27;429 to argue that despite the
amendments to the claims, both in the summary of the invention and the
detailed description, the Sulphur range was 40% to 98%. Further, examples 4
and 5, which are retained in IN&#x27;429, show the sulphur active ingredient at
65% and 70%. According to Mr. Sibal, ld. Senior Counsel, therefore, the
specification does not support the final amended claim. Even the inventive
component of the yield which, as per the expert, is 3kg/acre is defeated as for
different types of crops, the quantity used and the yield varies from 3kg/acre

the expert&#x27;s affidavit is not supported by the patent specification.
</p><p id="p_64">57.   The guidelines of the Patent Office, as also the manual of the Patent
Office, are relied upon to argue that whenever there is an improvement of a
product or process, the prior art and the invention in the new patent, is
distinguished very clearly and separated by use of the word &#x27;characterized by&#x27;
or &#x27;wherein&#x27;. After relying on these two documents, claim no. 1 is shown, in
order to emphasize the fact that the claim is in two parts. The first part is the
prior art and the second part, divided by the word &#x27;wherein&#x27;, shows that the
invention relies only on the size of the water dispersible granules and the
particles as per claim no.1. In conclusion, it is submitted that for the above
reasons, the interim injunction ought not to be issued.
Analysis &amp; Findings
</p><p id="p_65">58.   At the outset, it needs to be recorded that Defendant No.1does not
challenge infringement at this stage. The primary challenge of Defendant
No.1 is to the validity of the Plaintiff&#x27;s patent. If the patent is found to be
valid, then Defendant No.1&#x27;s products would be held to be infringing the
Plaintiff&#x27;s product. Thus, at this stage, the only issue to be decided is whether
Defendant No.1 raises any credible challenge to IN&#x27;429 or not.

cited by the Defendant No.1 in support of its plea of invalidity, at this stage,
pending trial, this Court is of the opinion that only the closest prior art i.e., D-
1, needs to be considered.
</p><p id="p_72">63.    D-1 is a patent application filed by the Plaintiff bearing
no.655/MUM/2000 titled &#x27;An improved fungicide/Bactericide, namely
copper oxychloride formulation in the dry flowable form (WG) and a
method of manufacturing/making &amp; using the same.&#x27; A perusal of the said
patent application shows that the main focus of the application is on a
fungicidal composition which is more environmentally friendly, less toxic,
creates lesser dust and is not hazardous. The specification itself clearly states
that sulphur fungicides are well-known. The process for manufacture of
sulphur is also well-known. The conventional sulphur product has a narrow
particle size. Sulphur is a contact fungicide i.e., the greater the surface area of
the product which is used on the plant, the higher the efficacy. D-1 therefore
discloses an improved process for manufacture of sulphur with a wider range
of particle size, bigger granule size and better bio-efficacy. D-1 then sets out
the method for manufacturing the said product and also gives examples to
show the bio-efficacy of the product.

ingredient is 80% by weight. It consists of a wetting agent, dispersing agent,
filler and a binding agents. It is a fungicidal/miticidal formulation, meaning
thereby it helps in cleaning fungi and also controls mites and tics. The
background to D-1 and the claims in D-1 are as under:

             case of Sulphur WP and has bulk density from 0.87
             to 0.90 in case of Sulphur WG (typically towards
             higher side after compaction). The known art
             product (Sulphur WP) is not free flowing and has
             flow number in the range of 8 to 10. Whereas the
             improved version Sulphur WG is free flowing and
             has a flow number in the range of 0 to 2. Sulphur
             WP when put in water does not disperse well.
             Sulphur WP has tendency to cake over a period of
             time. When the product is used on pouring it creates

             where the efficacy of the product is improved when
             the surface area of the product is improved. Due to
             the narrow particle size range of the particles of

             Over the year as man learnt of the hazards of using
             pesticides and the risks associated with this to
             mankind there is a growing need to make the same

             physical properties and more efficient bioefficacy
             properties which is understood to be due an efficient
             particle size as a result of increasing the range of
             the particles and having more particles in the range
             of 0.5 to 4 microns which in turn increases the
             surface area of the sulphur particles. Due to the
             product being a contact fungicide this increase in
             contact area increases the bioeffectivness of the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">             1.     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention relates to an agricultural
             composition comprising an effective amount of
             sulphur active ingredient and at least one
             dispersing agent.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">             2.     DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART
             All the crops need balanced fertilization and
             presently high emphasis is laid on N-P-K as major
             nutrients for fertilizer applications. However, in the
             past couple of years sulphur has gained importance
             as a fourth major nutrient and its requirement in
             various crops and soils is increasing world wide
             due to the decrease in sulphur emissions and hence
             lower depositions into the soil.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">             Sulphur is known as an elemental fertilizer for
             feeding plants and is an essential component of
             certain vitamins and enzymes of plants. Sulphur,
             together with phosphorus and nitrogen takes part in
             the synthesis of certain plant, proteins. Sulphur is
             insoluble in water, is easily inflammable and also
             displays irritable action on the human body. These
             properties of sulphur influence both its production
             as well as its use in the agricultural field.
             Sulphur is also used as a rectifier of certain
             structural characteristics of the soil, including in
             particular its pH, which it shifts towards acidic
             values for alkaline soils. Sulphur is naturally
             present in the soil as a component of certain salts.

             When sulphur is oxidized to its sulphate form it
             serves as an essential nutrient for plant growth as
             sulphate is the only form in which plants can take
             up sulphur.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">             Presently, sulphur is typically blended with other
             granular fertilizers such as phosphates, nitrates,
             urea and potash among others to provide it in a
             form suitable for application to the soil. Sulphur is
             available commercially as prills, soluble sulphur
             liquids, wettable powders and micronized powders.
             These compositions are then applied to the soil by
             various means such as broadcasting or banding to
             supply the soil with sulfur, as well as additional
             nutrients found in granular fertilizers.
             One problem associated with the use of these
             conventional compositions is that they need to be
             applied in very high dosages. The applicable
             dosage of these conventional compositions per acre
             is very high and can extend from about 10 kg / acre
             for Sulphur bentonite compositions to about 25 kg
             per acre for Sulphate based fertilizers and goes all

             Also since these conventional compositions are
             used in high dosages there is an increased
             possibility of leaching in the soil making it
             unavailable to the plant for uptake. Large amount

             considerably. However, the conventional fertilizers
             comprising sulphur or sulpbur plus bentonite
             mixture cannot be applied through drip irrigation
             as the particle size of these compositions are large
             and particles do not disperse in water, causing
             nozzle clogging in the irrigation equipment and
             resulting in a non-homogenous tank mixture at the

industry also finds it surprising that IN&#x27;429 has obtained over 80%
dispersibility with an extremely high loading of sulphur i.e., 80 to 91%, which
is totally unexpected and completely unpredictable from the prior art. Both

stated that almost the same combination of factors, including particle size
range, granule size range, dispersibility, suspensibility etc. has been disclosed
in D-1 i.e., 655/MUM/2000. Dr. Arora has also referred to the IIVR Report

             I have considered that the specific ranges of values
             if carved out from a disclosure teaching a fungicidal
             composition and those selected values produced not
             a fungicidal composition but an unexpected plant
             growth nutrient composition it would be an
             invention having regard to non-obviousness
             synergistic selection of actives selected in narrowed
             range resulted in unexpected yield/production. In
             this aspect relied upon decision of T 0198/84, by the
             European Board of Appeals which rules as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_62">                     &quot;A fairly broad range of number
                     delimited by minimum and maximum

                     not necessarily represent a disclosure,
                     ruling out the selection of a subrange, of
                     all the numerical values between these
                     minimum and maximum values if the
                     sub-range selected is narrow.&quot; &quot;The sub
                     range is novel not by virtue of an effect
                     which occurs only within in; this effect
                     permits the inference that what is
                     involved is not an arbitrarily chosen
                     specimen from the prior art but another

feature of D-1 is a sulphur loading of 80% and increased particle size in order
to have greater surface area of the sulphur particles. This is reiterated in the
background in several places. The claims in D-1 go on to describe the process
of obtaining the formulation which consist of 80% sulphur by weight as the
active ingredient. The claims in D-1 are slightly unusually worded inasmuch
as the main claim does not merely describe the formulation but also its uses
and effects.
</p><p id="p_88">77.    On the other hand, IN&#x27;429 relates to a product commercially used as a
Fertilizer. The core of the invention as per claim no.1 is the sulphur active
ingredient in the range of 82% to 98% and a dispersing agent in the range of
2% to 18%. In D-1, the dispersing agent is in the range of 0.5% to 5%. Thus,
on both counts i.e., the loading of sulphur and the dispersing agent, IN&#x27;429
seeks to achieve a higher sulphur loading with the range of dispersing agent
of a higher range. The particles are also intended to be smaller in the case of
IN&#x27;429.

           former performs a negative function, the latter performs a positive
           function. It is possible that even fungicides and miticides may, in
           the process of preventing attacks on the crop, also lead to better

             three examples which have sulphur as the active ingredient to the

             particle size in the range of 0.1 to 20 microns and the detailed

             particle size range is more efficacious. This is clear from a reading
             of paragraph 2 at page 3 of D-1 and paragraph 6 at page 5 of D-1.
             In IN&#x27;429, however, the granule size and the particle size is much
             smaller. D-1 discloses a granular size of above 200 microns.
             However, in IN&#x27;429, the range is 100 to 250 microns. Insofar as
             particle size is concerned, in D-1 the range is 0.1-20 microns,

Court, this is an incorrect approach inasmuch as the main sulphur range is
itself different. Moreover, D-1 is actually teaching away from what is

IN&#x27;429 shows a shift in the opposite direction i.e., use of smaller particle size
to enable better absorption. The mere presence of standardised agents such as
wetting agent, dispersing agent, filler and binding agent would not make the
two compositions identical in as much as the nature of the composition and
the loading of sulphur, the utilisation of the same etc., are different.
</p><p id="p_91">80.   D-1 does not defeat the novelty of IN&#x27;429 due to the range of active
ingredient itself being different. Thus, the main claim 1 is not anticipated by
D1. On an analysis of the two patent specifications, this Court is of the opinion
that the process disclosed in D-1 relates to sulphur of a lower concentration
but with a bigger granule and particle size. In IN&#x27;429, however, the patented
product    is   a    composition   which     has   a   much      higher         sulphur
loading/concentration and, surprisingly, a lower granule and particle size than
what is taught and suggested in D-1. Thus, when a person skilled in the art
analyses D-1, there is no motivation for the said person to explore the opposite
of what it teaches i.e., to use a higher loading of sulphur with lower granule
and particle size.
</p><p id="p_92">81.   The Defendants ought to have satisfied the Court as to how D-1 would
make IN&#x27;429 obvious to a person skilled in the art. The Defendants have not
been able to demonstrate by comparing the method/process in D-1 with
IN&#x27;429 as to how there was any motivation, suggestion or teaching in D-1 to
arrive at IN&#x27;429. There was no argument forthcoming as to how a person
skilled in the art would be inspired to try and arrive at the invention disclosed
in IN&#x27;429. The submission as to the lack of inventive step has to be supported
by some material to show that the journey from D-1 to IN&#x27;429 was an obvious
one. However, this has not been demonstrated or established by the
Defendants from the record. The mere fact that IN&#x27;429 uses the term &#x27;plant

protectant&#x27; would not lead to the conclusion that the composition can also be
used as a fungicide, when admittedly it is being used as a fertiliser. Due to the
above comparative features of D-1 and IN&#x27;429, this Court is of the opinion
that IN&#x27;429 patent discloses a novel and inventive composition.
</p><p id="p_93">82.   Recently, the ld. Division Bench of this Court in Astrazeneca AB &amp;
Anr. v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. [FAO (OS) (Comm) 139/2020, decided
on 20th July, 2021], while dealing with two patents of the same proprietor has
observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_70">             &quot;30. The tests of &quot;obvious to a person skilled in the
             art&quot; and &quot;anticipation by publication&quot; and &quot;use
             before the date of filing of patent application with
             complete specification&quot;, in the context of an earlier
             patent and its specifications, in our view, have to be
             different, when the inventor of both is the same. The
             counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs has argued,
             that owing to delays in obtaining approvals of Drug
             Regulators in different jurisdictions, for marketing
             of a new drug/medicine, after obtaining patent with
             respect thereto, results in the inventor/patentee
             being not able to enjoy the exclusivity granted under
             the Patent Laws to the inventor/patentee, for the full
             term of the patent. However merely because there
             are such delays, would not be a reason for the Court
             to give to the patent a longer life than provided in
             the statute. The cure therefor is with the Legislature
             and not with the Courts, by allowing more than one
             patent with respect to the same invention. The said
             argument of the counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs
             has however made us suspicious, that the
             appellants/plaintiffs, though invented DAPA at the
             time of seeking IN 147 and/or US equivalent
             thereof, though „covered‟ it therein (to prevent

<p id="p_95">84.   The Defendants have also argued that the Controller ought not to have
permitted the amendments to the claims of IN&#x27;429. It is seen that the Plaintiff
has amended IN&#x27;429 on four occasions during the examination and
oppositions process. The consistent view of the Controller, except in order
dated 24th October, 2009 which is no longer in operation, has been that the
said amendments were well within the scope of the originally filed claims and
the Plaintiff only sought to restrict the claims and not broaden them. The view
having been that the amendments are in accordance with <a href="/doc/1983731/" id="a_17">Section 59</a> of the
Patents Act, 1970, the mere fact that the Plaintiff has amended the claims
would not weigh against the Plaintiff. It is usual for patent applicants to edit,
amend, modify and vary the claims during the examination and opposition
process. So long as the amendments sought are within the scope of the claims
originally filed, no adverse conclusion can be drawn on the basis of the said
amendments.

concerned, this Court is of the opinion that the patent specification of IN&#x27;429
has given comparative efficacy figures of the patented composition, in
considerable detail. A perusal of the specification shows that when the
patented composition was used on different crops, in differing quantities and
in a specific manner, it showed greater yield. The said figures are tabulated
below:

stated to have been a commercial success. At the interim stage, when this

hold that enhanced efficacy is established by giving data in the specification

can help plants in several ways. The use of sulphur as a preventive
mechanism, protective mechanism or as a growth mechanism, would depend
on the manner in which the composition is prepared. Sulphur could be
converted into a pesticide, fungicide, miticide or a fertilizer, but that does not
mean that it ceases to be sulphur. The inherent properties of sulphur would
remain the same. However, the quantity of sulphur that is dispersed, the
quantity that is absorbed, the effect it has on the plants, the effect it has on the
humans who are administering the composition on the plants, the wastage
involved, the bio-efficacy, the effect on the yield of different crops, etc. could
vary from composition to composition. The mere fact that the core ingredient
is sulphur, whose physical and chemical properties are known and do not
change, does not mean that no patent can ever be granted on sulphur related
compositions. It would also be incorrect to hold that if patents are granted for
the manufacture of specific compositions, each and every such process would

             foreign matter from goods complete in themselves
             and/or processes which clean goods that are
             complete in themselves fall within this category.
             (2) Where the goods remain essentially the same
             after the particular process, again there can be no
             manufacture. This is for the reason that the original
             article continues as such despite the said process
             and the changes brought about by the said process.

leading to a higher loading of sulphur does not cease to be sulphur. The stand
of the Plaintiff before the Commissioner of Customs cannot, therefore, be held
to be in negation of the patent. The existence of the patent also cannot, by
itself, lead to the conclusion that there is &#x27;manufacture&#x27; under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_38">Central
Excise Act</a>, 1944. The tests, the standards and the purpose of both these laws
being completely different, one cannot be conflated with the other. The over-
emphasis of the Defendant No.1 on the order passed by the excise authorities
is clearly a red-herring, in as much as the argument of the Plaintiff that in the
product before the excise authorities there is no change, i.e., the previous and
the current product is the same i.e., Sulphur - cannot mean that there is no new
process or composition. The previously manufactured product was a Sulphur
based fungicide and the present product is a Sulphur based fertilizer with
greater efficacy on various counts.

<p id="p_111">98.   On receiving the replies, the Plaintiff filed the present suit claiming that
IN&#x27;429 is a revolutionary product which has provided better yield to farmers.
The Plaintiff has made an enormous investment in the marketing and
promotion of the product since 2007 and the Defendants, despite having
knowledge of the Plaintiff&#x27;s patent, continue to infringe the Plaintiff&#x27;s patent.
The Plaintiff also got the products tested by an expert in an agro-chemical

the Plaintiff&#x27;s product. The prayer is for an injunction, restraining the
Defendants from infringing IN&#x27;429.

the Defendant&#x27;s dealer mentions &#x27;SUFFAR 90&#x27; and &#x27;COZY WET&#x27; in the
stock register, however, the products could not be found. The Local
Commissioner who visited Defendant No.1&#x27;s premises found that &#x27;COZY
WET 90&#x27; was being manufactured by Sterling Agrichem Pvt. Ltd.
</p><p id="p_113">100. In the written statement/counter claim, the Defendant No.1 takes the
position that the sulphur-based composition used in &#x27;SUFFAR 90&#x27; is different
from the Plaintiff&#x27;s patent. However, during oral arguments, ld. Counsel for
the Defendant No.1 made it clear that they do not dispute infringement at this
stage. Thus, if IN&#x27;429 is held to be a valid patent, the injunction would follow.
</p><p id="p_114">101. From the above narration it is clear that the Defendants stand has been
changing from time to time. Initially, in reply to the legal notices, the
Defendant No.1 claimed that it is using the same process as a US patent. In
the written statement/counter claim, it is claimed that the process used in
&#x27;SUFFAR 90&#x27; is different from IN&#x27;429 and no reference to any US patent is
given. However, during oral arguments, the stand is that for the purposes of
interim injunction, infringement is not challenged and only the issue of
invalidity is raised. Thus, the Defendants have adopted a changing stance
insofar as the nature of their product and the process involved is concerned.
The only challenge being to the validity of the patent, the question that arises
is that once the patent is held to be valid, can the Court refuse an injunction?
</p><p id="p_115">102. The product in question is a patent for an agricultural composition.
Defendant No.1 had already filed a post-grant opposition. Prior to its grant,
the patent was opposed by seven different parties. Two detailed orders have
been passed by the Controller on 9th September, 2016 and 11th April, 2017,
discussing the entire prior art which is identical to the prior art cited in the
present suit. It is also noted that the same counsels who are currently

the Controller.
</p><p id="p_116">103. In the first round, when the patent was rejected by the Controller and
by the IPAB, the order of the IPAB was set aside by the Bombay High Court
and the matter was remanded back to the IPAB. The IPAB, not following its
own earlier order dated 4th April, 2012, set aside the rejection of the patent
and remanded the matter back to the Controller. Thereafter, the patent has
been granted by the Controller after hearing seven oppositions.
</p><p id="p_117">104. The patent is valid only for six more years i.e., out of a period of 20
years, 14 long years have already gone by. From the filing of the application
in 2007 till the grant in 2017, ten years had passed. Owing to the pandemic,
the hearings in this interim injunction application were considerably delayed.
During this period, Defendant No.1 has continued to manufacture and sell its
product and the Plaintiff has not been able to enjoy its exclusive monopoly
granted under the patent. The conduct of the Defendants has also not been
bona fide.
</p><p id="p_118">105. The grant of the patent does not put an embargo on the manufacture or
sale of sulphur-based agricultural compositions. It merely prevents third
parties from manufacturing or selling products that are infringing IN&#x27;429.
Third parties are free to follow the process as contained in Ex. D-1 i.e.,
655/MUM/2000 or even US5443764, as relied upon by the Defendant No.1
in reply to the legal notices.
</p><p id="p_119">106. All these factors need to be borne in mind while deciding the nature of
relief that is to be granted. The Defendants stand is that only a credible
challenge needs to be shown and invalidity need not be proved by the
Defendants. This is the settled law as per the judgments of this Court in

Anr. v. Mobi Antenna Technologies</a>, 2011 (48) PTC 426 (Del). In the present
case, however, IN&#x27;429 has gone through multiple levels of scrutiny and
examination and the orders rejecting the patent have already been set aside.
The pre-grant opposition proceedings were quite robust, as can be seen from
the various contentions raised before the Controller. Seven opponents have
opposed the grant of the patent and the Controller has considered almost all
the prior documents which have currently been cited. Thus, this Court is of
the opinion that merely on the strength of the Plaintiff&#x27;s stand before the
Commissioner of Customs, it cannot be argued that there is a credible
challenge or that IN&#x27;429 is vulnerable.
</p><p id="p_120">107. The Plaintiff, having been granted the patent after long drawn
opposition proceedings by multiple parties and the products of the Plaintiff
having also been a commercial success, infringement having also not been
challenged by the Defendants, the Plaintiff has clearly made out a prima facie
case for grant of an injunction. The balance of convenience is also in favour
of the Plaintiff. As held in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_41">Merk Sharp &amp; Dohme Corporation &amp; Anr. v.
