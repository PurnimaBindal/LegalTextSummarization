</pre>



<p id="p_1">     The prayer in the writ petition is to direct the first respondent,

the appropriate authority to receive the petitioner's renewal application

dated 15.12.2015 for renewing the Trade Mark “TAJMAHAL” Indian

Pappad registered under No.1077334 in Class 30 and renew the same

in accordance with due process of law.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.   The   petitioner   firm   is   engaged   in   the   business   of

manufacturing, marketing and exporting pappads and had adopted the

trade mark 'TAJMAHAL' for their products.       The said trade mark has

been used by them continuously and extensively from 01.04.1970 and

had attained a high reputation and turnover. The petitioner's trade

mark TAJMAHAL was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal dated

16.08.1982.     However, it was not renewed and the same lapsed.

Later, after the petitioner took over the firm from his mother in 1985

and became the sole proprietor of the firm, he changed the design of

the label and applied for registration of the changed trade mark

TAJMAHAL Indian Pappad on 01.02.2002 by Application No.1077334 in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>

class 30 for the revised label TAJMAHAL claiming to be using the same

from 01.04.1985. The same was accepted and published in the Trade

Mark Journal on 15.03.2006 and the registration certificate was issued

on 19.02.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">     3. The petitioner found out the infringement of goods of Pappad

sold in Kwait identical to his Trade Mark “TAJMAHAL” during October

2014, and therefore, sent a notice on 10.10.2014 to the infringer

through his attorney.   Only while receiving the reply notice from the

infringer, the petitioner learnt that the Register No.1077334 was not

renewed within time. The said Trade Mark Registration Certificate

dated 01.02.2002 was issued only on 19.02.2007 and he was told that

the Trade Mark has to be renewed after 10 years. However, the

website of the Trade Mark Registry www.ipindia.nic.in reflected the

status of the Trade Mark TAJMAHAL Indian Pappad as “registered”, and

only on verification, it was learnt that the Trade Mark        was not

renewed and the petitioner was asked to submit a copy of the renewal

intimation/registration certificate/extract of the journal, wherein, the

application was advertised with registration charges, etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    4</span>



</p><p id="p_6">      4. Thereafter, a fresh application for renewal of the trade mark

was made on 15.12.2015, but the Registrar of the first respondent

refused to receive the application, as the last date for filing the

renewal application expired on 31.01.2013, that is, the registration of

the mark should be treated from the date of application on

01.02.2002, the registration is for ten years and may then be renewed

for a period of another ten years within one year of the expiry of the

certificate term. Hence, this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">      5. It is submitted by the learned counsel that though the website

showed the status for the petitioner's trade mark as “registered”, the

respondent, for all practical purposes, had treated the mark as

“removed” thereby refusing to accept the renewal application of the

petitioner. Therefore, it was contended that the Trade Mark Registry

ought not to have refused to receive the application for renewal of the

mark, when the status is reflected only as “registered”.



</p><p id="p_9">      6. It is also alleged that the notice of the renewal by the Trade

Mark Registry under Section 25(3) of the Trade Mark Act, 1999 (in

short “the Act”) was not received by the petitioner in Form O-3, that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span>

is, the first respondent has not issued the notice, which they ought to

have issued. Hence, due to the inaction on the part of the authorities

in not issuing the statutory and mandatory notice, the petitioner is put

to loss and unable to renew the trade mark and the alleged expiry of

the trade mark is adversely affecting the petitioner. Learned counsel

for the petitioner placed his reliance on <a href="/doc/76971177/" id="a_2">Union of India V. Malhotra

Book Depot</a>, 2012 (49) PTC 354 (Del.).
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">      7. Heard the learned counsel on either side and perused the

materials available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">      8. A reading of <a href="/doc/1914967/" id="a_3">Section 25(3)</a> of the Act, which provides for

sending of notice, prescribes the removal of trade mark only at the

expiration of the time prescribed in the notice. The conditions required

therein to be filled have not been complied with, the removal can be

done. In the counter-affidavit in paragraph 11, the receipt of the

renewal request made by the petitioner as per Trade Mark Rules,

2002, is denied and it is further stated that as per their electronic data

base record the Form O-3 notice as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1914967/" id="a_4">Section 25(3)</a>

of the Act has been generated and sent and a copy of the data base

record of the renewal entry module was also produced to evidence the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>

compliance of the statutory provision. The said notice was stoutly

denied by the learned counsel for the petitioner as it is only a

computer generated automatic data base and there is absolutely no

proof of having dispatched the same to reach it to the petitioner.



</p><p id="p_14">     9. It is to be stated that as per <a href="/doc/414728/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> of the Act, the notice

must have been sent at a date not less than one month and not more

than three months before the expiration of the last registration of the

trade mark as prescribed under Rule 64 of the Rules. From the above,

it is clear that the removal of the mark from the register can be made

only subject to the sending of the notice in the prescribed manner

calling upon the registered owner of the mark to apply for renewal of

the same and only upon the failure of the owner of the mark to comply

with the requirements mentioned therein and not merely on the failure

of the registered owner/proprietor to apply for renewal within the time.

If the statute prescribes a procedure, the same has to be followed

scrupulously. In this regard, paragraph 14 of the judgment of the Delhi

High Court in Malhotra Book Depot (cited supra) is relevant,

where, the emphasis is laid on the following procedure step by step in

the following manner :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            “14. The Supreme Court, though in the context of a Rent
      Legislation, in E. Palanisamy Vs. Palanisamy (2003) 1 SCC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         7</span>

     123 reiterated in <a href="/doc/943497/" id="a_6">Sarla Goel V. Kishan Chand</a> (2009) 7 SCC
     658, emphasized the importance of following the statutory
     procedure step by step and held an earlier step to be a
     precondition for the next step and it being impermissible to
     straightaway jump to the last step. It was further held that the
     last step can come only after the earlier step has been taken. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">The
     Trade Marks Act</a> is an Act for the benefit of the proprietors of
     trademarks (refer <a href="/doc/1236969/" id="a_8">Thukral Mechanical Works v. P.M.Diesels
     Pvt. Ltd</a>. (2009) 2 SCC 768). <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_9">When the Act</a> itself has prescribed
     the procedure for removal, we do not find any justification for
     holding the said procedure to be not mandatory or not binding on
     the Registrar or to uphold the removal even if such procedure is
     not   followed.   We   are   here   concerned   with   the   legislative
     interpretation and cannot be guided by the consequences as
     argued by the counsel for the appellants, which may follow as a
     result of the said interpretation. Where the statute is clear, the
     Court has to give effect to the right created and should not restrict
     that right merely in order to minimize litigation. It has been held in
     <a href="/doc/40806/" id="a_10">Coal India Ltd. v. Saroj Kumar Mishra</a> (2007) 9 SCC 625 that
     legislative interpretation cannot be rejected merely for the reason
     of opening the floodgates of applications or litigations”



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     10. In the instant case, in the absence of any material to show

that the notice of Form O-3 was issued to the petitioner, the authority

could not have removed the name of the petitioner for want of renewal

within the prescribed time. After removal comes the question of what

would be the effect of the removal from the register without the

procedure being followed.</blockquote><p id="p_15">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    8</span>

</p><p id="p_16">      11. <a href="/doc/1101498/" id="a_11">Section 25(4)</a> of the Act makes the period of one year for

restoration of the mark to the register and renewal thereafter from the

expiration of the last registration and not the removal of the name.

Admittedly, in this case, the expiration of the last registration was on

01.10.2012 and adding the period of one year to it, it would be

01.02.2013, which would be the last date for application under <a href="/doc/1101498/" id="a_12">Section

25(4)</a> of the Act, whereas, admittedly the application for renewal was

made only on 15.12.2015.      Hence, it was contended by the learned

counsel for the respondents that the application is out of time.



</p><p id="p_17">      12. Interestingly, in this case, it is claimed by the petitioner's

that their trade mark had not been removed after the expiry of the

time. Rule 65 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 (in short, “the Rules”)

mandates that if, at the expiration of last registration of a trade mark,

the renewal fees had not paid, the Registrar may remove the trade

mark from the register and advertise the fact forthwith in the Journal.

The respondents have not stated neither in the counter nor before this

Court that they have removed the trade mark of the petitioner from

the register and published the same in the Journal.         In fact, The

respondents, who have a statutory and mandatory requirement to

issue notice under Form O-3 and after removal publish the same in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                        9</span>

Journal, also had not performed their statutory duty. Therefore, the

restoration is possible only after the removal of the trade mark. The

restoration and renewal of registration is provided in Rule 66 of the

Rules.    When   the   removal   of     the   mark   has   not   categorically

demonstrated by the respondents in this case, it would only be

deemed that the renewal of registration alone is pending.             For the

renewal of registration, admittedly, Form O-3 was not issued to the

petitioner. Therefore, the act of the Registrar in not receiving the

application for renewal is incorrect.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">        13. Against the refusal of the receipt of the registration form,

normally, it is open to the petitioner only to go before the Intellectual

Property Appellate Board, which will be the appellate authority.

However, since in this case, the mandatory provision of issuing the

notice in Form O-3 has not been followed, it breaches the statutory

duty.    It is to be stated that mere expiration of the registration by

lapse of time and also the failure of not renewing the same by the

proprietor of the trade mark do not take away the right of the

ownership over the trade mark resulting in removal of the same from

the register, in the absence of compliance of the mandatory procedure

prescribed under <a href="/doc/414728/" id="a_13">Section 25</a> of the Act read with Rules 64 and 66 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  10</span>

the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">     14. In the above peculiar circumstances, though it is argued that

there is no period of limitation prescribed either in the Act or in the

Rules for restoration of the trade mark, in this case, only the renewal

is sought for by the petitioner of his registered trade mark.    As the

renewal is not possible without the statutory notice being issued by the

respondents, this Court is of the opinion that the following directions

could be issued to the respondents :
</p>
<p id="p_22">  (i).The second respondent is directed to issue the notice in

     compliance of <a href="/doc/1914967/" id="a_14">Section 25(3)</a> of the Act in Form O-3 ;
</p>
<p id="p_23">  (ii).On receipt of such notice, the petitioner is directed to comply

     with the conditions stipulated therein and make prescribed fee

     for renewal of the trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_24">  (iii).Once there is proper compliance of Form O-3 notice, the

     Registrar is directed to receive the application and consider the

     same on the merits of the case and pass appropriate orders as

     the Registrar may deem fit and proceed with the matter in

     accordance with law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   11</span><p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">      15. With the above directions, the writ petition is disposed of.

There will be no order as to costs. Consequently, W.M.P.No.5088 of

2016 is closed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
