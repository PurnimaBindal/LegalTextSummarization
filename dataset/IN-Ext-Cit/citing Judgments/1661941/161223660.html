Amrita Sinha, J.:-


</pre><p id="p_1">      The petitioner is aggrieved by the order of removal from service

passed against him by the disciplinary authority on 14th December,

2017 and the order dated 10th May, 2018, affirming the same, by the

appellate authority.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      The petitioner was an employee of the Allahabad Bank. While he

was in service a charge sheet was issued against him on 15th

September, 2016. There were five Articles of Charge. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1">Article-I:</a> He

proceeded on leave on several occasions without submission of proper

leave application and without obtaining permission of the Competent

Authority. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2">Article-II:</a> He remained on unauthorized absence from duty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>




upto 15th February, 2016. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_3">Article-III:</a> He remained continuously absent

from duty, in unauthorized manner, since 23rd February, 2016 till date.

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_4">Article-IV:</a> The letter sent to his residential address on 17th March, 2016

was returned with the remark &quot;unclaimed&quot; and the letter sent by e-mail

was also not responded by him, though his correspondences with office

were made from the same residential address and same e-mail. <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_5">Article-

V:</a> He did not join in his transferred place of posting in violation of the

order of his superior authority and also in violation of the order passed

by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      The disciplinary authority was of the opinion that the aforesaid

acts of omission and commission committed by the petitioner were in

violation of Regulations 3(i) and 3(iii) of the Allahabad Bank Officer

Employees&#x27; (Conduct) Regulations, 1976 (herein after referred to as

&quot;Conduct Regulations&quot;), amounting to misconduct under Regulation 24

of the said Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      The statement of imputation of charges mentioned in details the

days on which the petitioner remained absent unauthorizedly. The list of

documents and the list of witnesses were also forwarded to the

petitioner along with the charge sheet.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      The petitioner did not participate in the disciplinary proceeding

and all the letters sent to him by the enquiry officer and the presenting

officer returned undelivered. The enquiry conducted ex parte was

completed on 24th March, 2017 and the enquiry officer submitted his

report on 31st August, 2017. The disciplinary authority on perusal of the

enquiry report and upon analysis of the witnesses put forth in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>




enquiry, concluded, that all the charges levelled against the petitioner

was proved. The disciplinary authority by order dated 14th December,

2017 imposed the penalty of removal from service which shall not be a

disqualification   for   future   employment   under   Regulation   4(i)    of

Allahabad Bank Officer Employees&#x27; (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations,

1976 herein after referred to as the &quot;D &amp; A Regulations&quot;.


</p><p id="p_10">      Aggrieved by the order passed by the disciplinary authority the

petitioner preferred an appeal before the appellate authority on 19th

January, 2018. By an order dated 10th May, 2018 the appellate

authority dismissed the appeal preferred by the petitioner and upheld

the order of the disciplinary authority.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      Being aggrieved the petitioner has filed the instant writ petition.


      The primary contention of the petitioner is that the charge sheet,

enquiry report, findings of the disciplinary authority and the appellate

authority does not disclose any misconduct within the meaning of

Regulations 3(i) and 3(iii) of the Conduct Regulations.


</p><p id="p_13">      He contends that there is no allegation in the charge sheet that

his absence was either wilful or deliberate. Mere unauthorized absence

does not amount to misconduct under the aforesaid Regulations and

hence the charge sheet is vague. In support of the aforesaid contention

the petitioner relies upon the judgment delivered by the Hon&#x27;ble

Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/32156579/" id="a_6">Krushnakant B. Parmar -vs- Union of

India &amp; Anr</a>. reported in (2012) 3 SCC 178 paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 14, 15,

16, 17, 18 and 19 wherein it was held that unless the absence was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span>




wilful or deliberate the question of the action being unbecoming of the

officer or failure to perform duty does not arise at all.


</p><p id="p_14">       The petitioner has relied upon medical documents in support of

his absence. He was suffering from medical problems and accordingly he

was not in a position to join his duties. The absence in such a situation

cannot be treated as wilful or deliberate.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">       The petitioner has mentioned in details the reasons for his

absence in the appeal preferred by him before the appellate authority.

He argues that none of the averments made by the petitioner has been

disputed by the appellate authority, and as such, his absence not being

wilful or deliberate ought to be condoned and the charge of misconduct

is liable to fail.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">       The petitioner alleges mala fide at the time of passing of the order

of transfer on 1st July, 2016 whereby the petitioner was transferred to

Siliguri.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">       The petitioner submits that he could not take part in the

disciplinary proceeding as the notices were not received by him. He

submits that his employer was well aware of his e-mail number and the

documents ought to have been sent to him through e-mail. Non-service

of the documents relating to his disciplinary proceeding, including the

enquiry report, has caused prejudice to him.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">       The petitioner contends that the respondents proceeded in a pre-

determined manner. On the very day of issuing the charge sheet the

employer had declared him to be on unauthorized leave.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>




</p><p id="p_23">       According to the petitioner none of the documents relied upon by

the employer were proved by the witnesses. Regulation 6(XIII) of the D &amp;

A Regulations mandates oral and documentary evidence to be proved by

witnesses. That not being done, the entire disciplinary proceeding is

liable to fail.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">       In support of the aforesaid contention the petitioner relies upon

the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1666610/" id="a_7">Ramji

Dayawala &amp; Sons (P) Ltd. -vs- Invest Import</a> reported in (1981) 1 SCC

80 paragraph 16.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">       The petitioner submits that neither the report of the enquiry

officer nor the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority contain

any independent findings of facts. He submits that he raised as many as

ten issues in his appeal before the appellate authority. The appellate

authority chose to deal with only issue nos. 1, 3, 8, 9 and 10 and that

too, while dealing with those issues the relevant evidences were not

considered.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">       In this connection the petitioner relies upon the decision delivered

by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of Allahabad Bank &amp; Ors.

</p><p id="p_30">-vs- Krishna Narayan Tewari reported in (2017) 2 SCC 308

paragraph 7 wherein the Court held that in a case where the

disciplinary authority records a finding that is unsupported by any

evidence whatsoever or a finding which no reasonable person could have

arrived at, the writ court would be justified if not duty bound to examine

the matter and grant relief in appropriate cases. The Court observed

that the writ court will certainly interfere with disciplinary enquiry or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       6</span>




the resultant orders, if the enquiry itself was vitiated on account of

violation of principles of natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">      The petitioner argues that the appellate authority failed to

appreciate that the order of transfer, despite being illegal, he intended to

join his transferred place of posting, but because of health issues he was

unable to join. The appellate authority did not deny the aforesaid

averment made by the petitioner, thereby implying, that the reason for

not joining the transferred place of posting has been accepted by the

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">      The last contention of the petitioner is that the punishment that

has been imposed upon him is highly disproportionate. As the charges

against him were vague and not even proved on evidence the

punishment is shockingly disproportionate and is liable to be set aside

by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_35">

</p><p id="p_36">      Per contra, the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the bank

submits that on 14th September, 2015 while the petitioner was in office,

he complained of discomfort and uneasiness.         The Branch Manager

immediately arranged for medical help and the petitioner was sent to the

Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI). After administration of first

aid the petitioner was released by the said hospital. The petitioner

returned from CMRI and joined office on the self-same day without any

further health problem.       There was no indication in the medical

documents of CMRI requiring the petitioner to take rest.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>




</p><p id="p_37">      The petitioner, for no valid reason, remained absent on 15th

September, 2015 without any prior notice or intimation. A letter was,

however, sent by the petitioner on 16th September, 2015 to the effect

that on consultation with a doctor, he was advised to take rest. The

letter further indicated that he will resume his duties upon being

declared fit by the doctor.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">      On 28th September, 2015, after a lapse of twelve days the

petitioner returned to work and expressed his desire to join duties. As

the petitioner was not carrying the fit certificate with him accordingly,

he was advised to resume duties after he produces the fit certificate by

the doctor.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">      The petitioner went away and did not make any communication

with the branch till 4th October, 2015. On 5th October, 2015 the bank

requested the petitioner to submit his leave application mentioning his

probable date of joining.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">      On receipt of the aforesaid letter the petitioner returned to work

on 13th October, 2015 and he was allowed to join duties. The petitioner

again absented himself from work on 15th October, 2015 without any

intimation, but reported to duty on 16th October, 2015. On and from

19th October, 2015, the petitioner remained absent continuously

without any intimation.       The petitioner, however, sent an email on

regular basis in the morning, intimating that he was unable to attend

office as he was unwell.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      8</span><p id="p_44">




</p><p id="p_45">        The bank by an e-mail dated 29th October, 2015 requested the

petitioner to submit his application with detailed reasons for his

absence and to intimate the expected date of his joining duty.


</p><p id="p_46">        The petitioner by a letter dated 31st October, 2015 informed the

bank that he was unable to attend office since October 19, 2015 as he

was feeling uncomfortable, but assured that he would be joining very

soon.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">        By a letter dated 5th November, 2015, the petitioner informed the

bank that he would join on 10th November, 2015 but surprisingly the

petitioner did not turn up on the said date. The petitioner ultimately

joined duties on 12th November, 2015. In the meantime, the petitioner

remained absent for about twenty four days from October 19, 2015 to

November 11, 2015.        He continued duty for five days and again

absented himself on 18th November, 2015.           He rejoined on 19th

November, 2015 and again absented himself on 24th November, 2015.

On 25th November 2015 he joined duty but absented himself from 27th

November, 2015 without any intimation.
</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">        On 1st December, 2015 he communicated a message over the

mobile phone and intimated the Assistant General Manager of the bank

that he will join his duty on 3rd December, 2015.         The petitioner,

however, did not join on 3rd December, 2015. The bank, accordingly, by

a letter dated 3rd December, 2015, requested the petitioner to explain

his present position of health and to intimate his expected date of

joining on becoming medically fit. The petitioner failed to reply to the

said letter. A further e-mail was sent to the petitioner requesting him to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     9</span>




intimate his probable date of joining. The petitioner thereafter informed

the bank that he was unable to join his duties due to the illness of his

wife.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">        The petitioner thereafter visited the branch on 16th December,

2015 and expressed his desire to join. The Assistant General Manager

of the bank requested him to provide the reasons for not replying to the

bank&#x27;s earlier letter dated 3rd December, 2015 as the same was required

for onward transmission to the higher authorities. On being asked to

submit the explanation, the petitioner got highly infuriated and left the

branch after heated arguments with the Assistant General Manager.

The matter was reported by the branch office to the branch head and

the petitioner was called upon to submit his explanation for such

untoward act. The petitioner submitted his explanation by a letter dated

29th December, 2015 but he did not turn up for resuming his duties.


</p><p id="p_53">        On 12th January, 2016 the petitioner wrote a letter to the zonal

office complaining, that though he was fit to resume duties since

December 16, 2015, he has not been able to join his duties as he did not

receive any communication or confirmation for resuming his duty. In

reply, the petitioner was intimated that he was free to report for duty

along with the medical certificate certifying his fitness. It was further

clarified that the period of his absence was being treated as

&#x27;unauthorised&#x27;.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">        The petitioner visited the SME Finance Branch on 16th February,

2016 along with a medical certificate dated 15th December, 2015

certifying that the petitioner was fit to resume his duties on and from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>




16th December, 2015. The petitioner was directed to submit his

explanation for not joining duty for such a long period of time. This

infuriated the petitioner and he started an altercation with the Assistant

General Manager of the Bank and thereafter left. The petitioner was

asked to explain his conduct by a letter dated 16th December, 2015. The

petitioner replied to the same by his letter dated 29th December, 2015.


</p><p id="p_56">      The petitioner reported to work on 16th February, 2016 but again

failed to attend office on 20th February, 2016, but thereafter joined on

22nd February, 2016 and then remained absent on 23rd February, 2016.

On 24th February, 2016, he sent an e-mail that he was feeling

uncomfortable and needed rest for a couple of days.


</p><p id="p_57">      By a letter dated 22nd February, 2016, the petitioner was asked to

explain the reason for not joining duties for the period 16th December,

2015 to 15th February, 2016. The petitioner was informed once again

that his absence from duties was treated as unauthorized by the higher

authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">      By a letter dated 24th February, 2016 the petitioner intimated the

bank that he was physically prevented from joining his duties.


</p><p id="p_60">      In the month of March 2016, being the closing of the financial

year, additional manpower was required in the Asset Recovery

Management Branch (ARMB) of the Bank to deal with the sudden work

load. The petitioner was temporarily posted at the ARMB of the Bank

situated in the first floor of the same building where the petitioner was

serving. The petitioner was sought to be served with the letter dated

March 11, 2016 intimating him about his temporary transfer, but such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      11</span>




attempt failed as the postal envelope addressed to the petitioner

returned unserved with the endorsement &quot;unclaimed&quot;. The order of

temporary posting was thereafter communicated to the petitioner via e-

mail. The petitioner did not reply and/or respond to the said order of

posting.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">       By an order dated 1st July, 2016 the petitioner was advised to

report at the zonal office, Siliguri for receiving posting orders on 4th July,

2016 as the Competent Authority of the bank decided to transfer him

from the place where he was then posted.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">       The bank viewed the action of the petitioner as misconduct and

initiated formal disciplinary proceeding against him. The petitioner did

not participate in the disciplinary proceeding and ex parte order was

passed removing him from service. The petitioner preferred an appeal

against the said order but was unsuccessful.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">       According to the respondents, the disciplinary authority acted

strictly in accordance with the provisions mentioned in the D &amp; A

Regulations. It has been submitted that due opportunity was given to

the petitioner to defend himself. Principle of natural justice was duly

complied with by the disciplinary authority. The petitioner, for the

reasons best known to him, did not participate in the disciplinary

proceeding. Notices were sent to the petitioner at the address registered

in the official record of the bank. The un-served letters were returned

with   the   endorsement     &#x27;unclaimed&#x27;.   The    bank    made    a   public

advertisement in the newspapers and sought to draw the attention of

the petitioner. There was no response from his side. The bank was left
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    12</span>




with no other alternative but to proceed and conclude the disciplinary

proceeding ex parte.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">      It has been argued that the scope of review in matters dealing with

the disciplinary proceedings of employees under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India is extremely limited. The Courts ought not to

interfere with the order passed by the disciplinary authority if the same

has been passed upon compliance of the provisions of law and

principles of natural justice.

       In reply to the contention of the petitioner that the charges

mentioned in the charge sheet did not include the charge of absence, it

has been submitted that there are sufficient charges in the charge sheet

clearly indicating unauthorised absence from work. The petitioner was

all along aware of all the charges levelled against him. His devotion and

sincerity towards his duty were lacking. In such a situation the non-

recording of the appropriate Regulation dealing with absence will not

make the charge sheet bad. In support of the aforesaid contention the

petitioner has relied upon the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in

the matter of <a href="/doc/266697/" id="a_13">Union Bank of India -vs- Vishwa Mohan</a> reported in

treatment. The petitioner reported to work on 13th October, 2015 but

absented himself on the 15th October, 2015 without giving any prior

intimation. Since thereafter the petitioner intermittently remained

absent from duty, without any prior intimation, citing health reasons,

either of himself or his wife. The petitioner did not submit any formal

application for obtaining leave. In spite of giving assurance of reporting

to duty on a particular day the petitioner did not turn up for work on

more than one occasion.

</p><p id="p_83">      According to Regulation 13 (1) of the Conduct Regulations no

officer employee shall absent himself from his duty or be late in

attending office or leave the station without having first obtained the

permission of the Competent Authority. In case of unavoidable

circumstances, where availing of prior permission is not possible or is

difficult, such permission may be obtained later, subject to the

satisfaction of the Competent Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">      It appears in the instant case, that the petitioner absented himself

from work without obtaining prior permission of the competent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                      15</span>




authority for days together. The petitioner forwarded a message via

email in the morning intimating that he would not be able to report to

duty as he was not feeling comfortable. The discomfort of the petitioner

was not backed up by medical reports. An officer of the bank ought not

to absent himself from duty without any cogent reason. As the petitioner

claimed that he was unwell, he ought to have submitted proper

application(s) for leave along with supporting documents.


</p><p id="p_86">      An   employee    ought    to    appreciate   that   he   has   been

appointed/employed for a particular purpose, for performing certain

assigned jobs. Not reporting to duty means that the work which is

assigned to the employee has to be performed by some other person, as

the work of a public authority ought not to be kept pending on account

of absence of an employee. The bank in such a case would have been

answerable, if the work is not performed or completed within the

specified time limit. If an employee remains absent from office without

giving any prior intimation then it becomes difficult for the employer in

the matter of proper administration of the institution. The requirement

of prior intimation is for the sole purpose of putting the employer on

notice of the absence, so that the work may be assigned to some other

employee and is not kept pending. In the absence of proper prior notice,

the employer will not be in a position to assign the work to any other

person.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">      The petitioner was handling the foreign exchange services of the

bank. Non-reporting to work in such an important department certainly

caused inconvenience to the bank. The petitioner by a letter dated 29th

December, 2015 addressed to the Assistant General Manager of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    16</span>




bank intimated him that there was huge work load and he had verbally

requested to reduce his work load. Being aware of the fact that he was

holding a responsible post, the petitioner ought not to have taken his

duty in such a casual and cavalier manner.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">      The bank initiated a disciplinary proceeding against the petitioner

on account of certain irregularities committed by him. There were as

many as five charges mentioned in the statement and articles of charge

framed against him. Three out of the five charges relates to his absence

from work without obtaining prior permission and without submission

of proper leave application.     A further charge of not joining his

transferred place of posting in violation of the order passed by the High

Court, Calcutta has also been levelled against him.    According to the

bank, the same amounts to misconduct.
</p>
<p id="p_91">
</p><p id="p_92">      The petitioner has challenged the same, as according to him, the

Regulation dealing with absence was not specifically mentioned in the

articles of charge issued to him. The charge sheet mentioned violation of

Regulations 3(1) and 3(3) of the Conduct Regulations.          However,

Regulation 24 relating to misconduct has also been mentioned in the

articles of charge.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
</p><p id="p_94">      Regulation 24 of the aforesaid regulations mentions that a breach

of any of the provisions of the Regulations shall be deemed to constitute

misconduct punishable under the Regulations.       The charges levelled

against the petitioner clearly mention the fact of his remaining absent

from office, without any valid permission and without submitting any

documents. The same is in violation of Regulation 13, which certainly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                     17</span>




amounts to misconduct punishable under the Regulations. 3(1) of the

Conduct Regulations is a general provision which mentions that every

officer employee shall, at all times take all possible steps to ensure and

protect the interest of the bank and discharge his duties with utmost

integrity, honesty, devotion and diligence and do nothing which is

unbecoming of a bank officer.
</p>
<p id="p_95">
</p><p id="p_96">      Regulation 3(3) of the Conduct Regulations mentions that no

officer employee shall, in the performance of his official duties or in the

exercise of powers conferred on him, act otherwise than in his best

judgement except when he is acting under the direction of his official

superior.
</p>
<p id="p_97">
</p><p id="p_98">      The aforesaid provision lays down the general principles that are

required to be followed by all officer employees of the bank. The act of

the petitioner in absenting himself from work without any prior

intimation is in direct conflict with the provision of Regulation 3(1).

Being absent from work without prior intimation cause serious prejudice

to the bank and poses problems in the general administration and day

to day functioning of the bank. The same is not in the interest of the

bank, but is against the bank&#x27;s interest. Not reporting to work on

frequent basis reflects the employee&#x27;s lack of devotion and diligence

which is unbecoming of the bank officer.
</p>
<p id="p_99">
</p><p id="p_100">      The expression &#x27;prior permission&#x27; as appearing in the Conduct

Regulations has to be given due importance. The service condition of the

employee requires a permission to be obtained from the competent

authority before he remains absent from work. Remaining absent from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                      18</span>




work without taking an expressed permission from the competent

authority, in advance, amounts to misconduct as per the said

Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_101">
</p><p id="p_102">      The petitioner has also not acted in accordance with the order

passed by his superior authority. He did not join his transferred place of

posting in compliance with the order of his superior authority.          The

petitioner unsuccessfully challenged the order of transfer before this

Court. In the order dated 23rd August, 2016 passed in W.P. No. 16506

(W) of 2016 filed by the petitioner, the Court specifically records that

there is no question of staying the impugned order of transfer and the

petitioner must report to Siliguri within ten days, failing which, the bank

shall be at liberty to pass proper order including initiation of disciplinary

proceeding against him. The disciplinary proceeding against the

petitioner was initiated only after he did not comply with the direction

passed by the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_103">
</p><p id="p_104">      The notice of show cause and the subsequent letters and notices

were communicated to the petitioner at the address which was

mentioned in his official records. The same returned unserved with the

endorsement &quot;unclaimed&quot;. The bank has relied upon Regulation 20 of

the D &amp; A Regulations which mention that every order, notice and other

process made or issued under the Regulations shall be served in person

on the officer employee concerned or communicated to him by registered

post at his last known address. Admittedly, the notices and the

processes of the disciplinary proceeding were communicated to the

petitioner at his last known recorded address.         The same returned

unserved.   The bank thereafter made a public announcement in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                     19</span>




newspaper. The petitioner did not respond to the same. The petitioner

tried to make out a case that the bank ought to have communicated the

notices and the processes via e-mail as the petitioner regularly

communicated with his superior officers via e-mail. The said contention

of the petitioner cannot be accepted, as the mode of service of notice has

been clearly mentioned in the D &amp; A Regulations of the bank. Serving a

copy via e-mail may be as a supplementary communication, in addition

to the prescribed mode of communication, but the same cannot be

treated as the primary and the only mode of communication.          If the

mode of communication as prescribed in the Regulations has been

followed by the employer, then the same has to be accepted as a valid

communication, irrespective of the fact whether a supplementary,

additional communication over e-mail was made or not.         It was the

bounden duty of the petitioner to intimate the bank about his proper

address and his change of address. The petitioner never recorded his

present address in the official records maintained by the bank. It has

been submitted by the bank that as many as twenty letters sent to the

recorded address of the petitioner returned unserved.


</p><p id="p_105">      The petitioner contends that as there is a separate Regulation

dealing with absence from duty (Regulation 13 of the Conduct

Regulations), the bank ought to have invoked the same and thereafter

proceeded accordingly.    As the bank did not invoke Regulation 13

accordingly, the charge of absence from duty cannot be attributed to the

petitioner. It has further been submitted that the petitioner all along

provided the reason for not reporting to duty to his superior officer. The

absence was not wilful, and in the absence of a finding that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                     20</span>




petitioner remained wilfully absent from duty, the period during which

he did not report for duty ought not to have been treated as

unauthorized. The petitioner has relied upon the judgment delivered in

the case of Krushnakant B. Parmar (supra) in support of his

submission.

</p><p id="p_107">      The Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/3501833/" id="a_14">Chennai Metropolitan

Water Supply and Sewerage Board &amp; Ors. -vs- T. T. Murali Babu</a>

reported in (2014) 4 SCC 108 paragraph 23 has laid down that the

views expressed in the case of Krushnakant B. Parmar (supra) has to be

restricted to the facts of the said case, regard being had to the real

position, the nature of the charge levelled against the employee and the

material that had come on record during the enquiry. It cannot be

stated as an absolute proposition in law that whenever there is a long

unauthorized absence, it is obligatory on the part of the disciplinary

authority to record a finding that the said absence is wilful, even if the

employee fails to show the compelling circumstances to remain absent.

The said decision has practically denuded the precedential value of the

decision in Krushnakant B. Parmar (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_108">
</p><p id="p_109">      The petitioner has relied upon the decision delivered by the

Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1106974/" id="a_15">Roop Singh Negi -vs- Punjab

National Bank &amp; Ors</a>. reported in (2009) 2 SCC 570 para 14 on the

issue of proof of documents. The Supreme Court in the said matter held

that the departmental proceeding, being a quasi-judicial proceeding, the

charges levelled against the delinquent officer must be found to have

been proved. It is the duty of the enquiry officer to arrive at a finding

upon taking into consideration the materials brought on record by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                         21</span>




parties. Merely tendering the documents without proving the contents,

thereof will not amount to the documents being proved. The petitioner

submits that as the disciplinary proceeding was held ex-parte the

documents relied upon by the management witness were merely

tendered and not proved. Accordingly, no reliance can be placed on the

said documents.
</p>
<p id="p_110">      In reply to the aforesaid contention the respondents submit that

the fact of the case of Roop Singh Negi (supra) is different from the facts

of the case at hand. It has been submitted that the documents relied

upon by the bank were the records of the bank comprising of the

attendance register, the official communications and the letters and

certificates produced by the petitioner. The said documents are of great

evidentiary value and there is no requirement for proving the aforesaid

documents separately at the time of proceeding with the departmental

proceeding. The said documents were enough proof to pass order

against the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_111">      In      this   connection   the   respondent   has   relied   upon   the

Constitution bench judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in the

matter of H.C. Goel (supra), R. Periyasamy (supra), P. Gunasekaran

(supra), S. Subramaniam (supra) on the issue that under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution the High Court cannot consider the question of

adequacy or sufficiency of evidence in support of a particular

conclusion. If there is some evidence to arrive at the finding the Court

will not question the same. Here, there are evidences galore against the

petitioner.

judge Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/623061/" id="a_17">Bhavnagar

University -vs- Palitana Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>. reported in

(2003) 2 SCC 111 paragraph 59 on the issue that a decision is an

authority for which it is decided and not what can logically be deduced

therefrom. A little difference in facts or additional facts may make a lot

of different in the precedential value of a decision.

</p><p id="p_114">      The respondents rely upon the judgment delivered by the Hon&#x27;ble

Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1936933/" id="a_18">Ram Kumar -vs- State of Haryana</a>

reported in 1987(Supp) SCC 582 para 7 and 8 and the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1993458/" id="a_19">National Fertilisers Ltd. &amp; Anr. -vs-

P.K. Khanna</a> reported in (2005) 7 SCC 597 para 9 wherein the Court

held that when the punishing authority agrees with the findings of the

enquiry officer and accepts the reasons in support of such finding, it is

not necessary for the punishing authority to again discuss the evidence

and come to the same finding as that of the enquiry officer and give the

same reasons for the findings. The Court held that the disciplinary

authority is required to give reasons only when the disciplinary

authority does not agree with the finding of the enquiry officer.

</p><p id="p_115">      The respondents rely upon Regulation 7(2) of the D &amp; A

Regulations wherein it is mentioned that the disciplinary authority shall,

if it disagrees with the finding of the inquiring authority on any article of

charge, record its reasons for such disagreement and record its own

findings on such charge. In the instant case, as the disciplinary

authority accepted and agreed with the findings of the inquiring
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                        23</span>




authority accordingly, there is no requirement for recording further

reasons for agreeing with the findings of the inquiry officer.

</p><p id="p_116">      The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_20">Gujarat Electricity Board &amp; Anr. -vs-

Atmaram Sungomal Poshani</a> (supra) held that whenever a public

servant is transferred he must comply with the order and failure to act

in compliance with the transfer order would expose him to disciplinary

action under the relevant rules. In the said case the respondent lost his

service as he refused to comply with the order of transfer from one place

to another. The Court was of the opinion that the respondent acted in

an irresponsible manner in not complying with the order of transfer

which led to his discharge from service.
</p>
<p id="p_117">      In Tushar D. Bhatt (supra) the Court reiterated the aforesaid

contention. The Court also reiterated the settled legal position that

absence from duty without proper intimation is a grave offence

warranting removal from service.
</p>
<p id="p_118">      The primary charge against the petitioner in the case at hand is

that he remained absent from service without any prior intimation, for

days together and further failed to act in accordance with the direction

given by the superior authority. By order dated 23rd August, 2016

passed in W.P. No. 16506 (W) of 2016 filed by the petitioner, the prayer

of the petitioner for staying the impugned order of transfer was

categorically refused by the Court with direction to the petitioner to

report to Siliguri within ten days, failing which, the bank shall be at

liberty   to   pass   proper   order   including   initiation   of   disciplinary

proceeding against him.

</p><p id="p_120">      While deciding the case of T.T. Murali Babu (supra) the Court

relied upon the views expressed by the Court in the case of <a href="/doc/155348/" id="a_21">State of

Punjab -vs- P.L. Singla</a> reported in (2008) 8 SCC 469 and was of the

opinion that the unauthorized absence of an employee as a misconduct,

cannot be put into a straight jacket formula for imposition of

punishment and the extent of the punishment will depend upon the

nature of service, the position held by the employee, the period of

absence and the cause/explanation for the absence.

</p><p id="p_121">      The petitioner has submitted that the punishment imposed upon

him is highly disproportionate.
</p>
<p id="p_122">      It is settled law that the Court, in review of the punishment

imposed upon an employee, is not entitled to interfere with the same

unless the punishment imposed shocks the conscience of the Court. In

the instant case, the petitioner being an officer employee of the bank

held a responsible post. He ought not to have absented himself for days

together citing trivial reasons without any supporting documents.

Forwarding a communication in the morning intimating the superior

officer that he will not attend the office as he was not feeling well cannot

be accepted to be a valid application for leave. Absenting from work for

days together without any prior intimation and without any supporting

document is certainly misconduct on the part of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_123">      A three judge bench of the Supreme Court in SBI -vs- Ramlal

Bhaskar reported in (2011) 10 SCC 249 made it succinctly clear that

in a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the Constitution the High Court

does not sit as an appellate authority over the findings of the

disciplinary authority and so long as the findings of the disciplinary

authority are supported by some evidence, the High Court does not re-

appreciate the evidence and come to a different and independent finding

of the evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_124">      In the instant case, it is clearly evident that the petitioner

remained absent without any prior intimation and without supporting

documents. The explanation given by the petitioner for his absence not

being found satisfactory, disciplinary proceeding was initiated against

him. The petitioner was given several opportunities to defend himself in

the said disciplinary proceeding, which the petitioner failed to avail as

he did not receive the letters and the notices which were sent to him.

The petitioner moved out from his residential address as recorded in the

official records of the respondent authority and did not care to

incorporate his present address in the official records. The public

notices published by the bank in the newspapers were also not

responded to by the petitioner and thereby he lost the chance of

defending himself before the disciplinary authority.

</p><p id="p_125">      The Supreme Court in the matter of Vishwa Mohan (supra)

emphasised that in the banking business absolute devotion, diligence,

integrity and honesty needs to be preserved by every bank employee and

in particular the bank officer. If it is not observed, the confidence of the

public/depositors would be impaired.
</p>
<p id="p_126">      The petitioner being an officer employee of the bank ought to have

been more diligent, and should have acted in a responsible manner with

absolute devotion. The action of the petitioner does not reflect the above

qualities. The Court does not find any reason to interfere with the order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                     26</span>
