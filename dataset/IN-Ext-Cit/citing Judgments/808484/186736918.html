        under Bettiah Municipality, District-West Champaran. However,

        petitioner defaulted in making payment of dues as agreed and

        demanded, as such, a demand notice under Section 13 (2) of the

        Securitization and Reconstruction of the Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Security

        Interest Act</a>, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_2">SARFAESI Act</a>,

        2002') dated 30.07.2013 was issued which was received by the

        petitioner which postulated that the dues mentioned was to be paid

        within 60 days. Having failed to repay, a possession notice was issued

        on 24.10.2013 against which the petitioner represented before the

        authorities of the Bank on 24.10.2013. Thereafter the Bank sat silent.

        After about two years again a possession notice was issued to the

        petitioner on 09.07.2015 and the property was put on E-auction sale

        by issuing E-auction sale notice dated 15.10.2015 fixing the lowest

        price of property of Rs. 18 lacs and the date of auction was fixed on

        20.11.2015 wherein the security deposit amount was 1.80 lacs. The

        Bank published sale notice in two newspapers namely 'Prabhat

        Khabar' and 'The Telegraph' on 16.10.2015. The auction purchaser

        respondent no. 6 submitted his offer letter on 19.11.2015 and E-

        auction bid was held on 20.11.2015 who deposited the security money

        of Rs. 180000/- on 19.11.2015 along with tender. The purchase of the

        property offered to the respondent auction-purchaser was accepted by

        the respondent Bank. An acceptance letter was given by the

        respondent Bank vide Annexure-2 dated 23.11.2015 in C.W.J.C. No.

        17913 of 2016. The respondent auction purchaser deposited the

        auction-purchase price of Rs. 18.10 lac within the time postulated

        under Rule 9 (3) and 9 (4) of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_3">SARFAESI Act</a>, 2002 by which 25%

        was paid immediately and the rest 75% within 15 days of

        confirmation of sale or such extended period. The auction-purchaser

        in Annexure-3 of C.W.J.C. No. 17913 of 2016 has enclosed a Bank

        statement stating therein that the entire amount of Rs. 18.10 lac was

        deposited by 24.12.2015 as per the extended period agreed by the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.13998 of 2017 dt. 10-10-2018

        West Champaran, Bettiah vide letter no. 498 dated 21.06.2016 as

        contained in Annexure-5, in C.W.J.C. No. 17913 of 2016 the District

        Magistrate handed over possession of the said questioned property

        which physical possession was handed over by the bank to the

        auction-purchaser on 30.07.2016 which is Annexure-6 to C.W.J.C.

        No. 17913 of 2016. At this juncture, it may be mentioned that the

        Bank had also preferred O.A. No. 385 of 2015 against the petitioner

        before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Patna for recovery of its dues and

        a certificate was obtained on 07.03.2016 but after auction sale of the

        property in question the order passed by the Tribunal was recalled and

        recovery proceeding and certificate dated 07.03.2016 was dropped.

        The petitioner challenged the auction of his property before the Debt

        Recovery Tribunal, Patna in S.A. No. 28 of 2016 challenging the

        auction on many a ground: (i) The representation of the petitioner

        dated 24.10.2013 after the possession notice of the same date was not

        yet decided by the Bank. (ii) The possession notice dated 09.07.2015

        was not affixed on the secured assets neither served on the applicant

        which is in violation of Rule 8(i) of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_4">SARFAESI Act</a>, 2002. (iii)

        The value of the property was more than 50 lacs but it was sold at Rs.

        18.10 lacs. (iv) Recovery certificate in O.A. 385 of 2015 was obtained

        by the Bank on 07.03.2016 but the property was already sold on

        21.11.2015 which the Bank had concealed. (v) No certificate of E-

        auction sale notice was published in the newspapers of the area where

        property was situated which is in violation of Rule 8(vi) of the Rules,

        2002 and that in view of the decision in the case of General

        Manager, Sri Siddeshwara Cooperative Bank Limited &amp; Anr. Vs.

        Ikbal &amp; Ors. since reported in (2013) 10 SCC 83 para 14, since

        mandatory provisions of <a href="/doc/117573380/" id="a_5">Section 9(3)(4)</a> of the Rules, 2002 was not

        followed sale was not valid and also in view of the decision rendered

        in the case of J. Rajiv Subramaniyan &amp; Anr. Vs. Pandiyas &amp; Ors.

        since reported in (2014) 5 SCC 651 para 15 the sale effected

        without complying with the aforesaid            provision would     be

        unconstitutional and therefore null and void. However, before the

        Debts Recovery Tribunal in S.A. No. 28 of 2016 the auction-

        purchaser refused to accept notice and did not appear, hence, the order

        was passed ex parte as against the auction purchaser. The respondent

        Bank appeared before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Patna and

        submitted that after the notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_6">Section 13(2)</a> dated 30.07.2013,

        the representation was not filed within 60 days. Representation was

        filed by the petitioner only on 24.10.2013 i.e. on the date when the

        possession notice under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_7">Section 13(4)</a> was issued which was beyond

        60 days. It was also submitted that even after possession notice, the

        Bank waited for 2 years for the petitioner to repay the loan which was

        not paid and as such possession of the property was taken on

        09.07.2015 by the Respondent Bank which was sent by the

        enforcement agent of the Bank to the petitioner but he refused to

        accept, which was later on sent by post. The possession notice was

        also published in two leading newspapers namely, 'The Telegraph'

        and 'Prabhat Khabar' and the property was valued by the approved

        valuer on 15.09.2015. Thereafter, auction was held and the private

        respondent auction-purchaser was declared a successful bidder who

        deposited 25% of the bid amount within time and the rest 75% within

        the extended period as agreed between the respondent-Bank and the

        auction-purchaser. Although no written agreement was filed by the

        Bank in the proceeding before the DRT, Patna, the Tribunal found

        that the mandatory procedure as laid down under the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_8">SARFAESI Act</a>

        and Rules were not followed and in view of the decisions of the Apex

        Court as referred to hereinabove came to a conclusion that the

        mandatory procedure having not been followed the sale was not valid.

        Hence, the Tribunal set aside the possession notice and E-auction

        notice and directed the respondent-Bank to return the auction amount

        to the auction-purchaser within 10 days of receipt of its order dated

        08.09.2016 passed in S.A. No. 28 of 2016. The order having not been

        complied, the petitioner filed M.A. No. 101 of 2016 in which from the

        order sheet as contained in Annexure-2 it is evident that the Bank had

        accept the same, instead moved this Court in writ petition being

        handed over in his favour, he has made certain constructions and

        spent about Rs. 8,75,000/- for its remodeling and repairing. He

        able to enjoy its fruits since last two years and is embroiled in

        law as per the procedure followed, as the petitioner had defaulted in

        having defaulted in payment of loan taken as credit facility, the

        respondent-Bank initiated SARFAESI proceedings and also preferred

        original application before the DRT, Patna being O.A. No. 385 of

        2015 for recovery of its dues. A notice under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_10">Section 13(2)</a> of the

        SARFAESI Act was served on the petitioner on 30.07.2013 to repay

        the SARFAESI Act within time but when the possession notice was

        issued on 24.10.2013, the petitioner submitted a representation dated

        situated. The auction was held on 20.11.2015 and respondent no. 6 the

        auction-purchaser was declared a successful bidder who deposited

        25% within time and rest 75% within extended time as mutually

        agreed. In fact, from the statement of accounts as contained in

                            third party auction purchaser, in compliance of a
                            court order, cannot be interfered with on the basis
                            of the success or failure of parties to a proceeding,

                            property. In order to substantiate his aforesaid
                            contention, learned counsel representing Sadashiv
                            Prasad Singh placed emphatic reliance, firstly, on a

                            Our attention was drawn to the following
                            observations recorded therein :

                            any third-party interest is no longer in dispute nor
                            the same is subject to any order of this Court. In
                            any event, ordinarily, a bona fide purchaser for
                            value in an auction-sale is treated differently than a
                            decree-holder purchasing such properties. In the
                            former event, even if such a decree is set aside, the
                            interest of the bona fide purchaser in an auction-
                            sale is saved. (See Nawab Zain-ul-Abdin Khan v.
                            Mohd. Asghar Ali Khan (1887) 15 IA 12). The said
                            decision has been affirmed by this Court in

                            that this Court in its ultimate analysis observed as

                            purchaser at a court auction. The strangers to the

                            they are not connected with the decree. Unless the

                            paragraph, this Court has carved out one exception.
                            The aforesaid exception came to be recorded in
                            Velji Khimji and Company v. Official Liquidator of

                            auction is not subject to confirmation by any
                            authority, the auction is complete on the fall of the
                            hammer, and certain rights accrue in favour of the
                            auction-purchaser. However, where the auction is
                            subject to subsequent confirmation by some
                            authority (under a statute or terms of the auction)
                            the auction is not complete and no rights accrue
                            until the sale is confirmed by the said authority.
                            Once, however, the sale is confirmed by that
                            authority, certain rights accrue in favour of the
                            auction-purchaser, and these rights cannot be
                            extinguished except in exceptional cases such as
                            fraud.

                            confirmed on 30.7.2003 by the Court it cannot be
                            set aside unless some fraud or collusion has been
                            proved. We are satisfied that no fraud or collusion

                            cannot be extinguished except in cases where the
                            said purchase can be assailed on grounds of fraud
                            or collusion.

        Bank on the one hand and the petitioner who was the borrower on the

        other, the auction-purchaser was not a party to the said proceeding

        initiated by the Bank till its auction in favour of the auction-purchaser.

        Applying the law declared by the Apex Court in the case of Sadashiv

        Prasad Singh (supra) rendered in forgoing paragraphs irrespective of

        the merits of the lis between the rival parties namely, the Indian Bank

        and the petitioner the borrower, it is not open to anyone to assail the

        purchase of the property made by the auction-purchaser in the above

        view of the matter, especially in the absence of any allegation of fraud

        or collusion by the auction-purchaser who was the bona fide

        purchaser for consideration having purchased the property in E-

        auction and who has spent huge amount of money on the property so

        purchased for its remodeling and repairing. The petitioner having

        defaulted in payment of Bank dues, the right of the auction-purchaser

        being a bona fide purchaser ought to be protected. The right of the
