        daughter Munni Devi was married with Mukesh Sah, son of Sakal

        Sah of village Pachnaur about two and half years ago. About three

        months ago, in the month of Shrawan bidai of Munni Devi was

        effected. At that very time, they have demanded a television as well as

        bicycle. However, she had gifted pial as well as Rs.1,000/-. They have

        further disclosed that in case bicycle and television is not provided,

        then they will commit murder. In the evening of 29.10.2009 she came

        to know that her daughter has been administered poison on account of

        which she died and then thereafter her dead body has been burnt. Over

        this, she along with her husband Dhanai Sah, son Rampujan Sah and

        Bachhu Sah gone to Paachnaur where they have come to know that

        Mukesh Sah, Sushila Devi, Ram Kumar Sah, Satan Sah and Ram

        Kumar Sah, Sakal Sah all have murdered her daughter by

        administering poison and then disposed of her dead body.

</p><p id="p_6">                          3.     Belsand P.S.Case No.132 of 2009 under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_5">Section

        304B</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_6">201</a>, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> of the IPC was instituted thereupon followed with

        investigation which concluded by way of chargesheet against the

        appellant while further investigation has been kept opened against

        Mukesh Sah. The other accused were not sent up for trial. The learned

        Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sitamarhi took cognizance thereupon where

        after appellant faced trial meeting with ultimate result, the subject

        matter of instant appeal.

</p><p id="p_8">                          4. The plea of appellant by way of defence as is evident

        from mode of cross-examination as well as from the statement

        recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_8">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C. is complete denial of

        occurrence. Further it has specifically been pleaded that deceased died

        of natural death whereupon prosecution party were properly informed

        and in whose presence, funeral was done but subsequently, only to

        squeeze money they have filed instant case with false and frivolous

        allegation. However, neither any D.Ws. has been examined nor any

        exhibit has been brought up on record.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                          5.     From the Lower Court Record, it transpires that

        altogether five P.Ws. have been examined, out of whom, P.W.1 is

        Narendra Kumar Singh, P.W.2 is Ram Bhajan Sahni, P.W.3 is

        Mantoran Devi, P.W.4 is Basudeo Prasad Yadav and P.W.5 is

        Yogendra Sah as well as had also exhibited Ext-1 formal FIR, Ext-2

        written report and Ext-3 the chargesheet. As stated above neither any

        D.Ws. has been examined nor any exhibit happens to be on behalf of

        defence.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                          6.     While assailing the judgment of conviction and

        sentence, it has been submitted on behalf of the appellant that the

        judgment happens to be cryptic one as the learned Lower Court failed

        to appreciate the improbability with regard to prosecution version. It

        has further been submitted that the false implication of appellant and
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.496 of 2013 dt.13-02-2014                       4




        his family members are apparent from bare perusal of the written

        report which has purposely been filed taking the informant, an

        illiterate lady under their control by the P.W.2 whose dubious

        character is itself exposed during course of cross-examination. Then,

        it has been submitted that prosecution case suffers from basic

        infirmities. As per written report, the husband, two sons of informant

        along with others have gone to the place of occurrence but

        surprisingly enough neither the husband nor two sons who happens to

        be own family members of informant have come forward to support

        the case of the prosecution nor any explanation has been offered by

        the prosecution thereto. Their non-presence is suggestive of the fact

        that there happens to be no truthfulness in the version of the

        prosecution. Had there been, at least the father and the brother would

        not have let the accused at any cost.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                          7. It has further been submitted that after going through

        the evidences of the P.Ws., it is crystal clear that they have developed

        the case so many times by introducing new fact than that of what have

        been disclosed by the informant P.W.3 by way of written report.

        Having those facts decanted was suffice to dethrone application of

        <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_9">Section 304B</a> or 201 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                          8.    It has also been submitted that on account of non-

        examination of I.O., their rights have been prejudiced, more
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.496 of 2013 dt.13-02-2014                        5




        particularly, relating to objective finding of the I.O. concerning place

        of occurrence as well as on account of material contradiction present

        in the evidence of witnesses which could not brought up on record

        legally. The inconsistency in between the written report wherein there

        happens to be specific disclosure that the dead body of deceased had

        already brunt is found controverted by the evidence of P.W.3

        wherefrom it is apparent that dead body was burnt in presence of

        police. So again, due to non-examination of I/O the appellant has been

        deprived of an opportunity to place their innocence because of the fact

        that police would have permitted to funeral only in case no offence

        was found to be committed otherwise police would have seized the

        dead body. As such, due to non-examination of I/O, fate of appellant

        has been blurred.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                          9.     In likewise manner, it has been submitted that

        P.Ws.1 and 2 are stranger to the family of the P.W.3 and on account

        thereof, there was no occasion for them to depose on the score of

        demand of dowry and harassment so made in lieu thereof. In absence

        of examination of father as well as two brothers for which prosecution

        has not given any sort of explanation, evidence of P.W.3, informant

        cannot be taken into consideration and so submitted that virtually it

        happens to be a case of no evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                          10.    It has further been submitted that even taking into
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.496 of 2013 dt.13-02-2014                      6




        account the evidence of P.Ws. it is apparent that it might be a case of

        suicide in the background of persisting illicit relationship in between

        husband of deceased with his Bhaujai. It has further been submitted

        that for such act appellant cannot be held guilty because of absence of

        evidence to the effect that appellant had abettedthereof.

</p><p id="p_15">                          11. On the other hand, the learned Additional P.P. while

        supporting the finding arrived at by the learned Trial Court submitted

        that the judgment of conviction and sentence recorded by the learned

        Trial Court needs no interference because of the fact that the death of

        deceased at her Sasural is found duly proved. Whether death was in

        normal or otherwise than normal, for that appellant should have taken

        precaution by producing cogent and reliable evidence in the

        background of the fact that the prosecution had proved presence of

        deceased at her Sasural at the time of her death as well as before her

        death, she was subjected to torture for fulfillment of demand of

        dowry. It has also been submitted that though P.Ws.1 and 2 happens

        to be person of different community but are co-villagers and having

        shown their involvement during course of Panchayati which was

        convened at the instant of P.W.3, the informant, on account of

        torturing the deceased for procurement of dowry. So, submitted that

        all the ingredients so specified attracting <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_11">Section 304B</a> of the IPC is

        found satisfied on account of which the finding so recorded by the
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.496 of 2013 dt.13-02-2014                          7




        learned Trial Court is fit to be confirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                          12. Before coming to scrutinize the evidence available

        on the record, the basic feature of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_12">Section 304B</a> of the IPC is to be

        taken note of. <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_13">Section 304B</a> of the IPC is applicable only when there

        happens to be death of a woman within seven years of her marriage in

        otherwise than normal circumstance and before her death, there was

        demand of dowry as well as                   she was subjected to torture for

        fulfillment of demand of dowry soon before her death. The dowry is

        found properly identifiable in terms of <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_14">Section 2</a> of the Dowry

        Prohibition Act and the crux thereof happens to be any demand so

        made in connection with marriage at the time or after marriage. The

        basic ingredients, in case as referred above is found fulfilled then in

        that event, the presumption in terms of <a href="/doc/462524/" id="a_15">Section 113(B)</a> of the

        Evidence Act will come into play subject to rebut. Therefore, first of

        all prosecution has to satisfy by cogent and reliable evidence relating

        to the ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_16">Section 304B</a> of the IPC and then thereafter in

        terms of <a href="/doc/462524/" id="a_17">Section 113(B)</a> of the Evidence Act, the court will presume

        such event unless and until rebutted by the defence. The Hon'ble

        Apex Court in <a href="/doc/73642903/" id="a_18">Kashmir Kaur and Anr. V. State of Punjab</a> reported in

        2013 Cr.L.J. 689 has thoroughly examined the ambit, scope

        applicability of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_19">Section 304B</a> and explained the same in following

        way under paras-9,10,11,12,13,14,15 and 16.

                these appeals, we feel it appropriate to state the requirement of

                relevant where <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_37">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_38">Section
                304-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_39">IPC</a> are pressed into service. The prosecution is obliged
                to show that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or
                harassment and only in that case presumption operates.
                Evidence in that regard has to be led in by the prosecution.
                ―Soon before‖ is a relative term and it would depend upon the
                circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula can be
                laid down as to what would constitute a period of soon before
                the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed
                period, and that brings in the importance of a proximity test
                both for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for
                raising a presumption under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_40">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act.

                present with the idea of proximity test. No definite period has
                been indicated and the expression ―soon before‖ is not defined.
                A reference to the expression ―soon before‖ used in Section 114
                Illustration (a) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_44">Evidence Act</a> is relevant. It lays down that
                a court may presume that a man who is in the possession of
                goods soon after the theft, is either the thief who has received
                the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for
                his possession. The determination of the period which can come
                within the term ―soon before‖ is left to be determined by the
                courts, depending upon facts and circumstances of each case.
                Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression ―soon before‖
                would normally imply that the interval should not be much
                between the cruelty or harassment concerned and the death in
                question. There must be existence of a proximate and life link
                between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the
                death concerned. If the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in
                time and has become stale enough not to disturb the mental
                equilibrium of the woman concerned, it would be of no
                consequence.‖

                used in the section is ―soon before her death‖. In our view, the
                expression ―soon before her death‖ cannot be given a restricted
                or a narrower meaning. They must be understood in their plain
                language and with reference to their meaning in common
                parlance. These are the provisions relating to human behaviour
                and, therefore, cannot be given such a narrower meaning,
                which would defeat the very purpose of the provisions of the
                Act. Of course, these are penal provisions and must
                receive      strict construction. But, even the rule of strict
                construction requires that the provisions have to be read in
                conjunction with other relevant provisions and scheme of the
                Act. Further, the interpretation given should be one which
                would avoid absurd results on the one hand and would further
                the object and cause of the law so enacted on the other.
</p><p id="p_36">                                20. We are of the considered view that the
                concept of reasonable time is the best criteria to be applied for
                appreciation and examination of such cases. This Court in
                <a href="/doc/409054/" id="a_52">Tarsem Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, held that the legislative
                object in providing such a radius of time by employing the
                words ―soon before her death‖ is to emphasise the idea that
                her death should, in all probabilities, has been the aftermath of
                such cruelty or harassment. In other words, there should be a
                reasonable, if not direct, nexus between her death and the
                dowry-related cruelty or harassment inflicted on her.
</p><p id="p_37">                                21. Similar view was expressed by this Court in
                <a href="/doc/280401/" id="a_53">Yashoda v. State of M.P</a>., where this Court stated that
                determination of the period would depend on the facts and
                circumstances of a given case. However, the expression
                would normally imply that there has to be reasonable time gap
                between the cruelty inflicted and the death in question. If this
                is so, the legislature in its wisdom would have specified any
                period which would attract the provisions of this section.
                However, there must be existence of proximate link between
                the acts of cruelty along with the demand of dowry and the
                death of the victim. For want of any specific period, the
                concept of reasonable period would be applicable. Thus, the
                cruelty, harassment and demand of dowry should not be so
                ancient, whereafter, the couple and the family members have
                lived happily and that it would result in abuse of the said
                protection. Such demand or harassment may not strictly and
                squarely fall within the scope of these provisions unless
                definite evidence was led to show to the contrary. These
                matters, of course, will have to be examined on the facts and
                circumstances of a given case.

                Constitution of India as well as has a presumption of innocence
                in his favour. In other words, the rule of law requires a person
                to be innocent till proved guilty. The concept of deeming
                fiction is hardly applicable to the criminal jurisprudence. In
                contradistinction to this aspect, the legislature has applied the

                Where other ingredients of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_56">Section 304-B</a> are satisfied, in that

        being confronted on this very score that Munni Devi died of natural

        with the conduct of the parties which could be traced out from their

        congenial atmosphere after Panchayati. Then thereafter only

        suggestion happens to be that the death of Munni Devi was a natural

        event wherein her father had participated. Subsequently, this case has

        falsely been filed to squeeze money.

<p id="p_58">                          16.     P.W.2 is Ram Bhajan Sahni. He had stated that

        deceased Munni Devi, daughter of Dhanai Sah co-villager was

        married with Mukesh Sash, son of Sakal Sah of village Pachnaur

        whereupon Munni Devi had gone to her Sasural. Then had stated that

        the occurrence is about two years ago. There was illicit relationship in

        between        Mukesh Sah and Sushila Devi who happens to be his

        Bhaujai and for that Munni Devi used to protest. He had further stated

        that Mukesh Sah, Sushila Devi, Sakal Sah, Raj Kumar Sah, Ram

        Ekbal Sah were demanding dowry. They have demanded television,

        bicycle and for that they tortured and then they driven out Munni

        Devi. Then thereafter they have convened a Panchayati. During

        course of Panchayati, Dhanai Sah had paid Rs.10,000/- as well as

        ‗payal' weighing five bher and thereafter Bidai was effected. Mukesh

        Sah taken away Munni Devi to his house where she was again

        subjected to torture. After coming to know about the same, they have

        gone to Sasural of Munni Devi and tried to pacify               the matter.

        Thereafter Sushila Devi, Mukesh Sah, Ram Ekbal Sah, Raj Kumar

        Sah along with 2-3 accused persons committed murder of Munni Devi

        and had burnt the dead body. He had further disclosed that Munni

        Devi was married about one and half years ago from the date of

        occurrence. He had identified the accused persons. During cross-

        examination at para-10, he had stated that after Bidai of daughter of

        Dhanai Sah he had gone to her Sasural along with Dhanai Sah for

        getting the matter sorted out on account of assault of daughter of

        Dhanai Sah. Hira Lal Sah, Bachu Sah, Ramchandra Sahani and Mantu

        Sah have also gone along with there. In para-11, he had categorically

        stated that there was no documentation of Panchayati. They have

        returned back. Thereafter he had got an occasion to talk with Munni

        Devi at her Maika. At that very time, Nagendra Singh, Ramu Sahni,

        Bachhu Sahani, Ramchandra Sahni, Hira Lal Sah and others were

        present. In para-13, he had further disclosed that they have informed

        the police regarding the occurrence of assault but he is unable to

        disclose the date, time and year. In para-14, he has further disclosed

        that the marriage was solemnized in congenial manner. Then had

        denied the suggestion that Munni Devi died on account of an ailment

        whereupon Naiherwala was informed. Again from the evidence of

        this P.W., it is apparent that he has also not been cross-examined on

        the point of demand, torture, as well as Panchayati.

</p><p id="p_59">                          17.    P.W.3 is Mantoran Devi, the mother of deceased.

        She had stated that Munni Devi was her daughter. Her marriage was
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.496 of 2013 dt.13-02-2014                 18




        solemnized with Mukesh Sah of village-Pachnaur. Her daughter

        Munni Devi had gone to her Sasural after marriage where she was

        subjected to torture and cruelty. She was taken back to her place

        where she disclosed that her Sasuralwala is demanding television and

        bicycle and further disclosed that in case, the aforesaid items is not

        given, then she will be killed. She had further disclosed that Sushila

        Devi, Rajkumar Sah, Mukesh Sah, Sakal Sah and Satan Sah were

        involved in demand as well as torturing her. She had further disclosed

        that Mukesh Sah was continuing with illicit relationship with Sushila

        Devi. He was not giving a single farthing to her. He was not

        respecting her. Always beat her. Accordingly, a Panchayati was

        convened, participated by Mukesh Sah, Sakal Sah and Hira Lal Sah,

        Ram Chandra Sahani, Bachhu Sah and others were from her side

        wherein they have demanded Rs.1,000/- as well as silver five bhers

        which she had handed over and then thereafter Mukesh Sah and Sakal

        Sah get Munni Devi on Bidai to her Sasural. Again they began to

        torture her and lastly murdered her and disposed of her dead body

        stealthily. One fishermen who had gone to sell fish had informed

        regarding the aforesaid misfortune over which she along with 4-5

        persons have gone to Pachnaur where the dead body of her daughter

        was under fire. Police also came. After closing their house, they have

        made on escape therefrom. Thereafter, she had filed written report
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.496 of 2013 dt.13-02-2014                  19




        before the O.C. Belsand. She had further stated that as she failed to

        fulfill demand of dowry by providing television and bicycle, her

        daughter was murdered by Sushila Devi, Sakal Sah, Ramkumar Sah,

        Satan Sah and others. During cross-examination at para-7, she had

        specifically disclosed that Sakal Sah had demanded dowry. She had

        further disclosed that she paid Rs.1,000/- and silver weighing five

        bhers as per terms of Panchayati. She had not gone to Pachnaur

        thereafter. Her daughter did not return to her place after her Bidai

        which was effected after Panchayati. After Bidagari there was no

        hitch amongst the two families. At para-8, she had stated that it was

        very difficult to carry a patient from the locality because of presence

        of two rivers. Some times people of Belsand die for want of treatment.

        In para-9, she had stated that she had not received any information

        from her Samdhiyana regarding death of her daughter. When

        fisherman had informed then they rushed to Pachnaur. At that very

        time, dead body was under fire. Police was present. At that very time

        all the members of her Sasuralwala were absconding. Darogajee had

        called them. Darogajee took her LTI over a paper. At that very time,

        Bachhu Sah, Nagendra Singh, Ramchandra Sahani, her co-villager

        were present, she had also gone to police station where her statement

        was recorded. Then she died the suggestion that her daughter had died

        due to ailment.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                 ―..........The real question for determination is
                   not as to what is the effect of non-examination of certain
                   witnesses as the question whether the witnesses examined in
                   Court on sworn testimony should be believed or not. Once the
                   witnesses examined by the prosecution are believed by the
                   Court and the Court comes to the conclusion that their
                   evidence is trust-worthy, the non-examination of other
                   witnesses will not affect the credibility of these witnesses. We
                   would, however, like to indicate that it is not at all necessary
                   in law to incorporate the statements of the witnesses in the
                   inquest report. The inquest report is to be made by the
                   investigating officer just to indicate the injuries which he has
                   found on the bodies of the deceased persons. It may be
                   witnessed by one or two persons but it is not at all necessary
                   for the Investigating Officer to record the statements of the
                   witnesses or to get the statements of witnesses signed on the
                   inquest report and incorporate the same in it which introduces
                   an element of chaos and confusion and demanding an
                   explanation from the prosecution regarding the statements

                  made therein. For these reasons, therefore, we are unable to
                  hold that merely because Roop Singh and Sardara Singh have
                  not been examined, the prosecution case is not proved. We
                  might mention that it is not necessary for the prosecution to
                  multiply witnesses after witnesses on the same point. In the
                  instant case, once the evidence of the eye witnesses is
                  believed, there is an end of the matter.‖

                   wishes to raise any doubt as regards the correctness of the
                   statement of a witness, the said witness must be given an

                     enlarged by <a href="/doc/130551/" id="a_74">Section 146</a> of the Evidence Act, which permits
                     a witness to be questioned, inter alia, in order to test his
                     veracity. Thereafter, the unchallenged part of his evidence
                     is to be relied upon, for the reason that it is impossible for
                     the witness to explain or elaborate upon any doubts as
                     regards the same, in the absence of questions put to him
                     with respect to the circumstances which indicate that the
                     version of events provided by him, is not fit to be believed,
                     and the witness himself, is unworthy of credit. Thus, if a

                     adequate opportunity to the witness in the witness box, to
                     give a full and proper explanation. The same is essential to

        at her Sasural and was driven away as well followed with Panchayati

        and then again Bidai, torture soon before death and which found to be

        last visit is conclusively proved. It is surprising that those parts of

        evidence has not been challenged by the defence during course of

        cross-examination. Hence, those parts remained unshaken. Apart from

        this, it is also found proved regarding death of deceased at her Sasural

        within seven years of marriage. Having tortured before occurrence

        relating to demand of dowry followed with death, though cause did

        not find ascertained as dead body was not recovered within seven

        years of marriage satisfy the ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_76">Section 304B</a> of the IPC

<p id="p_71">                          27. Another question of consideration is with regard to

        impact over non-examination of I/O. It is evident from the testimony

        of P.W.1, P.W.2, P.W.3 that there happens to be complete absence of

        contradiction. Furthermore, they were not all challenged/cross-

        examined over their presence at P.O. P.O. also not been challenged.

        Apart from the fact that appellant also failed to controvert the

        sequence of death of deceased as well as disposing of the dead body.

</p><p id="p_72">                          28.       Presence of police at the time of arrival of

        witnesses at the place where dead body was burning, as stated by

        P.W.3 has been highlighted with a further plea that due to non-

        examination of I/O, their plea of innocence has been clogged.
          Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.496 of 2013 dt.13-02-2014                               25




</p><p id="p_73">                                   29. Answer is available from the record itself. P.W.4,

                 the part I/O has not been cross-examined on this score. Departure of

                 police away from police station always precedes with entry in station

                 diary. Had there been, the case diary must have such endorsement

                 which could have very well brought up on record as it happens to be a

                 factual theme based upon document having no concern with the

                 presence/absence of main I.O. Leaving the P.W.4 on this score is an

                 indication of absence and the evidence of P.W.3, a rustic lady coming

                 from lower strata of society on this score, appear to be by fluke.

</p><p id="p_74">                                   30. Last leg of argument made on behalf of appellant is

                 also not appreciable because of consistent credible evidence of P.Ws.

                 on the material fact. Furthermore, during discharge of obligation in

                 terms of <a href="/doc/462524/" id="a_80">Section 113(B)</a>, it has not been flashed with due

                 impulsiveness.

                 hence is dismissed. Appellant is under custody, hence will serve out

                 the remaining part of the sentence.
