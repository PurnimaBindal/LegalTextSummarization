1.          This order will dispose of a bunch of petitions bearing CWP

Nos. 1056, 1057, 1209, 1983, 2335 and 21544 of 2016.

2.          The dispute pertains to inter-se seniority of members of the

Punjab Superior Judicial Service. The impugned            seniority list was

circulated on 24.12.2015 (Annexure P-1).

            Arguments of the petitioners

            CWP No. 1056 of 2016

3.          Mr. D. S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel for the petitioners

submitted that the petitioners herein were appointed against the posts meant

for direct recruitment quota. Advertisement for recruitment was issued on

2.2.2008. Written test was held on 18.5.2008. After interviews, the

petitioners were found to be meritorious. The Selection Committee in its

meeting held on 25.7.2008 approved their names            for appointment as

Additional District &amp; Sessions Judges in the State of Punjab. It was

followed by letter of recommendation dated 29.7.2008 from the Registrar

General of this Court to the State. On 28.11.2008, appointment letters were

issued to the petitioners. After medical examination, the petitioners were

issued posting orders on 8.12.2008.

4.          Respondents No. 3 to 15 were regularly promoted on the basis

of their seniority. They were appointed on promotion on 18.2.2008 and

joined as such on 23.2.2008.



5.          Respondents No. 16 and 17 are the officers, who were earlier

working in Fast Track Courts and have been selected in the same

competitive examination in which the petitioners appeared and were

appointed vide letter dated 20.6.2008 against the vacancies meant for direct

recruitment quota. They joined at their place of posting on 28.7.2008.

6.          Respondents No. 18 to 25 are the officers, who were promoted

in terms of Rule 7(3)(b) of the Punjab Superior Judicial Service Rules, 2007

(hereinafter described as 'the 2007 Punjab Rules') by way of a limited

departmental competitive examination. Their names were recommended by

the High Court to the State        along with the petitioners on 29.7.2008,

however, they managed to get their names cleared and were issued

appointment letters on 11.8.2008 and were posted on 22.10.2008. In the

meeting of the Recruitment/Promotion Committee (Superior Judicial

Services) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Committee') held on 15.9.2014, it

was decided to circulate tentative seniority list of the officers of the

Superior Judicial Service, Punjab for inviting objections. Needful was done

as the tentative seniority list was circulated to all the officers vide letter

dated 25.9.2014 by the Registrar Vigilance of this Court, to which various

objections were filed. After hearing, the Committee vide its report dated

11.8.2015 opined that the objections were not sustainable, hence, it was

recommended that the tentative seniority list already circulated does not

require any alteration or modification and the same be finalised as such. The

objections filed by the petitioners and other officers were rejected. The

aforesaid report of the Committee was circulated, on which one of the

Hon'ble Judge of this Court offered his comments on 16.9.2015, in terms of

which the matter required re-consideration. Thereafter, the matter was put

up in the Full Court meeting held on 22.12.2015. The report of the

Committee was accepted, and the final seniority list was circulated, which

has been impugned in the present petitions.

7.          Learned senior counsel for the petitioners further submitted that

the service is governed by the 2007 Punjab Rules, which were notified on

3.9.2007. The service of the Haryana Superior Judicial Service is governed

by the Haryana Superior Judicial Service Rules, 2007 (hereinafter described

as 'the 2007 Haryana Rules'), which were notified on 10.1.2007. Rule 2 of

the 2007 Punjab Rules provides for definitions, whereas Rule 7 provides

for method of appointment with three sources, namely, by promotion from

amongst the Civil Judges (Senior Division) on the basis of merit-cum-

seniority and passing of a suitability test (50% quota); by promotion on the

basis of merit through limited departmental competitive examination for

which Civil Judges (Senior Division) having not less than five years service

as Civil Judge (Senior Division) are eligible (25% quota) and 25% of the

posts can be filled up by way of direct recruitment from amongst the

eligible candidates on the basis of written test and viva-voce. The posts are

to be filled up in accordance with roster attached as Appendix-B. Rule 12

of the 2007 Punjab Rules deals with seniority. Rule 23 thereof provides that

in respect of the matters, which are not specifically provided in the Rules,

members of the service shall be governed by Punjab Civil Services (General

and Common Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994 (hereinafter described as

'the 1994 Punjab Rules'). Rule 8 thereof provides that inter-se seniority of

the persons appointed to a post shall be determined by continuous length of

service on such post in the cadre. Note thereto provides that seniority of

persons appointed on purely provisional basis or on ad hoc basis shall be

determined as and when they are regularly appointed keeping in view of the

dates of such regular appointment. The officers promoted on the basis of

seniority under Rule 7(3)(a) of the 2007 Punjab Rules were in excess of

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                        [6]

their quota, hence, for the purpose of seniority, they cannot be treated to be

members of the service. Rule 20 of the 1994 Punjab Rules gives these rules

over-riding effect.

8.           Referring to the roster, he submitted that prior to the 2007

Punjab Rules,     members of the service were governed by the Punjab

Superior Judicial Service Rules, 1963 (hereinafter described as 'the 1963

Punjab Rules'). Rule 8 therein provided for recruitment to service. 75% of

the posts could be filled by way of promotion, whereas 25% by way of

direct recruitment. The promotion was on the basis of seniority. Shetty

Commission appointed to go into the working conditions of the Judicial

Officers made certain recommendations on 11.11.1999, which were

considered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1245776/" id="a_1">All India Judges Association v.

Union of India</a>, (2002) 4 SCC 247 [hereinafter described as 'All India

Judges Association 3rd case]. To encourage efficient officers, amendment

in the service rules governing the post was directed. 50% of the posts were

now to be filled up by way of promotion from amongst the Civil Judges

(Senior Division) on the basis of merit-cum-seniority and passing of a

suitability test, 25% by promotion on the basis of merit through limited

departmental competitive examination for which            Civil Judges (Senior

Division) having not less than 5 years of service are eligible and 25% were

to be filled up by way of direct recruitment. The High Courts were directed

to frame appropriate rules in terms of the directions of Hon'ble the Supreme

Court. It was further directed that to avoid litigation with reference to

seniority, roster as specified be provided.        Though the judgment was

delivered on 21.3.2002, the amendment in the 1963 Punjab Rules, with

reference to quota for recruitment, was made only on 15.1.2004. The matter


                              6 of 148
            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:12 :::
 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                      [7]

regarding inter-se seniority was not taken care of. Thereafter the 2007

Punjab Rules were framed, which were notified on 3.9.2007 providing for

three sources of recruitment to the post strictly in terms of the directions

issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court.

9.          It was further contended that as some of the States were facing

difficulty in filling up 25% posts to be filled up        by holding limited

departmental competitive examination, Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1977799/" id="a_2">All

India Judges Association &amp; Ors. v. Union of India and others</a>, (2010) 15

SCC 170 [hereinafter described as 'All India Judges Association 4th case']

opined that quota be reduced from 25% to 10%. The High Courts were

directed to take steps to amend the rules in terms of the directions. It was

further directed that if the rules are not amended suitably, the order shall

prevail w.e.f. 1.1.2011 and further recruitments shall be made strictly as

per the directions by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. In pursuance of the

directions, required amendment was made in the 2007 Haryana Rules on

6.6.2012, whereas the 2007 Punjab Rules were amended on 29.4.2013.

10.         As regards the factual position, which according to learned

counsel for the petitioners is not in dispute, the cadre strength as on

3.9.2007, when the 2007 Punjab Rules were notified, was 89, which

increased to 107 on 10.11.2007. As per the quota fixed for three different

sources of recruitment, 53 posts will go to the regular promotion quota

against which 58 officers were already in position as on 10.11.2007. 15

officers were recommended to be promoted on 29.11.2007, who had joined

on 19.2.2008. It was submitted that admittedly in the quota meant for

promotion on the basis of merit-cum-seniority, five persons were already

working in excess, hence, no further post could be given to the officers


                              7 of 148
            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:12 :::
 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                      [8]

coming from that quota and the vacant posts of other quota were to be filled.

They could be given placement in the seniority list only after a post in their

quota becomes available. Even if the seniority is to be determined on the

basis of continuous length of service, still the quota is relevant as any

person appointed/promoted beyond his quota is not to be treated as a

member of service. Unless a person is member of service, he cannot claim

seniority. In fact, the Committee has also noticed this legal position and

recorded a finding in para (3)(i) specifically stating that if promotions have

been made in excess to the prescribed quota, the promotees who are in

excess to the quota are liable to be pushed down to a date when vacancy

within their quota becomes available. In support of this plea, reliance was

placed upon <a href="/doc/765456/" id="a_3">Keshav Chandra Joshi and others v. Union of India and others</a>,

AIR 1992 SC 284; <a href="/doc/1375346/" id="a_4">A. N. Sehgal v. Raja Ram Sheoran</a>, (1992) (Suppl) SCC

304; C. K. Antony etc. v. B. Muraleedharan, (1998) 6 SCC 630 and Ashok

Pal Singh and others v. U. P. Judicial Services Association and others,

(2010) 12 SCC 635.

11.         Learned counsel, while referring to the judgment of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court in All India Judges Association 3rd case (supra), submitted

that though the judgment was delivered on 21.3.2002 and immediately the

rules were to be       amended, however, the needful was not done. The

judgment clearly provided that to avoid even litigation with reference to

seniority, the roster be prepared. Though in the 2007 Haryana Rules, which

were notified prior to the 2007 Punjab Rules, Rule 10 clearly provide

manner to determine inter-se seniority of the members of service coming

from three different sources of recruitment. In the 2007 Punjab Rules, this

word is missing in roster, however, the roster is same, as has been provided


                              8 of 148
            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:12 :::
 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                       [9]

for recruitment purpose. It is in line with judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme

Court.

12.          He further argued that in the 2007 Haryana Rules, seniority has

been de-linked from continuous length of service and is applicable only

from the roster point. It further clarifies that if in any cadre any person is

beyond quota, then it is treated as ad-hoc. He cannot claim seniority till

roster point for that source is available.

13.          Referring to the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All

India Judges Association 3rd case (supra) and the 2007 Punjab Rules, it was

argued that regular promotion for which 50% posts were ear-marked clearly

provided that it has to be on the basis of merit-cum-seniority and passing of

a suitability test, however no suitability test was held. It was submitted that

such a test was prescribed by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges

Association 3rd case (supra), which was made part of the 1963 Punjab

Rules, vide amendment dated 15.1.2004 and is part of the 2007 Punjab

Rules. Admittedly, respondents No. 3 to 15 had not passed the suitability

test. The Committee observed that only their ACRs were seen, as the

Selection Committee at that time understood that no test was to be held. The

High Court interpreted the rules in that manner. Even the recommendations

made to the Governor were accepted. Even after the promotions in question

and for subsequent promotions also, no suitability test was held. The

submission is that once the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

provides for passing of a suitability test for regular promotion, which is

even part of the 2007 Punjab Rules, administrative instructions or decisions

cannot over-ride the same.          In fact, this issue has been considered

appropriately by one Hon'ble Judge of this court in his comments in the


                               9 of 148
            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:12 :::
 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                        [10]

report of the Committee. On the issue that any practice or administrative

instructions, which run contrary to the rules are bad, reliance was placed

upon in <a href="/doc/221651/" id="a_5">K.Kuppusamy and another v. State of T. N. and ors</a>., (1998) 8 SCC

469 and <a href="/doc/1021541/" id="a_6">Yogesh Kumar and Ors. v. Government of NTC Delhi and Ors</a>.,

(2003) 3 SCC 548.      The respondents promoted under Rule 7(3)(a) of the

2007 Punjab Rules by not passing the suitability test, their promotion cannot

be termed as regular. They have no right to the post. They have to be pushed

down. They are to be considered as members of the cadre only after they

pass the suitability test. The mere fact that the High Court had not

conducted any test will not endure to the benefit of this category as the rules

have to be adhered to strictly.

14.          Learned counsel further submitted that the view expressed by

the Committee in shifting unfilled posts from             limited departmental

competitive examination quota to regular promotion quota is erroneous as

the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges Association

4th case (supra) was not appreciated properly. There was a cut-off date,

namely, 1.1.2011 as provided for in the judgment itself. Shifting of the

unfilled vacancies was permissible only from that date. The judgment was

delivered on 20.4.2010. In the present case, the selections pertain to the year

2008, much prior to the date of judgment and the cut-off date provided in

All India Judges Association 4th case (supra). Paragraph of the judgment in

which the cut-off date was provided missed attention of the Committee.

Merely because the seniority is being finalised now will not mean that the

later judgment can be applied from a back date.           On a date when the

promotions were made under Rule 7(3)(a), the posts from Rule 7(3)(b) of

the 2007 Punjab Rules could not be shifted.

15.         With reference to the promotion of the officers through limited

departmental competitive examination, it was submitted that in the case of

direct recruits, advertisement was issued on 2.2.2008. For limited

departmental competitive examination, circular was issued on 23.4.2008.

Written test was held on the same day. The recommendations were made by

this court to the State for appointment on the same day. It is because in the

case of direct recruits, more formalities are to be completed and promoted

officers were able to pursue their case more effectively that they were issued

appointment letters earlier. It was delayed in the case of the petitioners. The

submission is that the date on which recommendations were made by this

court for appointment should be considered as the relevant date for the

purpose of determination of seniority. In support, reliance was placed upon

the instructions issued by the State on 15.3.1962 (Annexure P-24).

16.         It was argued that seniority list has to be set aside merely on the

ground that it is based on mis-interpretation of the rules. Rule 23 of the

2007 Punjab Rules clearly provides that the 1994 Punjab Rules shall not

affect Rules 7 and 12. Rule 12 provides for seniority, hence, to invoke the

1994 Punjab Rules for determination of seniority is totally illegal.

Otherwise also, the 1994 Punjab Rules are general in nature, whereas the

2007 Punjab Rules are specific to the service, hence, being special will have

precedence over the general rule. Even if there is nothing in the 2007

Punjab Rules regarding seniority, still Rule 23 of the 2007 Punjab Rules

specifically excludes application of the 1994 Punjab Rules for that purpose.

In that situation, the dictum of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India

Judges Association 3rd case (supra) has to be read, in terms of which the

rules were required to be framed. In support of the plea that special will

over-ride the general, reliance was placed upon <a href="/doc/1226081/" id="a_7">J. K. Cotton Spinning and

Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U. P. and others</a>, (1986) 4 SCC 90 and

<a href="/doc/86255537/" id="a_8">Commercial Tax Officer, Rajasthan v. M/s Binani Cements Ltd. and

another</a>, (2014) 8 SCC 319. If the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court is

not followed, that would mean committing contempt.

            CWP No. 2335 of 2016

17.         Mr. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners

(in CWP No. 2335 of 2016) promoted              through limited departmental

competitive examination, while adopting the arguments raised by Mr. D. S.

Patwalia, senior counsel, submitted that ever since the judgment was

delivered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges Association 3rd

case (supra), amendment of the 1963 Punjab Rules or framing of the 2007

Punjab Rules, no written test was conducted for promotion through limited

departmental competitive examination. First test was conducted on

18.5.2008. The principle of continuous length of service has rightly been

applied. The judgment in All India Judges Association 3rd case (supra) was

delivered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court on 21.3.2002 and there are reasons

assigned as to why the roster was not             framed for the purpose of

determination of inter-se seniority of the officers coming from three

different sources.     In fact, third source, i.e., promotion through limited

departmental competitive examination, was created in terms of the

directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court.



18.         The judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court are binding. It

was a mandate, hence, have to be read along with the rules. He further

submitted that in the 2007 Punjab Rules, which replaced the 1963 Punjab

Rules, word 'recruitment' has been used but that would take in its fold even

the roster for determination of inter-se seniority, as the roster provided for

recruitment, in fact, provides as to which of the post should be filled in

from which quota. He further submitted that Rule 23 of the 2007 Punjab

Rules firstly provides that the 1994 Punjab Rules will be applicable on the

issues not dealt within the 2007 Punjab Rules. However, in the proviso to

that rule, it is provided that the 1994 Punjab Rules will not have any affect

on Rules 7 and 12 of the 2007 Punjab Rules. Meaning thereby the rule-

making authority was conscious of the fact that even if there is nothing

specifically provided in the 2007 Punjab Rules regarding determination of

inter-se seniority of the officers coming from three different sources, still

application of the 1994 Punjab Rules on that issue was excluded, as the

issue regarding inter-se seniority has to be dealt with in terms of the

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges Association 3rd

case (supra).

19.         Learned counsel further referred to second proviso to Rule 23

of the 2007 Punjab Rules, which provides that condition of service, as

provided by National Judicial Pay Commission (hereinafter referred to as

'Shetty Commission'), will have over-riding effect. He further referred to

communication dated 21.7.2006 from this court to the State of Punjab while

sending the rules for notification, in which it was clearly mentioned that the

rules have been framed as per judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in

All India Judges Association 3rd case (supra) and the recommendations of

the Shetty Commission. It also establishes the fact that the rule-making

authority was conscious of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court. Seniority is a condition of service. The Committee in its report had

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                      [14]

wrongly rejected the argument that seniority is to be read into the roster.

Even Hon'ble the Supreme Court directed for preparing a roster for the

purpose of inter-se seniority.

20.         He further submitted that direct recruits cannot be placed above

the officers promoted by         way of limited departmental competitive

examination, as they were appointed and had joined service later in time.

When the petitioners herein were promoted, the posts meant for their quota

were also available.

            CWP No.21544 of 2016

21.         Mr. Anupam Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing for the

officers, who were promoted through         limited departmental competitive

examination, sought to raise two issues. He defended the report of the

Committee placing the direct recruits below the officers promoted through

limited departmental competitive examination, however, he challenged

placement of regular promotees above the officers promoted through limited

departmental competitive examination.

22.         Elaborating the arguments, Mr. Gupta, learned senior counsel,

submitted that in the 2007 Punjab Rules, there are three sources of

recruitment, direct recruitment, regular promotion and promotion by way of

limited departmental competitive examination. Regular promotions are

made in terms of Rule 7(3)(a) of the 2007 Punjab Rules. As regular

promotions have been made in violation of the rules, the officers concerned

have no right to usurp the posts meant for other quota, however, their

appointment is not under challenge. In any case, they have to be placed at

the bottom of seniority. As there is fundamental defect in their appointment,

the benenfit of seniority is not admissible to them. They were otherwise

also beyond the quota meant for them, hence, to that extent their promotion

cannot be treated as regular.

23.         He fairly submitted that to the extent that the Committee had

given hearing to all the concerned officers, he has no grievance. Only the

legality of the report is under challenge. This court is bound by the law laid

down by Hon'ble the Supreme Court, but here the same has been violated.

There are certain fundamental defects in the report. Competence of the

members of the service is not being disputed. Judicial Service is an

important service considering the fact that it is one of the very few services,

which finds mention in the Constitution itself. Its history relates back to

even Government of India Act, 1935 (for short, 'the 1935 Act'). The

provisions were made in the 1935 Act as well as the Constitution of India

with regard to the judicial service with paramount object to maintain its

independence, which is the basic structure of the Constitution of India.

Sections 253 to 255 were relevant sections in the 1935 Act, which now are

Articles 233 to 235 in the Constitution of India. The only change made in

the Constitution of India with reference to the provisions contained in the

1935 Act is that now consultation with the High Court is required. Earlier,

opinion of the Governor was final.

24.         Raising general issue regarding the 2007 Punjab Rules, though

may not be directly relevant with the issues raised in the writ petition, he

submitted that Appendix 'B', attached to the said Rules, for both major and

minor punishments, appellate authority is the Governor. If independence of

judiciary is to be considered, the Governor cannot be the appellate authority

over and above the Full Court of the High Court. Appointment of any

Judicial Officer is issued in the name of the Governor and so is the order of

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                       [16]

removal. No non-judicial authority can be an appellate authority above the

High Court in Judicial Officers' matter. It is in breach of first principles of

the Constitution of India. He further submitted that Rule 25 of the 2007

Punjab Rules provides that if any question arises as to the interpretation of

the Rules, the Government in consultation with the High Court shall decide

the same. This power cannot be delegated to the executive. It should have

been vested with the High Court only. The 1994 Punjab Rules, which have

been adopted for certain issues, not dealt with in the 2007 Punjab Rules, in

terms of Rule 23, provide that any question regarding interpretation of the

1994 Punjab Rules rests with the Government. Meaning thereby this court

had abdicated its power to administer control over the judicial service,

which is impermissible.

25.         He further submitted that Articles 245 and 309 of the

Constitution of India are subject to other provisions of the Constitution or

the law made by the Parliament, whereas Articles 233 to 235 are not subject

to any other provision of the Constitution of India. These Articles deal with

judicial service. Meaning thereby supermacy of judicial system is accepted.

There are similar provisions pertaining to Secretariat of Parliament in

<a href="/doc/817281/" id="a_9">Article 98</a> and pertaining to Secretariat of State Assembly under <a href="/doc/290816/" id="a_10">Article 187</a>

of the Constitution of India. More importance is attached to the cadres,

which are to be dealt with in terms of the constitutional provisions and the

scheme. The executive having failed to take care of the judicial service,

Hon'ble the Supreme Court had to intervene in <a href="/doc/1977799/" id="a_11">All India Judges' Association

v. Union of India and others</a>, (1992) 1 SCC 119 [hereinafter described as

'All India Judges' Association 1st case'] and All India Judges' Association 3rd

case (supra) followed by subsequent judgments/orders.

26.         He further submitted that even Rule 16 of the 2007 Punjab

Rules pertaining to reservation of posts is contrary to the law laid down by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/176261373/" id="a_12">State of Bihar and another v. Bal Mukund

Sah and others</a>, (2000) 4 SCC 640. The High Court as such has no rule-

making power, however, it has to be got done through the State. The High

Court is the custodian of subordinate judiciary. In case the High Court does

not control the lower judiciary, it may collapse as a pack of cards. With

regard to independence of judicial system and administrative control of the

High Court, reference was also made to the Constitutional debates.

27.         On the issue raised by the direct recruits that their date of

recommendations by the High Court to the State for appointment should be

treated as the date of their appointment and consequent assignment of

seniority, Mr. Gupta submitted that even if the recommendations made by

the High Court are binding, the date of recommendations cannot be treated

as the date of appointment. The role of executive is not completely ousted.

The power is to be exercised by the executive on the recommendations

made by the High Court, which though are binding on the State, but still it

can always point out if any glaring issue comes before them in the process

of antecedents verification. Any order of appointment or even of

dismissal/removal takes effect only on the date when it is passed in the

name of the Governor, as the power of appointment vests in the Governor,

which is to be exercised in consultation with the High Court. In support of

the plea, reference was made to <a href="/doc/434606/" id="a_13">State of Assam and another v. Kuseswar

Association and another v. Union of India</a>, (2016) 5 SCC 1 [hereinafter

described as Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association's 2nd case].

Departure from this rule, which is envisaged in the constitutional scheme,

regarding appointment by the Governor in consultation with the High Court,

will be in violation thereof. Direct recruits, being not members of the

service, as compared to the candidates who are to be promoted, some period

is required between recommendation and actual appointment for the reason

that their character verification is required, which is quite important. The

importance thereof was recognised by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/201797/" id="a_20">Union

of India and others v. Kalidass Batish and another</a>, (2006) 1 SCC 779 and

<a href="/doc/192680728/" id="a_21">K. Vijaya Lakshmi v. State of Andhra Pradesh and another</a>, (2013) 5 SCC

489.

28.          He further referred to the minutes of the Full Court meeting,

vide which recommendations were made to the State for appointment of the

direct recruits as well as the officers promoted through limited departmental

competitive examination. In the aforesaid minutes, it was specifically

provided that report of character verification of the direct recruits be sent to

the High Court and appointment letters are to be issued only after the same

is accepted by this court, hence, there was no direction for issuing

appointments. Judicial Officers are not members of an ordinary cadre. They

are not strictly Government employees. Their service partakes the character

of sovereignty. They sit in judgment over the decisions by other sections,

hence, the plea that direct recruits should be given seniority from the date of

recommendation made by this Court is totally misconceived, hence,

deserves to be rejected.

29.          Regarding the constitutional scheme with reference to judicial

service and framing of rules, reference was made to judgments of Hon'ble

the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/594363/" id="a_22">B. S. Yadav and others v. State of Haryana and others</a>,

(1980) Supp. SCC 524 and Bal Mukund Sah's case (supra).

30.          Mr. Gupta referred to Entries 77 and 78 in List-I of Seventh

Schedule, Entry 3 in List II and Entry 11A in List III of the Constitution of

India. There was       amendment made in Entry 3 of List II vide 42nd

Constitutional amendment. New Entry 11-A was added in List III. <a href="/doc/647227/" id="a_23">Article

312</a> of the Constitution of India was also amended at the same time

envisaging All India Judicial Service in addition to other All India Services.

Though this amendment was carried out way back in the year 1976,

however, no efforts were made to create All India Judicial Service. He

further submitted that <a href="/doc/647227/" id="a_24">Article 312</a> of the Constitution of India starts with a

non-obstante clause. It has over-riding effect with reference to anything

contained in Chapter VI of Part VI or Part XI, which deal with Articles 233

to 237 of the Constitution of India. All India Judicial Service was coined

keeping in view Pan India approach for judicial system. The

recommendations made by Law Commission in its 14th report were

accepted. Presently, the judicial system is integrated as far as judicial part is

concerned. For administration, all States are independent.

31.          The 2007 Punjab Rules were framed by the Governor in

exercise of the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_25">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of

India, which provides for recruitment and conditions of service. These were

framed in consultation with the High Court.

32.         With reference to the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra), it was submitted that the

directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court are binding on all

concerned under Articles 141 and 144 of the Constitution of India. Hon'ble

the Supreme Court had to intervene as the executive failed to discharge its

duty. Any violation of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court

can either be directly by acting in defiance or by omission as well, by failing

to comply. Both are serious and may amount to contempt as well. In any

case, it is serious impropriety. In judicial parameters, the lower judiciary is

at the base, whereas Hon'ble the Supreme Court is at the top. The base

cannot ignore any direction by the top. Base has to be made strong. In fact,

the effort of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in taking up the issues of Judicial

Officers pertaining to conditions of their service and even the pay scales

was a step to strengthen the judicial system and keep it independent and

make it strong. When the directions issued by the top are not followed, the

base may become weak and the system may collapse. In any case, the High

Court cannot be expected to plead ignorance or ignore the judgment of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court. He further submitted that this court is one of

the unique court, which controls cadres of two States, namely, Punjab and

Haryana. The judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges

Association 3rd case (supra) was binding on all the States and the High

Courts. There were certain directions issued. Though directions were

complied with as far as the officers of the Haryana State cadre are

concerned but were ignored with reference to Punjab State.

33.         He further submitted that any direction by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court is above the rules. It is law above the law. Whatever has been stated

by Hon'ble the Supreme Court is binding on all concerned and not what is

stated in any Act or Rules with reference to which any direction has been

issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. On interpretation of any law, the

opinion of Hon'ble the Supreme Court is final. If any State or High Court

had any reservation about any direction issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court, there were two options, either to file application on judicial side or

represent on administrative side, otherwise the directions were binding. It

could be pointed out before Hon'ble the Supreme Court if any State or High

Court had experience different than what is sought to be envisaged by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court. It does not matter whether the law was enacted

first and Hon'ble the Supreme Court interpreted it later on or the direction

by Hon'ble the Supreme Court is first and the law is framed later on. The

final word in both the cases is of Hon'ble the Supreme Court. It is the part

of basic structure.

34.          Prayer in the writ petition filed by All India Judges' Association

1st case (supra) before Hon'ble the Supreme Court was for a direction to

constitute All India Judicial Service and for bringing about uniform

conditions of service for the subordinate judiciary throughout the country.

Prior to the amendment of <a href="/doc/647227/" id="a_26">Article 312</a> of the Constitution of India, vide 42nd

constitutional amendment, there was no enabling provision. The matter was

examined by Hon'ble the Supreme Court with its rich experience and certain

directions were given, which included direction to the Union of India to

take steps to constitute All India Judicial Service; increase age of retirement

of Judicial Officers from 58 to 60 years; residential accommodation;

sumptuary allowance; setting up of Judicial Academies, provision of car etc.

As some of the States faced some difficulty in implementing the judgment

raising    pleas of diversity, financial resources and other legal issues

regarding competence, review applications were filed. The matter was

considered threadbare by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1977799/" id="a_27">All India Judges'

Association and others v. Union of India and others</a>, (1993) 4 SCC 288

[hereinafter described as 'All India Judges' Association 2nd case']. Some of

the directions already issued in All India Judges' Association 1st case (supra)

were reiterated, whereas some were modified, besides that certain fresh

directions issued. The sole object of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in doing

that exercise was keeping in mind independence of judicial system. Hon'ble

the Supreme Court and the High Courts clearly know, with rich experience,

the requirement of Judges, with reference to the duty to be discharged and

the appropriate working conditions required. It was an era of judicial

reforms.

35.            He further submitted that while increasing retirement age

from 58 to 60 years, as directed in All India Judges' Association 1st case

(supra), stress was laid on merit. The record of the officer was to be

reviewed and only if the officer is found to be of utility to the judicial

system, he was to be allowed to continue till the age of 60 years. In fact,

this had laid the foundation for merit in the judicial system over and above

seniority only. Appraisal was on actual performance. Finally, Hon'ble the

Supreme Court directed that three years' legal practice be made mandatory

as one of the essential qualification for recruitment to the post of a Judicial

Officer at entry level. Wherever recruitment was made through Public

Service Commission, a representative of the High Court was to be

associated whose advice was to prevail, unless there were strong and cogent

reasons for not accepting it. All concerned were directed to amend

recruitment rules accordingly. Certain other directions were also issued.

36.         The rules are framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_28">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of

India. There is no power vested with the High Court to frame rules. The

Legislature can frame rules under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_29">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India.

37.         He further submitted that the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme

Court is statement of law binding on all concerned. All civil and judicial

authorities are to work in aid of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in terms of

<a href="/doc/1799967/" id="a_30">Article 144</a> of the Constitution of India. Against any law framed by the

State Legislature or the Parliament, there is a remedy of judicial review,

however, in the case in hand, there being direction by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court for framing of rules in a particular manner, even that remedy was not

available to any one. The only passage left open was              of seeking

clarification. If the Government or the executive do not act in terms of the

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court, there is remedy available,

however, High Court should not have slept over the matter or acted

differently than what was specifically directed. What cannot be done

directly cannot be allowed to be done indirectly. In fact, the High Court on

the administrative side has failed to act in aid of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

by violating the judgment. There cannot be any excuse for not complying

with the judgment. If the time granted was to expire, extension could be

sought. It is actionable defiance showing lack of respect to Hon'ble the

Supreme Court.

245 (order dated 10.4.1995) [hereinafter described as 'All India Judges'

Association 5th case'] impressed upon the States to take effective steps to

comply with the directions. The Chief Secretaries of the States concerned

were held responsible to ensure compliance. In a subsequent order dated

29.9.1997, reported as <a href="/doc/1977799/" id="a_32">All India Judges' Assn. and others v. Union of India

and others</a>, (1997) 8 SCC 520 [hereinafter described as 'All India Judges'

Association 6th case'], the State Governments were required to file

comprehensive status reports regarding implementation of the directions

given in All India Judges' Association 2nd case (supra). The Advocates

Generals of all the States were required to be personally present in court on

the next date of hearing. Vide order dated 17.12.1997, reported as <a href="/doc/1789833/" id="a_33">All India

Judges' Assn. and others v. Union of India and others</a>, (1998) 2 SCC 204

[hereinafter described as 'All India Judges' Association 7th case'], noticing

the fact that Government of India agreed to enlarge the terms of reference of

Shetty Commission, to even make interim recommendations, Hon'ble the

Supreme Court sought response on the issue as to whether the matter

regarding conditions of service of the staff of subordinate judiciary can also

be referred to Shetty Commission. This shows the seriousness with which

Hon'ble the Supreme Court was considering the matter as even the staff is

also part of the judicial system. The High Courts were requested to furnish

status reports.

39.          Thereafter, the matter was considered by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra). Earlier condition of

three years' practice for new entrants in a judicial service at the entry level

was dispensed with. It was a remarkable exercise by Hon'ble the Apex

Court. It shows how Hon'ble the Supreme Court dealt with issue pertaining

to judicial officers with its vast practical experience. The fact that after All

India Judges' Association 2nd case (supra), the matter was pursued by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court to ensure compliance shows the seriousness

with which it was being taken. It was a judicial exercise for codification.

Wherever directions were issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court, these were

final and conclusive. There are three sources of laws - first is customary

law; second is legislation and third is judicial precedents. The kind of

codification in the case in hand was judicial legislation. Codification is

essentially the subject of      legislature. Because it had failed to take

appropriate steps, Hon'ble the Supreme Court had to intervene. In the laws

framed by the legislature, the courts only interpret. The interpretation may

come on case to case basis. There are lot of instances where in the areas of

vacuum, Hon'ble the Supreme Court had to intervene. It was codification

with experience; creative and purposeful. It is the best piece. The judgment

should have been followed in letter and spirit. If not complied with, it would

make the judgment redundant.

40.          It was further argued        that in series of judgments/orders

pertaining to working conditions of the subordinate judges, Hon'ble the

Supreme Court exercised its power of judicial review and judicial

interpretation, which was both interpretive and legislative. It was a kind of

judicial legislation. The underlying object is to be seen for which mammoth

exercise was done by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. It was to enure

independence of judiciary by making it more effective and impartial in the

administration of justice. Error as committed by this court on the

administrative side is the failure to implement the judgment in its true spirit.

It is error of law. Constitutional principles have been violated. It is none

else than neglect or breach of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court. For sustaining a large building, foundation has to be made strong.

All the laws or actions of any organs of the State are subject to the basic

structure theory. The exercise carried out by Hon'ble the Supreme Court was

not one sided, namely, to increase        emoluments or the facilities to be

provided to the judges, rather, it was a balancing act, where merit was given

more importance, hence, it was to be taken as a package. Only beneficial

part was not to be adopted. Even the duties enshrined therein were also to

be taken along.

41.          It was further submitted that the promotions made merely on

the basis of seniority, which are in violation of the law laid down by Hon'ble

the Supreme Court, though may be promotion, but were in violation of law.

Giving example of recruitment of the judicial officers at the grass root

level, he submitted that in case three years pre-condition of practice as one

of the eligibility conditions is not adhered to, that would be violation

apparent on the face of it. Same principles are applied by the court while

examining action of the executive or of the judiciary on the administrative

side. This establishes the fact that judiciary is independent.

42.          He further submitted that though this Court administratively

supervises functioning of the officers in two States, but procedure followed

in the State of Haryana was strictly as per the judgment of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court, whereas in the State of Punjab, it was different. If the

suitability test for promotion could be held in the State of Haryana, it cannot

be accepted that the judgment was not properly understood. Same system

should have been followed in the State of Punjab. There is nothing in the

report of the Committee as to why the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme


                              26 of 148
            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:12 :::

Court was not complied with. No reasons have been assigned. In fact, there

could not be any reason as the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court were and are binding.

43.         The plea raised by the promotees that they were not given

chance to appear in limited departmental competitive examination as they

had already been promoted or did not avail of that, is merely to be noticed

and rejected. There is no estoppel against law. Once as per judgment of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court and the 2007 Punjab Rules, examination was

one of the condition for promotion and the merit was to be given priority

over seniority, any action in violation will not confer any right on the

persons taking the benefit thereof.

44.         Mr. Anupam Gupta, learned senior counsel further referred to a

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_34">M. Nagaraj and others v. Union

of India and others</a>, (2006) 8 SCC 212, where validity, interpretation and

implementation of constitutional 77th, 81st, 82nd and 85th amendments were in

question.   He submitted that the constitutional scheme was expounded in

the aforesaid Constitution Bench judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

while stating that it does not embody a set of legal rules, rather, it sets out

principles for an expanding future to endure for ages to come. Part-III of the

Constitution does not confer fundamental rights, rather, it confirms their

existence and gives them protection. A right becomes a fundamental right

because it has foundational value. Fundamental rights are important, as they

possess intrinsic value. The final word on the content of the right is that of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court. There are systematic principles underlying and

connecting the provisions of the Constitution, which give coherence to the

Constitution and make it an organic whole. These principles are part of the


                              27 of 148
            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:12 :::

constitutional law, even if these are not expressly stated in the form of rules.

Some of the principles may be so important and fundamental as to qualify as

"essential features" or part of the "basic structure" of the Constitution,

which are not open to amendment. The basic structure concepts limit the

power of amending the Constitution. Judicial review is an essential feature

of our Constitution. Constitutional adjudication is like no other decision-

making. There is a moral dimension to every major constitutional case and

our Constitution works because of the good sense of Judges when

interpreting it. It is that informed freedom of action of the Judges that helps

to preserve and protect our basic document of governance. Hon'ble the

Supreme Court has already opined that judiciary is part of the basic

structure of the Constitution.

45.          The Judicial Officers working at the entry level go to the

foundation of the judicial system, on which the entire edifice is based. In

exercise of power of judicial review in All India Judges' Association 1st, 2nd,

3rd and 4th cases (supra), certain directions were given, which resulted in

constitutional adjudication or codification. Keeping in view the paramount

object of the judiciary being independent and responsive, separation of

powers and considering the need to insulate it from other forces. Non-

exercise of power is also a kind of arbitrary exercise of power, which has

resulted in arbitrariness    in-action. While not prescribing and holding

suitability test in the case of regular promotion, the High Court on the

administrative side has failed to exercise the power in compliance to the

directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. It had failed to discharge

its constitutional obligation. Even in M. Nagaraj's case (supra), Hon'ble the

Supreme Court, while holding that Articles 16(4)(a) and 16(4)(b) of the


                                 28 of 148

Constitution are not ultra vires, it was opined that any action of the State has

to be examined on its own facts, in terms of the law laid down by Hon'ble

the Supreme Court. Theory of guided power was coined as certain

principles were laid down and guide-lines were given in the judgment, in

terms of which enabling power could be exercised.

46.          The consequence of non-holding of test for regular promotion

despite directions by Hon'ble the Supreme Court is invalidation of the entire

exercise. This may have to be examined even in the light of the fact that a

competitive examination has been provided even for limited departmental

competitive examination. Had that test not been held, where out-of-turn

promotions are made, could it be said to be valid. Merely because this

entire exercise was done by the High Court, different principles cannot be

applied, in the sense that any action of any of the department of the State in

this situation would have certainly been commented upon by the High

Court, being in violation of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court, which are binding on one and all, if read in view of Articles 141, 144

and 129 of the Constitution of India. Any law, if violates the judgment of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court, is bad. Non-framing of Rules strictly in terms

of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court and non-holding of test, in

fact, amounts to self-abdication on the part of the High Court. The

petitioners in the present set of petitions, as such, are not challenging

promotion of the candidates in the regular promotion quota, however, their

appointment being illegal, they cannot be placed above the petitioners in the

seniority list. At the most, they can be placed at the bottom. Whatever time

is taken in the process is irrelevant. Though this court had amended the

Rules providing for quotas for three different sources for recruitment in the

Superior Judicial Service in terms of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme

Court granting all the benefits, however, failed to appreciate the underlying

object of giving more preference to merit. The conditions attached were

forgotten. In fact, the directions were not followed only for one source of

recruitment, which is major share-holder, i.e., regular promotion.

47.         In terms of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_35">Article 141</a> of the Constitution of India, judgments

of Hon'ble the Supreme Court are binding on all courts. It will be totally

inappropriate to argue that binding theory is only on the judicial side,

especially in case of High Courts and not on the administrative side. The

High Court, being a constitutional court and custodian of law, is required to

adhere to the constitutional principles to maintain rule of law. Even for

argument's sake, the High Court cannot be permitted to state that the

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court is not binding on the High Court on

the administrative side. Even Hon'ble the Supreme Court on administrative

side is bound by the judgments rendered by the Supreme Court. Any

judgment delivered is binding on the authorities and the public at large,

whosoever is concerned, from the date it is delivered. The time taken in

communication thereof may be a relevant factor to consider as to whether

there was a wilful defiance or not.

48.         Scope of <a href="/doc/1799967/" id="a_36">Article 144</a> of the Constitution of India and the

constitutional status of Hon'ble the Supreme Court and the High Courts was

appreciated the spirit behind the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

and the directions given therein. It is evident from the minutes of the

meeting of the Committee of the High Court dated 14.10.2004, whereby it

was decided that four vacancies available in the Punjab Superior Judicial

Service be filled by promotion as per the criteria of merit-cum-seniority

subject to passing of suitability test. Similar recommendation was made

with regard to Haryana Superior Judicial Service for filling up one post. The

Committee further recommended that the vacancies which became available

prior to 25.11.2003 (Haryana Superior Judicial Service) and 15.1.2004

(Punjab Superior Judicial Service) be filled up as per un-amended rules and

the vacancies, which became available, after the aforesaid dates, be filled as

per the amended rules in the prescribed quota. This action was prior to even

notification of the 2007 Punjab Rules. If the High Court can be permitted to

claim immunity from any direction given by Hon'ble the Supreme Court

that would mean that no person is permitted to file a petition against the

High Court, but the position is otherwise.

administration of justice in the legal system. It has reference to the

and the comparative constitutional law help the courts to understand the

provisions of the Constitution. The shadow of the law of contempt hangs

over our jurisprudence. Such judicial law making was held to be part of the

judicial process. Keeping in view the right of fair trial, Hon'ble the Supreme

Court created a remedy to safeguard that right. Keeping in view assault by

media in mind, the exercise undertaken by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the

aforesaid judgment was an exercise to define constitutional limitations

under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_41">Article 141</a> read with Articles 129/215 and the interpretation as given

to Articles 19(1)(a), 19(2), 21, 129 and 215 of the Constitution of India and

the law of contempt by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. Any authority daring to

on the issue of binding nature of judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court.

It was a case pertaining to Supreme Court Bar Association, where the Bar

Association refused to abide by the judgment. Hon'ble the Supreme Court

observed that it being a leading Bar Association, should have acted in aid of

the judgments of the courts instead of passing a resolution not to abide by it.

The action was an affront to the majesty and dignity of Hon'ble the Supreme

Court. It was outrightly contumacious. It was against normal rules of

decorum. The Court further opined that in order to enforce its orders and

directions, the Supreme Court can take recourse to the power vested in it

under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_44">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India to do complete justice. When

a judgment is delivered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court, it is the obligation of

contained therein, unless the same is modified or re-called. If the High

Court on the administrative side says that it will not implement the

judgment, it will be travesty of justice.

52.          While referring to the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/181443842/" id="a_45">Madras Bar Association v. Union of India and another</a>, (2014) 10 SCC 1,

in which constitution of the National Tax Tribunal was under challenge,

wherein powers of the High Court were transferred to the Tribunal, Mr.

Anupam Gupta, learned senior counsel submitted that even the ordinary

laws can be challenged on the principle of basic structure theory. In case,

they violate that theory, these can be struck down. In the case in hand,

independence of judiciary was held to be the basic structure. While framing

the 2007 Punjab Rules, this Court had violated the judgment of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court, hence, in a way violated the basic structure theory. If any

error was committed at the first stage, namely, framing of the 2007 Punjab

Rules, the same should have been corrected at the second stage, when the

Committee was considering the issue. If there were certain limitations in the

power to be exercised by the committee, this court on the judicial side

should correct the error. In the aforesaid judgment, while dealing with the

independence of judicial process, transfer of powers for dealing with the

cases which were earlier being dealt with by the High Court, was held to be

bad as the Tribunal was not found to be having semblance with court.

Judicial review was held to be part of the basic structure. It is standing as a

guard to our Constitution. Rule of law, separation of power and judicial

review have been held to be part of the basic structure of the Constitution of

India. Rule of law will be maintained if this court meticulously follows the

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in its true letter and spirit by

giving more weightage to merit in recruitment of officers from different

sources at different levels. Any law would not mean the bare Act, but as

interpreted by the court. As a result, the judicial pronouncements gain

importance of which upto date knowledge is required as law is to be

implemented in terms of the final interpretation by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court.

53.          Further reference was made to a Constitution Bench judgment

of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record

Association's 2nd case (supra). Challenge in the aforesaid judgment was to

the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014. Independence

of judiciary was opined to be part of the basic structure. The Court opined

that sometimes it is not possible to deduce the "basic structure" concerned

from a plain reading of the provisions of the Constitution and effort has to

be made to find out the same from all important silences hidden within

those articles. "Primacy of judiciary" was found to be a constituent of the

"independence of the judiciary", which is the              basic structure of the

Constitution of India. In the case in hand, while framing the 2007 Punjab

Rules and interpreting those in the manner, which runs contrary to the

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd

case (supra), this court on the administrative side had violated the basic

structure theory. Though Hon'ble the Supreme Court opined that regular

promotions have to be made on the principle of merit-cum-seniority and

passing of     a suitability test, whereas this court, while ignoring the

principles, had made promotions merely on the basis of seniority-cum-

merit and without holding any suitability test. In fact, what is laid down by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court is required to be followed and has to be read in

the Rules, least any one can opine that even the High Court has no respect

for judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court. The High Court while not

acting as per the directions given by Hon'ble the Supreme Court will be

setting a wrong example. It is the time to take corrective steps in the process

of judicial review. Even the plea, if any raised, that whatever has happened

has happened, should not be accepted. By following this method, in fact,

this court had failed to achieve the objectives and the principles laid down

by Hon'ble the Supreme Court wherein merit was being given primacy and

to ensure independence of judiciary.

54.         On the principle of rota and quota, Mr. Anupam Gupta, learned

senior counsel relied upon <a href="/doc/101697/" id="a_46">N. K. Chauhan and others v. State of Gujarat and

others</a>, (1977) 1 SCC 308; <a href="/doc/1963303/" id="a_47">Narender Singh Rao v. State of Haryana and

others</a>, AIR 1978 P&amp;H 234 (FB) and B.S. Yadav and others' case (supra).

55.         He further submitted that in fact, there are fundamental errors/

discrepancies in the 2007 Punjab Rules, which have not been framed strictly

in terms of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. Though

Appendix 'B' has reference to Rule 7, however, the language used therein is

different than what is used in the 2007 Punjab Rules. Though the 2007

Punjab Rules use words "merit-cum-seniority" and passing of a suitability

test, Appendix 'B', with reference to Rule 7(4) of the 2007 Punjab Rules

providing for the roster to fill up the posts, mentions seniority-cum-

suitability for the officers, who are regularly promoted. There is substantial

difference between the concepts of "merit-cum-seniority" and "seniority-

cum-merit". The distinction between seniority-cum-merit and merit-cum-

seniority was sought to be explained while referring to judgments of

<a href="/doc/180374877/" id="a_51">Balbir Singh Bedi v. State of Punjab and others</a>, (2013) 11 SCC 746.

56.         In the case in hand, as directed by Hon'ble the Supreme Court,

even merit-cum-seniority was not enough as it was followed by a suitability

test, which was completely lost sight of by this court on the administrative

side not only while framing the 2007 Punjab Rules, but even at the stage of

implementation thereof. In fact, the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

was over-ruled on the administrative side as the word "and", mentioned in

between 'merit-cum-seniority' and 'suitability test' was replaced with "or".

Both had their independent meaning and import. These had been subdued to

one. While drafting Rule 7 of the 2007 Punjab Rules, suitability test is part

of the Rules, whereas in implementation, it was ignored.

57.         In fact, Rule 8 of the 2007 Punjab Rules reverses the same

position as was there in the 1963 Punjab Rules. Premium is given

continuously to mediocrity in service.

58.         It was further argued that any promotion made in excess of the

quota meant for that source has to be considered as ad-hoc. It is by legal

fiction. In the eyes of law, such a promotion is non-est. They cannot be

given double benefit. No plea of hardship can be accepted. They have no

right to usurp the posts meant for other quotas. They have to be placed at

the bottom of seniority. In the case in hand, the regular promotees were not

only in excess of their quota but they had even been promoted in violation

reliance was placed upon <a href="/doc/338275/" id="a_52">S. G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India and others</a>,

59.         In support of the plea that there is fundamental difference

between recruitment and appointment, reference was made to <a href="/doc/1734432/" id="a_54">Jagdish Ch.

selected, as selection does not confer any right of appointment.

60.         It was further contended that Rule 12 of the 2007 Punjab Rules

does not deal with issue regarding inter-se seniority from three sources of

recruitment, namely, regular promotion, promotion by limited departmental

competitive examination and direct recruitment. In terms of Rule 23 thereof,

in the absence of any provision in the 2007 Punjab Rules, the 1994 Punjab

Rules shall be applicable, which provide for determination of seniority on

the basis of continuous length of service, however, in case some posts have

been filled in excess of the quota, any period of that service will not count

towards seniority.

61.          Assailing the report of the Committee, Mr. Anupam Gupta

submitted that the Committee had wrongly opined that judgment of All

India Judges Association 4th case (supra) had retrospective effect which, in

fact, it did not have, as there is a specific date given. Had it not been

specified in the judgment, one could raise an argument about its

retrospectivity. Though that was also debatable in the facts of the case,

however, the directions being in clear terms and there being no ambiguity,

there is no scope for having different opinion.           Shifting of un-filled

vacancies from limited departmental competitive examination quota to the

regular promotion quota had to be from the cut-off date as provided. It was

specifically clarified by Hon'ble the Supreme Court that in case the Rules

are not amended upto the date fixed, the judgment will be applicable.

Meaning thereby the quota of accelerated promotion through limited

departmental competitive examination will stand reduced from 25% to 10%

from that date onwards and any unfilled vacancy therein will be added in

the regular promotion quota from that date onwards and not from any date

prior thereto. Reduction in quota is not retrospective.

62.          It was further submitted that in compliance to the directions of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court, this court had specially held the test for an

officer, namely, Roshan Lal Ahuja, though there was error in that case in

pointing out complete facts before Hon'ble the Supreme Court and the test

was not required to be held.

63.          He further submitted that justice is not only done but seen to

have been done. In case, the High Court on the administrative side will not

follow the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court or the directions given

therein explicitly, what message will be given to others. In fact, the

Committee has tried to justify a wrong act done earlier while referring to a

subsequent judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court which, in fact, does not

come to its rescue.

64.          Mr. S. S. Swaich, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners

representing direct recruits, while adopting the arguments raised by Mr.

Anupam Gupta, learned senior counsel, with reference to the appointment of

regular promotees in excess of their quota being not as per the Rules, raised

an argument that seniority of direct recruits should be taken from the date of

recommendation by this court. He argued that in the constitutional scheme,

High Court is the last word and role of the State is formal. It is limited to the

extent of issuing appointment letters. Verification of antecedents is a

ministerial act and not substantive. Even after verification, the report was to

be sent to this court. The Committee examined the issue only with reference

to normal service where recommendation made by the selecting agency is

not final. Here High Court is not merely the selecting agency. In judicial

service, its recommendation is binding, which cannot be changed by the

State. These are appointments under <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_59">Article 233</a> of the Constitution of

India.

65.          He further referred to the minutes of meeting dated 25.7.2008,

vide which recommendations were made to the Government for

appointment. In those minutes also, keeping in view the Rules applicable,

first recommendation was for appointment of direct recruits and thereafter

of the promotees from the quota through limited departmental competitive

examination. In this manner only, appointments should have been made.

This recommendation was binding on the Governor. Even if any of the


                              39 of 148
            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:12 :::
 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                        [40]

person gets appointment letter earlier, his seniority will not be affected by

this process as the same has to be reckoned from the date of

recommendation. In case, the verification had been fast and the direct

recruits had joined earlier, they would have been ranked senior to the

promotees. In the process of verification, it is only the executive which

caused the delay and the consequence was that direct recruits, who

otherwise should have been ranked senior to the promotees, have been made

junior.     The power which is not vested in executive with reference to

judicial service directly has been exercised indirectly. Things cannot be left

as such. In seniority, an important aspect is appointment.

66.            He further argued that the recommendations are not be read in

isolation. If we see the steps even prior thereto, the process for direct

recruitment started much before the process for promotion through limited

departmental competitive examination started. For direct recruits, the

advertisement was issued on 2.2.2008, whereas for promotion through

limited departmental competitive examination, circular was issued on

23.4.2008. The examination for direct recruits as well as for promotion

through limited departmental competitive examination was held on the same

day, i.e., 18.5.2008. He further referred to the letters sent by the High Court

to the Government. Though both the letters are of even date, namely,

29.7.2008, however, for the recommendation made in the case of direct

recruits,    letter number is 628, whereas for promotion through limited

departmental competitive examination, letter number is 629. He submitted

that persons, who are already in service have ways and means to get their

files cleared early. That cannot be the sole criteria for ranking them senior to

the direct recruits. The appointment letters were issued to the promotees

through limited departmental competitive examination on 11.8.2008,

whereas to the direct recruits, the same were issued on 28.11.2008.

67.            With reference to the recommendation of the High Court being

binding, Mr. Swaich, learned counsel contended that the recommendation

and appointment with reference to the judicial service is such an integrated

process that these cannot be separated from each, which has source of

power under <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_60">Article 233</a> of the Constitution of India. In none of the cases

cited before this court, recruitment at the same time was made from two

different sources. These were the cases where merely on selection, right of

appointment was being sought and there was huge delay in appointment. In

the case in hand, there is not much delay. Authority in the case of judicial

officers is vested with the Full Court and not the Chief Justice of the High

Court alone. In support of the argument regarding the recommendation of

the High Court being binding and the process of selection and appointment

being extricable, reliance was placed upon Supreme Court <a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_61">Advocates-on-

Record Association and another v. Union of India</a>, (1993) 4 SCC 441

[hereinafter      described     as     'Supreme    Court     Advocates-on-Record

Association's 1st case'] and President of India's Special Reference No. 1 of

1998, 1998(4) SCT 696.

68.            Referring to the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in

Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association's 2nd case (supra)], he

submitted that Hon'ble the Supreme Court opined therein that if the

appointments in judiciary are left to the executive, it will breach

independence of judiciary. Judicial system has been held to be the basic

structure of the Constitution. The recommendations made by the High Court

are binding on the Governor. The appointment of Judges is not an executive

function, rather, it is participatory. Changing order of appointment will

amount to interference in the basic structure of the Constitution. The role of

the Governor is formal. Reference was made to Bal Mukand Sah's case

(supra). The promotees cannot be allowed to steal march over the direct

recruits if the process was same. Reference was made to <a href="/doc/975883/" id="a_62">Arvinder Singh

Bains v. State of Punjab and others</a>, (2006) 6 SCC 673. He further relied

upon judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/101059510/" id="a_63">Union of India and others

v. N. R. Parmar and others</a>, (2012) 13 SCC 340 to contend that roster as

given in Appendix 'B' can be considered for framing the seniority as the

same is strictly as per the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court.

Reliance was placed upon <a href="/doc/86114294/" id="a_64">Chandra Mohan v. State of U. P. and others</a>, AIR

1966 SC 1987 and <a href="/doc/2120073/" id="a_65">Chief Information Commr. and another v. State of

Manipur and another</a>, 2012 (1) RCR (Civil) 374 to contend that if a manner

has been prescribed to do something, it has to be strictly followed. As

direct recruits had been recommended to be appointed first, they had to be

given appointment first. Reliance was also placed upon instructions dated

15.3.1962 (Annexure P-24) issued by the State, which clearly provide that

seniority of the candidates should be treated with reference to the date of

recommendation.

69.          He further submitted that there is no weight in the argument

sought to be raised by the regular promotees that they were not given a

chance to participate in the limited departmental competitive examination as

this dispute is not with the direct recruits. They are within their own quota.

70.          Mr. R. K. Chopra, learned senior counsel appearing for some

of the petitioners, who are direct recruits, referred to the judgment of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra)

and submitted that once Hon'ble the Supreme Court had laid down the law

and the principles to be followed especially while framing the Rules, those

have to be adhered to. Seniority has to be fixed accordingly. The direction

was to prepare a roster for determining seniority. The 2007 Punjab Rules

have to be read with the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court and not in

violation thereof.

71.          Mr. Karanvir Singh Khehar, learned counsel appearing for the

direct recruits, while referring to Rule 8 of the         1994 Punjab   Rules,

submitted that direct recruits are to be placed above the promotees. <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_66">Article

233</a> of the Constitution of India deals with a situation, which is prior to the

appointment of judicial officers, whereas <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_67">Article 235</a> deals with after the

appointment. He further submitted that the Committee committed an error

in noticing the fact that there are only two sources of recruitment to the

superior judicial service, namely, promotion and direct recruitment. Even

Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra)

opined that there are three sources of recruitment, hence, the consequence

will automatically change. The decision of the Committee is largerly based

on this fact that there are only two sources of recruitment. He further

distinguished the judgments cited by Mr. Anupam Gupta, learned senior

counsel, by contending that these deal with the issue regarding right of

appointment on selection and not with reference to the seniority. These are

two different concepts.



             Arguments on behalf of the High Court

High Court, submitted that the process for framing the Rules was started in

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                      [44]

terms of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges'

Association 3rd case (supra), however, as the same was being delayed, to

take care of minimum requirements and to comply with the direction of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court, amendment was made in the 1963 Punjab Rules

providing for three sources of recruitment to the superior judicial service,

which was notified on 15.1.2004. He further submitted that the High Court

had finalised the same set of draft Rules applicable to the officers in both

the States, namely, Punjab and Haryana and sent them for notifying in the

official gazette. The State of Haryana notified the Rules after carrying out

cosmetic changes without effecting the substance thereof, that too

with/without consultation of the High Court, whereas in the case of State of

Punjab, without there being any consultation with the High Court,

completely changed Rules were notified. Learned counsel appearing for the

State of Punjab at this stage, on verification, with reference to the

notification of the 2007 Punjab Rules, submitted that from the record it is

evident that the Rules were changed at the level of the State Government in

Legal Remembrancer's office without any consultation with the High Court

of the proposed change. Though in the files, there is a note that the Legal

Remembrancer had a meeting with K. S. Grewal, J., who was heading the

Rules Committee at that time, but no minutes of meeting are available with

them or even in the High Court record.

73.         Mr. Sharma, learned senior counsel further submitted that from

January 2004 to August, 2007, no suitability test for regular promotions was

held either in the State of Punjab or Haryana, however, thereafter the same

was held in the State of Haryana, as the 2007 Haryana Rules provided for

that, whereas there being no such provision notified in the 2007 Punjab

Rules, it was not held. First selection process after the 2007 Punjab Rules

were notified was held in the year 2008. There is no challenge to the Rules

either prior to the filing of bunch of petitions or in the present set of

petitions.

74.          He further submitted that in Malik Mazhar Sultan (3) and <a href="/doc/1617723/" id="a_68">another

v. Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission and others</a>, (2008) 17 SCC 703,

Hon'ble the Supreme Court provided for annual schedule for carrying out the

selection process for recruitment to the Superior Judicial Service from all three

sources.

75.          He further referred to the observations made by Hon'ble the

Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra) that in case

there is any issue pertaining to the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court in the aforesaid judgment, application could be filed only before

Hon'ble the Supreme Court. As the petitioners in the present petitions are

seeking implementation of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court, the present set of petitions are not maintainable in this court. He

further submitted that in Vitusah Oberoi and others v. Court of Its Own

Motion, AIR 2017 SC 225, Hon'ble the Supreme Court opined that for any

order passed by Hon'ble the Supreme Court, contempt does not lie in High

Court, hence, the petitioners cannot even claim that any action/in-action of

this court is contemptuous.

76.          Controverting the contentions raised by learned counsel for the

petitioners that even if the Rules are silent on any issue, with reference to

which Hon'ble the Supreme Court had given directions in All India Judges'

Association 3rd and 4th cases (supra), then the law laid down by Hon'ble the

Supreme Court is to be followed, it was submitted that once the statutory

rules are there, those are required to be followed and not what is stated in

the judgment. In support, reliance was placed upon <a href="/doc/932837/" id="a_69">Syed T. A. Naqshbandi

and others v. State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and others</a>, (2003) 9 SCC 592 and

<a href="/doc/163565972/" id="a_70">Sasidhar Reddy Sura v. State of Andhra Pradesh and others</a>, (2014) 2 SCC

158.

77.          As regards seniority, the submission of learned senior counsel

for the High Court is that the same has been determined strictly as per the

2007 Punjab Rules which, read with the 1994 Punjab Rules, which provide

that continuous length of service is the criteria for determination of

seniority. Referring to various Rules in the 2007 Punjab Rules, he submitted

that Rule 7(3)(a) is to be read with Rule 8. Rule 7(3)(b) is to be read with

Rule 9 and Rule 7(3)(c) is to be read with Rules 10 and 11 thereof. The

aforesaid Rules pertain to appointment/promotion to the Superior Judicial

Service from different sources. Rule 12 of the 2007 Punjab Rules, which

deals with seniority, is to be read with Rule 23 thereof along with Rule 8 of

the 1994 Punjab Rules.

78.          Regarding suitability test, as envisaged in Rule 7(3)(a) of the

2007 Punjab Rules, it was submitted that Rule 7(3)(a) providing for 50%

quota for regular promotion, which was later on increased to 65%, is to be

read with Rule 8 thereof. No doubt, Rule 7(3)(a) provides for promotion on

the basis of merit-cum-seniority and passing of a suitability test, Rule 8

provides how the merit is to be assessed and suitability is to be tested. The

Rule may be bad or not happily worded, but as long as it stays, it has to be

adhered to. Suitability test will not mean written test only.

79.          Mr. Sanjeev Sharma, learned senior counsel, was not able to

refer from any material on record to show how merit was assessed and

suitability was tested with reference to any bench-mark fixed. He could

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                      [47]

refer to only the minutes of the meeting of the Recruitment Committee held

on 29.11.2007, which recommended promotion of the officers from the

feeder cadre in order of their seniority, except those who could not be

considered eligible as per the Rules itself or who were under suspension. In

the criteria framed for Haryana Officers, viva-voce was also prescribed.

Nothing was referred from the record to show that any viva-voce was

conducted. He further submitted that the Committee had followed the

criteria laid down by the Full Court in its meeting held on 30.10.2007 for

promotion of the members of Haryana Civil Services (Judicial Branch) to

Haryana Superior Judicial Service under the 2007 Haryana Rules, where

also the criteria for promotion is merit-cum- seniority and suitability test.

However, he was not able to explain that there was substantial difference in

Punjab and Haryana Rules, as the 2007 Haryana Rules are strictly as per the

directions given by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges'

Association 3rd case (supra), whereas the 2007 Punjab Rules are

substantially different. The Full Court in its meeting held on 30.10.2007

provided that officers in the zone of consideration, who are having three B

(Plus) 'good reports" out of preceding five years and who are not having any

integrity doubtful report in any of the last 5 years, should be called for

assessing and testing the merit and suitability for promotion under 50%

quota. The aforesaid criteria laid down for Haryana Officers was followed

in Punjab. It was further provided therein that viva-voce test was conducted

by the Judges consisting of Administrative Committee, i.e., Hon'ble the

Chief Justice and four senior most Judges.

80.         It was further contended that regular promotions against 50%

quota (which was later on increased to 65%) was made way back in the year

2008, hence, any challenge to the same at this stage is highly belated.

Promotion and seniority are two different concepts. If the members of

service from other sources were aggrieved of the promotion of the aforesaid

officers, they should have raised objection immediately after they entered

service. The objection was made only when tentative seniority list was

circulated. In any case, a member joining service later on, cannot raise

issue with reference to seniority, as seniority is to be determined on the

basis of continuous length of service and the promotees being already in

service have to be ranked senior.

81.          Mr. Sharma, learned senior counsel, referred to the report of

the Committee, which determined inter-se seniority of the members of the

cadre. He submitted that the report is quite exhaustive, where after hearing

number of counsels representing three different groups and considering

their submissions, the Committee had framed eight issues in para No. 38

thereof. While dealing with different issues, the Committee opined that

holding of suitability test for regular promotion was not provided in the

Rules, i.e., either in the 1963 Punjab Rules after these were amended on

15.1.2004 or the 2007 Punjab Rules. The Selection Committee understood

the criteria of 'merit-cum-seniority' and 'suitability test' as contained in Rule

8(a) of the 1963 Punjab Rules in a particular manner and recommended

promotions without holding any 'suitability test'. These recommendations

were approved by the Full Court. In the subsequent meeting of the Selection

Committee held on 29.11.2007 also, somewhat similar criteria was adopted

without any written test, hence, the persons appointed cannot be held to be

irregular or ad-hoc. Once the Rules did not provide for holding of written

test, there was no obligation to hold one.

82.         He further submitted that there are only two sources of

recruitment to Superior Judicial Service, namely, promotion and direct

recruitment. Promotion has been sub-divided into two parts, namely, regular

promotion and accelerated promotion by way of limited departmental

competitive examination, hence, the vacancies have to be calculated in that

manner. In All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra), Hon'ble the

Supreme Court directed that out of regular promotion quota of 75%, 25% be

diverted to limited departmental competitive examination quota. As these

vacancies could not be filled for years together in different States, in All

India Judges' Association 4th case (supra), it was opined that percentage be

reduced from 25% to 10% and the vacancies be diverted back to the regular

promotion quota, hence, there is no error in calculation of vacancies and

there is no merit in the contention raised by learned counsel for the

petitioners that promotions are in excess of quota.

83.           The cadre strength as on 19.2.2008 when promotions were

made was 107. Different posts available in each cadre were 53 for regular

promotion [Rule 7(3)(a)], 27 for promotion through limited departmental

competitive examination [Rule 7(3)(b)] and 27 for direct recruitment [Rule

7(3)(c)]. Though the 2007 Punjab Rules were amended on 15.1.2004

providing for 25% quota for limited departmental competitive examination,

but no recruitment was made in this category upto the year 2008. Actual

working strength as on 10.2.2008 in promotion category [Rule 7(3)(a)] was

58, whereas in direct recruitment quota, it was 6 [Rule 7(3)(c)]. The total

vacancies available in promotion category taking both the sources together

as on 19.2.2008 was [53+27]-58=22. These vacancies were divided into

50% and 25%, ie., 15+7 under Rule 7(3)(a) and Rule 7(3)(b) of the 2007

Punjab Rules, respectively and appointments were made accordingly. There

is nothing wrong in that as the earlier cadre was to be protected considering

the fact that change in quota was effected only after 15.1.2004 amendment

in the 1963 Punjab Rules. Same system for recruitment was to continue, till

such time by way of retirement, elevation or otherwise, cadre strength in the

promotion category [Rule 7(3)(a)] was reduced to 50%.

84.          He further submitted that there is no merit in the contention

raised by learned counsel for the direct recruits to claim that the date of

recommendation made by the High Court to the State be treated as their date

of appointment, as the selection does not confer any right of appointment.

The Rules define       appointing authority as the Governor. Unless the

appointment letter is issued, there is no right to join service. Number of

formalities are to be completed after the recommendation and before

appointment. Giving date of recommendation as the date of appointment

will be putting the cart before the horse.

85.          As regards holding of written test for regular promotion

subsequently, Mr. Sharma, learned senior counsel appearing for the High

Court, submitted that in the meeting of the Recruitment Committee held on

24.2.2011, it was recommended that in view of the judgment of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra), test is

required to be conducted for promotion. In the meeting of the Committee

held on 11.3.2011, criteria for test was proposed, which was approved by

the Full Court on 29.3.2011. Prior to that, in Punjab, no test was held for

regular promotion to determine the suitability. He further submitted that the

Rules Committee in its meeting held on 19.11.2012 recommended for

amendment in Rule 8 of the 2007 Punjab Rules for including the written

test and viva-voce for regular promotion. These were approved on

29.1.2013 by the Full Court and sent to the Government on 2.3.2013, which

are still pending for notification. Learned counsel for the State at this stage

pointed out that these have been approved, however, are to be placed

before the Cabinet after Assembly elections in the State.

86.         The judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in Maharashtra

State Judges Association and others v. Registrar General, High Court of

Judicature at Bombay and another, (2009) 1 SCC 569 was cited in support

of the argument that whatever was the seniority position upto 31.3.2003 was

to be protected in terms of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in

All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra).

87.         Learned counsel was further candid in stating that if the officers

working in any category are more than their sanctioned strength in the

cadre, then no recruitment in their quota is to be made. If they are excess,

they will come at the bottom of the seniority list. Regarding roster-point

provided in Appendix 'B' for the purpose of recruitment, it was submitted

that the same is to be followed seeing the cadre strength. If in any cadre the

officers in position are more, then no recruitment is to be made from that

category. In case, quotas in Rule 7(3)(a), 7(3)(b) and 7(3)(c) in the cadre are

taken separately, there was no vacancy in the quota, as provided in Rule 7

(3)(a) (regular promotion quota) as on 14.2.2008, as 58 officers were

already working against the quota of 53.



88.         With reference to the seniority assigned to the Judges of Fast

Track Court recruits in the regular cadre, it was submitted that needful was

done in terms of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in Brij Mohan

<a href="/doc/299215/" id="a_71">Lal v. Union of India</a>, (2012) 6 SCC 502.             The circular for limited

departmental competitive examination was issued on 25.1.2008 and even

the test was conducted on 4.2.2008, much prior to the process for

recruitment of direct recruits. They had joined earlier in time.

89.          Argument was also addressed regarding delay and laches in

filing the petitions. It was submitted that promotion beyond quota, if any, as

is sought to be argued by the members of other two sources, namely, direct

recruits and limited departmental competitive examination deserves to be

rejected at this stage, as it is highly belated. When the promotions were

made, none represented to contend that these were beyond quota.

      Arguments on behalf of private respondents-regularly promoted

90.          Mr. Sumeet Mahajan, learned senior counsel appearing for

respondent Nos. 6 and 10 in CWP No. 1056 of 2016 and for same

respondents in the other writ petitions, who are regularly promoted officers,

adopted the arguments raised by Mr. Anupam Gupta, and Mr. Sanjeev

Sharma, learned senior counsels, except regarding operation of roster for the

purpose of seniority or that promotions were beyond quota. He further

submitted that learned senior counsel Mr. Anupam Gupta had rightly

pointed out that seniority of the officers directly recruited has to be counted

from the date of appointment and not from the date of recommendations. He

further submitted that the officers being represented by him are of 1992

batch of Punjab Civil Services (Judicial Branch) batch. Respondent Nos. 18

and 22 to 24 are also of 1992 batch, however, they were below in the merit

list, hence, in the seniority. Respondent Nos. 19 to 21 and 25 are of 1994

and 1995 Batches, respectively. Both respondent Nos. 6 and 10 were

designated as Senior Sub-Judges on 16.12.1996. They completed their five

years as Senior Sub-Judge on 2.1.2002 and 4.1.2003, respectively. Though

as per the 1963 Punjab Rules, they were eligible to appear in the limited

competitive test, however, were not given any opportunity as no test was

held. After the judgment in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra),

amendment was carried out in the 1963 Punjab Rules on 15.1.2004

providing for quotas for promotion and direct recruitment as directed by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court. Thereafter, on 23.3.2005, regular promotions

were made, however, no suitability test was held. No limited competitive

test was held though the rules provided for it. On 31.8.2007, the 2007

Punjab Rules were notified superseding the 1963 Punjab Rules. On

18.2.2008, regular promotions were made, however, without holding any

suitability test. No test was held even for limited competitive examination.

Had the test been held either for regular promotion or for limited

competitive examination, the respondents, represented by him, would have

certainly appeared in that test. On 23.4.2008, the High Court issued a

circular for limited competitive test. It was forwarded only to the Senior

Sub-Judges and not to the officers, who were already promoted. In fact,

there was no need for them to appear as they had already been promoted as

Additional District &amp; Sessions Judges. On 29.5.2009, regular promotions

were made following the same procedure, namely, without holding any

suitability test. On 24.8.2008, all the Judges working in Fast Track Courts

were absorbed while holding a limited competitive test for them against the

direct recruitment quota posts. On 18.5.2008 for the first time after the

amendment of 2004 in 1963 Punjab Rules or promulgation of the 2007

Punjab Rules, test was held for limited competitive examination. 8 officers

were appointed out of this quota on 14.8.2008. Directly recruited officers

were appointed on 28.11.2008.

91.         It was contended that the petitioners herein have only

challenged the seniority list and not the report of the committee. The

Rules have also not been challenged. The promotion of the respondents

made way back in the year 2008 is also not under challenge, even though

much stress was laid by learned counsel for the petitioners on the issue that

the promotions were made in violation of the judgment of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court without holding the suitability test. The Committee has

rightly followed the principle of continuos length of service for the purpose

of determination of seniority as this is the method provided for in the 2007

Punjab Rules. Though the 2007 Punjab                  Rules referred to the

recommendations made by the Shetty Commission, however, this would not

apply   here. The Rules are silent about this. Even Shetty Commission

recommended that continuos length of service should be taken as the

principle for determination of seniority. While referring to All India Judges'

Association 3rd case (supra), it was argued that Hon'ble the Supreme Court

gave directions for amendment of the Rules and for providing roster for

determination of seniority in the Rules itself. As argued by learned senior

counsel Mr. Sanjeev Sharma appearing for the High Court, he submitted

that after the Rules have been promulgated, these are applicable and not

the judgment. There is no direction by Hon'ble the Supreme Court that after

the cut off date, provided for amendment of the Rules, the judgment will

apply if the Rules are not amended. There is no roster provided for in the

Rules for determination of seniority. The contention of learned counsel for

the petitioner that in view of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

roster should be made applicable, is totally misconceived. The Rules are

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                      [55]

prospective in nature. Once principle of continuos length of service is

applied for determining inter-se seniority of officers from different sources

then the quota looses its significance.

92.          The judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1829040/" id="a_72">P.V. George

and others v. State of Kerala and others</a>, (2007) 3 SCC 557 was cited in

support of the argument that settled issues should not be un-settled and a

judgment of the court can either be prospective or retrospective. Even if for

argument's sake, three quotas are taken, still as per the Rules applicable,

seniority has to be determined on the principle of continuous length of

service. The roster provided for appointment in Appendix 'B' annexed with

the 2007 Punjab Rules has not been followed. Even in        All India Judges'

Association 3rd case (supra), Hon'ble the Supreme Court had opined that to

give effect to the directions given in the judgment, the Rules are required to

be amended. Till such time, the Rules are amended in consonance with the

judgment, as per the existing Rules, continuous length of service is to be

applied for determination of seniority.

93.          It was further argued that the contention regarding violation of

basic structure theory is totally mis-conceived. Hon'ble the Supreme Court

had clearly provided that there had to be written test for direct recruitment

as well as for limited departmental competitive examination, however, for

the purpose of promotion, it provided that there has to be suitability test,

which was not necessarily to be written. Objectivity is tested only when

there is no viva-voce and only record is seen. In the present case, the

promotions were made after perusal of record, hence, there was complete

objectivity. In case, the stand of the petitioners is that judgment of Hon'ble

the Supreme Court has been violated, then the remedy lies before Hon'ble

the Supreme Court. Even after 2007, when the Rules were framed in the

States of Punjab and Haryana, these can be different for both the States.

Regarding application of any bench-mark for the purpose of consideration

of candidates for promotion on the basis of merit-cum-seniority, it was

submitted that once the exercise has been done by this court on the

administrative side, we must presume that it was strictly in accordance with

the Rules. If the promotions have not been challenged, the promotees will

get all consequential benefits. If the promotions have been made strictly

following the Rules and are even beyond quota, they are not to be pushed

down in the seniority. In support, reliance was placed upon <a href="/doc/485116/" id="a_73">Direct Recruit

Class II Engineering Officers' Association v. State of Maharashtra and

others</a>, (1990) 2 SCC 715 and <a href="/doc/1396306/" id="a_74">Rudra Kumar Sain and others v. Union of

India and others</a>, (2000) 8 SCC 25.

94.          With reference to the quota, it was submitted that promotions

made prior to 15.1.2004 in the 1963 Punjab Rules should be treated as filled

up in the ratio of 50 and 25 in the promotion quota and the vacancies

should be worked out accordingly. Raising the issue of quota, it was

submitted that regularly promoted officers were not at fault. As they had

already been promoted, they were not given a chance to appear in limited

departmental competitive examination. In this process, the persons who

were far junior to the regularly promoted officers have been given march

over them.



95.          Another contention raised by Mr. Sumeet Mahajan, learned

senior counsel is that the Rules are to be given its true meaning with no

addition or deletion of words. The judgments are not to be seen over and

above the Rules. In support, reliance was placed upon Syed T.A.

Naqshbandi's case (supra); <a href="/doc/545775/" id="a_75">Rakhi Ray and others v. High</a> Court of Delhi

and others, (2010) 2 SCC 637 and <a href="/doc/58524857/" id="a_76">Rohitash Kumar and others v. Om

Prakash Sharma and others</a>, (2013) 11 SCC 451.              He distinguished the

judgment referred to by learned counsel for the petitioners in Arvinder

Singh Bains' case (supra) on the plea that roster provided by Appendix 'B'

should be read even for the purpose of determination of seniority, while

submitting that seniority is to be fixed as per the Rules, which provide for

continuous length of service. The judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/1898203/" id="a_77">Bhupinderpal Singh and others v. State of Punjab and others</a>, (2000) 5

SCC 262 was cited in support of the plea that if a wrong practice was being

followed bonafidely, no adverse action should be taken, however, this case

pertains to the manner of appointment and not regarding seniority.

96.          Summing up his arguments, Mr. Mahajan, learned senior

counsel submitted that direct recruits have no cause of action against the

regularly promoted officers as their quota had not been violated. Only out-

of-turn promotees could raise the issue. Even their contention is also mis-

conceived.

97.          Mr. Rajiv Atma Ram, learned senior counsel appearing for

respondent-Amrinder Singh Grewal submitted that all the findings recorded

by the Committee are strictly as per law and he adopts the same. He further

submitted that once the 1963 Punjab Rules were repealed and the 2007

Punjab Rules were promulgated, new posts are deemed to be sanctioned

and the quota will start afresh in 2007 Punjab Rules. On the issue of effect

of repealed service rules with enactment of new rules, reliance was placed

upon <a href="/doc/829721/" id="a_78">State of Punjab and others v. Arun Kumar Aggarwal and others</a>,

cadre. All appointments are to be made as per roster even if the quotas, as

mentioned in Rule 7(3) of the 2007 Punjab Rules, are violated. For Rule 7

(3)(a) and (b) of the 2007 Punjab Rules, quotas have not been mentioned

with reference to the posts in the cadre, which is there in case of Rule 7(3)

(c).   He submitted that in fact the 2007 Punjab Rules are anomalous,

however, they have to be followed as it is, as the vires is not under

challenge. Though Appendix 'B' provides for a roster for recruitment on

posts from three different sources, however, at any given point of time, the

recruitments will not be made from all three sources simultaneously, hence,

the roster at Appendix 'B' can be said to be directory as it is not possible to

adhere to the same. It was further submitted that if the roster is applied for

determination of seniority, then from any one source the person may be

given seniority from a date when he was not even born in the cadre.

98.          With reference to second proviso to Rule 23 of the 2007 Punjab

Rules, it was submitted that a plain reading of the language used therein

shows that the recommendations made by Shetty Commission will over-

ride. That would mean the recommendations as such, irrespective of the

fact as to whether these were approved or dis-approved by Hon'ble the

Supreme Court.       If the recommendations of Shetty Commission are

considered, even the appointments made by way of direct recruitment are

also in violation thereof.



99.          It was further argued that quota of promotion before 15.1.2004

was 75%. Even if at the time of making promotions at any stage the High

Court had violated the quota, the officers cannot be said to be at fault. There

<p id="p_1">102.         The case pertains to inter-se seniority of the officers in the

cadre of Superior Judicial Service in the State of Punjab. Initially the cadre

was governed by the 1963 Punjab Rules, which were amended on 15.1.2004

in terms of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges'

Association 3rd case (supra) and subsequently replaced by the 2007 Punjab

Rules. The contest for inter-se seniority finalised for the year 2008 is

amongst the officers, who are regularly promoted, directly recruited and

promoted through limited departmental competitive examination. Regular

promotions are made in terms of Rule 7(3)(a); accelerated promotions are

made in terms of Rule 7(3)(b) and direct recruitments are made in terms of

Rule 7(3)(c) of the 2007 Punjab Rules. Prior to finalisation of the seniority

list, a tentative seniority list was prepared and circulated to all the officers

on 25.9.2014. Objections were invited. Oral hearing was granted to all the

officers, who were even represented by senior counsels. The Committee

considered the objections and opined that no change was required in the

tentative seniority list circulated, hence, finalised on 11.8.2015. None of the

parties or their counsels have any grievance about the fair hearing afforded

to them by the Committee. The report of the Committee was circulated.

One of the Hon'ble Judge submitted his comments on the report, which were

placed before the Full Court. Finally, the report of the Committee was

accepted in Full Court meeting held on 22.12.2015 and thereafter, the

impugned seniority list was circulated on 24.12.2015.

             Rule 7(3)(a) are liable to be termed as irregular or 'ad-hoc', and

             if so, to what effect ?

<p id="p_3">             (2)   Whether the posts meant for the 'out-of-turn promotion'

             under Rule 7(3)(b) which remained unfilled as no competitive

             examination took place from the year 2004 to 2008, can be

             included in 'promotion quota' under Rule 7(3)(a), and if not, to

             which quota such posts shall stand diverted ?

</p><p id="p_5">             (a) were in excess to the 'promotion quota", and if so, what is

             the effect on seniority of such excess promotions ?

             or (b) are entitled to the 'weightage' of their service rendered in

             PCS (Judicial Branch) towards seniority in Superior Judicial

             Service in view of second proviso to Rule 23 of 2007 Rules ?

             (5)   Whether the direct recruits under Rule 7(3)(c) could be

             recommended by the High Court for appointment ?

under Rule 7(3)(a) of the 2007 Punjab Rules was regular for all intents and

purposes. The promotions made on 19.2.2008 under Rule 7(3)(a) were held

to be not in excess of quota. The posts, which remained vacant out of the

quota meant for limited departmental competitive examination [Rule 7(3)

claim seniority from the date of their recommendation made by the High

Court for appointment. Roster, as provided in Appendix 'B' to the 2007

Punjab Rules cannot be applied for determination of inter-se seniority of

members of the cadre recruited from three different sources. The seniority

was determined on the basis of continuous length of service, as provided

under Rule 8 of the 1994 Punjab Rules, applicable in terms of Rule 23 of the

2007 Punjab Rules. The tentative seniority list was approved.

             GENERAL ISSUES

</p><p id="p_16">105.         As counsels for the petitioners have raised many issues

regarding judicial system with reference to the constitutional scheme, it

being part of basic structure of the Constitution of India, we deem it

appropriate to notice the same before dealing with other issues.


</p><p id="p_17">             Judicial system-- the Basic structure, <a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_79">Article 233</a> of the
             Constitution of India

</p><p id="p_18">106.         In Madras Bar Association's case (supra),             issue under

consideration before the Constitution Bench of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

was the validity of the <a href="/doc/1850110/" id="a_80">National Tax Tribunal Act</a>, 2005 (for short, 'NTT

Act'), vide which National Tax Tribunal (for short, 'the Tribunal') was

constituted, which was to take over jurisdiction of the High Courts for

dealing with appeals under different direct and indirect taxes statutes.

While considering the issue as to whether NTT Act violates the basic

structure of the Constitution, answer was in positive. The scope of judicial

review was examined. Concepts of "rule of law", "separation of power" and

"judicial review" were held to be part of basic structure of the Constitution.

These were held to be essential ingredients of adjudicatory process. Finding

that power of judicial review vested in the High Court under Articles

                               63 of 148

226/227 of the Constitution remained intact, National Tax Tribunal was

deemed to be held to be discharging a supplemental role, rather, than

substitutional role. The plea raised by the Attorney General that the law

having been enacted within the competence of the Parliament has to be

tested on that touch-stone and none else, was not accepted. The NTT Act

was also found to be violating the basic structure theory as it was not found

to be as independent an institution as the High Courts are, powers from

which were sought to be transferred.
</p>
<p id="p_19">107.        It was opined that though transfer of jurisdiction is permissible,

but in effecting such transfer, the court to which power of adjudication is

transferred, must be endured with salient characteristics, which were

possessed by the court from which the adjudicatory power has been

transferred. All conventions/customs/ practices of the court sought to be

replaced have to be incorporated in the court/tribunal created. Finding that

the Tribunal constituted under the NTT Act was lacking in that, the same

was struck down. The plea of the Chartered Accountants and the Company

Secretaries to allow them to appear before the Tribunal was declined, as

intricate questions of law and fact were to be decided. This was held to be

part of independence of judicial process. The interference of the

Government in the entire process was found to be impinging upon the

independence and fairness of the Members of the Tribunal. If the Tribunal

was to substitute the High Court, the manner of appointment of a

Chairperson/Member thereof will have to be same as prevalent for

appointment of a Judge of the High Court and so the security of service. In

the process of final determination, Hon'ble the Supreme Court placed

reliance upon a judgment of Privy Council in Hinds v. R., 1977 AC 195.</p><pre id="pre_3">

            regarding the power of the High Court in the matter of ordering

            are vested with the disciplinary control              as well    as

            administrative control over the members of the judicial service

Thereafter, antecedents were to be verified. After receiving the reports, the

matter was referred to Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for concurrence.

The proposal was accepted. Though the appointments were notified, but the

names of the respondent and another candidate in the aforesaid case were

not notified as there were some adverse reports. One of the candidates filed

writ petition in Jharkhand High Court challenging his non-appointment. The

writ petition was dismissed. Another candidate filed writ petition in

Himachal Pradesh High Court impugning the decision of the Central

Government not to appoint him as Judicial Member. The High Court

directed for re-consideration of his case. The judgment of Jharkhand High

Court was upheld, whereas that of Himachal Pradesh High Court was

reversed by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. Verification of antecedents was

found to be an important exercise, which is done before a decision is taken

to strengthen judicial system at the grass root level started in All India

Judges' Association 1st case (supra). It was a writ petition filed by All India

Judges' Association with a prayer for constitution of All India Judicial

Service, enabling provision for which was made in the Constitution of India

with amendment of <a href="/doc/647227/" id="a_89">Article 312</a> by 42nd amendment. Further prayer was for

providing uniform conditions of service for members of the subordinate

judiciary throughout the country. In broader head of uniform conditions of

service throughout the country, the relief was claimed on following counts:

not seriously pressed. 14th report of the Law Commission of India submitted

in the year 1958 was referred to with reference to requirement of practice at

bar before recruitment as Judicial Officer, training after induction in service,

designation, age for retirement, pay scales, allowances, residences and other

facilities. While noticing various aspects with reference to the duties

performed by the Judges, it was observed that Judges do not have an easy

job. They repeatedly do what rest of us seek to avoid; make decisions. It

was further observed that nature of work of a Judicial Officer being

different, the Government can always prescribe a higher pay scale for a

Judicial Officer. It was also noticed that Law Commission report was

submitted way back in the year 1958, but the Government slept over that for

33 long years. It was the reason for Hon'ble the Supreme Court to intervene.

The observations made regarding kind of life, lived by a Judge, are extracted

below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             "45. These prescription for a Judicial Officer, therefore, results

             in a restricted life. Austerity is a quality to be practised by

             every Judge- personally as also in his public functioning. This

             necessarily gives rise to a situation where the Judge must have

             patience, perseverance and painstaking habits. In order that a

             Judge may be able to put in these aspects into his public

             functioning it is absolutely necessary that the Judge enjoys

             freedom    from     personal   worries.      A   reasonable   salary,

             appropriate allowances and manageable living conditions are,

             therefore, required to be provided."

<p id="p_41">121.        The aforesaid directions clearly established the kind of pain

Hon'ble the Supreme Court had taken to go into every minute aspect of the

Judicial Officers' working at the grass root level. And for the judiciary to be

independent, what kind of bare minimum facilities were required to be

given to them so that they do not look for that anywhere else. The directions

by Hon'ble the Supreme Court were required to be complied with, for which

dates were specified.
</p>
<p id="p_42">122.        Thereafter, the matter was taken up in All India Judges'

Association 2nd case (supra). It was a bunch of Review Petitions, Special

Leave Petitions and even a Writ Petition. The review petitions were filed by

Union of India and various States raising objections to the specific

directions given in All India Judges' Association 1st case (supra) to improve

service conditions of the members of subordinate judiciary in the country.

Legal objections were raised by the States referring to Articles 233 and 234

of the Constitution of India claiming that determination of service

conditions of the Judges is in the purview of State Legislature/Government,

but power has been whittled down with specific directions given by Hon'ble

the Supreme Court. The directions resulted in change of administrative

policy, which may entail heavy financial burden. Some of the States may

not be able to bear that. Pay Commissions are set up by the States from time

to time. Specific objections were raised to various directions given in All

India Judges' Association 1st case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_43">123.         Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment strongly

observed that failure to realise the distinction between judicial service and

other services is at the bottom of the hostility displayed by the review

petitioners to the directions given in the judgment. The judicial service is

not service in the sense of 'employment'. The Judges are not employees. As

members of the judiciary, they exercise sovereign judicial power of the

State. The Judges, at whatever level they may be, represent the State and its

authority unlike the administrative executive or the members of the other

services. The members of other services, therefore, cannot be placed at par

with members of the judiciary, either constitutionally or functionally.

Judicial independence cannot be secured by making mere solemn

proclamation about it. It has to be secured both in substance and in practice.

Those who are in want cannot be free. Self-reliance is the foundation of

independence. Under the Constitution, judiciary is above the administrative

executive and any attempt to place it at a par with the administrative

executive has to be discouraged.
</p>
<p id="p_44">124.         With reference to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_90">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India, it

was observed that merely because that Article gives power to the executive

and the legislature to prescribe service conditions of the judiciary, does not

mean that the judiciary should have no say in the matter. It would be against

the spirit of the Constitution to deny any role to the judiciary in that behalf,

for theoretically it would not be impossible for the executive or the

legislature to turn and twist the tail of the judiciary by using the said power.

Such a consequence would be against one of the seminal mandates of the

Constitution, namely, to maintain independence of the judiciary. It was

with this reference that idea of an independent Commission exclusively

constituted for judicial service was coined. Hon'ble the Supreme Court had

to intervene where the authorities failed to discharge their duties for

decades. The directions were explained to mean that these are essentially for

evolvement of an appropriate national policy by the Government with

regard to    judiciary's condition. The directions are merely aids and

incidental to, which are both reasonable and necessary. All the issues were

evaluated in detail and finally the directions were summed up in para No. 52

thereof, which is extracted below:

            associated with the selection process and his advice should

            accepting it, which reasons should be recorded in writing.

            evaluate the record of the judicial officer for his continued

            utility well within time before he attains the age of 58 years by

            following the procedure for the compulsory retirement under

            the Service rules applicable to him and give him the benefit of

            the extended superannuation age from 58 to 60 years only if he

            is found fit and eligible to continue in service. In case he is not

            found fit and eligible, he should be compulsorily retired on his

conditions of service of staff in the subordinate courts. It was found to be

appropriate for proper and effective functioning of the subordinate courts.

Final decision taken by the State Governments in this regard was to be

reported to the court. Hon'ble the Supreme Court also considered it

necessary to require all the States to file comprehensive status reports of

action taken by them to implement the directions given in All India Judges'

concerned were also requested to appear in court on the next hearing and

relevance in the functioning of subordinate courts. It is directly connected

with administration of justice and thereby with rule of law, hence, the matter

requires examination in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_91">Article 32</a> of the

Constitution of India. In case need be, <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_92">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of

were requested to furnish detailed status reports regarding compliance of

the previous order passed.

<p id="p_61">129.        Thereafter, the matter was considered by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra), which was a writ

judgment notices that this is third round before the Supreme Court. The

directions given in All India Judges' Association 1st case (supra) were

noticed and also the fact that number of them had been implemented. The

judgment also refers to All India Judges' Association 2nd case (supra) and

the directions given therein. Various recommendations made by Shetty

Commission were noticed, which included appointments to higher judicial

service and inter-se seniority amongst the promoted and directly recruited

officers. In para No. 27 of the judgment, the recommendations made by

Shetty Commission with regard to method of recruitment were considered.

</p><p id="p_62">130.        One of the important aspect considered therein was regarding

method of recruitment in the cadre of higher judicial service, i.e., District

Judges and the Additional District Judges. Noticing that at present there

were two sources of recruitment, namely, by promotion and direct

recruitment and the subordinate judiciary is the foundation of the edifice of

judicial system, it was opined that like any other foundation, it should

become as strong as possible. The weight of the judicial system essentially

rests on the subordinate judiciary. Hon'ble the Supreme Court was

conscious of the fact that keeping in view the independence of judicial

system, they had directed for constitution of an independent pay

commission and to examine other facilities to be provided to the judicial

officers. At the same time, it was required that judicial officers,

hardworking as they are, become more efficient. They are up-date in

knowledge of law. Establishment of judicial academies was also

recommended by Justice Shetty Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_63">131.        Hon'ble the Supreme Court was of the opinion that there have

to be certain minimum standards, objectively adjudged, for officers who are

to enter higher judicial service as Additional District Judges and District

Judges. While agreeing with the recommendation made by Justice Shetty

Commission that 25% of the posts of the higher judicial service be filled up

by way of direct recruitment after holding a competitive examination, both

written and viva-voce. Regarding objective method of testing suitability of

the subordinate judicial officer for promotion to the higher judicial service,

Hon'ble the Supreme Court opined that some incentive needs to be given to

relatively junior and other officers to improve and to compete with each

other, so as to excel and get quicker promotion. This will result in

improvement in calibre of the members of judicial service. Out of 75% posts

meant for promotion quota, it was directed that 50% of the total posts shall

be filled in by promotion on the principle of merit-cum-seniority. For this

purpose, the High Courts were required to devise and evolve a test in order

to ascertain and examine legal knowledge of those candidates and to assess

their continued efficiency with adequate knowledge of case law. The

remaining 25% of the posts are to be filled up by promotion strictly on the

basis of merit through a limited departmental competitive examination, for

which Civil Judges (Senior Division), with at least 5 years of service are to

be eligible. The High Courts were directed to frame the rules in this regard.

After discussion, the directions as given by Hon'ble the Supreme Court are

extracted below:
</p>
            The relevant parts thereof are extracted below:<p id="p_64">

</p><p id="p_65">            "27. Another question which falls for consideration is the

            method of recruitment to the posts in the cadre of Higher

            Judicial Service i.e. District Judges and Additional District

            Judges. At the present moment, there are two sources for

            recruitment to Higher Judicial Service, namely, by promotion

            from amongst the members of the Subordinate Judicial Service

            and by direct recruitment. The Subordinate Judiciary is the

            foundation of the edifice of the Judicial system. It is, therefore,

            imperative, like any other foundation, that it should become as

            strong as possible. The weight on the Judicial system

            essentially rests on the Subordinate Judiciary. While we have

            accepted the recommendation of the Shetty Commission which

            will result in the increase in the pay scale of the Subordinate

            Judiciary, it is at the same time necessary that the Judicial

            officers, hard-working as they are, become more efficient. It is

            imperative that they keep abreast of knowledge of law and the

            latest pronouncements, and it is for this reason that the Shetty

            Commission has recommended the establishment of a Judicial

            Academy which is very necessary. At the same time, we are of

            the opinion that there has to be certain minimum standards,

            objectively adjudged, for officers who are to enter the Higher

            Judicial Service as Additional District Judges and District

            Judges. While we agree with the Shetty Commission that the

            recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service i.e. the District Judge

            Cadre from amongst the advocate should be 25 per cent and the

            process of recruitment is to be by a competitive examination,

            both written and viva voce, we are of the opinion that there

            should be an objective method of testing the suitability of the

            Subordinate Judicial officers for promotion to the Higher

            Judicial Service. Furthermore, there should also be an incentive

            amongst the relatively junior and other officers to improve and

            to compete with each other so as to excel and get quicker

            promotion. In this way, we expect that the calibre of the

            members of the Higher Judicial Service will further improve. In

            order to achieve this, while the ratio of 75 per cent appointment

            by promotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to the

            Higher Judicial Service is maintained, we are, however, of the

            opinion that there should be two methods as far as appointment

            by promotion is concerned: 50 per cent of the total posts in the

            Higher Judicial Service must be filled by promotion on the

            basis of principle of merit-cum- seniority. For this purpose, the

            High Courts should devise and evolve a test in order to

            ascertain and examine the legal knowledge of those candidates

            and to assess their continued efficiency with adequate

            knowledge of case law. The remaining 25 per cent of the posts

inter-se seniority of the officers of superior judicial service. It was noticed

that there had been constant discontentment amongst the officers with

regard to their seniority.

<p id="p_73">134.         Noticing the fact that there is lot of litigation amongst the

officers regarding inter-se seniority and with experience that there is least

amount of litigation where the roster system is followed and one of the

methods to avoid litigation and bring about certainty is by specifying quotas

in relation to posts and not in relation to vacancies. A direction was issued

to all High Courts to suitably amend the seniority Rules on the basis of

roster principle as approved by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_94">R. K.

Sabharwal and others v. State of Punjab and others</a>, (1995) 2 SCC 745, as

early as possible, in any case by 31.3.2003. The recommendation for giving

any weightage of service rendered in subordinate judiciary after promotion

to higher judicial service in determination of their seniority vis-a-vis the

direct recruits was dis-approved. The relevant paras of the judgment dealing

with the issue are extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">             29. Experience has shown that there has been a constant

             discontentment amongst the members of the Higher Judicial

             Service in regard to their seniority in service. For over three

             decades large number of cases have been instituted in order to

             decide the relative seniority from the officers recruited from the

             two different sources, namely, promotees and direct recruits.</blockquote><p id="p_74">

</p><p id="p_75">             As a result of the decision today, there will, in a way, be three

             ways of recruitment to Higher Judicial Service. The quota for

             promotion which we have prescribed is 50 per cent by

             following the principle "merit-cum- seniority", 25 per cent

            strictly on merit by limited departmental competitive

            examination and 25 per cent by direct recruitment. Experience

            has also shown that the least amount of litigation in the

            country, where quota system in recruitment exists, in so far as

            seniority is concerned, is where a roster system is followed. For

            example, there is, as per the Rules of the Central Government,

            a 40-point roster which has been prescribed which deals with

            the quotas for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Hardly,

            if ever, there has been a litigation amongst the members of the

            Service after their recruitment as per the quotas, the seniority is

            fixed by the roster points and irrespective of the fact as to when

            a person is recruited. When roster system is followed, there is

            no question of any dispute arising. The 40-point roster has been

            considered and approved by this Court in <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_95">R. K. Sabharwal and

            Ors., v. State of Punjab</a> reported in [1995] 2 SCC 745. One of

            the methods of avoiding any litigation and bringing about

            certainty in this regard is by specifying quotas in relation to

            posts and not in relation to the vacancies. This is the basic

            principle on the basis of which the 40 point roster works. We

            direct the High Courts to suitably amend and promulgate

            Seniority Rules on the basis of the roster principle as approved

            by this Court in R.K. Sabharwal 's case (supra) as early as

            possible. We hope that as a result thereof there would be no

            further dispute in the fixation of seniority. It is obvious that this

            system can only apply prospectively except where under the

            relevant Rules seniority is to be determined on the basis of

             the members of the Higher Judicial Service has to be protected

             but the roster has to be evolved for the future. Appropriate

             rules and methods will be adopted by the High Courts and

</p><p id="p_77">135.        Thereafter, the matter was considered in All India Judges'

Association 4th case (supra), in interim application filed in earlier decided

matter. Different High Courts shared their experience as to why they were

not able to fill up 25% of the posts in Superior Judicial Service cadre, which

were ear-marked to be filled by way of limited departmental competitive

examination. It was     either on account of non-holding of test or non-

availability of candidates or for other reasons.     Some of the High Courts

pointed out that there was no provision in the Rules to fill up the posts so

remaining vacant by way of regular promotion or otherwise. Some of the

States were in favour of reducing the quota of 25% of limited departmental

competitive examination, whereas opinion of some of the States was that

quota should be allowed to continue and in case any posts remained vacant

in that quota, it could be filled up by way of regular promotion. In some of

the States, Civil Judges (Senior Division) were being promoted before even

completion of five years of service, hence, the posts meant for limited

departmental competitive examination, remained vacant.           Again with

experience and inputs from different High Courts, Hon'ble the Supreme

Court opined that suitable amendment be made in the Rules to reduce the

quota of limited departmental competitive examination from 25% to 10%. It

was directed that 'henceforth' only 10% of the cadre strength of the District

Judges shall be filled up by way of limited departmental competitive

examination. If any post is not filled up under 10% quota, the same shall be

filled up by regular promotion. The existing service Rules were directed to

be amended positively w.e.f. 1.1.2011. In case the Rules are not amended by

that time, the order was to prevail and all further recruitments from 1.1.2011

were to be made in terms of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme

Court. Date was fixed apparently considering the previous experience where

amendment in the Rules, as directed by Hon'ble the Supreme Court was not

made within the time granted. Relevant paras thereof are extracted below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">            "3. After this judgment, High Courts have amended Service

            Rules and 25% posts of District Judges are being filled up by

            the Limited Departmental Competitive Examination. But many

            High Courts found it difficult to fill up 25 per cent through such

            process. In some of the States as many as 50 posts of District

            Judges, to be filled up by the said exercise, remained vacant and

            there is no alternative method provided by which, these vacant

            posts could be filled up. Some of the States, for example, in the

            promotion. But in many States, there are no such Rules to fill

            up these vacancies. Most of the States are in favour of reducing

            the percentage from 25 per cent of Limited Departmental

            Competitive Examination, but many of the States, for example,

            States of Gujarat, Delhi, M. P., J&amp;K and H. P. maintained that

            this 25 per cent should be continued but they are also of the

            view, in case there are vacant posts then it be filled up by

            regular promotion. For the time being, in many of the States,

it has appellate jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters, being the

case (supra), Hon'ble the Supreme Court examined the issue to find out an

acceptable constitutional balance between free press and the administration

of justice. Theory of order of postponement of publication was devised. The

High Courts and the Supreme Court, being courts of record, were held to be

competent to pass postponement order under their inherent jurisdiction.

Such orders would fall within "reasonable restrictions" under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_115">Article 19(2)</a>

of the Constitution of India. The principle underlying postponement order is

to     prevent possible contempt. The power to postpone publicity in

appropriate cases is a preventive measure without disturbing its contents.

Such orders direct postponement of publication for a limited period. Such

measures protect the media from getting prosecuted or punished for

committing contempt. It was opined that precedents of the Supreme Court

uniform rules. Relevant paras therefrom are extracted below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">            "79. Punjab and Haryana have a peculiar problem since they

            seniority of officers in one State by one test and that of officers

            in the other State by an opposite test. In Punjab, continuous

            officiation on a post in the service is the criterion of seniority.

            In Haryana, the date of confirmation is the governing factor.

            Can the two Governors not come together and take a joint

            decision applying a uniform test of seniority of their judicial

SC 1910, a Constitution Bench of Hon'ble the Supreme Court considered

the issue whether the petitioner therein had a right to be promoted as Deputy

Inspector General of Police merely on the ground of his seniority. Noticing

the fact that the post in question was a selection post, it was opined that

promotion to selection grade or selection post is to be based primarily on

merit and not on seniority alone. Hon'ble the Supreme Court opined that

trouble with only seniority system is that it is so objective that it fails to

take into account personal merit. This system is fair to every official except

the best ones; an official has nothing to gain or loss except when he does

not actually becomes so inefficient that disciplinary action has to be taken

against him. The principal object of a promotion system is to secure the best

possible incumbents for the higher positions, while maintaining the morale

<blockquote id="blockquote_52">            In our opinion, the respondents are right in their contention that

            the ranking or position in the Gradation List does not confer

            any right on the petitioner to be promoted to selection posts and

            that it is a well-established rule that promotion to selection

            grades or selection posts is to be based primarily on merit and

            not on seniority alone. The principle is that when the claims of

            officers to selection posts is under consideration, seniority

            should not be regarded except where the merit of the officers is

            judged to be equal and no other criterion is therefore

            available. .......

            (9) ...... Mr. N. C. Chatterjee argued that the introduction of the

            idea of merit into the procedure of promotion brings in an

            element of personal evaluation, and that personal evaluation

            open is the door to the abuses of nepotism and favouritism, and

            so, there was a. violation of the constitutional guarantee under

            Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution. We are unable to accept

            this argument as well-founded. The question of a proper

            promotion policy depends on various conflicting factors. It is

            obvious that the only method in which absolute objectivity can

            be ensured is for all promotions to be made entirely on grounds

            of seniority. That means that if a post falls vacant it is filled by

            the person who has served longest in the post immediately

            below. But the trouble with the seniority system is that it is so

            objective that it fails to take any account of personal merit. As a

            system it is fair to every official except the best ones; an

            official has nothing to win or lose provided he does not actually

            become so inefficient that disciplinary action has to be taken

            against him. But, though the system is fair to the officials

            concerned, it is a heavy burden on the public and a great strain

            on the efficient handling of public business. The problem

            therefore is how to ensure reasonable prospect of advancement

            to all officials and at the same time to protect the public interest

            in having posts filled by the most able men? In other words, the

            question is how to find a correct balance between seniority and

            merit in a proper promotion-policy. In this connection Leonard

                   merit. For the merit system ought to apply as specifically

                   in making promotions as in original recruitment.

                   Employees often prefer the rule of seniority, by which

                   the eligible longest in service is automatically awarded

                   the promotion. Within limits, seniority is entitled to

                   consideration as one criterion of selection. It tends to

                   eliminate favouritism or the suspicion thereof; and

                   experience is certainly a factor in the making of a

                   successful employee. Seniority is given most weight in

                   promotions from the lowest to other subordinate

                   positions. As employees move up the ladder of

                   responsibility, it is entitled to less and less weight. When

                   seniority is made the sole determining factor, at any

                   level. it is a dangerous guide. It does not follow that the

                   employee longest in service in a particular trade is best

                   suited for promotion to a higher grade; the very opposite

                   may be true".

be assessed either by subjecting the candidates to a written examination or

interview or by assessment of their work performance during the previous

years or by a combination of either two or all the three of the aforesaid

methods. It was held that prescribing          qualifying marks to ascertain

minimum merit necessary for discharging functions of the higher post is not

violative of the concept of promotion by merit-cum-seniority.

promotion as a matter of right by virtue of his seniority alone. If he is found

unfit to discharge the duties of higher post, he may be ignored. A senior,

though less meritorious, may get promotion as the concept of comparative

merit is missing, in case both are found to be having minimum necessary

merit. Whereas the principle of 'merit-cum-seniority' puts greater emphasis

on merit and ability, and seniority plays a less significant role. Seniority is

given weightage only when merit and ability are more or less equal.

<p id="p_109">149.        Is public interest more important than the personal interest ? In

fact, this apparently was the idea when Hon'ble the Supreme Court, while

carrying out mammoth exercise, in All India Judges' Association 3rd case

(supra) directed for improvement of infrastructural facilities for the judicial

system and pay and other allowances for the judicial officers by giving more

weightage to merit than seniority. As an officer goes to the higher position,

his responsibilities increase. The judicial officers are in a system where they

are appointed to judge others' decisions. So in the system, criteria of merit

has to be on the top. They are moving on upper side in a pyramid; will have

more people to command and guide, deal with important matters and so

have to lead by example. Unless the leader is meritorious, he may not be

able to lead his team.
</p>
<p id="p_110">150.         Not only the merit, stress of Hon'ble the Supreme Court was

also on the fact that these officers have upto date knowledge of law, which

is required to be tested even for the purpose of regular promotion, besides

any other quotas. The judicial pronouncements have importance of which

upto date knowledge is required as law is to be implemented in terms of the

final interpretation by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. The idea is to make the

system more responsive and independent to serve the needs of the society. If

an officer is upto date in law and correctly applies the same in the facts of a

case, consequent order results in lesser litigation and lesser harassment of

the litigants. The parties will be satisfied if correct orders are passed. The

courts are already over-loaded with litigation. In this manner, certain

percentage of litigation could be avoided. As one goes up, merit should be

the only criteria. It brings change in attitude. Without consideration of

merit, if the promotions are to be made on the basis of seniority alone, it is

not a good sign for a progressive society, rather, it will derail the system

down. The people will move on a beaten track, with no improvement. Same

ideas will flow from bottom to top. Seniority is experience alone, may be

with no merit. We are facing new challenges. New ideas are required, hence,

the merit is important. Many of the judicial officers in the superior judicial

service may have chance of elevation even to this court or the Apex Court,

hence, there cannot and should not be any compromise on merit. A judge is

one man machine in judicial system. Judges' stock in trade is their intellect.

Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra)

did not leave the matter as such after dealing with infrastructure and

facilities for the Judges and giving more importance to merit. It also

directed for setting up of Judicial Academies to up-date knowledge of the

judicial officers in law. If in any system, promotion is assured merely on the

basis of seniority, there would be no incentive to work. With the passage of

time, even more meritorious will become lethargic. They will also adopt the

track adopted by their other colleagues, even though they had the potential

sometimes, which brings negativity as well. By giving merit supermacy, the

entire effort is to make the foundation of the judicial system, which is the

basic structure of the Constitution, strong.
</p>
<p id="p_111">151.         With the aforesaid discussions, Hon'ble the Supreme Court in

All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra) provided that even regular

promotion have to be on the basis of merit-cum-seniority and passing of a

suitability test. A test was devised inter-alia to test 'up-to-date knowledge of

law' of the officer seeking promotion. Such knowledge needs to be tested

just before the promotion is made. It is not to be treated as mere basic

qualification such as graduation or post-graaduation or a degree in law

which provide you basic knowledge of a subject. The words 'up-to-date

knowledge of law' have to be given true and purposive meaning. Any other

view will defeat the underlying object. A new quota for promotion was

provided which was to be filled by way of limited departmental competitive

examination. For this serving officers were made eligible.</p><pre id="pre_10">

            Reg. Test for promotion

</pre><p id="p_112">152.        In All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra), Hon'ble the

Supreme Court provided that 50% posts meant for promotion are to be filled

on the basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority and passing of a suitability

test. For this purpose, the High Courts were to devise and evolve a test in

order to ascertain and examine legal knowledge of those candidates and to

assess their continued efficiency and adequate knowledge of case law.

Though provision for test and viva-voce for regular promotion was made in

the 2007 Haryana Rules notified prior to the 2007 Punjab Rules, however,

there is no provision to that effect in the 2007 Punjab Rules. As has come

on record, the Rules were substantially changed by the State of Punjab at its

own level without consultation with            High Court. The conduct is

deprecable. Apparently, some one played mischief at some level.

</p><p id="p_113">153.        In Punjab, promotions were made after considering service

record of the officers. It was for the first time that in the meeting of the

Recruitment Committee held on 24.2.2011, holding of test for regular

promotion was proposed. Subsequently, the criteria was devised. It was

approved by the Full Court and is being followed. There is no provision in

the 2007 Punjab Rules till date for holding of written suitability test.

Thereafter, the Rule Committee recommended for amendment of Rule 8 of

the 2007 Punjab Rules to that effect on 19.11.2012. After approval by the

Full Court on 29.1.2013, proposed amendment was sent to the Government

on 2.3.2013 and is still pending there.

regular promotions till 2011 when suitability test was prescribed and is

being held, all promotions were made merely by considering the service

record of the officers with no bench mark, however, their promotions as

such having not been challenged, this Court is not going into that aspect.

</p><p id="p_115">155.          The effect of change in criteria by Hon'ble the Supreme Court

from seniority-cum-merit to merit-cum-seniority and passing of suitability

test was evident in the promotions made from 2011 onwards. When the

suitability test was held. Either some of the officers did not appear in the

test though they were at a position within the seniority considering the

number of vacancies or certain officers similarly placed could not qualify

the test and as a result the officers, who were far lower in seniority were

promoted. The position which finally emerged in the written test held on

18.3.2011 in Punjab was that there were 15 vacancies for promotion on the

basis of merit-cum-seniority and passing of a suitability test. 45 officers as

per their seniority were called for written suitability test. 21 officers passed

the suitability test, whereas 24 officers either could not pass the test or

remained absent. It is interesting to note that out of              15 officers

recommended for promotion, only four were within first 15 officers as per

the seniority list. The last officer, who was promoted against 15 vacancies

was, in fact, at Sr. No. 39 in the seniority list. Similar position continued

thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_116">156.          The aforesaid fact clearly establishes that there was purpose for

prescribing the suitability test even for regular promotion in the judgment

of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case

(supra) and the purpose could be achieved only after 2011 onwards.</p><pre id="pre_11">

that date onwards, there were three sources of recruitment, namely, by way

of promotion on the principle of merit-cum- seniority and passing of a

suitability test, through limited departmental competitive examination and

direct recruitment. The quotas were prescribed for each of the source. Final

directions by Hon'ble the Supreme Court as contained in para No. 27(1),

which have been incorporated in the 1963 Punjab Rules as such, have to be

read in conjunction with discussions in the judgment. The discussion on the

issue in para No. 26 of the judgment clearly provides that percentage fixed

for the purpose of quota for three different sources was with reference to

total posts and not vacancies. As was the information furnished at the time

of hearing, no effort was made to fill up the posts reserved for limited

departmental competitive examination as no such examination was held

after the amendment of the 1963 Punjab Rules on 15.1.2004 till such time

those were repealed and replaced by the 2007 Punjab Rules, which were

were governed by the 1963 Punjab Rules. Rule 8 thereof provided for

recruitment to service. Two sources were provided, namely, direct

recruitment and promotion with quotas prescribed as 25% and 75%,

respectively. Ten years' service was required to be eligible for promotion,

whereas for direct recruitment, minimum age of 35 years with maximum of

45 years was required. Ten years' practice as Advocate or Pleader was

mandatory for direct recruitment. While considering the working conditions

of the members of subordinate judiciary, Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All

relatively junior officers to improve and compete with each other, so as to

excel and get quicker promotion, provided for 25% of the total posts as

on the basis of merit through limited departmental competitive examination

of Civil Judges (Senior Division) with not less than 5 years' qualifying

Punjab Rules. It specifically excludes application of the provisions of the

amendment, the judgment was to apply from 1.1.2011. The amendment

Punjab Rules governing the service at the relevant time was made in the

year 2004 with reference to prescribing three different quotas for

recruitment to the Superior Judicial Service, however, no amendment was

made in terms of the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court for

providing roster for the purpose of determination of inter-se seniority with

reference to the number of posts and not in relation to the vacancies. The

1963 Punjab Rules were replaced by the 2007 Punjab Rules. (The manner in

which the 2007 Punjab Rules were promulgated has been separately dealt

with in para No. 160 of the judgment). In these Rules, Rule 7 provides for

method of appointment. The posts are to be filled up as per roster attached

as Appendix 'B'.
</p>
<p id="p_176">173.        Rule 12 of the 2007 Punjab Rules provides that original

seniority of the promoted officers from PCS (Judicial Branch) shall not be

disturbed. Inter-se seniority of out-of-turn promoted officers shall be in the

order of merit as determined by the High Court. Inter-se seniority of the

direct recruits shall be on the basis of merit as determined by the High

Court. Proviso to Rule 12 provides that if an officer has been promoted on

ad-hoc basis on a vacant post belonging to out-of-turn promotee officer or

direct appointee, he shall have no right on the said post. Such an officer

shall not be allowed to claim addition of that period of ad-hoc service for

the purpose of seniority. Nothing was provided as to how inter-se seniority

of the members of the cadre recruited from three different sources was to be

determined. This was despite the fact that Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All

India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra) directed for providing roster for

the purpose. As emerged during the course of hearing, in fact, the High

Court had proposed similar set of Rules to the States of Punjab and Haryana


                             124 of 148
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">            ::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2017 09:31:15 :::</span>
 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                      [125]

for notification. The State of Haryana notified the Rules with some minor

changes, whereas the State of Punjab notified substantially changed Rules

without any consultation with the High Court. In fact, in the process the

mandate of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd

case (supra) was violated by the State.
</p>
<p id="p_177">174.        Rule 23 of the 2007 Punjab Rules provides that in respect of the

matters which are not specifically provided in these Rules, the members of

the service shall be governed by the 1994 Punjab Rules as amended from

time to time. Both the provisos attached with this Rule are important. First

proviso provides for Rules, which shall not be affected by the 1994 Rules.

These relate to   age for recruitment, method of appointment, seniority,

probation, death-cum-retirement benefits, superannuation from service and

administrative control, as contained in Rules 5, 7, 12, 13, 19, 20 and 21 of

the 2007 Punjab Rules. This exclusion is important as all these Rules

contain main conditions of service, which are special in the case of judicial

officers and could not be over-ridden by general rules. Addition of Rule 12

in first proviso to Rule 23 cannot be said to be superfluous and without any

meaning.    Though the State had not notified the Rules in the manner

approved and forwarded by the High Court, which were in line with the

directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges'

Association 3rd case (supra), but still it may be conscious of the fact that

directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court with reference to inter-se

seniority of the members of the cadre, would be violated if the 1994 Punjab

Rules are made applicable for determining inter-se seniority of the members

of the cadre coming from three different sources. This intention is fortified

by second proviso to Rule 23(1) of the 2007 Punjab Rules, which provides


                             125 of 148

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                         [126]

that conditions of service, as determined by Shetty Commission, shall have

an over-riding effect. The Rules notifying authority was conscious of the

fact that there are certain special conditions of service recommended by

Shetty Commission, which were considered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court

from time to time. Some of the recommendations were accepted as such;

some were not accepted; whereas some were accepted with certain

modifications. Besides others, Shetty Commission had                 made certain

recommendations with regard to inter-se seniority of direct recruits and

promotees. The recommendations in the same manner were not accepted by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra),

but were modified by providing that certainty be brought in this regard by

specifying quotas in relation to posts and not in relation to vacancies. (This

position was reiterated by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in a case              from

Jharkhand in <a href="/doc/121803967/" id="a_144">Srikant Roy and others v. State of Jharkhand and others</a>, 2016

(12) Scale 147). The High Courts were directed to amend service rules and

promulgate seniority rules on the basis of roster principle, as early as

possible, however, to be applied prospectively. It was expected that needful

shall be done by 31.3.2003. Hon'ble the Supreme Court was of the opinion

that roster system will ensure fair play to all while improving efficiency in

the service.
</p>
<p id="p_178">175.           Rule 8 of the       1994 Punjab      Rules provides that inter-se

seniority of persons appointed to the posts in any cadre shall be determined

by continuos length of service on such posts. This principle has been

applied while determining inter-se seniority of the members of the cadre.

The note appended to Rule 8 provides that seniority of persons appointed on

purely provisional basis or on ad-hoc basis shall be determined as and when

they are regularly appointed keeping in view the dates of such regular

appointments.
</p>
<p id="p_179">176.         It is a peculiar case in which there are judgments of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court giving certain specific directions to the High Courts to frame

Rules governing the cadre of the judicial officers in a particular manner,

with an object to bring uniformity throughout the country. The Rules,

according to the petitioners, having not been framed strictly in terms of the

directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court, hence, defiance for non-

compliance of the judgments. In such a situation, the only course open is to

harmoniously construe the Rules keeping in view the contents thereof along

with the directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court, which are binding.

</p><p id="p_180">177.        As far as the contention raised by learned counsel appearing for

the regularly promoted officers [Rule 7(3)(a)] that second proviso to Rule

23 of the 2007 Punjab Rules, which gives over-riding effect to the

recommendations made by Shetty Commission, to the extent that those

recommendations have to be taken as such and applied here, irrespective of

the fact as to whether those were approved, disapproved or modified by the

Supreme Court, we find the contention to be totally mis-conceived. There

were number of recommendations made by Shetty Commission, which were

considered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court from time to time. Some were

accepted as such; some were rejected in totality; whereas some were

modified. In our opinion, only those recommendations made by Shetty

Commission, which have been finally               approved with or without

modification by Hon'ble the Supreme Court, which can be read in second

proviso to Rule 23 of the 2007 Punjab Rules, for giving over-riding effect.

If the contention as raised is accepted, that would mean violating the

judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court, which are binding on all courts

subordinate thereto in view of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_145">Article 141</a> of the Constitution of India and

would result in setting a very bad precedent.
</p>
<p id="p_181">178.        Hon'ble     the    Supreme      Court,    while     modifying   the

recommendations made by Shetty Commission with reference to inter-se

seniority of the officers, had directed that for future, the same has to be

determined by preparing 40-point roster, as approved in R. K. Sabharwal's

case (supra).    Hence, final dictum of Hon'ble the Supreme Court with

reference to inter-se seniority of the officers of the cadre, while considering

the recommendations made by Shetty Commission have to be read with

Rule 23 of the 2007 Punjab Rules and the seniority list has to be framed

accordingly. In fact, the roster as provided at Appendix-B with the Rules is

strictly in terms of directions issued by Hon'ble the Supreme Court. There

had been various amendments in the 2007 Punjab Rules after the judgment

of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case

(supra). Even at that stage,        issue regarding determination of inter-se

seniority was not raised. Presumably, even this court was conscious of the

fact that in terms of second proviso to Rule 23 of 2007 Punjab Rules,

judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd

case (supra) was applicable for determination of inter-se seniority of the

members of the cadre coming from three different sources. The fact of the

matter is that even this court, while recommending the Rules to the State

Government for notification in the year 2006, had provided for such a

roster. Rule 10(1)(d) therein clearly provided for that. In fact, in Haryana,

where same Rules were notified, provide for that. Though identical roster

has been provided as Appendix 'B', but reference has been given to Rule 7

however, shall be applicable even for determination of seniority.

Association 4th case (supra), was made vide notification dated 29.4.2013. In

any case, as the direction of Hon'ble the Supreme Court was that even in the

absence of amendment of the Rules in line with the judgment, the directions

with effect from that date.

recruitment.

<p id="p_207">187.           From 15.1.2004, either under the 1963 Punjab Rules or under

the 2007 Punjab Rules, 50% posts were to be filled up by way of promotion

on merit-cum-seniority and passing of a suitability test; 25% posts were to

be filled up by way of limited departmental competitive examination and

25% by way of direct recruitment.

regular promotion, whereas undisputedly in the case in hand there was no

such enabling provision. If the contention raised by learned counsel for

regularly promoted officers is accepted to the extent that vacant posts in the

quota of limited departmental competitive examination upto 31.12.2010 are

to be treated to be diverted against regular promotion quota from the very

beginning when the quota was created, that would mean reading something

in the Rules, which is not provided therein. This is not even the direction by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_210">190.        The direction is not to treat the quota of limited departmental

competitive examination reduced from 25% to 10% from day one, namely,

the date on which the amendments were made, rather a specific date has

been given. On one side, the contention is sought to be raised by the

respondents is that the Rules are sacrosanct and on the other hand, the plea

is sought to be taken that despite there being no specific direction by

Hon'ble the Supreme Court, the Rules should be read differently than what

has been provided therein. The judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court

cannot be read in the manner suggested by regularly promoted officers. If it

has to be given a meaning that quota of promotion through             limited

departmental competitive examination would reduce from 25% to 10% from

day one, the consequence would be making appointment of persons in

excess of 10% during that period in some States, to be illegal.

</p><p id="p_211">191.        The fact that Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All India Judges'

Association 4th case (supra), while reducing the quota of promotion through

limited departmental competitive examination from 25% to 10% provided

that un-filled vacancies in that quota be shifted to regular promotion quota,

clearly means that these are independent quotas and not to be merged

together for calculating the posts to be filled up by intermingling the both.</p><pre id="pre_19">

vacancies in that quota will shift to the regular promotion quota only w.e.f.

under consideration before Hon'ble the Supreme Court was right of the

officers promoted against the quota meant for direct recruits. It pertains to

judicial service. In Bihar, there are two sources of recruitment to the higher

superior judicial service, namely, by direct recruitment and by promotion.

1/3rd posts are to be filled up by direct recruitment, whereas 2/3rd posts by

promotion. Direct recruitments were not regularly made and the posts were

often filled by promotion. As there was delay in the process of direct

recruitment, the matter came to the court. A direction was issued for filling

up the posts for direct recruitment quota. At the same time, certain regular

promotions were made. When the advertisement for direct recruitment was

issued, the candidates, who were working against promotion quota were

already more than their share. It was opined that promotees could not be

given posts, which are meant for direct recruits quota, even if the posts had

been lying vacant and there was some delay in appointments. The

promotees, who had been adjusted against the posts meant for direct recruits

quota, have to revert back to the position from which they were promoted.

Instead of taking hard step to rescind order of promotion, the concerned

High Court in that case on the administrative side had taken a decision to

treat these officers promoted against the subsequent quota from their source.

However, they were not held entitled to seniority from the date of their

actual promotion. Relevant paras of the judgment are extracted below:

            which decision, in our opinion, is legally correct and sound,

            there was absolutely no scope for giving promotion to the

            contesting respondents in the vacancies, which did not fall in

            the quota of promotees but fell within the quota earmarked for

            direct recruits. The High Court had issued clear directions in

            the case of K.P. Verma that vacancies meant for recruitment

            from amongst advocates should never be filled up by

            promotees even on the ground that the posts are lying vacant

            due to the delay caused by the appointment procedure and

            further if any post out of that lying vacant from the quota of

            direct recruits had been filled up or is filled up by promotion,

            such promotee will revert immediately to its original position

            in the service from which he had              been promoted.   The

            promotion order passed in favour of the                  contesting

            respondents on 30.4.1991 was, therefore, liable to be

            cancelled. However, instead of taking this decision, which

            would       have naturally meant reverting the contesting

            respondents back to their original position, they were allowed

            to continue treating them as        promoted against subsequent

            quota of promotees. In such circumstances there is absolutely

            no scope for treating the contesting respondents as senior to

            the appellants who are all direct recruits.

 CWP No. 1056 of 2016                                          [140]

            being well settled that the temporary posts have also to be

            counted for determining the one-third quota of direct recruits,

            the promotion given to the contesting respondents was not in

            accordance     with law.      Instead of taking the harsh step of

            rescinding their order of promotion the Patna High Court, on

            the administrative side, took the             decision to treat them

            promoted against subsequent quota of promotees. Therefore,

            the contesting respondents can under no circumstances claim

            seniority over the appellants and the view to the contrary taken

            by the Jharkhand High Court on 29.8.2002 on administrative

            side and also in the judgment and order dated 1.4.2003, which

            is the subject-matter of challenge in the present appeal, is

            wholly erroneous in law."         [Emphasis supplied]

their quota in the Rules was considered by a Constitution Bench of Hon'ble

the Supreme Court in Ajit Singh and others (II)'s              case (supra). The

conclusion arrived at was that it was axiomatic in service jurisprudence that

any promotions made wrongly in excess of any quota are to be treated as ad

hoc. It applies to reservation quota as much as it applies to direct and

promotees. The persons wrongly promoted in excess of their quota cannot

get additional benefit of seniority. Relevant paragraph thereof is extracted

            direct recruits and promotee cases. If a court decides that in

            order only to remove hardship such roster-point promotees are

            not to face reservations,-- then it would, in our opinion be,

            necessary to hold - consistent with our interpretation of

            Articles 14 and 16(1) - that such promotees cannot plead for

            grant of any additional benefit of seniority flowing from a

            wrong application of the roster. In our view, while courts can

            relieve immediate hardship arising out of a past illegality,

            courts cannot grant additional benefits like seniority which

            have no element of immediate hardship. Thus, while

            promotions in excess of roster made before 10.2.1995 are

            protected, such promotees cannot claim seniority. Seniority in

            the promotional cadre of such excess roster-point promotees

            shall have to be reviewed after 10.2.1995 and will count only

            from the date on which they would have otherwise get normal

            promotion in any future vacancy arising in a post previously

            occupied by a reserved candidate. That disposes of the

            Union of India</a>, 1992 Suppl (1) SCC 272 held that when

            promotion is outside the quota, seniority would be reckoned

            from the date of the vacancy within the quota rendering the

            previous service fortuitous. The previous promotion would be

            regular only from the date of the vacancy within the quota and

            seniority shall be counted from that date and not from the date

            to do justice to the promotees, it would not be proper to do

            injustice to the direct recruits.     The rule of quota being a

            statutory one, it must be strictly implemented and it is

            impermissible for the authorities concerned to deviate from the

against that, 58 officers were already working, hence, these were five in

excess. When the quota under Rule 7(3)(a) (regular promotion) was already

full, any promotions made in that quota thereafter would be in excess of the

quota, hence, has to be legally termed as ad hoc. These officers get their

placement in the seniority only from the date when vacancy in their quota

will be available. The legal position that any officer appointed in a service

beyond quota will not be entitled to benefit of seniority has been accepted

even by the Committee while recording finding on issue No. 3 framed by it.

</p><p id="p_227">201.        This Court is not going into the requirement or conduct of the

written test as the promotion of the officers as such has not been challenged.

It is settled that there is no estoppel against statute. All the officers are

legally educated and judicially trained and are expected to know rules and

also the the judgments of Hon'ble the Supreme Court, especially pertaining

to their service conditions. Even if they were allowed or not allowed or of

their own did not appear in the written test for promotion by limited

departmental competitive examination, will not have any effect as the fact

remains that they have been promoted against a different quota, where they

are in excess. They may or may not have grievance in that regard, however,

their promotions in a different quota cannot be justified for that reason.

The quotas provided in the Rules for recruitment from different sources

cannot be allowed to be violated or inter-changed, as it will set a bad

precedent, besides being violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_149">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.

appointment to the service, whereas in terms of       judgment of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 3rd case (supra), there are

three sources. It was on that assumption that finding had been recorded

that the promotion quota has to be taken as 75% and direct recruitment as

25% to hold that any vacancy remaining unfilled from limited departmental

competitive examination has to be included in the quota of promotion on the

basis of merit-cum-seniority. There is no enabling provisions in the Rules

for that. It was only after the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in All

India Judges' Association 4th case (supra) that such a diversion was

permissible. The words used in that judgment were "henceforth",

'hereinafter'. The judgment was to take effect from 1.1.2011, even in the

absence of enabling Rules. Aforesaid cut-off date fixed in the judgment of

Hon'ble the Supreme Court is sacrosanct.

notification dated 29.4.2013. A proviso was added to Rule 7(3)(b) of the

2007 Punjab    Rules that in case no suitable candidate is available for

promotion from this category, the available posts shall be filled up by

regular promotion in accordance with the criteria laid down in terms of Rule

7(3)(a) of the 2007 Punjab Rules. The amendment is not retrospective. It is

only retrospective to the extent that there is a direction by Hon'ble the

Supreme Court in All India Judges' Association 4th case (supra) for

implementation thereof with effect from 1.1.2011, even in the absence of

enabling provisions in the Rules. It was with a condition that process of

recruitment should be conducted regularly.

made taking total 80 posts (53+27) in promotion quota ignoring the fact

that there were two different sources even in the promotion quota and both

were independent. The criteria and sources for promotion were different.

Considering that out of total 80 posts coming to the quotas provided in

Rules 7(3)(a) and 7(3)(b) of the 2007 Punjab Rules and the actual working

strength 58 [recruited in terms of quota as provided in Rule 7(3)(a) only],

balance 22 vacancies were divided in the ratio of 50% and 25% to justify

promotion of 15 officers under Rule 7(3)(a) in excess of the quota meant for

them. Hon'ble the Supreme Court no where opined that while considering

the recruitment/ promotion from two different quotas, the posts were to be

clubbed together or the quotas have to be calculated on vacancies. Rather, it

was clearly held that quotas are post based.

<p id="p_231">205.        Once the promotion of officers under Rule 7(3)(a) of the 2007

Punjab Rules on 10.2.2008 are held to be beyond quota, natural

consequence is that they will be termed as ad-hoc. Once ad-hoc and

promoted against the post meant for other quotas, then even as per Rule 12

of the 2007 Punjab Rules, these officers do not get the benefit of that

service for the purpose of seniority. They will get placement in the seniority

only from a date when a post in their quota will be available.
