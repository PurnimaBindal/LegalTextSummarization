BACKGROUND
</p><p id="p_2">1.     The petitioner is a topper of her batch. She pursued her studies in law
at the Army Institute of Law, situate at Mohali (i.e., respondent no.2).
Respondent no. 2, is affiliated to the Punjabi University, at Patiala, and is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C) 360/2013                                                        Page 1 of 56</span>
 recognized by the Bar Council of India.
</p><p id="p_3">1.1    The petitioner, has approached this court for redressal of her
grievance, which stems from the stand taken by respondent No.1 to not,
consider her application, for appointment as a Law Clerk-cum-Research
Assistant (in short LCRA) for the year 2013-14, inter alia, on the following
grounds. First, that respondent No.2 is not empanelled with it. Second, that
the petitioner's application has not been forwarded by respondent No.2.
</p><p id="p_4">2.     With this preface, let me sketch out briefly, the facts, which have led
to the institution of the present petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_5">2.1    The       Supreme   Court,   on   its   administrative   side   issued     a
communication dated 03.12.2012, addressed to the Registrar, National Law
University, Dwarka, New Delhi (in short NLU, Delhi), whereby it invited
applications from LL.B. (Final Year)/ Semester/ Trimester students, who
were likely to graduate in May-June, 2013, to consider them for selection as
LCRAs in respect of, assignments commencing from 01.07.2013 and ending
in the summer of 2014.        A request was made that the recommendations
should be supported by signed applications, in the format specified,
accompanied by passport size attested photographs along with attested
photocopies of mark-sheets/ grade-cards and other testimonials of eligible
candidates. The recommendations, with indicated enclosures, were required
to reach respondent No.1, latest by 31.01.2013.
</p><p id="p_6">2.2    The opening paragraph of the aforementioned communication dated
03.12.2012, clearly indicated that, the applications for consideration for
short-term assignment as LCRA, as in the previous years, were being called
from National Law Schools/ Universities on the "approved panel", and in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 2 of 56</span>
 the "stand-by-category".     Since, NLU, Delhi was evidently empanelled;
applications were invited from its students.
</p><p id="p_7">2.3     The petitioner, who had joined the law course with respondent no. 2
in 2008, and was likely to graduate in 2013, approached respondent no. 1, to
know the procedure for making an application for being considered, for
appointment, as a LCRA, in the Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_8">2.4     It appears that the petitioner was told that, students of only those
National Law Schools could apply, which were placed on the approved
panel of the Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_9">2.5     The petitioner was, naturally, aggrieved, which made her approach,
then Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India (CJI) vide communication dated
11.01.2013. The petitioner, claims that she did not receive a response to her
communication; a fact which has not been disputed by respondent no.1.
2.6     Consequently, the petitioner filed an application under the Right to
<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_2">Information Act</a>, 2005 (in short the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_3">RTI Act</a>) with the Additional Registrar/
Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the Supreme Court on
14.01.2013.      Several queries were raised in the said application.      The
petitioner, inter alia, sought information qua various aspects, which can
broadly be paraphrased as follows:
</p><p id="p_10">(i)     Whether there was, in place, a scheme/ guidelines or administrative
orders for appointment of a LCRA?
</p><p id="p_11">(ii)    Information was sought, with regard to Law-Colleges/ Universities
which had been put on the approved panel or in the stand-by-category in the
previous five (5) years, on a year-wise basis.
</p><p id="p_12">(iii)   The criteria adopted for empanelment on the approved panel or stand-
by-category.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) 360/2013                                                  Page 3 of 56</span>
<p id="p_13"> (iv)   List of candidates of Colleges and Universities, who had been
shortlisted in the previous five (5) years, for the purpose of interaction with
the Judges.
</p><p id="p_14">(v)    List of candidates, who had been finally selected for appointment as
LCRAs, in the previous five (5) years.          In this regard the names of
candidates along with the Colleges and Universities from which they had
graduated, were also sought.
</p><p id="p_15">(vi)   Copies of file(s), if any available, with regard to matters referred to
above; were also sought.
</p><p id="p_16">3.     In view of the fact that no information was supplied qua the queries
raised by the petitioner, vide her application dated 14.01.2013, the petitioner
approached this court by instituting a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_17">4.     Notice in the captioned writ petition was issued on 22.01.2013, which
was made returnable, on 28.01.2013.
</p><p id="p_18">4.1    At the hearing held on 28.01.2013, respondent no. 1 was represented
by Mr A.S. Chandhiok, learned ASG, instructed by Mr Ritesh Kumar and
Mr Piyush Sanghi, Advocates. At the said hearing, Mr Chandhiok, was
queried by me, as to whether, there were in place any guidelines for
empanelment of Universities/ Law Colleges. Since, Mr Chandhiok, did not
have a ready answer, he indicated that he would examine the matter and
revert to the court qua that aspect.
</p><p id="p_19">4.2    Mr Chandhiok, at the bar, also raised a preliminary objection vis-a-vis
the maintainability of the petition, on the ground that respondent no.2, in
which, the petitioner was at that point in time prosecuting her studies, had
not applied for empanelment, and that, applications for appointment of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 4 of 56</span>
 LCRAs could only be considered, if routed through, the institution, in
which, the student (in this case the petitioner), was prosecuting his/her
studies.
</p><p id="p_20">4.3    Having regard to the above submission, based on an oral prayer made
by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the Army Institute of Law at
Mohali, was arrayed as respondent no.2, to the instant proceedings.
</p><p id="p_21">5.     The writ petition was thereafter, posted for hearing on 19.03.2013. In
the interregnum, petitioner moved an application being: CM No. 2059/2013,
with alternative reliefs. Firstly, for closing the right of respondent no.1 to
file a counter-affidavit, since, it had not been filed, though time was
allocated for the said purpose by the court. Secondly, for redressal of the
petitioner's grievance that her application dated 14.01.2013 under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">RTI
Act</a> had been rejected by respondent no. 1 vide communication dated
11.02.2013; ostensibly on the ground of pendency of the instant writ
petition.
</p><p id="p_22">5.1    As regards the first prayer, Mr Chandhiok assured the court that the
counter-affidavit will be filed in the course of the day; with a copy served on
the petitioner. In so far as the alternative prayer was concerned, it was not
pressed in view of the following clarification made by me.
5.2    It was made clear that if, the petitioner was aggrieved, she could
approach the relevant statutory authority, under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_6">RTI
Act</a>, and that, in so far as this court was concerned, there was no injunction
issued qua disclosure of any information. The aforesaid clarification was
issued by me vide order dated 20.02.2013.
</p><p id="p_23">5.3    The aftermath of the clarification issued on 20.02.2013 was that, the
First Appellate Authority vide order dated 07.03.2013 ruled that pendency



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 5 of 56</span>
 of proceedings before this court will not warrant exemption under <a href="/doc/26532/" id="a_7">Section
8(1)(b)</a> of the RTI Act, and therefore, the stand taken by the CPIO claiming
exemption under the said section, would not survive.          The matter was
consequently remanded to the CPIO for fresh consideration in accordance
with law within a period of five days from the date of receipt of the said
order.
</p><p id="p_24">5.4      Based on the aforesaid direction, the CPIO vide order dated
12/13.03.2013 briefly responded as follows vis-à-vis queries raised by the
petitioner in her application :- In so far as Queries 1 to 5 were concerned, it
was stated that information sought thereby was already furnished to the
petitioner vide respondent no.1's counter affidavit filed in the instant writ
petition. As regards, query nos.6 and 7 were concerned, it was indicated that
information had been complied and was reflected in Annexures A and B
respectively, appended to the response. Lastly, in respect of query no.8, the
stand taken was that the files in issue which contained the information,
related to a vast period, and therefore, compiling the information sought for,
would dis-proportionately divert the resources of the Registry, and would
thus, be detrimental not only to its functioning, but would also, make the
system unworkable in practice.
</p><p id="p_25">5.5      It appears that, in the interregnum, the petitioner had filed a second
application under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_8">RTI Act</a> dated 25.02.2013, with the CPIO of the
Supreme Court. The queries, inter alia, raised in this application sought
responses from respondent no.1, in respect of the following aspects broadly:
</p><p id="p_26">(i).     Whether the Supreme Court had at any time invited applications from
Law Colleges / Universities for empanelment in the "Approved Panel" and
the "stand-by-category"?
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 6 of 56</span>
<p id="p_27"> (ii).   Whether advertisements were issued or letters were sent to Colleges /
Universities informing them about the existence of an approved panel or a
stand-by-category for the purpose of engaging their students as LCRAs.
</p><p id="p_28">(iii). List of Colleges / Universities which had applied to the Supreme
Court or in response to a communication inviting applications for being
empanelled in the approved panel or in the stand-by-category.
</p><p id="p_29">(iv). Did the Indian Law Society's Law College, Pune (in short ILS, Pune)
apply, for being put on the approved panel or in the stand-by-category?
</p><p id="p_30">(v).    Amongst Colleges and Universities which were put on the approved
panel or in the stand-by-category, the number of Institutes which had been
empanelled on a suo motu basis, and those, which had been empanelled
based on the applications for empanelment.
</p><p id="p_31">5.6     In respect of most of the queries referred to above, relevant
documents were sought by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_32">5.7     Evidently, vide order dated 23.03.2013, the CPIO disposed of the
petitioner's RTI application dated 25.02.2013. In response to the first two
queries, it was indicated that no applications were invited or advertisements
were taken out for placing Law Colleges and Universities on the approved
panel or in the stand-by-category. This according to the response given was
done: "in the light of initial decision to requisition the services of suitable
candidates from various National Law Schools / Colleges."
5.8     As regards query no.3, it was, inter alia, indicated that letters were not
sent to Law Colleges and Universities informing them of the decision to
have in place an approved panel and a stand-by-category; however, the :
"concerned National Law Schools / colleges were informed in writing about
their empanelment."
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WP(C) 360/2013                                                      Page 7 of 56</span>
<p id="p_33"> 5.9    As regards query no.6, it was indicated that ILS, Pune had sent a letter
of request and since the letter did not originate from the Supreme Court the
petitioner was advised to contact the concerned authority.
</p><p id="p_34">6.     In so far as query no.7 was concerned, it was indicated that number of
Institutions had sent letters of request, and since, the data / information was
not tabulated and available in the manner sought, that information could not
be supplied. A further justification for the same, was provided : which was,
that files were spread over a period of time and therefore, "detaching the
concerned papers would be detrimental to the preservation of the records in
question and may prejudicially affect the functioning of the Registry."
6.1    As regards query no.8, it was indicated that files were spread over a
period of time and that compilation of information sought would
disproportionately divert resources and would be detrimental to the
functioning of the office.
</p><p id="p_35">6.2    Against orders of the CPIO dated 12/13.03.2013 and 23.03.2013, the
petitioner preferred two separate appeals with the First Appellate Authority
on the same date i.e., 03.04.2013. Both appeals were dismissed by the First
Appellate Authority by an order dated 01.05.2013.            Furthermore, the
information sought by the petitioner vide her RTI application dated
16.04.2013 was declined by the CPIO vide order dated 16.05.2013.
6.3    As is obvious the aforesaid events pertaining to the applications
preferred under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_9">RTI Act</a> and their disposal went on in tandem with the
prosecution of the writ petition. The applications and orders, passed on
them have been brought on record, by way of affidavits, filed by the
petitioner. In the interregnum the writ petition was argued on several dates.
Counsels were given opportunity to not only rebut but also make



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 8 of 56</span>
 submissions in sur-rejoinder. Finally, the matter was reserved for judgment.
The parties, in the meanwhile, filed their respective written submissions
while the matter was in progress.
</p>

<p id="p_36">SUBMISSIONS OF COUNSELS
</p><p id="p_37">7.      Arguments on behalf of the petitioner were advanced by Mr Rajeev
Sharma, Advocate, while those on behalf of respondent no. 1 were advanced
by Mr Chandhiok, learned ASG. Respondent no.2, though served, chose not
to participate in the proceedings.          Respondent no. 2, has thus gone
unrepresented. Counsels for both sides argued broadly, in line with their
respective pleadings filed in the matter.
</p><p id="p_38">7.1    I must also note that though, both on behalf of the petitioner and
respondent no.1, several sets of written submissions have been filed, the
basic emphasis and the central point of their respective submissions
remained the same. Let me, therefore, sketch the broad contours of the
submissions made by the learned counsels on each side.
</p><p id="p_39">8.      Mr Sharma, broadly, argued as follows:
</p><p id="p_40">(i)    There was no communication available in public domain, which
would enable Law Colleges and Universities to apply for empanelment
against a known criteria.
</p><p id="p_41">(ii)   There was a policy of pick and choose, which was ad-hoc and
discriminatory. This point was sought to be emphasized by seeking to point
out that some Institutions were empanelled even though they had not applied
for empanelment, while others were empanelled based on bare, letters of
request. In respect of the latter, examples of ILS, Pune and Symbiosis Law
School, Pune (in short Symbiosis, Pune) were cited. It was pointed out that,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">WP(C) 360/2013                                                  Page 9 of 56</span>
 in stark contrast, respondent no.2 was not empanelled despite having sent
the letters of request for consideration of its students for appointment as
LCRAs.
</p><p id="p_42">(iii)   The criteria, which is articulated in the counter-affidavit, such as,
Institution-ranking, library size, quality of faculty etc., fails to disclose, what
was the relevant benchmark against each criteria, and when, was the last
time such an exercise had been conducted, with regard to empanelment of
Law Colleges/ Universities.
</p><p id="p_43">(iv)    There is no policy in place. The exercise conducted is ad-hoc. The
selection of a candidate, should be based on merit of the candidate /
applicant, and not, on the merit of the Institution, in which, the candidate /
applicant prosecutes his/her studies. It was submitted that, it was quite
possible that a first rate Institution ends up producing a student of average
ability, while an Institution, which is otherwise mediocre, may produce a
student of great ability and knowledge.        Respondent no. 1, has created a
class of Institutions which are empanelled and those which are not
empanelled, and such classification, has no nexus with the stated object;
which is, to render legal assistance to the Judges of the Supreme Court and
initiate fresh Law graduates to the judicial system/ judicial process. There
can be no distinction among students of various Law Colleges, all of which,
are necessarily required to be recognized by the Bar Council of India. The
classification is thus artificial and bereft of any rational differentia.
</p><p id="p_44">(v)     Assuming, without admitting, that the classification was valid, the
manner in which the stated policy was put into practice, was arbitrary and
unconstitutional.    Admittedly, no general advertisement was issued with
regard to the process of empanelment of the Law Colleges/ Universities.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">WP(C) 360/2013                                                        Page 10 of 56</span>
<p id="p_45"> The process for empanelment thus, lacked transparency, which was one of
the important facets of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_46">(vi). The LCRAs, are paid remuneration at the rate of Rs.25,000/- per
month,     out of the consolidated fund of India.         It would make little
difference whether the LCRAs are employed or engaged as long as their
engagement is with a public body; in this case, a constitutional body.
</p><p id="p_47">(vii). Every administrative action is subject to judicial review, what may
vary though is the extent or the depth of judicial review.
</p><p id="p_48">(viii). The argument of administrative convenience cannot be used to
jettison the mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article 14.</a> Nothing, prevented respondent no.1,
from evolving a rational criteria, which would stand the test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_49">8.1    In support of his submissions, Mr Sharma relied upon the following

 Reference No. 1 of 2012 (2012) 10 SCC 1.
</p><p id="p_51">9.       As against this, Mr. Chandhiok, based on the pleadings filed,
contended as follows :-
</p><p id="p_52">(i).     The Writ petition is not maintainable as the petitioner obtained her
Law degree from respondent no.2, which is not on the approved list of
Institutions, maintained by respondent no.1. In this behalf, it was also
submitted that in any event, an application to consider appointment as
LCRA can be considered if, it is sponsored or recommended by the
concerned Institute; which as indicated above, has to find a place on the
panel approved by respondent no.1.
</p><p id="p_53">(ii).    The engagement of a LCRA, could not be equated with an
appointment to a civil post as there does not exist an employer-employee
relationship.
</p><p id="p_54">(iii).   The engagement being in the nature of a "personal engagement", it
was not open to judicial review. It is for respondent no.1, to select LCRAs
and therefore, in the matter of their engagement, the concept of public office
does not come into play. In this behalf, it is stated that LCRAs are paid a
fixed honorarium of Rs.25,000/- per month and not a salary.
</p><p id="p_55">(iv). No person, including the petitioner, can claim a right to be appointed /
selected as it is a position of "great trust and confidence".
</p><p id="p_56">(v).     The petitioner, cannot compel respondent no.1 to utilize her services
as a LCRA, and thus, in effect, fetter the choice of respondent no.1.
</p><p id="p_57">(vi). The scheme for selection of LCRAs was evolved by orders of the
Hon'ble CJI(s). The scheme envisages empanelment of Colleges, inter alia
of "known reputation", especially, the National Law Schools. Though, this
does not undermine the quality or credence of other good Colleges, the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 12 of 56</span>
 scheme is not amenable to challenge.        The entire scheme, is meant to
shortlist candidates for engagement as LCRAs.
</p><p id="p_58">(vii). Information with regard to procedure for making an application for
engagement as LCRA is available in the annual report of the court, which
mentions the details and the procedure for engagement.
</p><p id="p_59">(viii). There is no preference given to any particular Law School / College.
Apart from National Law Schools and Universities, other Colleges, on
consideration of their requests for empanelment, are placed in either "other
category" or "stand-by-category".
</p><p id="p_60">(ix). As and when Colleges / Institutes apply for empanelment, their
request is placed before the concerned Committee of the court, and
thereafter, empanelment is made on the recommendations of the concerned
Committee or on the directions of the Hon'ble CJI.
</p><p id="p_61">(x).   On the last occasion, when some Colleges / Institutes had applied for
empanelment, on the direction of the concerned Committee, the following
information was sought :- performance / result of candidates for previous
five (5) years; size of the library maintained by the concerned College/
Institute, with details of library information services provided to the
students; the profile of the faculty available in the College / Institute; and
lastly, the details of courses offered alongwith copies of syllabus, was called
for from the concerned College / Institute. In other words, the request for
empanelment is dependent on the criteria indicated above, which will
include, the standing of the concerned College / Institute, in the order of
ranking.
</p><p id="p_62">(xi)   In view of the fact that there are innumerable Law Colleges / Law
Schools all over the country, it would be practically impossible to consider



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 13 of 56</span>
 the candidature of each Law College directly. The method of shortlisting
Institutions and considering students for engagement based on sponsorship
of the selected Institute, is valid, as otherwise, it would be next to impossible
to interview, and then, select candidates, if all, candidates were to apply
directly to respondent no.1. These being reasonable restrictions, there is no
violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_63">(xii). The nature of engagement requires not only specialized skills but also
maintenance of confidentiality and trust. Therefore, the method evolved for
selection cannot be found fault with.
</p><p id="p_64">(xiii). It is open for any Institution recognized by the Bar Council of India
conducting a professional law course to forward its request for
empanelment, which would be examined by the concerned Committee; there
being no restriction as to eligibility or norm.
</p><p id="p_65">(xiv). The challenge by the petitioner, is to the empanelment of Law
Colleges / Universities. There is no grievance made out in the writ petition
with regard to requirement of recommendation or sponsorship by the
concerned Law College / University, in which, the applicant has pursued his
or her Law course. The fact that the petitioner was not sponsored or
recommended by respondent no.2, is not denied.                Therefore, the issue
concerning empanelment cannot be raised by her in the present writ petition
as it is not in the nature of a public interest litigation.
</p><p id="p_66">(xv). Respondent no.2, has chosen not to enter appearance before this court
despite being impleaded as a party vide order dated 28.01.2013. Respondent
no.2 vide communication dated 17.02.2006, had sought placement of its
students, as LCRAs; which is when, it was informed that its students could
be considered only after it was empanelled with the Supreme Court. The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">WP(C) 360/2013                                                        Page 14 of 56</span>
 respondent no.2, since then, has not reverted qua the issue, and therefore, the
present writ petition on behalf of the petitioner i.e., the student of respondent
no.2, is not maintainable, as respondent no.2 is not interested, in
empanelment.
</p><p id="p_67">(xvi). The petitioner, has not laid a challenge with respect to Colleges which
have found place in the empanelment list; that challenge, in any case, would
not be maintainable as the empanelled Institutions have not been made
parties to the present proceedings.
</p><p id="p_68">(xvii). The selection process for engagement of LCRAs for the year 2013-
2014 has already commenced, and therefore, the selection process cannot be
challenged by way of the present writ petition.
</p><p id="p_69">(xviii). The process of selection of candidates is a policy decision and an
eligibility criteria, and consequently, not amenable to judicial review.
(xix). There are several ways for selecting LCRAs, it is ultimately for
respondent no.1 to adopt a method, which best suits its purposes.
(xx). The policy, being uniform, has to be examined in the context of the
limited requirement for engagement of LCRAs.                The requirement of
respondent no.1, as of now, is 60 to 70 LCRAs, which has to be seen in the
backdrop of the fact that there are presently at least 900 Law Colleges in
India. While testing the policy, on the touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_22">Article 14</a>, these facts
would have to be borne in mind. The resources of the court are limited, and
therefore, some method for shortlisting is required to be used. This court,
cannot interfere with the policy formulated, on the ground, that it is
erroneous, or that, there is a better, fairer or wiser alternative available.
(xxi). Empanelment with the Supreme Court is an eligibility criteria for
enabling consideration of Law graduates of a particular Institute, for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">WP(C) 360/2013                                                       Page 15 of 56</span>
 engagement as LCRAs. It is settled that, it is for the rule making authority
or the appointing authority to prescribe the mode of selection, and a
minimum qualification for any recruitment.
</p><p id="p_70">(xxii). Classification/selection based on "institutional preference" is a
definite and an identifiable criteria, which satisfies the test of valid
classification as mandated by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Classification
based on Institutes is not violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_24">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
Reliance in this regard is placed on <a href="/doc/309064/" id="a_25">Saurabh Chaudri &amp; Ors. vs. Union of
India &amp; Ors</a>., 2003 11 SCC 146 at pages 175 and 177 (paragraphs 64 and
</p><p id="p_71">70).
</p><p id="p_72">(xxiii). The engagement of LCRAs, is a facility, provided by the court to
young Law graduates, which cannot be claimed as a matter of right.
(xxiv) The criteria for empanelment is in public domain. The petitioner,
who is a student of respondent no.2, cannot speak on behalf of Law
Colleges/ Universities. In so far as respondent no.2 is concerned, it was
informed of the procedure as far back as in 2007.
</p><p id="p_73">(xxv). LCRAs are not "officers" and "servants" of Supreme Court as
envisaged under <a href="/doc/231390/" id="a_26">Article 146(2)</a> of the Constitution. The Supreme Court
Officers and Servants (Conditions of Service and Conduct) Rules, 1961 are
not applicable to LCRAs.        Terms and conditions vis-à-vis salaries,
allowances, leave, pension, and procedure for disciplinary proceedings as
applicable to Supreme Court "officers" and "servants" are not applicable to
LCRAs.
</p><p id="p_74">(xxvi).   The engagement of LCRAs, to render assistance to the Judges
cannot be equated with distribution of "state largesse" or award of a
contract, tender or even holding of an auction. Their engagement can,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">WP(C) 360/2013                                                 Page 16 of 56</span>
 however, be compared with engagement of lawyers by clients.
(xxvii). Merely because LCRAs are paid a stipend / honorarium, the nature
of engagement will not evolve into one concerning a "public office" or
"public employment".
</p><p id="p_75">(xxviii). It is incorrect to contend that once, Law Colleges are recognized by
the Bar Council of India, any further classification would be violative of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.        The Supreme Court in an order dated
29.06.2009 passed in SLP (C) No.22337/2008 in the case of Bar Council of
India vs. Bonnie Foi Law College &amp; Ors. expressed its concern regarding
affiliation and recognition of Law Colleges by the Bar Council of India.
The Bar Council of India has now introduced the All India Bar Examination
(in short Bar Exam) for the purposes of admitting Law graduates to the Bar
and all students studying in recognized Colleges are called to the Bar only
after they qualify the Bar Exam.          Therefore, to contend that once the
Institute is recognized by the Bar Council of India, a further classification
cannot be made is, erroneous. Further classification, which is based on
selection of Institutes, is a valid classification. Therefore, classification /
selection which has its basis in institutional preference is, a valid
classification, as it bears out a definite and identifiable criteria.
(xxix) <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_28">Article 14</a> permits reasonable classification.           Selection of Law
graduates only from approved Colleges is found on intelligible differentia
which has rational nexus to the objects sought to be achieved, namely,
shortlisting and rendering effective assistance to the Judges.
(xxx). Merit, is given due weightage. The process of selection has two
stages; in the first stage, approved Institutes are empanelled. In the second
stage, the approved Institutes recommend meritorious students for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">WP(C) 360/2013                                                          Page 17 of 56</span>
 sponsorship. In this regard, example is cited of the Punjab and Haryana
High Court.
</p><p id="p_76">(xxxi). It cannot be said that quality of education is not dependent on the
college, in which, a student pursues his or her education. Colleges have a
role in preparing and educating their students. It is a matter of common
knowledge that to a large extent, students can be judged on the basis of the
Institute, in which, they pursue their education.      It is the educational
Institutions which lay the foundation for morality, ethics and discipline,
which is imbibed by its students.       Therefore, maintaining a panel of
approved Colleges does not violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_29">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
9.1    In respect of the aforesaid contentions, counsels for respondent no. 1
apart from judgments already cited above have relied upon the following

Corporation Ltd</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_79">REASONS
</p><p id="p_80">10.    Having deliberated upon the matter, it is quite evident that the central
issue is narrow. The nub of the matter is: does the petitioner have a right to
be considered for appointment as a LCRA; sans the empanelment of
respondent no.2 on the Supreme Court's approved panel or in the stand-by-
category or even in the "other colleges category". More so, given the fact
that the petitioner's application is not sponsored by or routed through
respondent No.2. The latter objection is, though, really a non-sequitur, if the
first objection holds.
</p><p id="p_81">10.1 These are objections on merits.        The defence of respondent no.1
though, has several legal layers. These issues can be broadly paraphrased as
follows :-
</p><p id="p_82">(i) First and foremost, does the petitioner have locus; (ii) Second, is the
decision of the Supreme Court to maintain a panel, a matter of "policy"
and/or an "eligibility criteria" and therefore, completely immune to mandate
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a> of the Constitution; (iii) Third, institutional preference is not
violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_41">Article 14.</a> Eminence of Institute ensures merit as, the best
students, are sponsored ultimately. This process of selection permeates
ethicality, discipline and morality in the legal profession and judicial
fraternity; (iv) Fourth, the engagement of a LCRA is not a public
employment or appointment to a civil post. The engagement is for the
benefit of the Judges of the Supreme Court to assist them in discharge of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 19 of 56</span>
 their judicial duties, and to initiate, Law graduates to complexities of the
judicial system.
</p><p id="p_83">11.      Let me attempt to deal with each of the objections in seriatim. Locus
is an attribute attached to the legal standing of a litigant, who approaches an
adjudicatory forum, for redressal of his/her grievances. While, the contours
and texture of the locus may vary to some extent depending on the forum
approached and the remedy availed of, the core attribute remains the same,
which is, the existence of an enforceable legal right. The right, in respect of
which, enforcement is sought could be statutory, constitutional, contractual,
customary or a common law right. As long as there is a right, it is axiomatic
that a court would necessarily have to provide access for enforcing such a
right.
</p><p id="p_84">11.1 Those who are kept out are "busy bodies" or "meddlesome
interlopers" [see <a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_42">Jasbhai Motibhai Desai vs. Roshan Kumar, Haji Bashir
Ahmed &amp; Ors</a>. (1976) 1 SCC 671]. The test ordinarily followed is: does the
litigant have sufficient legal interest in the matter which propels the litigant
to approach the Court, to ventilate his/her grievance. To put it differently is
the litigant aggrieved by acts of omission and commission of the opposite
party; which measure may or may not be common to a large body of
similarly placed persons. If that be so, he/ she would be person aggrieved
and, in that sense, have sufficient legal interest to approach the court for
redressal of his / her grievance. If I am right in adopting this measure, let
me examine whether the petitioner shores up to the said measure.
11.2 The petitioner is, undisputedly, a Law graduate, who is otherwise
eligible for consideration for appointment as a LCRA but for the fact that
respondent no.2 is not empanelled with the Supreme Court, and therefore,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 20 of 56</span>
 in that sense, whether or not her application is routed through respondent
no.2 is, really irrelevant. The fact that the respondent no.2, is recognised by
the Bar Council of India, is also not in dispute.
</p><p id="p_85">11.3 The "Policy" or criteria of empanelment of the sponsoring Law
College/University impacts the petitioner's right to be considered for an
assignment as a LCRA.
</p><p id="p_86">11.4 Therefore, can the petitioner's legal standing be put in issue solely on
the ground that respondent no.2, having not assailed the policy of
empanelment, its alumni i.e., the petitioner is not entitled to maintain the
instant petition. The fact that the sponsoring Law College or University is
not empanelled, for whatever reasons, is a threshold bar, and in my opinion,
provides, sufficient legal interest, to the petitioner, to lay a challenge to the
regime which is put in place, as it substantially impacts her right, to be
considered, for appointment as a LCRA.
</p><p id="p_87">11.5 Dovetailed in this argument advanced on behalf of respondent no.1, is
the argument that appointment as a LCRA, is not a right. The submission
made on behalf of respondent no.1 is that it is an engagement, for the
"personal benefit" of the Judges of the Supreme Court to render assistance
in respect of judicial duties, that they are called upon to discharge, and to
initiate LCRAs in the working of the judicial system and its myriad
processes.
</p><p id="p_88">11.6 A "right", in its narrowest sense, in present context, could be
described as a claim, which one person asserts he / she ought to receive,
which is, withheld by the opposite party. (Black's Law Dictionary, 6th
Edition, Page No. 1324).
</p><p id="p_89">11.7 The fact that the engagement as a LCRA is for assistance of Judges,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 21 of 56</span>
 does not make it a personal engagement.            On respondent no.1's own
showing, the engagement is to assist a Judge in the discharge of his / her
judicial duties. It is, in my view, a claim of engagement directed towards an
identifiable institution, that is, the Supreme Court, and hence, cannot, but be
a right, enforceable in law. An infraction of this right would certainly lead
to a grievance, and thus, supply necessary ingredients to maintain a petition
of this nature.
</p><p id="p_90">11.8 In my opinion, the petitioner has the locus standi to maintain the
instant petition.
</p><p id="p_91">12.    This brings me to the second argument advanced on behalf of
respondent no.1 that the entire scheme of empanelment, if one could refer to
it as one, for want of a better expression, is a policy or, in the alternative, an
eligibility criteria, and therefore, immune from challenge under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_43">Article 14.</a>
12.1 Before I dwell on the argument of immunity from challenge, let me
advert briefly to the manner in which such scheme came to be formulated, as
per respondent no.1's stand, taken in its return, filed with the court.
12.2 It appears that pursuant to order dated 02.07.2002 passed by then
Hon'ble the CJI, for the first time services of "suitable law graduates from
various National Law Schools"; such as, Bangalore, Bhopal, Jodhpur,
Calcutta and Hyderabad, were availed of.
</p><p id="p_92">12.3. In this behalf, it must be noticed that reference is made to order dated
27.08.2002 passed by the then Hon'ble CJI, by which the Registry of the
Supreme Court was directed not to entertain applications directly from
students of National Law Schools, and in the event, an application was sent
directly, the Registry of the Supreme Court was directed to notify the
applicant that she / he was required to secure a recommendation from the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">WP(C) 360/2013                                                      Page 22 of 56</span>
 concerned National Law School before, she / he could be considered for
engagement as a LCRA.
</p><p id="p_93">12.4. The said order appears to have been followed by yet another order
dated 04.11.2004, which is also stated to be issued by the then Hon'ble CJI,
whereby guidelines were put in place to streamline the system for
engagement of LCRAs.
</p><p id="p_94">12.5. It is also indicated in the counter affidavit of respondent no.1, in this
behalf, that following a proposal mooted on 15.12.2005 that another
category of prominent Law Colleges/ Institutes conducting five (5) years
Law degree course should be created and candidates found suitable from this
category be put on wait-list and considered if, respondent no.1 was not able
to get suitable candidates from National Law Universities / Colleges; the
then Hon'ble CJI vide order dated 16.12.2005, constituted a Committee of
Judges of the Supreme Court to look into the matter and make suitable
recommendations.
</p><p id="p_95">12.6. Consequent thereto, vide order dated 15.02.2006 of then Hon'ble the
CJI, four (4) Colleges were put in the stand-by-category.
12.7. It appears that the matter again gained attention of the Supreme Court
and based on the recommendations of a Committee of Judges of the
Supreme Court, the then Hon'ble CJI vide order dated 28.01.2009 directed
that all National Law Schools / Universities should be empanelled for
consideration of their students for selection as LCRAs.         This order, it
appears, came to be passed for the reason that some Law Schools/
Universities were established under State Laws.
</p><p id="p_96">12.8. Evidently, based on the recommendations of the Committee of Judges
of the Supreme Court, Hon'ble the CJI vide order dated 03.03.2009



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 23 of 56</span>
 approved the guidelines which are presently in vogue. It may be pertinent to
note at this stage the catchment area continued to be restricted to "eligible
National Law Schools / Colleges on panel and in stand-by-category".
</p><p id="p_97">13.    Presently there are: twelve (12) National Law Schools/ Universities
on the approved panel; four (4) Law Colleges in the stand-by-category and
two (2) in the other colleges category.
</p><p id="p_98">13.1 On respondent no.1's own showing, there are 900 Law Colleges in
India against which what we have is a select category of 18 Law Colleges,
whose students are privileged to be considered for grant of entry into the
portals of the country's most vibrant, reputed, and hallowed Institution, i.e,
the Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_99">13.2 In this backdrop, let me continue with the discussion, whether the
decision to empanel simplicitor; partakes the character of "policy" or
"eligibility" criteria.
</p><p id="p_100">13.3 The term policy in its simplest form would mean general rules applied
or made applicable to a particular course of action. The action could be that
of the Government, legislature, judiciary or any instrumentality of the State
or even a private body. Though, ordinarily courts are not concerned with
policies of private bodies unless they extend to the realm of public law. It
cannot be in dispute, as it appears to be too well settled that courts are slow
to strike down "policy" on the ground that a better policy was available at
hand. Courts cannot and do not substitute their views or the wisdom, which
went into the construct of the policy.       The authority charged with the
responsibility to formulate a policy is largely left to its own devices, as it is
assumed to know the prevailing difficulties and circumstances which, in the
first instance, perhaps, would have led to its formulation.          The policy



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 24 of 56</span>
 formulator is thus given a wide latitude; no exactitude or mathematical
precision is expected of it. There is what is felicitously referred to as "play
in the joints". [see <a href="/doc/1033021/" id="a_44">R.K. Garg vs. Union of India and Ors</a>. (1981) 4 SCC
675]. The only area of judicial intercession or review is: when and where it
is alleged that the impugned policy violates a statutory provision or is
violative of fundamental rights of a citizen or the provision(s) of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_101">13.4 In the instant case, though, the first and foremost question which
comes to mind is: is there a policy in place? The counsels for respondent
no.1, in the alternative labelled the banding together of some eighteen (18)
National Law Colleges / Universities, in three different categories, referred
to above, as an eligibility criteria. What that criteria is: is not spelled out,
though this issue was flagged at first returnable date in the matter.
Therefore, the immunity sought and propounded on behalf of respondent
no.1 is, to my mind, not available.
</p><p id="p_102">14.    I will touch upon this aspect in greater detail in the latter part of my
judgment, let me before that deal with the third objection, which is,
institutional preference, is not violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_45">Article 14.</a>
14.1 A quick scan of the judgments of the Supreme Court would show that
the principle of institutional preference was examined for the first time in
the recent history of the court in <a href="/doc/72560/" id="a_46">Dr. Jagdish Saran &amp; Ors. vs. Union of
India</a> (1980) 2 SCC 768 and <a href="/doc/31937106/" id="a_47">Dr. Pradeep Jain &amp; Ors. vs. Union of India &amp;
Ors</a>. (1984) 3 SCC 654. In Dr. Pradeep Jain's case wherein, Dr. Jagdish
Saran's case was discussed, the Supreme Court sustained the principle of
institutional preference by scaling down the percentage of students inducted
from preferred Institutions to a reasonable degree. In sum, reservations in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 25 of 56</span>
 post graduate courses in medicine were restricted to 50%.             In courses
dealing with super specialities, the argument advanced for reservation on
principle of institutional preference, was repelled by the court.
14.2 The Supreme Court as a matter of fact in <a href="/doc/562079/" id="a_48">Municipal Corporation of
Greater Bombay vs. Thukaral Anjali Deokumar &amp; Ors</a>., 1989 (2) SCC 249
had struck down Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC's) notification,
providing for College wise preference. A three Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/1149825/" id="a_49">AIIMS
Students' Union vs. AIIMS &amp; Ors</a>., (2002) 1 SCC 428, had once again,
disapproved of reservations in post graduate courses in Medicine on the
ground of institutional preference; though justified a "certain degree of
preference", for students of the same Institution seeking to prosecute their
studies in their own Institute on the grounds of "convenience", "suitability"
and "familiarity". This was the rationale adopted from Hon'ble Mr. Justice
R.S. Pathak's concurring judgment (as he then was) in Dr. Jagdish Saran's
case. The caveat entered was that such preference cannot be unreasonable
or excessive. The court speaking through Hon'ble Mr. Justice R.C. Lahoti
(as he then was) went on to say "...The preference has to be prescribed
without making an excessive or substantial departure from the rule of merit
and equality. It has to be kept within limits. Minimum standards cannot
be so diluted as to become practically non-existent.           Such marginal
institutional preference is tolerable at postgraduation level but is rendered
intolerable at still higher levels such as that of superspeciality. In the case
of institutions of national significance such as AIIMS, additional
considerations against promoting reservation or preference of any kind
destructive of merit become relevant..."
</p><p id="p_103">14.3 In Saurabh Chaudri's case, the Constitution Bench was considering



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">WP(C) 360/2013                                                      Page 26 of 56</span>
 whether reservation based on domicile could be sustained. The issue was
enlarged to include examination of the constitutionality of admissions
gained by adopting the principle of institutional preference.         The court
sustained the application of principle upon taking into account the
sociological and economic realities of the country. The majority judgment
though restricted institutional preference to the extent of 50% of total seats
in the MBBS course and, qua all other aspects applied its decision rendered
in AIIMS Students' Union case. (see paragraph 74 at page 178).
14.4 The upshot of these judgments is that, in the field of medical
education where seats are to be filled up for post graduate courses, the
principle of institutional preference, can be applied bearing in mind that it
does not become either excessive or unreasonable.
</p><p id="p_104">14.5 The facts of the present case quite clearly portray that, in considering
engagement of applicants as LRCAs, the principle of institutional preference
is not applied, what is instead applied is a rule of thumb, which is, that only
applicants belonging to the empanelled class, are considered for engagement
of LCRAs, to exclusion of others.        Assuming for a moment that mere
segregation of Institutions (rather than preference of applicants of one
Institution as against the other) brings into play the principle of Institutional
preference; to my mind, it cannot be constitutionally sustained, as it does not
leave scope for consideration of Law graduates of other Institutions, which
are not empanelled.
</p><p id="p_105">14.6 To put it differently, it constitutes 100% reservation in favour of
applicants belonging to empanelled Institutes. To contend that it is only
such Institutes which produce students imbued with talent, ethicality,
discipline and morality, is not based on any empirical data. While the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 27 of 56</span>
 probability of Institutes of excellence producing first rate students is high, it
cannot exclude the possibility of several jewels (metaphorically speaking)
being hidden in Law Colleges situate in remote parts of the country.
14.7 The argument, in my view, not only seriously negates the avowed
intent of the equality clause in our Constitution of furthering merit and only
merit where all things are even, but also, damages the prospect of advancing
the principle of affirmative action by restricting the source of entry to the
empanelled Institutes. If I were to embellish this rationale, I would look no
further than to the following greats who did not graduate from Colleges of
"known" eminence.        The father of the nation Mohandas Karamchand
Gandhi passed his matriculation exam from Samaldas College in Bhavnagar,
presently in the state of Gujarat though he studied law at the University
College at London; Sh. C. Rajagopalachari did his initial schooling in a
village school in Thorapalli and graduated in Arts from Central College in
Bangalore. He studied law at the Presidency College, Madras. Sh. Abdul
Kalam Azad had no formal education. He was taught at home. He was
recognized as a renowned scholar, poet, linguist and a brilliant debater.
Albert Einstein failed to reach the required standard in the general part of
examination held by the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich though he
attained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. His contribution to
science needs no articulation. Abraham Lincoln was a self taught person.
He cleared his bar exam in 1836. Dr. Kailash Nath Katju passed his LL.B.
examination from Allahabad University. Sh. Bal Gangadhar Tilak obtained
his law degree from Elphinstone College, Mumbai. Sh. M.C. Setalvad
studied law at evening classes in the Law College at Elphinstone College,
Mumbai. Hon'ble Mr. Justice Sir Harilal Jekisundas Kania, Hon'ble Mr.

 Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, Sh. H.M. Seervai and                   Sh. N.K.
Palkhiwala were all alumni of Government Law College, Mumbai (in short
GLC, Mumbai), which is one of the Colleges put in the stand-by-category.
These are only a few examples which have come to my mind.
</p><p id="p_106">15.    This brings me to the other argument advanced on behalf of
respondent no.1 which is that empanelled Institutes constitute a class by
themselves. And that, classification of such Institutes is based on intelligible
differentia, which has, nexus with object sought to be achieved.
15.1 I must only note that respondent no.1, apart from formulating the,
well stated principle both in its affidavit and through oral submissions
advanced on its behalf, has provided no material to establish the basis for
such classification.
</p><p id="p_107">15.2 There is no basis given for including eighteen (18) Law Colleges in
the "approved panel", "stand-by-category" and the "other colleges"
category.    There is no clue as to the basis for empanelment or shortlisting,
as respondent No.1 would like to refer to it. What is befuddling is: Is the
empanelment based on their location or, their performance or, the eminence
of their faculty or, even the availability of infrastructural facilities. In the
affidavit-in-reply, respondent no.1 has averred that in the recent past while
considering applicants, performance / result of previous five (5) years,
library size, profile of faculty and courses offered, were aspects, which were
taken into account.
</p><p id="p_108">15.3 The assertion, to say the least, was not backed by any data set forth in
the affidavit. That apart, the more serious lacuna was, the absence of the
benchmark against which each of these attributes were measured.
15.4 To take this point further, if performance of the Institutes was



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 29 of 56</span>
 measured; was it based on the total pass percentage or say based on the
percentage of students who had secured first division(s) or say distinction(s).
How was the content and quality of the library determined? Was the quality
of the Library evaluated by taking into account the number and variety of
law reporters and journals, made available? Was the evaluation confined to
Indian reporters, or were foreign journals and magazines, included? Were
facilities in the form of web based research, included in the assessment?
15.5 Similarly, while assessing the quality of faculty available, what
weightage was given to the number of post graduates and doctorates
employed by the Institute? Was the extent of permanent and visiting faculty
of foreign law schools of international repute, taken into account? Was the
availability of opportunities of exchange programmes, noticed? Whether,
the quality of courses offered take into account areas of emerging interest,
apart from traditional subjects? Did the assessment made evaluate as to
whether     the   courses   offered   included   emerging   fields   such        as:
biotechnology, space law, cyber law, genetics, etc.?        More importantly,
whether the availability of courses, was assessed keeping, in mind the
faculty available, to teach such courses.
</p><p id="p_109">16.    It is quite possible that most of the empanelled Institutes may come
through if parameters cited hereinabove, were applied.         Therefore, the
question is not as to whether those Institutes which are already empanelled,
are Institutes of excellence. The question is: was such an exercise carried
out. The more substantial area of concern is : were benchmarks fixed and
put in public domain.
</p><p id="p_110">16.1 If one were to go by answers to the RTI queries of the petitioner given
by respondent no.1, it is quite clear no advertisements were issued, calling



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 30 of 56</span>
 for applications, generally, from Institutes to seek such empanelment.
16.2 The argument advanced that the annual report of the Supreme Court
adverted to the aspect of empanelment, in my view, is a poor substitute for
having a public advertisement. Even if one were to assume that information
given in the annual report ought to suffice, what is decidedly not disclosed
is, the relevant benchmark against which respondent no.1 has thought it fit
to empanel some eighteen (18) Colleges.
</p><p id="p_111">16.3 What makes the empanelment nebulous is the fact that inter se the
empanelled Institutes there are categories put in place. There is no basis
disclosed for relegating a Law College to "stand-by-category" or "other
colleges" category. The Law Colleges and Universities, which are listed out
under the approved category have an average age ranging from 5 years to 27
years, if the date of their establishment is taken into account. In contrast the
average age of the Law Colleges and Universities, referred to in the
remaining two categories i.e., the stand-by-category and other colleges
category ranges from 51 years to 158 years and 36 years to 89 years,
respectively. The youngest College in the approved panel category is NLU,
Delhi. The oldest being the National Law School of India University,
Bangalore (in short NLSIU). NLSIU was established in 1986 while NLU,
Delhi was established in 2008. Similarly, the youngest College in the stand-
by-category is, the School of Legal Studies, Cochin University of Science
and Technology, Kochi, which was established in 1962 whereas the oldest
College in the said category is GLC, Mumbai which was founded in 1855.
The position in the "other      colleges" category,     is no different.     The
youngest College is Symbiosis, Pune, which was established in 1977 while
the oldest is ILS, Pune which was set up in 1924. While the websites of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 31 of 56</span>
 Colleges in the approved category are indicative of the fact that they offer a
five (5) year Law course, there are at least two Colleges in the stand-by-
category, which are GLC and the Faculty of Law, University of Delhi
(which was established in 1924) which offer a three (3) year Law course
after graduation.      Similarly in the "other colleges" category, ILS, Pune
offers a three (3) year Law course after completion of graduation.
16.4 By all accounts GLC, Mumbai - which is put in the stand-by-category
is, one of the oldest Law Institutes, and has produced some of the doyens in
the profession, both off and on the Bench.      If a five-year Law course is the
common denominator (and I can only hazard a guess in that behalf) for
empanelment in the approved category, it is not articulated as a criteria. If it
is a criteria then the said criteria is not followed across the board if there are
Colleges in the other two categories i.e., stand-by-category and other
colleges category which offers a three (3) years Law degree course. These
anomalies demonstrate that there are no principles or guidelines in place for
empanelment or for benchmarking. Absence of guidelines and benchmarks
makes the classification suspect and amenable to challenge under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_50">Article 14</a>
of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_112">16.5 In the course of submissions, Mr. Chandhiok had said that
empanelment is a voluntary act of the concerned Institute and that as and
when an Institute evinces an interest in its empanelment, the applications
filed by them are scrutinized and a decision is taken in that behalf by a
Committee of Judges.
</p><p id="p_113">16.6 This methodology apart from being legally infirm on account of the
fact that there is admittedly no advertisement issued has, not been followed
consistently. The two examples which have emerged during the course of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">WP(C) 360/2013                                                      Page 32 of 56</span>
 arguments, in which respondent no.1 entertained simple letters of request are
that of ILS and Symbiosis, Pune (letters dated 24.07.2002 and 05.10.2002,
respectively). Pertinently, these letters were not filed by respondent no.1
alongwith the affidavit-in-reply.   It is, therefore, not known as to the
information adverted to in the said letters. Assuming one were to treat
letters as applications and not mere letters of request for empanelment one
would expect that they would contain basic information with regard to the
attributes of the College which would commend itself for empanelment. In
sharp contrast, the letter of request of respondent no.2 dated 17.02.2006 was
not considered as an application for empanelment by respondent no.1. In
the counter affidavit, it was sought to be explained that in 2007, respondent
no.1 through its concerned officer(s) had telephonically informed respondent
no.2 that the said Institute had not been placed on the approved panel and
therefore, its request for considering its students for engagement as LCRAs
could not be entertained. I must point out here that apart from the letter of
17.02.2006, respondent no.2 vide letter dated 16.01.2007 had requested
respondent no.1 to engage its students for internship with the Judges of the
Supreme Court.       What is disconcerting is: as to why no written
communication was sent to respondent no.2. It is not even disclosed as to
the basis on which the reference is made with respect to the telephonic
conversation in paragraph 7 of respondent no1.'s affidavit-in-reply and
whether this information is based on the personal knowledge of the deponent
or the record of the case available with respondent no.1. If such a record
was available, it was not produced before the court.
</p><p id="p_114">17.    Having said so, the present dispensation clearly offends the equality
clause provided in the Constitution. Call it scheme or policy or eligibility



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">WP(C) 360/2013                                                  Page 33 of 56</span>
 criteria empanelment of Institutes in the present form leads to an invidious
classification, which brackets a set of Institutes and consequently its alumni,
into privileged category based on indiscernible and unintelligible criteria. If
the object sought to be achieved is to render assistance to the Judges of the
Court and initiate LCRAs to the judicial system and its processes, it fails on
both counts. By keeping a large section of both, meritorious and needy Law
graduates out of the fray or zone of consideration, the stated policy, in my
view, attains an element of discordance qua its articulated object. When, the
purported policy articulates that it wants to ensure that selected LCRAs
render assistance to the Judges; I would imagine that the Supreme Court
would want to induct the best and the brightest minds and expose them to its
workings and complexities, and while doing so, keep room for those who
are   sociologically    and    economically     deprived,    and    educationally
handicapped, due to absence of requisite facilities in their respective alma
maters. The scheme and/or the policy achieves neither.
</p><p id="p_115">18.    The argument of "trust" and "confidentiality" is equally flawed.
There is no basis to even suggest that only applicants from empanelled
Colleges would keep trust and confidence of the Judge with whom they are
attached. These are qualities which are peculiar to a person. If the argument
is that a particular Judge should have say in the engagement or attachment of
a particular person with his office, that discretion, is not diluted if applicants,
like the petitioner, are given a look-in.          The petitioner's plea is of
consideration. She does not and cannot claim a right to be selected.
18.1 The argument of trust and confidence is decidedly a weak argument
for another reason. Attached to each Judge is defined retinue of court staff,
made available to him.        To give an example: A Judge's staff would



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">WP(C) 360/2013                                                       Page 34 of 56</span>
 ordinarily include, amongst others his private secretary, two stenographers,
a court master, his usher and restorer. These personnel are constantly in and
out of a Judge's chamber. The staff is recruited through a well defined and
known criteria. The staff is required to keep the trust and confidence of the
Institution, while dealing with official information. A Judge on his
appointment to the court is assigned his staff, who are more often and then
not, already on the rolls of the institution. There is no particular criteria, in
the nature of a pre-requisite in place, which requires (at least none has been
shown) that the staff can be assigned to a Judge only if he/ she has his trust
or confidence. That is, not to say, that if, there is an infraction, the Judge
concerned will not have the authority to trigger an appropriate corrective
measure, including having the concerned employee removed from his
retinue.
</p><p id="p_116">18.2 Having said so, "trust" and "confidence" of a particular Judge cannot
form an eligibility criteria for recruitment as, the appointment is an
institutional appointment. A similar principle should apply, in my opinion,
to engagement of LCRAs as these engagements are ultimately for the benefit
of the Institution, that is, the Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_117">19.    The submission of Mr Chandhiok that the engagement of LCRAs is
not an employment to a civil post or a public office, is well taken. But from
this argument it cannot follow that engagement of a LCRA by the Supreme
Court does not fall within the realm of public law and hence is not amenable
to the writ jurisdiction of the court. Though there is a fine line at times
between what falls within the realm of public law as against that which falls
within the arena of private law, in the present case, in my view, wherever the
line is drawn, the instant case falls within the domain of public law. The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 35 of 56</span>
 reason for that is: the authority, (i.e., which is the Supreme Court) whose
actions are challenged is undoubtedly a State, being one of the three wings
of the State, in the large omnibus sense.       Its functions have a public
character, which character would be applicable to each of its constituents,
including the Judges of the court, whether acting singularly or collectively.
The terms of engagement of LCRAs require admittedly payment of a
stipend/ honorarium, which is paid out of public money, in the form of funds
provided by the Government of India through the consolidated fund of India.
The right to be considered for engagement as a LCRA by a State authority
has thus a public law character.            The term public character in
contradistinction to private character, perhaps has myriad definitions, each
of which would have a contextual meaning.          However, if one were to
attempt to articulate as to what would be a common denominator, to my
mind, it could be said that: A State displays attributes of a public character
when it acts in the realm of political firmament, or in its capacity as a
sovereign or even in its discharge of constitutional and administrative duties.
If I were to apply this measure to the engagement of LCRAs by the Supreme
Court, in my view, it would fall in the realm of public character as opposed
to private character and hence within the ambit of public law.
19.1 If that be so, the next question would be: would a mandamus lie qua a
public authority to enforce a duty which has attributes of public character.
To answer this question I need not go further than to derive sustenance from
the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of Andi Mukta sadguru
Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust
&amp; Ors. vs. V.R. Rudani &amp; Ors. (1989) 2 SCC 691. The Supreme Court in
this case was dealing with an appeal filed by a private trust, which was



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 36 of 56</span>
 aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, directing it to pay arrears of
salary and other terminal benefits to teachers, who were employed by a
College under its management. The Supreme Court, inter alia, was called
upon to examine the validity of the submission raised by the appellants
before it, that no writ would lie for seeking a mandamus qua the
management of the College. The Supreme Court observed that as long as
the party against whom mandamus is sought is required to discharge a
public duty, mandamus would lie. As a matter of fact, it quoted Lord
Denning in what would be the scope of relief that a court could grant in what
is termed as the power of judicial review conferred upon the superior Courts
in India. It approved Lord Denning's dicta, which inter alia, indicated that
both declaratory relief as well as, relief by way of a Writ of Mandamus
could be granted.     The Supreme Court also went on to approve the
observations of Prof. De. Smith to the effect that for a public duty to be
enforceable by mandamus, it does not necessarily have to be one imposed by
a statute, it would be sufficient if the duty is imposed by either a charter or
common law or custom or even a contract. The court, made a pointed
observation with regard to the use of the term 'authority' in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_51">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution, which it said, should receive a liberal meaning, unlike the
term used in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_52">Article 12</a>, which is relevant only for the purposes of
enforcement of Fundamental Rights under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_53">Article 32.</a> The court went on to
say that under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_54">Article 226</a>, High Courts can issue writs for enforcement of
both Fundamental Rights as well as non-Fundamental Rights; therefore, as
long as the body against whom writ is sought is performing a public duty,
which must be a positive obligation owed by a person or authority to the
affected party, a mandamus would lie.      This would be irrespective of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 37 of 56</span>
 means by which duty is imposed. As long as there is a positive obligation,
writ of mandamus cannot be denied. (See paragraphs 15 to 22 at pages 698
to 701 of Andi Mukta case).
</p><p id="p_118">19.2 In the present case, there is no difficulty in coming to the conclusion
that respondent no. 1 is a State. Furthermore, I am also of the opinion, in
view of the discussion above, that it is discharging a public duty in seeking
to engage LCRAs and, in that sense, has created a positive obligation in
favour of prospective applicants to consider them for engagement, by a
procedure, which is fair, reasonable and non-arbitrary.
</p><p id="p_119">20.     A submission was made on behalf of respondent no.1 that given the
large number of Law Colleges and Universities in India, which according to
the figure supplied, is 900, a method of 'shortlisting' had to be employed
due to administrative inconvenience and limited funds available to it. In
other words, respondent no. 1 seeks to justify creation of a class of
empanelled Law Colleges and Universities, inter alia, on these grounds, as
well.
</p><p id="p_120">20.1 The principles pertaining to permissible classification, which is
encompassed in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_55">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, are so well enunciated by the
Supreme Court, since its establishment, that citing them seems almost,
platitudinous. But the application of the principle continues to be tested, as
each case on facts, according to the parties involved in the lis, throws up a
new dimension. Therefore, it becomes necessary to restate the principle.
Classification per se is an anathema. What is permissible under the
Constitution is a reasonable classification, which is based on intelligible
differentia, which has, in turn, nexus with the object sought to be achieved.

 doesn't seem far away) the journey started with the court being called upon
in the case of <a href="/doc/184660633/" id="a_56">State of West Bengal vs. Anwar Ali Sarkar &amp; Anr</a>. AIR 1952

           systematic arrangement of things into groups or classes,
           usually in accordance with some definite scheme. But the
           scheme can be anything and the laws which are laid down
           to govern the grouping must necessarily be arbitrarily
           selected; also granted the right to select, the classification
           can be as broad-based as one pleases, or it can be broken
           down and down until finally just one solitary unit is
           divided off from the rest. Even those who propound this
           theory are driven to making qualifications. Thus, it is not
           enough merely to classify but the classification must not
           be 'discriminatory', it must not amount to 'hostile action',
           there must be 'reasonable grounds for distinction', it must
           be 'rational' and there must be no 'substantial

            discrimination'. But what then becomes of the
           classification? and who are to be the judges of the
           reasonableness and the substantiality or otherwise of the
           discrimination? And, much more important, whose
           standards of reasonableness are to be applied? - the
           judges? - the government's? - or that of the mythical
           ordinary reasonable man of law which is no single man
           but a composite of many men whose reasonableness can
           be measured and gauged even though he can neither be
           seen nor heard nor felt? With the utmost respect I cannot
           see how these vague generalisations serve to clarify the
           position. To my mind they, do not carry us one whit
           beyond the original words and are no more satisfactory
           than saying-that all men are equal before the law and that
           all shall be equally treated and be given equal protection.

           for the fact that the Constitution demands equality of
           treatment these laws would, in my opinion, be valid. But
           that apart what material have we for delving into the mind

           judged by his acts, for acts of this kind can spring from

 P.N. Bhagwati on his own behalf and on behalf of Hon'ble Mr. Justice. Y.V.
Chandrachud and Hon'ble Mr. Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer (as they then were).
Justice Bhagwati, in his own immitable style, stated that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_60">Article 14</a> was the
genus, while <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_61">Article 16</a> was its species. There was a reference to <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_62">Article 16</a>,
as the issue being considered related to public employment as well, which is
an aspect one is not concerned with in the instant case. The observations on
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_63">Article 14</a> are though most pertinent.
</p><p id="p_123">21.3 The learned Judge appositely went on to observe that when an act is
arbitrary, it is implicit in that, it is unequal, both according to political logic

relevant principles applicable alike to all similarly situate and it must not
be guided by any extraneous or irrelevant considerations because that
would be denial of equality". (See paragraph 85 at page 38).
</p><p id="p_124">22.    The Supreme Court went on to restate the principle in its subsequent

 reasons, does not disclose any valid, relevant or discernible principle. I may
here only quote with profit the observation made by the Constitution Bench
in the case of Ram Krishna Dalmia in relation to a legislative act:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "...(f) that while good faith and knowledge of the existing
       conditions on the part of the legislature are to be presumed, if
       there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding
       circumstances brought to the notice of the court on which the
       classification may reasonably be regarded as based, the
       presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried to the extent
       of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and
       unknown reasons for subjecting certain individuals or
       corporations to hostile or discriminating legislation...."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                                      (emphasis is mine)

22.1 Pertinently, the aforesaid observation is cited with approval by the
Supreme Court in its most recent judgment in the case of Indian Hotel &amp;
Restaurants Association.
</blockquote><p id="p_125">22.2 Keeping in mind the aforesaid, let me examine the tenability of the
latest guidelines relied upon by respondent No.1. The latest guidelines
(which are adverted to in paragraph 18 of the affidavit of respondent no.1),
while providing for the manner in which applications would be invited from
Law graduates of eligible National Law Schools/ Colleges and the mode and
manner in which they are processed, does not provide for, an eligibility
criteria for empanelment, which is the core grievance of the petitioner
herein.
</p><p id="p_126">22.3 In this regard, I may also, once again, advert to the annual report of
the Supreme Court for the year 2007-08, on which reliance was placed,
though filed by the petitioner.     A particular emphasis was placed on
paragraphs 30 to 32 of the annual report. While paragraph 30 discloses the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 43 of 56</span>
 fact that Hon'ble the CJI is the Chancellor or visitor of several "reputed
institutions", the examples of which are given; paragraph 31 adverts to the
fact that law clerks are drawn from "various empanelled National Law
Schools and other approved Law Colleges and Universities". There is also a
reference to the honorarium (which was Rs.20,000/- at that time) which is
paid on engagement, as also, to the various Law Colleges (as empanelled at
that time), which fall within the three categories referred to above.
Paragraph 32, of the very same report, dilates on the procedure which, inter
alia, requires the empanelled Law schools to submit applications and bio-
datas of their final year students pursuing a five (5) year Law course. In the
said paragraph, it is also indicated that the selection is carried out by a panel
of Judges, whereafter a list is prepared.   It is also stated that the assignment
as LCRA is for short periods, and that, on being engaged the LCRAs, are
required to execute an undertaking in the given format. In my opinion, the
disclosure in the annual report does not answer the question which has been
raised in the present petition, which is, what is the criteria for empanelment
of Law Colleges and Universities, and thus, the rationale for confining the
field of consideration for engagement of LCRAs to only those who have
graduated from the empanelled Law Colleges/ Universities.
22.4 The argument advanced on behalf of respondent no.1 that the
empanelled Colleges have not been made parties and hence the writ petition
is not maintainable, is according to me, an argument which deserves to be
rejected at the very threshold. The reason for this is that, the petitioner has
sought a declaration qua the scheme/ policy which has been put in place,
which purportedly led to the empanelment of eighteen (18) Colleges. The
petitioner has challenged the scheme/ policy of empanelment.            For this



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 44 of 56</span>
 purpose the Colleges need not be made parties as the scheme/ policy, if at
all, had to be defended by respondent no.1. In granting relief sought for by
the petitioner, I have taken care in not disturbing the recruitment of LCRAs
under the present dispensation for the year 2013-14. That, respondent no.1
may have to devise a policy which accords with the import of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_72">Article 14</a>, is
another matter.    Therefore, from hereon, much would depend on how
respondent no.1 would proceed post the directions issued in this particular
case.
</p><p id="p_127">22.5 There is yet another argument, which was advanced on behalf of
respondent no.1, which was that it is for the authority concerned, (which
seeks to recruit persons for the purposes for enabling it to discharge its
duties), to decide on the mode of selection and the qualifications required for
selecting a suitable candidate. One cannot quibble with this proposition and
the case law cited for this purpose on behalf of respondent no.1.       What is
found fault with is that there is no discernible principle or guidelines based
on which respondent no.1 has proceeded to select candidates from only
empanelled Law Colleges and Universities. If the argument of respondent
no.1 is that sourcing of prospective candidates from the empanelled Colleges
is itself a qualification criteria; it is a submission, which would have to be
rejected. There can be no difficulty in respondent no.1 providing minimum
qualification for recruitment of prospective applicants; as long as
empanelment is not confined to few selected Law Colleges and Universities,
without disclosing the relevant parameter or benchmark necessary, for
achieving empanelment.       Therefore, this argument, in my opinion, is
misconceived and hence rejected.
</p><p id="p_128">22.6 The other argument advanced on behalf of respondent no.1 is that, no



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 45 of 56</span>
 fault could be found with empanelment of limited number of Colleges from
amongst 900 Law Colleges, which had been recognized by the Bar Council
of India, as it was in effect a method employed to prune the best Law
Colleges/ Universities from a whole range of Law Colleges, which were
recognized by Bar Council of India.
</p><p id="p_129">22.6(i) This argument would have had some merit, if in reducing the
catchment area to a manageable number, respondent no.1 had employed
discernible and valid principle or guidelines. Administrative convenience
simpliciter cannot trump the mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_73">Article 14.</a>
</p>

<p id="p_130">CASES CITED BY RESPONDENT NO.1
</p><p id="p_131">23.    Before I conclude I must briefly deal with the cases referred to on
behalf of respondent no.1. The judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/745260/" id="a_74">Secretary, A.P.
Public Service Commission vs. B. Swapna and Ors</a>. relates to the power of
the A.P. Public Service Commission, to recruit persons vis-a-vis 'fallout'
vacancies, without taking recourse to the waiting list / ranking list. Both the
administrative tribunal as well as the High Court had accorded relief to the
respondents by taking recourse to the amended Rule. The Supreme Court,
found fault with this approach. The Supreme Court, was of the view that
regard ought to have been made to the unamended Rule, which was
applicable to the case. Under the unamended Rule, A.P. Public Service
Commission had the power to freeze the waiting list, and thus, had the
power not to take recourse to the waiting list in recruiting the candidates.
</p><p id="p_132">24.    It is not understood as to how this judgment would apply to the facts
of this case.    The observations of the Supreme Court in paragraph 14 on
which reliance was placed by the counsel for respondent no.1 that once the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 46 of 56</span>
 process of selection is started, the prescribed criteria cannot be changed, in
my view, would have no application in the present case as this is a case
where there is no prescribed criteria in place for empanelment of Law
Colleges / Universities.
</p><p id="p_133">25.      In so far as the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1014138/" id="a_75">Directorate of Film Festivals
and Ors. vs. Gaurav Ashwin Jain and Ors</a>. is concerned, it is also
distinguishable for the following reasons :-
</p><p id="p_134">25.1 This was a case where the respondents had succeeded in the High
Court.      The High Court had found fault with the eligibility criteria
requirements put in place by appellant no.1 for entering films in the non-
feature film category, for award of National Film Awards.             The first
eligibility condition required that film entered should have been certified by
the Central Board of Film Certification (in short the Board). The second
condition, required that the film entered should have been released in the
film 'celluloid' format.
</p><p id="p_135">25.2 Before the Supreme Court, the second eligibility condition was given
up by the appellants and therefore, it was called upon to examine the
tenability of only the first eligibility condition.   The argument before the
Supreme Court proceeded on the basis that films made by Doordarshan and
other film Institutes did not require certification by the Board before they
were entered for consideration of the National Film Awards and therefore,
there was a case of discrimination.
</p><p id="p_136">25.3 There was an additional submission advanced on behalf of the
respondents which was that, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
permitted entry of films in "Film Festivals" (non-commercial section),
without certification by the Board.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">WP(C) 360/2013                                                    Page 47 of 56</span>
<p id="p_137"> 25.4 The Supreme Court based on its analysis of the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/980182/" id="a_76">Cinematograph Act</a>, 1952 came to the conclusion that it was a policy
decision of the Government to permit entry of films for the purposes of
National Film Awards, to only those, which had been certified by the Board
for exhibition. In other words, films which could be publically exhibited.
The Supreme Court, was of the view that the object of the National Film
Awards was to encourage production of films which had high aesthetic
value and technical quality coupled with social relevance, so as to be able to
contribute to the understanding and appreciation of cultures of different
regions of the country and also be instrumental in promoting national
integration and unity.
</p><p id="p_138">25.5 The Supreme Court found no irrationality in the Government
formulating a policy to select best films from amongst those which were
made and certified for public exhibition as against those, which were
generally made, without having the requisite certification.
25.6 As is evident, the requirement of certification of films was based on
the provisions of a statutory act, which invested in the Government the
power to exempt certain entities from the provisions of the Act. The
classification in this case was based on a criteria which was intelligible and
had a nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The object was to have
certified films put in public domain, so as to meet socially relevant goals. In
this case, the classification is neither based on intelligible criteria nor has a
nexus with the stated object.
</p><p id="p_139">26.    The next judgment cited on behalf of respondent no.1 is Chandigarh
Administration through the Director Public Instructions (Colleges),
Chandigarh vs. Usha Kheterpal Waie &amp; Ors. This was a case where the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 48 of 56</span>
 Supreme Court was called upon to examine the tenability of the eligibility
condition provided in an advertisement issued by the appellant before it i.e.,
Chandigarh Administration with regard to the recruitment of candidates for
filling up the vacancies in the post of Principal, in the Colleges under its
purview. The eligibility criteria apparently was that only those lecturers
could be considered for appointment to the post of principal who, inter alia,
possessed a Ph.D. degree. Evidently, this condition was inserted based on
draft rules which had not been notified by the Central Government at the
stage at which the advertisement was issued. The Supreme Court, upheld
the condition contained in the advertisement, based on its own precedent,
which held that, administrative decisions taken to make promotions based on
draft rules, which are in the process of being finalized, are valid decisions.
The court also sustained the condition in the advertisement on the ground
that the Executive had necessary power to issue administrative instructions
in respect of the matters which are not governed by the statute or rules.
Therefore, the reliance on this judgment is totally misconceived. This was a
case in which eligibility conditions were provided, the challenge was to the
stage, at which, eligibility conditions had been inserted.
</p><p id="p_140">27.    The next judgment cited on behalf of respondent no.1 i.e., <a href="/doc/1184570/" id="a_77">Sanchit
Bansal and Anr. vs. Joint Admission Board and Ors</a>., is also,
distinguishable on facts.    In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the
evaluation procedure which gave weight to cut off marks secured by an
applicant in individual marks over and above the aggregate marks secured
by an applicant. The appellant no.1 before the Supreme Court had secured
an aggregate of 231 marks in mathematics, physics and chemistry. The
appellant no.1 had failed to secure the minimum cut off marks in chemistry,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 49 of 56</span>
 which were 55. The respondent no.1/Board had fixed minimum cut off
marks in chemistry as 55. Since, the appellant no.1, had secured only 52
marks in chemistry, he did not qualify for admission and hence the
challenge. It is in this context that the Supreme Court declined to interfere
with the evaluation criteria fixed by the respondent no.1/Board. The facts
obtaining in that case are clearly distinguishable.
</p><p id="p_141">28.    The judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/64632052/" id="a_78">State of U.P. and Ors. vs. U.P. State Law
Officers Association and Ors</a>., would also, not help the cause of respondent
no.1 in view of the fact that the Supreme Court in that case was considering
the legal validity of the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad , whereby
the order passed by the State of UP removing 26 out of 64 Law Officers was
set aside by the High Court.       The court noted that since the respondents
were beneficiaries of a "spoils system" and, given the fact that, their
contracts had already come to an end, the direction issued by the High Court
to continue their appointment could not sustain. What is interesting is the
observation of the Supreme Court in paragraph 19 which, in no uncertain
terms, highlights the fact that appointments of Government counsels should
ordinarily be made on merit alone and that in the absence of guidelines the
appointments may be made purely on personal or political considerations
and, consequently, be arbitrary. The court went on to say therefore, those
who were appointed         by an arbitrary procedure cannot complain if the
termination of their appointment is equally arbitrary. The facts in the said
case clearly revealed that it can have no applicability to the instant case.
</p><p id="p_142">29.    The case cited on behalf of respondent no.1. i.e., <a href="/doc/321019/" id="a_79">State of U.P. and
Anr. vs. Johri Mal</a> is related to renewal of term of district Government
counsels.        In this context, the provisions of Section 24 of the Code of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 50 of 56</span>
 Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the Code) and the relevant provisions of
the Legal Remembrancer's Manual were considered by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court ruled that the court could issue a mandamus where the
petitioner establishes enforceable legal right in himself which corresponds
with the legal duty in public authorities. One cannot quibble with the
principle. The scope of judicial review is also well known. Whether a
particular case would fall within the realm of a court exercising writ
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_80">Article 226</a> of the Constitution would obviously depend
on the facts of each case. The facts of Johri Mal's case in my view are
clearly distinguishable. Even in the said case, the Supreme Court having
regard to the provisions of the Code came to the conclusion that provisions
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_81">Article 14</a> would be applicable, though to a limited extent as the persons
named therein were public functionaries. Though, there was no concept of
public office, having come into play in the matter of engagement of district
Government counsel, the Supreme Court observed that if, the State were to
fail in the discharge of its public duty or act in defiance, deviation or
departure of principles of law, the court could interfere.
29.1 In my view, the said judgment turns on its own peculiar facts.
</p><p id="p_143">30.    The rationale of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/530963/" id="a_82">State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. vs. Rakesh Kumar Keshari and Anr</a>. is
more or less similar which again dealt with appointment or renewal of
contracts of Government counsels / pleaders.
</p><p id="p_144">31.    In the case of <a href="/doc/499519/" id="a_83">Vinay Balachandra Joshi vs. Registrar General</a>,
Supreme Court of India and Anr. the Supreme Court was called upon to
deal with the issue of allotment of chambers to the members of the Supreme
Court Bar Association. In this context, the rules framed by then Hon'ble



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">WP(C) 360/2013                                                 Page 51 of 56</span>
 the CJI for allotment of chambers of lawyers falling in the category of
advocates-on-record, non advocates-on-record and senior advocates, were
examined. In the instant case, we are faced with a situation where there are
no guidelines, rules or criteria in place. In my view, this judgment is
distinguishable, once again, on facts.
</p><p id="p_145">32.    Lastly, on behalf of respondent no.1 two judgments were cited which
dealt with the issue pertaining to the policy formulated by the Government
of India whereby, public sector enterprises were allowed recruitment of
management trainees by taking recourse to the methodology of on campus
interviews.
</p><p id="p_146">32.1 The first judgment cited in this behalf was that of the Division Bench
of the Kerala High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/706567/" id="a_84">Federation of Central Government
SC/ST Employees vs. Kochi Refineries Ltd</a>.
</p><p id="p_147">32.2 The second judgment was of a single Judge of the Madras High Court
in the case titled : Chennai Petroleum Employee's <a href="/doc/14071601/" id="a_85">Union vs. The General
Manager, H.R. Petroleum Corporation Ltd</a>., which merely followed the
judgment of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court.
32.3 The challenge to the Government policy which was contained in
office memorandum dated 29.05.2000 was raised in both cases by the
employees' union. There was no challenge by a prospective candidate with
regard to the policy of direct recruitment from certain specific Institutions.
32.4 The other distinguishing feature was, the argument of the petitioner
that the recruitment rules were being given a go-by. The Division Bench of
the Kerala High Court came to the conclusion that when State involved itself
in business or in commercial ventures where competition was keen, novel
methods could be adopted to keep ahead in the race, bearing in mind,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 52 of 56</span>
 national interest. Therefore, the Kerala High Court found no fault with
recruitment being made by on campus interviews.
</p><p id="p_148">32.5 In the other case which was decided by the learned single Judge of the
Madras High Court it was noticed that the petitioner union had entered into
a settlement under <a href="/doc/664381/" id="a_86">Section 18(1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 qua
promotions of its members, and therefore, the methodology of on campus
interviews for direct recruitment could not be found fault with.
32.6 What is clear, is that, in both cases persons employed through direct
recruitment through the methodology of on campus interviews did not
directly impinge upon the interest of employees who were already in harness
whereas in the present case, the policy / scheme which has been put in place
has resulted in exclusion of the petitioner from consideration for
engagement as a LCRA at the very threshold. Thus, in my view, the ratio of
these two judgments will have to be read in the background of the facts
arising in the said cases.
</p><p id="p_149">32.7 It may perhaps be of some miniscule relevance, that the Supreme
Court in the <a href="/doc/706567/" id="a_87">Federation of Central Government SC/ST Employees, Kochi
Refineries &amp; Ors. vs. Kochi Refineries Ltd</a>., has granted leave to appeal in
SLP (C) No.17538/2005 vide order dated 14.09.2007.
</p><p id="p_150">33.    The petitioner, in effect, is asking for a look-in or consideration of her
ability to fulfil the role of a LCRA. Denial of such an opportunity by
respondent no.1, by taking recourse to the present dispensation, is in my
view, manifestly unjust.     The scheme/ policy/ eligibility criteria is both
discriminatory and arbitrary, and thus, violative of the equality clause
engrafted in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_88">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Characteristically, a Constitution
Bench of the Supreme Court in the context of promotions in Government



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">WP(C) 360/2013                                                     Page 53 of 56</span>
 service has ruled that the right to be considered for promotion according to
relevant rules is a Fundamental Right and not just a statutory right. [see Ajit
Singh &amp; Ors. (II) vs. State of Punjab &amp; Ors. (1999) 7 SCC 209 (at
paragraphs 22 and 27 at pages 227 and 228, respectively)]. Though,
engagement as a LCRA is not an employment to a civil post, nevertheless,
the right to be considered will, in my view, be an enforceable right qua an
organ of the state such as the Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_151">33.1 On behalf of respondent no.1, an attempt was made to defend the
scheme / policy presently in place by relying upon the mechanism in place
in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. I have consciously chosen not to
discuss the schemes / policies for engagement of LCRAs which is prevalent
in other High Courts for two reasons.        First, in the present matter the
schemes / policies of those High Courts are not under consideration or
challenge.       Second,   the petitioner has cited examples of various High
Courts where empanelment of select Law Colleges / Universities is not the
route followed, while considering applicants for engagement as LCRAs.
Therefore, mindful of this situation, I have chosen to only concentrate on
the scheme / policy formulated by the Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_152">33.2 Therefore, I have no hesitation in declaring that the scheme/ policy, as
formulated, is unconstitutional. This is not to say, that respondent no.1
cannot devise a scheme/policy. It is undoubtedly empowered to design a
policy which is fair and equitable, and that, which enables every aspirant to
be considered for engagement as a LCRA.           Necessarily, the mode and
manner of sifting the source would have to be devised by respondent no.1.
Therefore, to the extent the present scheme/policy confines the source of
candidates, for engagement as LCRAs, to the empanelled Law Colleges and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">WP(C) 360/2013                                                   Page 54 of 56</span>
 Universities; it is illegal. That said the concerned Judge with whom a
LCRA is to be attached will ultimately have a say in the matter. The
concerned Judge would necessarily have a pool of eligible LCRAs available
with him / her from which he / she could choose a particular LCRA for
attachment.
</p><p id="p_153">34.    The fact that respondent no. 1 has already undertaken the exercise for
the year 2013-14 cannot be denied, and therefore, there can be no reversal of
the process, which has already crystalized. The reason for the same is two-
fold. First, it would unnecessarily upset the working of the court, which
cannot be in public interest. Second, it would affect the interest of those
applicants, who have been appointed as LCRAs.
</p><p id="p_154">35.    This brings me to the next limb of the petitioner's prayer, as to
whether a mandamus should issue to respondent no.1 to accept and consider
the petitioner's application for engagement as a LCRA for the remaining
term which ends in summer of 2014. Having held that sourcing of
candidates only from empanelled Law Colleges and Universities, is illegal,
the next logical step would be to direct respondent no.1 to consider the
petitioner's application for engagement as a LCRA, notwithstanding the fact
that respondent no.2 is not on the panel maintained by respondent no.1, and
that, the petitioner's application is not sponsored by respondent no.2. It is
directed accordingly. Respondent no.1, shall consider the application of the
petitioner for engagement as a LCRA, for at least, the remaining term.
</p><p id="p_155">36.    In view of the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is allowed in the
above terms. Consequently, no orders are called for in the captioned
interlocutory application. Accordingly, CM No.739/2013 is also disposed of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">WP(C) 360/2013                                                  Page 55 of 56</span>
 in the above terms. The parties are, however, directed to bear their own
costs.
