    to the issuance of the present impugned order dated 16 th

    impugned detention order dated 16th December, 2014 can
                         
    briefly be summarised as under.        It is stated that based on
                        
    intelligence, the detenu was intercepted by the Air Intelligence

    Officers of Customs, C.S.I. Airport, Mumbai on 11 th May, 2014 at
       

    08.15 hours.     The detenu was holding an Indian Passport and
    



    on his arrival from Dubai he had cleared himself through the

    green channel of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport,





    Terminal-2, Sahar, Mumbai.      The detenu was coming out by

    talking over phone and carrying only a shoulder bag.                      The

    Customs Officers took the detenu's passport and              verified the





    arrivals and departures stamp / endorsement on the passport

    and found that the detenu had made 17 visits to Dubai during

    the period from December 2013 till his interception. It is noticed

    that the detenu had short stay in abroad during each visit. The

    hand bag which the detenu was possessing was screened and a

    metal concealed in the said shoulder bag.           After following due

    procedure, the said hand bag was opened in the presence of the

    said    hand   bag   7   packets     wrapped   with     cream        coloured

    packets were found to contain 12 gold bars each weighing 1 kg.

    explain the delay in issuing the detention order even in the

    vitiated.   She has taken a specific ground in the memo of

    Petition as ground No.5(i) to that effect. In the said ground, it has




                                                
    been contended that though the date of incident is 11 th May,

    2014 and the inculpatory     statement recorded by the Customs

    Authorities is also dated 11th May, 2014, the impugned detention




                                         
    order was belatedly and leisurely issued on 16 th December, 2014
                         
    i.e. after a lapse of seven months and after about five months
                        
    from the date of release of the Petitioner on bail.           It has been

    contended in the said ground that the impugned order of
        

    detention is stale and remote in point of time and the same is
     



    malafide, null and void.     It has been further contended that

    because of the inordinate delay on the part of the Respondent





    authorities, the live link having been snapped and the credible

    chain has been broken and on that ground also the detention

    order stands vitiated.   In support of her contention, she relied





    upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/678597/" id="a_6">T.A. Abdul

    Rahman v. State of Kerala and others</a> reported in AIR 1990

              summarised         thus:      The    question       whether          the
              prejudicial activities of a person necessitating to pass
              an order of detention is proximate to the time when




                                                   
              the order is made or the              live-link between the
              prejudicial activities and the purpose of detention is
              snapped depends on the facts and circumstances of




                                           
              each case. No hard and fast rule can be precisely
              formulated that
                          ig             would    be applicable under all
              circumstances and no exhaustive guidelines can be
              laid down in that behalf. It follows           that the test of
                        
              proximity is not a rigid or mechanical test by merely
              counting number of months between the offending
              acts and the order of detention. However, when there
       


              is undue and long delay between the prejudicial
    



              activities and the          passing of detention order, the
              Court has to scrutinise             whether the            detaining
              authority has satisfactorily examined such                    a delay





              and afforded a tenable and reasonable explanation as
              to    why such a delay has occasioned, when                      called
              upon      to answer and further the Court has to





              investigate whether the causal connection has been
              broken in the circumstances of each case.</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">

          the lapse of      five months that it was necessary to

          counting the months of the interval' was sound. It all
       

          depends    on the nature of the acts relied on, grave
          and determined or less serious and corrigible, on the
    



          length of the gap, short or long, on            the reason           for

          information of participation being available only in

          proximity is not a rigid or        mechanical test              to be

    sponsoring authority by the detaining authority, a specific
                        
    question was asked as to whether, after forwarding the proposal

    to the detaining authority till that date, the proposed detenue
       

    was found to be involved in smuggling / adverse activities. The
    



    record further discloses that to the said query raised by the

    detaining authority the sponsoring authority has specifically and





    categorically submitted an answer stating therein that the

    proposed detenu was not involved in any smuggling / adverse

    activities subsequent to the sending of the proposal. It is to be

    entered into by the detaining authority with the sponsoring

    authority despite the fact that the sponsoring authority had




                                                     
    categorically stated by its communication dated 30 th July, 2014

    submitted by the detaining authority that the proposed detenu

    was not found indulged into smuggling / adverse activities after
           

    submitting the proposal, in our opinion, the live link between the
        



    date of incident in question i.e. 11th May, 2014 and the detention

    order dated 16th December, 2014 which came to be executed on





    8th January, 2015 is snapped, coupled with the afore stated delay

    at the behest of the Respondents in issuing the detention order.

<p id="p_39">    18.    For the reasons, stated herein above, we are of the
