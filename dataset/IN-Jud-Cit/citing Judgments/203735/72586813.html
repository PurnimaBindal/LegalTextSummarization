of India2</a>,    has referred the present batch of cases to a larger

Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
2.1   In the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra), a three Judge

Bench construed the provisions of Regulations 9(IV) and 9(VII) of

the MCI Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, as

amended on 15.2.2012 (hereinafter referred to as the “MCI

Regulations 2000”). In the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra),

while considering the aforesaid Regulations, this Court held that

the aforesaid Regulations do not provide for any reservation for

in­service government doctors in PG degree courses, and

therefore, the State Government order providing the reservation

for PG degree courses for in­service government doctors is held to

be illegal.

<p id="p_6">2.2   The present batch of cases came up for hearing before

another Bench of three Judges. The Bench was of the opinion

that the present batch of cases require consideration by a larger

Bench and that is how the present batch of cases are referred to

a larger Bench.       On the basis of the submissions made, the

following reasons were mentioned:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      “(i) The decision in Dinesh Singh Chauhan1 has not considered

      particularly Entry 66 of the Union List and Entry 25 of the
      Concurrent List;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          (ii) The main contention of the petitioners is that while
      coordination and determination of standards in institutions for
      higher education falls within the exclusive domain of the Union
      (Entry 66 List I), medical education is a subject in the
      Concurrent List (Entry 25 List III). Though, Entry 25 of List III is
      subject to Entry 66 of List I, the State is not denuded of its
      power to legislate on the manner and method of making
      admissions to postgraduate medical courses;

2.3   Now so far as Civil Appeals arising out of the Special Leave

Petitions(C) Nos.26448­26449 of 2019 are concerned, they arise

out of the impugned judgment and order dated 01/10/2019 in

MAT Nos. 1245 and 1267 of 2019 passed by the High Court at

Calcutta, by which the Division Bench of the High Court has

dismissed the batch of appeals confirming the order passed by

the learned Single Judge holding that the State has no authority

petitioners/parties,   more   particularly,   Tamil   Nadu    Medical

Association, State of Tamil Nadu, State of West Bengal and

others in support of the reservation for in­service Medical

Officers/ Candidates/Doctors in Post­graduate Degree Courses

have made the following submissions:
</p>
<p id="p_15">3.1. The moot question is whether the State Government is

competent to provide for a reservation for candidates who are

already serving the Government. Such reservation is made for

Post­graduate seats in the different medical colleges in the State.

The competence of the State Government is traceable to <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_7">Article

245</a> r/w Entry 25 List III of the 7 th schedule to the Constitution.

It cannot be said that there has to be a legislature made law to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                  7</span>


provide for such reservation. The Government can in exercise of

its power as an Executive under <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_8">Article 154</a> provide for such

reservation and it has been so provided as well.

</p><p id="p_16">      Once competence is found in favour of Government then

only question is one of a possible conflict with a Central Law and

the resolution of any question of repugnancy. It is submitted that

said question really does not arise in the present case;

3.2. The competence of the State Government to bring about a

law dealing with admissions of in­service candidates is upheld by

the Constitutional Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/99335142/" id="a_9">Modern

Dental College and Research Centre and Others vs. State of

Madhya Pradesh and Others3</a>. The argument raised on behalf of

the Centre that Entry 25 of List III itself would be subject to

Entry 66 of List I has also been considered by this Court;

3.3. There is no question of any conflict of Entry 25 of List III

and Entry 66 of List I. The subject of admission to courses is

referable to Entry 25 of list III and not Entry 66 of List I. It is

submitted that conflict, if any, can only be between a State Law




3 (2016) 7 SCC 353
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                          8</span>


and a Central Law both sourced to Entry 25 of List III. That no

such conflict is present in the instant case;

3.4. There is no plenary law by the Centre provided for any

reservation for in­service candidates. In other words, there is no

Central Law governing the said aspect, therefore, it would be

competent for the State Government to provide for a reservation

for in­service candidates. In the absence of a Central Law, it is

obviously open to the State Government to provide for a legal

instrument, whether by way of a statute or by an executing order

providing a reservation for in­service candidates;

3.5. The MCI Regulations, 2000, which are made under the

<a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_10">Medical Council Act</a> provide for a reservation in Post­graduate

Diploma Courses for in­service candidates serving with the

respective   State   Governments.      There    is   no   bar    to   such

reservation in Post­graduate Degree Courses. The bar, if any, has

to be express and cannot be implied. Clause 9(IV) of the MCI

Regulations, 2000 can be construed as provided for community

reservations and also a reservation for in­service candidates.

Even   otherwise,    it   does   not   enable    explicitly     the   State

Government to provide for a weightage in marks, amongst in­
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                  9</span>


service candidates. Thus, the legislative instrument which could

be sourced to the MCI, which in turn is a body established by the

Central Government under the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_11">Medical Council Act</a> itself

recognizes an empowerment of the State Government, inter alia,

to lay down the modalities to regulate or provide for a reservation

for in­service candidates in Post­graduate seats. If that be so,

then the actual prescription of a reservation for in­service

candidates, in relation to Post­graduate Degree seats obviously

has not come into conflict with the MCI Regulations, 2000 so as

to attract <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_12">Article 254</a> of the Constitution;

3.6. The MCI Regulations, 2000, not expressly providing for a

reservation   in    Post­graduate     Degree   seats,   specifically

empowering the State Government to do so, but only touches

upon the reservation in Diploma seats, it does not follow that the

State Government is incompetent to provide for reservation for

in­service candidates in Degree seats as well. The competence of

the State Government to provide for reservation for in­service

candidates is not sourced to the MCI Regulations, 2000, but it is

sourced to Entry 25 of List III. Thus, the absence of any mention

of reservation for candidates in Post­graduate Degree seats in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                10</span>


Regulations, 2000 cannot support a submission by the MCI that

consequently the State Government would be incompetent to

provide for any reservation for in­service candidates in Degree

seats;
</p>
<p id="p_17">3.7. The MCI Regulations, 2000 would become relevant only

when it provides for reservation in Post­graduate Degree seats

and the State Government brings about a policy of reservation in

Post­graduate Decree seats at variance from the protocol laid

down in the MCI Regulations. The MCI Regulations, 2000 are

silent in regard to the reservation in Post­graduate Degree seats

and therefore, possible repugnancy under <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_13">Article 254</a> of the

Constitution of India really cannot arise between an instrument

by the State Government and an instrument by the Central

Government which does not cover the subject or touch upon the

subject provided for by the State Government;

3.8.     Assuming without admitting that though MCI Regulations

do provide for a conversion of Diploma seats into Degree seats, by

the State Government with the approval of the MCI, the MCI

Regulations, 2000 do not specifically mention the consequences

of such conversion. When law provides for a particular event to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                     11</span>


take place then all reasonable consequences that emanates

therefrom should also be inferred, should be applied to the

present situation as well;
</p>
<p id="p_18">3.9. Even    MCI   Regulations,     2000   themselves   provide     for

reservation for in­service candidates in Diploma and also

provides for service condition to be fulfilled thereunder.          The

conversion of Diploma seats into Degree seats (now after 2018)

would obviously result in the same permissible reservation for in­

service candidates to be provided for Degree seats as well. All that

would be required is the imposition of the same conditions as are

provided in the Diploma seats;
</p>
<p id="p_19">
3.10.The decision of this Court in the case of Dinesh Singh

Chauhan (Supra) also requires re­look in view of the subsequent

development viz. Notification dated 12.07.2018 by which, MCI

has permitted the Medical College/Medical Institution to “seek

equal number of Post­graduate Degree seats by surrendering

recognized   diploma   seats   in   corresponding   course”.   It    is

submitted that pursuant to the said Notification the medical

colleges/institutions are/were given the option of converting the

available post graduate diploma seats into Post­graduate Degree
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                  12</span>


seats in a 1:1 ratio. It is submitted that pursuant to the said

notification most of the medical colleges/medical institutions in

the   respective   States   have   surrendered   the   Post­graduate

Diploma seats and have converted the same to Post­graduate

Degree seats. It is submitted that resultant effect is that now

there shall not be any Post­graduate Diploma seats available and

therefore, in­service candidates are left in a situation where even

the limited benefit conferred on them in form of 50% reservations

in Post­graduate Diploma Course can no longer be availed. As a

result, in­service candidates have been left in a complete lurch

since they would neither be able to qualify for Post­graduate

Degree course in adequate numbers nor be in a position to avail

the Post­graduate Diploma seats previously available in the

Government Colleges. In view of the above development, the

reasoning in the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) as to the

difference in the Regulations between Post­graduate Diploma and

Degree courses no longer survives;
</p>
<p id="p_20">3.11. Right of the State Government to set apart a definite

percentage of educational seats at Post­graduate level consisting

of Degree and Diploma courses exclusively for a class of persons

as a separate source of entry has been repeatedly upheld by this

Court with the condition that source is properly classified –

whether on territorial, geographical or other reasonable basis and

has a rational nexus with the object of imparting a particular

education and effective selection for the purpose. Reliance is

placed upon the decision of this Court in the cases of (1) <a href="/doc/195765/" id="a_14">Kumari

Chitra Ghosh and Anr. vs. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. 4; (2) <a href="/doc/1276295/" id="a_15">D.N.

</p>
<p id="p_21">3.12.              It has been consistently held by this Court that there

is a legitimate and rational basis in providing a separate

channel/source of entry for in­service candidates in order to

encourage them to offer their services and expertise to the State.

It is submitted that this Court has acknowledged that this has a

sufficient nexus with the larger goal of equalization of educational

opportunities and to sufficiently prefer the doctors serving in the

various hospitals run and maintained out of public funds, in the

absence of which there would be serious dearth of qualified Post­

graduate doctors to meet the requirements of the common public;

3.13.     Unlike reservation envisaged for Scheduled Caste/

Schedule Tribes, this is a distinct and vitally important public

purpose in itself absolutely necessitated in the best of public

interest. In the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) this Court

has held that no fault can be found with the method of providing

a separate channel of entry for in­service candidates for the

reason that the facilities for keeping up with the latest medical

literature might not be available to such in­service candidates

and the nature of the work makes it difficult for them to acquire

knowledge about very recent medical research, which the

candidates who has come after freshly passing their graduation

examination might have;
</p>
<p id="p_22">
3.14.In the case of Modern Dental College and Research Centre

(supra), the Constitution Bench of this Court has affirmed that

even though Entry 25 List III is subject to Entry 66 List I, the

power of States to enact laws concerning admissions would not

the State of Kerala had a policy of reserving 40% of the seats

Gopal D. Tirthani (supra), this Court has repeatedly upheld the

right of the State Governments to set apart a definite percentage

diploma courses exclusively for a class of persons as a separate

source of entry, with the condition that the source is properly

classified whether on territorial, geographical or other reasonable

basis and has a rational nexus with the object of imparting a

particular education and effective selection for the purpose;

</p><p id="p_40">      It is submitted that in the aforesaid decisions, this Court

has upheld providing in­service candidates a separate source of

in­service doctors and non­service doctors has a reasonable

nexus with the objective sought to be achieved, i.e., of providing

adequate and affordable healthcare in the public sector;

</p><p id="p_41">ii)   The power of the State to provide for a separate source of

entry in matters of admission in medical education flows from

Entry 25, List III of the Constitution, whereas the power of the

standards” in matters of admission in medical education is

derived from Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                   29</span>


</p><p id="p_42">iii)   This Court in the case of Modern Dental College (supra) has

specifically held after considering the earlier decisions that Entry

66 of List I was a specific entry having a very specific and limited

scope, i.e., dealing with “coordination and determination of

standards” in institutions of higher education or research as well

as scientific and technical institutions. It has been further held

that the words “coordination and determination of standards”

would mean laying down the said standard and thus, when it

comes to prescribing the standards for such institutions of higher

learning, exclusive domain is given to the Union.          Insofar as

medical education is concerned, the same is achieved by

parliamentary legislation in the form of <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_27">Medical Council of India

India,   the   functions   of   which   take,   within    its   sweep,

determination and coordination of standards in a medical

institution and that of educational institutions.        It is further

observed that when it comes to regulating education as such

which includes medical education as well as universities

(imparting higher education), that is prescribed in Entry 25 of List

laws under Entry 25, List III would not stand extinguished so

long as such laws did not have the effect of wiping out the law

enacted by the Union under Entry 66 of List I;

4.7   It is further submitted that the observations of this Court in

the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) as regards Regulation 9

prohibiting the States to provide a separate source of entry for in­

service candidates require re­consideration inasmuch as:

9 which prohibits the States from exercising their power under

Entry 25, List III and providing a separate channel of entry to in­

service candidates. On the contrary, the fact that preference is

given to in­service candidates is perceived to be a laudable

objective by the Union also, is evident from the proviso to

Regulation 9(IV) and Regulation 9(VII).      However, Regulation 9

has not (rightly so) prescribed a uniform policy for a separate

source of entry since only the State, which is fully aware of the

unique and peculiar facts of that State, can, if necessary, provide

for a separate source of entry for that State;


</p><p id="p_44">      b) that this Court relied upon the findings in Sudhir N

to arrive at the conclusion that the State Governments could not

provide a separate channel of entry to in­service candidates.

However, this Court failed to consider that even in Sudhir N

(supra), the case of Gopal D. Tirthani (supra) had been approved

and the impugned law framed by the State of Kerala had been

struck down on account of the State of Kerala giving the inter se

merits of in­service candidates a go­bye by fixing the criteria for

admission as inter se seniority. Thus, even in Sudhir N (supra),

the power of the State Governments to provide a separate channel

of entry to in­service candidates was affirmed;

</p><p id="p_45">      c) that this Court did not take into account the fact that by

providing a separate source of entry for in­service candidates,

there would be no lowering of standards prescribed by the

Medical Council of India since eligible candidates would have met

the admission would take place based on the inter se merits of

have affirmed the right of the State Government to determine the

admission process keeping in view their peculiar conditions with

the caveat that there is no laying down of uniform standard

and under­served population across the State. That there is an

absolute dearth of doctors entering Government services since

very few MBBS doctors join government service after their

graduation.   This situation affects the under­privileged, under­

served and poorest of poor people across the country who prefer

observations in the case of Sudhir N (supra) that Regulation 9 is a

complete code in itself may not be construed with respect to

providing reservation and/or making special provision like

providing separate source of entry for in­service candidates within

proviso is not in the form of an exception as it is independently

dealing with in­service doctors.     The proviso then becomes

substantive provision and is more concerned with the marks to be

allocated which is the concern of Regulation 9(III). This proviso

confers a discretion on the State to provide for weightage in

marks for services rendered in remote or difficult areas.      The

proviso was required because Regulation 9(III) prescribes for the

obtaining of minimum marks in the NEET exam.           The States

could not have relaxed or tinkered with the marking system.

Therefore, proviso enables the State by conferring a discretion to

provide for weightage.   The proviso has nothing to do with the

reservation in the postgraduate degree courses and it will not

negate the States power to make reservation;

4.11.1    Regulation 9(VII) provides that 50% of the seats in

postgraduate diploma courses shall be reserved for medical

officers in the government service. Firstly, this Regulation merely

deals with diploma courses and has no relevance to postgraduate

degree courses. Secondly, this provision makes it an obligation on

the part of the State to reserve 50% seats for in­service doctors.

The State, is therefore, left with no discretion and is bound to

not negate the discretionary power of the State Government to

make reservation for in­service doctors.

4.11.2    Regulation 9 contains no specific clause or expression

which would indicate that the field of making reservations for in­

service doctors in the postgraduate degree courses has been

covered. Hence, Regulation 9 is not a complete and exhaustive

code;

<p id="p_67">4.11.3    That by making Regulation 9(IV) and 9(VII), the

instead of ‘may be given’, ‘shall be given’, the proviso could have

become mandatory. Consciously such mandatory language is not

used in the proviso. However, if the mandatory language in the

nature of ‘shall be given’ was used, then the only way the States

could have recognised the in­service candidates entitlement to

postgraduate courses would have been by way of granting

incentive as provided therein.     Since the language does not

indicate that such course is mandatory and is only an enabling

provision, the State Rules/Act or directions issued by the

of India has made the following submissions against the power of

the States to make reservation of seats for in­service candidates

in Post­graduate Degree Courses and also in favour of validity of

the Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000:

5.1. MCI has framed a comprehensive scheme for admission to

Post­graduate Medicine (Degree and Diploma) Courses in the

form of Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000. The scheme

envisaged under Regulation 9 for admission to Post­graduate

Medicine (Degree and Diploma) is to be read as a whole. The

Regulation 9 when read as a whole show that it is in­service

doctors, i.e. doctors who have served in remote and difficult or

rural areas notified by the State Government, are given the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                   44</span>


maximum benefit under the said scheme as compared to other

candidates. The benefit given to the in­service doctors is in the

form of; (1) reservation in Post­graduate diploma courses; and (2)

grant of incentive marks in terms of Regulation 9(IV) of MCI

Regulations, 2000. The option of availing incentive marks for

Post­graduate degree courses or seeking reservation in post­

graduate degree courses is only available to in­service candidates

and the said option is not available to a non­service candidate;

5.2. <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_37">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 and the Regulation

framed thereunder are traceable to Entry 66 of List I of Schedule

VII of the Constitution of India and Entry 66 of List 1 provides for

“Co­ordination and Determination of Standards” in the field of

higher and technical education or research. The standard,

criteria, manner and basis of granting admission in medicine

courses fall within the exclusive domain of the Medical Council of

India. Regulation 9(IV) prescribes the criteria for determination of

merit on the basis of which admissions to be granted to students

in post­graduate degree courses;

the Regulations which govern post­graduate medical education.

These Regulations therefore, are binding and the States cannot in

the exercise of power under Entry 25 of the List III, make rules

and regulations which are in conflict with or adversely impinge

upon the Regulations framed by the Medical Council of India for

post­graduate medical education. Heavy reliance is placed upon

5.5. That in the case of Modern Dental College and Research

Centre (Supra) this Court has also further observed that exercise

of powers by the State Legislature on any matter under Entry 25

6.0. Now, so far as submission on behalf of the respective

petitioners on conversion of seats of Post­graduate Diploma

Course into seats of Post­graduate Degree pursuant to the

Notification dated 12.07.2018, it is vehemently submitted that as

such when the reference was made to a Larger Bench and even in

the original writ petition conversion of seats was not the issue

much less any basis for the said reference. It is submitted that

therefore, the issue of conversion of seats is a separate and

distinct issue and a separate cause of action, which is sought to

be clubbed with the present petition.
</p>
<p id="p_72">     It is submitted that however as submissions have been

made on this aspect, it is submitted as under:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                                  47</span>


A.   Conversion of seats from post­graduate diploma to degree is
     optional and not mandatory. No College/Institution was
     compelled or forced to opt for such conversion;

B.   The provisions for conversion was introduced as over the
     past years the students, medical colleges, State Government
     and other stake holders have complained about the scarcity
     of seats in the post­graduate degree courses which is the
     most preferred choice of students;
</p>
<p id="p_73">C.   To give an option to the States where the requirement of
     doctors post­graduate degrees is more to avail the benefit of
     conversion;
</p>
<p id="p_74">D.   This provision was not meant to take away or do away with
     the in­service reservation in post­graduate diploma courses.
     If any State/Government Medical College wants more
     diploma holders then it can retain those seats.

6.1. Now so far as submission on behalf of the respective

petitioners and the respective States that on conversion of post­

graduate diploma seats into degree seats in­service candidates

are deprived of reservation in diploma courses, it is submitted

that as such Government Medical Colleges and other Medical

Institutions in the State of Tamil Nadu and other States have

consciously and unconditionally chosen to opt for conversion of

seats. In fact, this conversion of seats helps the in­service doctors
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                                                  48</span>


also as there are a greater number of seats in post­graduate

degree courses for which they can compete;

6.2. It is submitted that any reservation for in­service candidates

in post­graduate degree course at this stage will give unfair

advantage to in­service candidates over other candidates by

increasing their seat share in the said degree courses;

6.3. That the Government Medical Colleges/Private Medical

Colleges/ Deemed Universities are keen to secure permission

from Government of India for post graduate degree courses only,

since post graduate diploma courses is not the preferred choice of

the students. In any case, the data in the table given below

indicates that not all post graduate diploma seats across the

Country have not been converted to post­graduate degree course.

Many States have not opted for conversion of seats in their

medical colleges;
</p>
<p id="p_75">6.4. It is important to take into consideration that if 30%

reservation of seats in post­graduate degree courses is reserved

for in­service candidates in State quota, then a major chunk of

these seats, particularly seats in clinical subjects will be reserved

for in­service candidates only;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                                  49</span><p id="p_76">


6.5. Now so far as submission on behalf of in­service candidates

that diploma seats for which reservation of in­service candidates

is permitted under Regulation 9(VIII) of MCI Regulations, upon

conversion into post­graduate degree seats, will continue to be

reserved for in­service candidates, it is submitted that the said

contention is devoid of merit and liable to be rejected since once

the seats in post­graduate diploma courses are converted to post­

graduate degree courses then the nature and colour of the said

seat itself changes and it will be governed by Regulation 9 (IV)

and not Regulation 9(VIII) of the MCI Regulations. It is submitted

that grievance of the petitioners, if any, as a result of conversion

is because of the action of their State Governments in applying

for conversion of seats;
</p>
<p id="p_77">6.6. There is clear cut distinction in post­graduate diploma seats

and post­graduate degree courses and both serve different

purposes. The conversion of post­graduate diploma seats into

post­graduate degree courses is only an enabling provision which

gives discretion to the State Government/Medical Institutes to

opt for such conversion. It is not in any manner intended to do

away with the reservation in post­graduate diploma courses

under Regulation 9(VIII) of the MCI Regulations, 2000;

6.7. Regulation 9(IV) of the MCI Regulations, 2000 serve a large

public interest and it is an objective way of determining merit.

Regulation 9(IV) of the Regulations based on the objective

consideration,   rational,   reasonableness   and    balances   the

competing interest of in­service candidates and non­service

(direct) candidates as well as the interest of State to have doctors

serving in remote and difficult or rural areas of the State and at

the same time also ensuring that there is no compromise of

merit;

for in­service candidates in Regulation 9 framed by the MCI

case of R. Chitralekha (supra) was passed there was no Entry 25

in List III (which came after the 42nd Amendment) and the two

Entries which were relevant for controversy in the said case were

Entry 66 of List I which has not been amended till now, and

Entry 11 of List II. The State therefore, had the power under

<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_48">Article 246(3)</a> read with Entry 11 to legislate in respect of

‘education’ subject to Entry 66 of List I. The expression

‘education’ was held in <a href="/doc/1627518/" id="a_49">Gujarat University v. Krishna Ranganath

Mudholkar14</a> (para 23) to be wide important and include all

matters     related     to   imparting       and   regulating   education.

Admittedly, there was no Central Enactment or regulation framed

under Entry 66 of List I which was to be considered by this

Hon’ble Court in the case of R. Chitralekha (supra);


7.3. That prior to the deletion of entry 11 of List II and insertion

of Entry 25 of List III, the Union Parliament could not deal with

the issue of imparting and regulating of the education which

vested exclusively in the State Legislature. The power of State

Legislature relating to ‘education’ was taken away only to the

extent Entry 11 of List II was made subject to relevant entries in

the List I including Entry 66 and Entry 25 of List III at the

relevant time dealt only with ‘vocational and technical training of

labour;
</p>
<p id="p_82">
7.4. In facts of R. Chitralekha (supra) the Court found that the

exercise of power impugned in the said case of admitting

students on the basis of higher or different qualification than

those prescribed by the University was not illegal as the

procedure adopted only contained a criteria to limit the

admission of students into colleges from amongst those who

secured the minimum qualifying marks prescribed. In other

words, the State Government did not transgress into any

forbidden are in the said case;
</p>
<p id="p_83">7.5. The instant case however deals with the situation where

Entry 11 is shifted from List II to List III as Entry 25, which Entry

enlarges the field (now concurrently vested with the State

Legislature and Union Parliament) beyond ‘Universities’ to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                   54</span>


‘technical education’ and ‘medical education’ also while retaining

‘vocational and technical training of labour’ in the original Entry;

7.6. The consequence of this change is that the State Legislature

does not have exclusive power over imparting and regulating of

education. And where the Centre has legislated on this subject,

the State Legislature would be denuded of its power subject of­

course to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_50">Article 254</a> of the Constitution (which has not been

invoked). In the absence of such legislative power even executive

power would not be available to the State Government;

7.7. Section 10 D has been inserted into <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_51">Medical Council of

India   Act</a>   (on   24.5.2016)   prescribing   a   uniform   entrance

examination ‘in such manner as may be prescribed.’ Section 10 D

has to be read with <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_52">Section 33</a> (mb) of the Act empowering the

MCI to make regulation concerning the manner of conducting

uniform entrance examination both at the undergraduate and

post­graduate level. In exercise of the power so conferred Post­

graduate Regulations were amended in 2018;

7.8. Regulation 9(IV) deals with “All India merit list as well as

State­wise merit list” on the basis of marks obtained in NEET for

admission to “post­graduate courses (both degree and diploma).
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                  55</span>


The proviso to Regulation 9(IV) stipulates that “in determining

the merit of the candidates” weightage in marks would be given

as provided. This is not a substantive provision as argued and is

clearly a proviso to Regulation 9 (IV);
</p>
<p id="p_84">7.9. Unlike Regulation 9(IV) which deals with both post­graduate

degree and diploma courses, Regulation 9(VIII) deals only with

“Post­graduate Diploma Courses” and provides for reservation in

the manner stipulated therein. Regulation 9(VIII) is therefore, a

special provision which will apply only to the subject within its

scope clearly indicating that the reservation is limited to diploma

courses only. Regulation 9 dealing both with ‘determination and

coordination of standards’ and ‘regulation’ of education has

correctly been described as a complete code. Not only can there

be no interference with the standard prescribed but there also

being regulation of the manner in which standards are to apply

by the MCI under a Central enactment, the State Government

cannot interfere with or modify the same;

7.10. In view of the specific provision for in­service candidates in

the MCI Regulations, 2000 framed by the Medical Council of

India, more particularly, Regulation 9(IV) r/w 9(VII)/(VIII) and as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                   56</span>


Regulation 9 is held to be a complete code and even considering

Entry 25 of List III, the State would not have any power to

legislate anything contrary to MCI Regulations, 2000, more

particularly Regulation 9 and cannot have any power to make

provision for reservation for in­service candidates in post­

graduate degree course. Any law framed and/or to be framed,

therefore, would be repugnant to MCI Regulations, 2000 framed

by the Medical Council of India, framed in exercise of powers

under <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_53">Section 20</a> r/w <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_54">Section 33</a> of the MCI Act, 1956.

8.0. Learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the   private

respondents in the case of State of West Bengal opposing the

reservation for in­service candidates has made the following

submissions:
</p>
<p id="p_85">8.1. There is no legislation in the State of West Bengal providing

for reservation for in­service candidates. The office memorandum

dated 18.4.2013, is only an executive instruction, which has

been relied upon by the State Government did not find any

mention in the original records of the Government when perused

by the Division Bench of the High Court while examining the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                 57</span>


reasons recorded by the State Government for grant of such

reservation;
</p>
<p id="p_86">8.2. Further, merit has become casualty by such reservation in

the State of West Bengal. The country definitely wants more

doctors but moreover it needs qualified specialists. Reservation at

higher level of professional courses such as medicine should be

minimal. Learned counsel has taken us to submission with

respect to allotment of PG seats and corresponding rank of open

category and in­service candidates from the written submissions.

It is submitted that therefore, merit has become casualty by such

reservation in the State; that the NEET­PG Notification for

admission to PG Medical Courses throughout the country was

published on 07.09.2018. NEET­PG 2019 result was published

on 31.1.2019. As per       the MCI     Regulations, State quota

counselling to commence from 25.3.2019. Before that open

category candidates made a representation to the State as well as

WBUHS (University) on 5.3.2019 citing Regulation 9(IV) of the

MCI Regulations, 2000 as well as judgment of this Court in the

case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) and the order of the

Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/171819938/" id="a_55">Tamil Nadu

Medical Officers Association v. Union of India</a> 15 requesting

Government not to reserve any seats for in­service candidates.

That the said representation has neither been annexed nor referred

to in the special leave petition by the State . That the counselling

notice by the university was dated 12.03.2019, in which, there was no

mention of any reservation for in­service candidates. There was

specific mention for SC/ST/OBC/PH reservation. Result of round

­1 counselling was published on 3.4.2019. Again, a legal notice

and the representation was made on 18.4.2019 to make

admissions in accordance with MCI Regulations and decision of

this Court in the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra).

Provisional List for 2nd round was published on 20.4.2019

without     considering   the   representation.   Immediately     on

23.4.2019 writ petition was filed. On 26.4.2019 learned Single

Judge granted stay on further counselling. On 1.5.2019 the

learned Single Judge modified the interim order that counselling

may take place but no admission. That thereafter, the interim

order passed by the learned Single Judge was modified by the

Division Bench and direction was issued to complete admission

in view of cut­off date of 30.05.2019 but directed that all

admissions shall be subject to final outcome of writ petition; all

admitted students to file an undertaking; no equities to be

claimed. SLP was preferred against the interim order passed by

the Division Bench dated 30.05.2019 before this Court. In that

MCI supported and submitted that there cannot be any

reservation of seats for in­service candidates. This Court disposed

of the SLP with a request to the learned Single Judge to hear the

case on day to day basis and decide it expeditiously. That by

judgment and order dated 19.08.2019 the learned Single Judge

allowed the writ petitions and quashed the reservation of seats in

PG­Degree Courses for in­service candidates. Consequently, the

admission of in­service candidates made against 40% reserved

seats   came to be cancelled and directed preparation of fresh

combined list. That thereafter, impugned judgment and order

came to be passed by the Division Bench. It is submitted that

therefore, the general category candidates made their grievance

against the reservation for in­service candidates from the very

beginning and well in advance and therefore, there is no delay on

their part and therefore, the direction issued by the Division

Bench be directed to be complied with. As directed by the learned

Single Judge and thereafter confirmed by the Division Bench, in­

service candidates now cannot be permitted to claim equity;

8.3. That in­service candidates are not meritorious and by such

reservation the meritorious general category candidates and non­

service candidates who have secured more marks in NEET and

competitive examination will have to suffer; (a) Medical Council of

India has been constituted as an expert body to control the

minimum standards of medical education and to regular their

observance; (b) Compliance with regulations framed by MCI are

mandatory inasmuch as enforcement of these regulations are

directly   relatable   to   quality   of   medical   professionals;   (c)

Regulations framed by the MCI are with prior approval of the

Central Government in terms of <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_56">Section 33</a> of the Indian Medical

Council Act, 1956 and are binding in nature; (d) Aforesaid

binding nature is apparent from a perusal of constitutional

scheme for enactment of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_57">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956.

Entry 66 of List I of the seventh schedule provides for ‘co­

ordination and determination of standards in institutions for

Constitution         provides   for   ‘Education   including   technical

education, medical education and universities, subject to the

provisions of entries 63,64,65 and 66 of List I’; It emerges from a

conjoint reading of Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III that

because the Parliament occupies the field earmarked for it under

Entry 66 of List I or its concurrent powers as per Entry 25 in the

concurrent list, the question of admission of students to any

medical course would mandatorily have to be in compliance of

the said law framed with reference to Entry 66 of List I which is

the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_58">MCI Act</a>, 1956;
</p>
<p id="p_87">8.4. As per catena of decisions, norms of admission including

reservation directly affect the standards of education and

laid down by the MCI. Hence reliance is placed on the following

</p>
<p id="p_90">8.5. That selection to Post­graduate Courses stands completely

covered by Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000. In support

of the above, followings submissions are made:

I.     MCI Regulations, 2000 were notified after prior approval

       from Central Government under <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_61">Section 33</a> of the MCI Act.

       The objective of the regulations is to produce competent

       specialists and/ or Medical teachers;
</p>
<p id="p_91">II.    Regulation 9 prescribes for manner and mode of selection of

       Post­graduate students which affirms the primacy of merit

       in selection of candidates to Post­graduate Courses by way

       of common entrance examination, i.e. NEET;

III.   Regulation 9 further makes a distinction in manner and

       mode of selection for candidates to ‘Post­graduate Diploma’

       courses and ‘Post­graduate Degree’ courses;

IV.    Manner of determination of academic merit is prescribed
       under Regulation 9(4);
</p>
<p id="p_92">V.     Proviso to Regulation 9(4) provides as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">              “Provided that that in determining the merit of candidates
              who are in service of Government/ Public Authority,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                                             63</span>


           weightage in the marks may be given by the Government /
           Competent Authority, as an incentive up to 10% of the marks
           obtained for each year of service in remote and / or difficult
           areas or rural areas up to maximum of 30% of the marks
           obtained in National Eligibility­cum­Entrance Test. The
           remote and / or difficult areas or rural areas shall be as
           notified by State Government /Competent Authority from
           time to time.”


VI.   It emerges from a perusal of the above regulation that (i) PG

Degree is distinct and different from a PG diploma which is clear

from perusal of Regulation 9(VIII) wherein 50% seats are reserved

for   aforesaid   Government       medical     officers   who    fulfil     the

requirements of service in notified areas (ii) In matters of

selection to PG Courses, inter­se merit is the determinative

factor, (iii) In determination of merit, the State Government may,

with a view to incentivize such service, give weightage in the

marks for service in ‘remote’ or ‘difficult’ areas and (iv), the

remote and difficult areas shall be notified by State Government

from time to time;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_93">VII. There is no provision for ‘reservation’ of seats for such

candidates who may have rendered service in remote or difficult

areas. At best, and strictly as a policy measure, the State

Government may provide weightage as incentive and nothing

more;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                                                  64</span><p id="p_94">


VIII. Therefore, Regulation 9 as per its letter and purport clearly

provides only for weightage, and not reservation. The same has

been so done, in order to incentivize the candidates to render

service in ‘remote’ and ‘difficult’ areas and at the same time,

ensure that requirement of ‘inter­se merit’ is not diluted by

introduction of a scheme of reservation;

8.6. That Regulation 9 is a ‘complete code’ governing selection to

PG Courses. In support of the above, following submissions are

made:
</p>
<p id="p_95">A.   There is no provision in the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_62">Indian Medical Council Act</a>,

     1956 and MCI Regulations, 2000 stipulating reservation for

     in­service candidates against the 30% seats in “Post­

     graduate Degree Course’;
</p>
<p id="p_96">B.   However, the provision is only to give weightage of marks to

     in­service candidates who had worked for specified period in

     notified remote, difficult or backward areas of the State;

C.   The State Governments in view of the fact that MCI

     Regulations have statutory primacy in matters of medical

     education, could not have framed any statutory Rules or

     notify a contrary provision by an executive fiat;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                                                 65</span>


D.   After having examined the entire Regulation 9 as a whole, in

     the case of Sudhir N (supra), it is held that Regulation 9 is a

     complete code in relation to selection to Post­graduate

     course.
</p>
<p id="p_97">8.7. That when Regulations prescribe for selection in a certain

manner, it must be done in that manner alone and not otherwise.

</p><p id="p_98">      The MCI Regulations governed the field of admission to PG

Courses and Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000 is a self­

contained code and Regulation 9 does not provide for anything

other than weightage, and that too, upon identification of remote

&amp; difficult areas by the State Government, the State could not

have provided for any reservation for in­service candidates

contrary to the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_63">Central Act</a> and the MCI Regulations, 2000;

8.8. Thus, the State is not competent to separately reserve a

specific number of seats for candidates who have served in

notified areas. Such candidates who had rendered services in

notified rural and difficult areas are entitled to weightage in

terms of proviso to Regulation 9(IV);
</p>
<p id="p_99">8.9. Regulations have been framed with a conscious decision to

not provide any reservation, as the same shall invariably have an

adverse effect on the inter­se merit and many candidates merely

by virtue of being in–service candidates may steal a march over

candidates higher in merit;
</p>
<p id="p_100">8.10.That the provisions regarding giving weightage to the in­

service   candidates    by   way   of   incentive   marks   has   been

introduced in larger public interest and the same is just, rational

and proper and there was no occasion to enlarge the scope and

provide for reservation, when the regulation itself does not

contemplate any such reservation;
</p>
<p id="p_101">8.11.The State is obliged to adopt a procedure as stipulated by

the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_64">Central Act</a> and Regulation framed thereunder;

8.12.That when there is categorical expression of weightage, it

would automatically exclude reservation in cases of admission to

PG Degree courses;
</p>
<p id="p_102">8.13.Regulation 9 even if read liberally does not provide for

reservation for in­service candidates, but only for giving a

weightage in the form of incentive marks as specified to the class

of in­service candidates (who have served in notified remote and

difficult areas in the State);
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                                                      67</span><p id="p_103">


8.14.Any reservation at the stage of Post­graduate Medical

education    will   necessarily   result    in   dilution   of   minimum

standards and merit and will therefore, be contrary to the

objective of the regulation itself;
</p>
<p id="p_104">8.15.Providing any reservation despite the same not being

provided for in the Regulations would be akin to redrafting the

Regulations itself. After due deliberations and keeping in mind

the past experience, Medical Council of India has framed

Regulations inter alia providing for giving incentive marks to in­

service candidates who have worked in notified remote and

difficult areas in the State to determine their merit. The

Regulation, as has been brought into force, after successive

amendments, and providing any reservation contrary to the

regulation would undo the regulation itself.


</p><p id="p_105">9.   In the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra), the very

Regulation 9(IV) and 9(VII) fell for consideration. In the case of

Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra), after considering the decision of

this Court in the case of Preeti Srivastava (supra), in para 24, it is

held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         “24. By now, it is well established that Regulation 9 is a

      for admissions to medical courses. It is also well established
      that the State has no authority to enact any law much less
      by executive instructions that may undermine the procedure
      for admission to postgraduate medical courses enunciated by
      the Central legislation and regulations framed thereunder,
      being a subject falling within Schedule VII List I Entry 66 of
      the Constitution (see <a href="/doc/1095409/" id="a_65">Preeti Srivastava v. State of M.P</a>. [1999)
      7 SCC 120]). The procedure for selection of candidates for
      the postgraduate degree courses is one such area on which
      the Central legislation and regulations must prevail.”

                                           (emphasis supplied)


9.1   Thereafter Regulation 9 has been considered in detail, the

relevant paras are paras 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 39, 47,

which read as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">         “26. From the plain language of this proviso, it is amply
      clear that it does not envisage reservation for in­service
      candidates in respect of postgraduate “degree” courses with
      which we are presently concerned. This proviso postulates
      giving weightage of marks to “specified in­service candidates”
      who have worked in notified remote and/or difficult areas in
      the State—both for postgraduate “degree” courses as also for
      postgraduate “diploma” courses. Further, the weightage of
      marks so allotted is required to be reckoned while preparing
      the merit list of candidates.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         27. Thus understood, the Central enactment and the
      regulations framed thereunder do not provide for reservation
      for in­service candidates in postgraduate “degree” courses.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      As there is no express provision prohibiting reservation to in­
      service candidates in respect of admission to postgraduate
      “degree” courses, it was contended that providing for such
      reservation by the State Government is not impermissible in
      law. Further, there are precedents of this Court to suggest
      that such arrangement is permissible as a separate channel
      of admission for in­service candidates. This argument does
      not commend to us. In the first place, the decisions pressed
      into service have considered the provisions regarding
      admission process governed by the regulations in force at the
      relevant time. The admission process in the present case is
      governed by the regulations which have come into force from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                                                  69</span>


the academic year 2013­2014. This Regulation is a self­
contained code. There is nothing in this Regulation to even
remotely indicate that a separate channel for admission to
in­service candidates must be provided, at least in respect of
postgraduate “degree” courses. In contradistinction, however,
50% seats are earmarked for the postgraduate “diploma”
courses for in­service candidates, as is discernible from
clause (VII). If the regulation intended a similar separate
channel for in­service candidates even in respect of
postgraduate “degree” courses, that position would have
been made clear in Regulation 9 itself. In absence thereof, it
must be presumed that a separate channel for in­service
candidates is not permissible for admission to postgraduate
“degree” courses. Thus, the State Government, in law, had
no authority to issue a Government Order such as dated 28­
2­2014, to provide to the contrary. Hence, the High Court
was fully justified in setting aside the said government order
being contrary to the mandate of Regulation 9 of the 2000
Regulations, as applicable from the academic year 2013­
2014.</blockquote><p id="p_106">

</p><p id="p_107">    29. In the present case, we have held that providing 30%
reservation to in­service candidates in postgraduate “degree”
courses is not permissible. It does not, however, follow that
giving weightage or incentive marks to in­service candidates
for postgraduate “degree” courses entails in excessive or
substantial departure from the rule of merit and equality.
For, Regulation 9 recognises the principle of giving weightage
to in­service candidates while determining their merit. In
that sense, incentive marks given to in­service candidates is
in recognition of their service reckoned in remote and
difficult areas of the State, which marks are to be added to
the marks obtained by them in NEET. Weightage or incentive
marks specified in Regulation 9 are thus linked to the marks
obtained by the in­service candidate in NEET and reckon the
commensurate experience and services rendered by them in
notified remote/difficult areas of the State. That is a
legitimate and rational basis to encourage the medical
graduates/doctors to offer their services and expertise in
remote or difficult areas of the State for some time.
Indisputably, there is a wide gap between the demand for
basic health care and commensurate medical facilities,
because of the inertia amongst the young doctors to go to
such areas. Thus, giving specified incentive marks (to eligible
in­service candidates) is permissible differentiation whilst
determining their merit. It is an objective method of
determining their merit.

</p><p id="p_109">   30. Coming to the next decision pressed into service in
<a href="/doc/114745381/" id="a_66">State of M.P. v. Gopal D. Tirthani</a> (2003) 7 SCC 83, it was a
case of conducting separate entrance test for in­service
candidates. That was frowned upon by this Court. The
Court, however, suggested modality of preparing two
separate merit list for the two categories and merit inter se of
the successful candidates to be assessed separately in the
two respective categories. The Court had examined the
question as to whether weightage can be given to doctors for
having rendered specified number of years of service in
rural/tribal areas to determine the inter se merit. The Court
analysed four earlier decisions of this Court; to wit, <a href="/doc/1603652/" id="a_67">Dinesh
Kumar v. Motilal Nehru Medical College</a> (1986) 3 SCC 727,
<a href="/doc/830488/" id="a_68">Snehelata Patnaik v. State of Orissa</a> (1992) 2 SCC 26,
<a href="/doc/927758/" id="a_69">Narayan Sharma v. Pankaj Kr. Lehkar</a> (2000) 1 SCC 44 and
<a href="/doc/1734464/" id="a_70">State of U.P. v. Pradip Tandon</a> (1975) 1 SCC 267. The Court
in para 33 observed thus: (Tirthani case (2003) 7 SCC 83,
SCC p. 106)
      “33. … The case at hand presents an entirely different
   scenario. Firstly, it is a case of postgraduation within the
   State and not an all­India quota. Secondly, it is not a case
   of reservation, but one of only assigning weightage for
   service rendered in rural/tribal areas. Thirdly, on the view
   of the law we have taken hereinabove, the assigning of
   weightage for service rendered in rural/tribal areas does
   not at all affect in any manner the candidates in open
   category. The weightage would have the effect of altering
   the order of merit only as amongst the candidates
   entering through the exclusive channel of admissions
   meant for in­service candidates within the overall service
   quota. The statistics set out in the earlier part of the
   judgment provide ample justification for such weightage
   being assigned. We find merit and much substance in the
   submission of the learned Advocate General for the State of
   Madhya Pradesh that Assistant Surgeons (i.e. medical
   graduates entering the State services) are not
   temperamentally inclined to go to and live in villages so as
   to make available their services to the rural population;
   they have a temptation for staying in cities on account of
   better conditions, better facilities and better quality of life
   available not only to them but also to their family members
   as also better educational facilities in elite schools which
   are to be found only in cities. In­service doctors being told
   in advance and knowing that by rendering service in
   rural/tribal areas they can capture better prospects of
   earning     higher      professional    qualifications,   and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                                                     71</span>


   consequently eligibility         for promotion, acts as a
   motivating factor and provides incentive to young in­service
   doctors to opt for service in rural/tribal areas. In the set­up
   of health services in the State of Madhya Pradesh and the
   geographical distribution of population, no fault can be
   found with the principle of assigning weightage to the
   service rendered in rural/tribal areas while finalising the
   merit list of successful in­service candidates for admission
   to PG courses of studies. Had it been a reservation,
   considerations would have differed. There is no specific
   challenge to the quantum of weightage and in the absence
   of any material being available on record we cannot find
   fault with the rule of weightage as framed. We hasten to
   add that while recasting and reframing the rules, the
   State Government shall take care to see that the
   weightage assigned is reasonable and is worked out on a
   rational basis.”

</p><p id="p_110">   31. However, in the present case, the Medical Council of
India itself has framed a regulation predicating one merit list
by adding the weightage of marks assigned to in­service
candidates for determining their merit in NEET.

</p><p id="p_111">   32. The imperative of giving some incentive marks to
doctors working in the State and more particularly serving in
notified remote or difficult areas over a period of time need
not be underscored. For, the concentration of doctors is in
urban areas and the rural areas are neglected. Large number
of posts in public healthcare units in the State are lying
vacant and unfilled in spite of sincere effort of the State
Government. This problem is faced by all States across India.
This Court in Snehelata case (1992) 2 SCC 26 had left it to
the authorities to evolve norms regarding giving incentive
marks to the in­service candidates. The Medical Council of
India is an expert body. Its assessment about the method of
determining merit of the competing candidates must be
accepted as final [<a href="/doc/1720792/" id="a_71">State of Kerala v. T.P. Roshana</a> (1979) 1
SCC 572 (SCC para 16); also see <a href="/doc/1822248/" id="a_72">Medical Council of India v.
State of Karnataka</a> (1998) 6 SCC 131]. After due
deliberations and keeping in mind the past experience,
Medical Council of India has framed regulations, inter alia,
providing for giving incentive marks to in­service candidates
who have worked in notified remote and difficult areas in the
State to determine their merit. The Regulation, as has been
brought into force, after successive amendments, is an
attempt to undo the mischief.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                                                     72</span><p id="p_112">




</p><p id="p_113">    33. As aforesaid, the real effect of Regulation 9 is to
assign specified marks commensurate with the length of
service rendered by the candidate in notified remote and
difficult areas in the State linked to the marks obtained in
NEET. That is a procedure prescribed in the Regulation for
determining merit of the candidates for admission to the
postgraduate “degree” courses for a single State. This serves
a dual purpose. Firstly, the fresh qualified doctors will be
attracted to opt for rural service, as later they would stand a
good chance to get admission to postgraduate “degree”
courses of their choice. Secondly, the rural healthcare units
run by the public authority would be benefited by doctors
willing to work in notified rural or difficult areas in the State.
In our view, a Regulation such as this subserves larger
public interest. Our view is reinforced from the dictum in
Snehelata Patnaik case (1992) 2 SCC 26. The three­Judge
Bench by a speaking order opined that giving incentive
marks to in­service candidates is inexorable. It is apposite to
refer to the dictum in the said decision which reads thus:
(SCC pp. 26­27, paras 1­2)

       “1. We have already dismissed the writ petition and
   special leave petitions by our order dated 5­12­1991. We
   would, however, like to make a suggestion to the
   authorities for their consideration that some preference
   might be given to in­service candidates who have done
   five years of rural service. In the first place, it is possible
   that the facilities for keeping up with the latest medical
   literature might not be available to such in­service
   candidates and the nature of their work makes it difficult
   for them to acquire knowledge about very recent medical
   research which the candidates who have come after
   freshly passing their graduation examination might have.
   Moreover, it might act as an incentive to doctors who had
   done their graduation to do rural service for some time.
   Keeping in mind the fact that the rural areas had suffered
   grievously for non­availability of qualified doctors giving
   such incentive would be quite in order. The learned
   counsel for the respondents has, however, drawn our
   attention to the decision of a Division Bench of two
   learned Judges of this Court in <a href="/doc/1603652/" id="a_73">Dinesh Kumar v. Motilal
   Nehru Medical College</a> (1986) 3 SCC 727. It has been
   observed there that merely by offering a weightage of 15%
   to a doctor for three years’ rural service would not bring
   about a migration of doctors from the urban to rural
   areas. They observed that if you want to produce doctors
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                                                   73</span>


   who are MD or MS, particularly surgeons, who are going
   to operate upon human beings, it is of utmost importance
   that the selection should be based on merit. The learned
   Judges have gone on to observe that no weightage should
   be given to a candidate for rural service rendered by him
   so far as admissions to postgraduate courses are
   concerned (see Dinesh Kumar case (1986) 3 SCC 727,
   SCC para 12 at p. 741).
</p>
<p id="p_114">      2. In our opinion, this observation certainly does not
   constitute the ratio of the decision. The decision is in no
   way dependent upon these observations. Moreover, those
   observations are in connection with all­India selection
   and do not have equal force when applied to selection from
   a single State. These observations, however, suggest that
   the weightage to be given must be the bare minimum
   required to meet the situation. In these circumstances, we
   are of the view that the authorities might well consider
   giving weightage up to a maximum of 5% of marks in
   favour of in­service candidates who have done rural
   service for five years or more. The actual percentage would
   certainly have to be left to the authorities. We also clarify
   that these suggestions do not in any way confer any legal
   right on in­service students who have done rural service
   nor do the suggestions have any application to the
   selection of the students up to the end of this year.”

</p><p id="p_115">    35. As aforesaid, the Regulations have been framed by an
expert body based on past experience and including the
necessity to reckon the services and experience gained by the
in­service candidates in notified remote and difficult areas in
the State. The proviso prescribes the measure for giving
incentive marks to in­service candidates who have worked in
notified remote and difficult areas in the State. That can be
termed as a qualitative factor for determining their merit.
Even the quantitative factor to reckon merit of the eligible in­
service candidates is spelt out in the proviso. It envisages
giving of incentive marks @ 10% of the marks obtained for
each year of service in remote and/or difficult areas up to
30% of the marks obtained in NEET. It is an objective
method of linking the incentive marks to the marks obtained
in NEET by the candidate. To illustrate, if an in­service
candidate who has worked in a notified remote and/or
difficult area in the State for at least one year and has
obtained 150 marks out of 200 marks in NEET, he or she
would get 15 additional marks; and if the candidate has
worked for two years, the candidate would get another 15
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                                                   74</span>


marks. Similarly, if the candidate has worked for three years
and more, the candidate would get a further 15 marks in
addition to the marks secured in NEET. 15 marks out of 200
marks in that sense would work out to a weightage of 7.5%
only, for having served in notified remote and/or difficult
areas in the State for one year. Had it been a case of giving
10% marks en bloc of the total marks irrespective of the
marks obtained by the eligible in­service candidates in
NEET, it would have been a different matter. Accordingly,
some weightage marks given to eligible in­service candidate
linked to performance in NEET and also the length of service
in remote and/or difficult areas in the State by no standard
can be said to be excessive, unreasonable or irrational. This
provision has been brought into force in larger public
interest and not merely to provide institutional preference or
for that matter to create separate channel for the in­service
candidate, much less reservation. It is unfathomable as to
how such a provision can be said to be unreasonable or
irrational.
</p>
<p id="p_116">    39. Reverting to the recent decision of this Court in
Sudhir N. (2015) 6 SCC 685, the two­Judge Bench was
dealing with the question of selection of in­service medical
officers for postgraduate medical education under Section
5(4) of the Kerala Medical Officers Admission to Postgraduate
Courses under the Service Quota Act, 2008. The said
provision has been extracted in para 5 of the reported
decision. It deals with the finalisation of select list by the
Postgraduate Course Select Committee strictly on the basis
of seniority in service of the medical officers and following
such other criteria as may be prescribed. Dealing with that
challenge the Court noticed that Regulation 9 is a complete
code by itself and then proceeded to answer the question
whether the State was competent to enact law on the matter
of admission on the basis of inter se seniority of candidates.
In that context, the Court noted that the basis of selection
must be strictly as per norms specified in the MCI
Regulations. Any law with regard to that will be beyond
legislative competence of the State Legislature. The Court
noted that weightage for in­service candidates is made
permissible by Regulation 9. That is the limited departure
from the merit list criteria permitted by the Regulation itself.
Neither in Sudhir N. (2015) 6 SCC 685 nor Tirtha (2003) 7
SCC 83 the Court had the occasion to deal with the question
regarding challenge to the proviso to clause (IV) of Regulation
</p><p id="p_117">9.

</p><p id="p_118">         47. We must hold that the High Court was justified in
     quashing the stated government order providing for
     reservation to in­service candidates, being violative of
     Regulation 9 as in force. However, we modify the operative
     direction given by the High Court and instead direct that
     admission process for academic year 2016­2017 onwards to
     the postgraduate degree course in the State should proceed
     as per Regulation 9 including by giving incentive marks to
     eligible in­service candidates in terms of proviso to clause
     (IV) of Regulation 9 [equivalent to third proviso to Regulation
     9(2) of the old Regulations reproduced in the interim order
     dated 12­5­2016]. We, accordingly, mould the operative
     order of the High Court to bring it in conformity with the
     direction contained in the interim order dated 12­5­2016 but
     to be made applicable to academic year 2016­2017 onwards
     on the basis of Regulation 9 as in force. We are conscious of
     the fact that this arrangement is likely to affect some of the
     direct candidates, if not a large number of candidates whose
     applications were already processed by the competent
     authority for postgraduate degree course concerned for
     academic year 2016­2017. However, their admissions cannot
     be validated in breach of or disregarding the mandate of
     Regulation 9, as in force. The appeals against the judgment
     of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 7­4­2016
     are disposed of accordingly.”

9.2. The present batch of cases came up for hearing before

another Bench of three Judges. The Bench was of the opinion

<p id="p_120">10.    While considering the aforesaid issues, let us first consider

the scope and ambit of Entry 66 of List I – legislative competence

of the Union in exercise of powers under Entry 66, List I of

Schedule VII of the Constitution of India.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                                                           78</span>


10.1 In the case of Modern Dental College &amp; Research Centre

(supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court again had an occasion

to deal with and consider Entry 66 List I and Entry 25 List III.

After considering catena of decisions of this Court, more

particularly, the decisions of this Court in the cases of Gujarat

University (supra); R. Chitralekha (supra); Preeti Srivastava

(supra); and <a href="/doc/551845/" id="a_76">Bharati Vidyapeeth v. State of Maharashtra</a> 17, it is

held by this Court that Entry 66 in List I is a specific entry having

a very specific and limited scope. It is further observed by this

Court that it deals with “coordination and determination of

standards” in institution of higher education or research as well

as scientific and technical institutions. The words “coordination

and determination of standards” would mean laying down the

said standards. It is observed that thus, when it comes to

prescribing the standards for such institutions of higher learning,

exclusive domain is given to the Union. The relevant observations

are in paragraphs 101 to 105, which read as under:

prescribing the standards for such institutions of higher
learning, exclusive domain is given to the Union. However, that
would not include conducting of examination, etc. and
admission of students to such institutions or prescribing the fee
in these institutions of higher education, etc. In fact, such
coordination and determination of standards, insofar as medical
education is concerned, is achieved by parliamentary legislation
in the form of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_77">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 and by
creating the statutory body like Medical Council of India (for
short “MCI”) therein. The functions that are assigned to MCI
include within its sweep determination of standards in a
medical institution as well as coordination of standards and
that of educational institutions. When it comes to regulating
“education” as such, which includes even medical education as
well as universities (which are imparting higher education), that
is prescribed in List III Entry 25, thereby giving concurrent
powers to both Union as well as States. It is significant to note
that earlier education, including universities, was the subject­
matter of List II Entry 11 [“11. “Education” including
universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and
66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III”]. Thus, power to this extent
was given to the State Legislatures. However, this entry was
omitted by the Constitution (Forty­second Amendment) Act,
1976 with effect from 3­7­1977 and at the same time List II
Entry 25 was amended [Unamended Entry 25 in List III read as:
</blockquote><p id="p_121">“Vocational and technical training of labour”]. Education,
including university education, was thus transferred to the
Concurrent List and in the process technical and medical
education was also added. Thus, if the argument of the
appellants is accepted, it may render Entry 25 completely
otiose. When two entries relating to education, one in the Union
List and the other in the Concurrent List, coexist, they have to
be read harmoniously. Reading in this manner, it would become
manifest that when it comes to coordination and laying down of
standards in the higher education or research and scientific and
technical institutions, power rests with the Union/Parliament to
the exclusion of the State Legislatures. However, other facets of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                                                      80</span>


education, including technical and medical education, as well as
governance of universities is concerned, even State Legislatures
are given power by virtue of Entry 25. The field covered by List
III Entry 25 is wide enough and as circumscribed to the limited
extent of it being subject to List I Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66.


</p><p id="p_122">      102. Most educational activities, including admissions,
have two aspects: the first deals with the adoption and setting
up the minimum standards of education. The objective in
prescribing minimum standards is to provide a benchmark of
the calibre and quality of education being imparted by various
educational institutions in the entire country. Additionally, the
coordination of the standards of education determined
nationwide is ancillary to the very determination of standards.
Realising the vast diversity of the nation wherein levels of
education fluctuated from lack of even basic primary education,
to institutions of high excellence, it was thought desirable to
determine and prescribe basic minimum standards of education
at various levels, particularly at the level of research
institutions, higher education and technical education
institutions. As such, while balancing the needs of States to
impart education as per the needs and requirements of local
and regional levels, it was essential to lay down a uniform
minimum standard for the nation. Consequently, the
Constitution­makers provided for List I Entry 66 with the
objective of maintaining uniform standards of education in
fields of research, higher education and technical education.


</p><p id="p_123">      103. The second/other aspect of education is with regard
to the implementation of the standards of education determined
by Parliament, and the regulation of the complete activity of
education. This activity necessarily entails the application of the
standards determined by Parliament in all educational
institutions in accordance with the local and regional needs.
Thus, while List I Entry 66 dealt with determination and
coordination of standards, on the other hand, the original List II
Entry 11 granted the States the exclusive power to legislate with
respect to all other aspects of education, except the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                                                      81</span>


determination of minimum standards and coordination which
was in national interest. Subsequently, vide the Constitution
(Forty­second <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_78">Amendment) Act</a>, 1976, the exclusive legislative
field of the State Legislature with regard to education was
removed and deleted, and the same was replaced by amending
List III Entry 25 granting concurrent powers to both Parliament
and State Legislature the power to legislate with respect to all
other aspects of education, except that which was specifically
covered by List I Entries 63 to 66.

<p id="p_124">

Vidyapeeth v. State of Maharashtra</a>, (2004) 11 SCC 755 : 2
SCEC 535] it has been observed that the entire gamut of
admission falls under List I Entry 66. The said judgment by a
Bench of two Judges is, however, contrary to law laid down in
earlier larger Bench decisions. <a href="/doc/1963279/" id="a_80">In Gujarat University [Gujarat
University v. Krishna Ranganath Mudholkar</a>, AIR 1963 SC 703 :
1963 Supp (1) SCR 112] , a Bench of five Judges examined the
scope of List II Entry 11 (which is now List III Entry 25) with
reference to List I Entry 66. It was held that the power of the
State to legislate in respect of education to the extent it is
entrusted to Parliament, is deemed to be restricted.
Coordination and determination of standards was in the
purview of List I and power of the State was subject to power of
the Union on the said subject. It was held that the two entries
overlapped to some extent and to the extent of overlapping the
power conferred by List I Entry 66 must prevail over power of
the State. Validity of a State legislation depends upon whether it
prejudicially affects “coordination or determination of standards”,
even in absence of a Union legislation. In R. Chitralekha v. State
of Mysore [R. Chitralekha v. State of Mysore, AIR 1964 SC 1823 :
(1964) 6 SCR 368] , the same issue was again considered. It was
observed that if the impact of the State law is heavy or
devastating as to wipe out or abridge the Central field, it may be
struck down. <a href="/doc/1109491/" id="a_81">In State of T.N. v. Adhiyaman Educational &amp;

     In the concurring judgment, Bhanumati, J. in paragraphs

131 to 134 and 147 to 149, has held as under:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                                                    83</span>


“131. In order to answer the concern of other Constitution
Framers, Dr Ambedkar went on to clarify the limited scope of
List I Entry 66 (as in the present form), as proposed by him in
the following words: (CAD Vol. 9, p. 796)
           “Entry 57­A merely deals with the maintenance of
    certain standards in certain classes of institutions, namely,
    institutions imparting higher education, scientific and
    technical institutions, institutions for research, etc. You
    may ask, “why this entry?” I shall show why it is necessary.
    Take for instance, the BA Degree examination which is
    conducted by the different universities in India. Now, most
    provinces and the Centre, when advertising for candidates,
    merely say that the candidate should be a graduate of a
    university. Now, suppose the Madras University says that a
    candidate at the BA Examination, if he obtained 15% of the
    total marks shall be deemed to have passed that
    examination; and suppose the Bihar University says that a
    candidate who has obtained 20% of marks shall be deemed
    to have passed the BA degree examination; and some other
    university fixes some other standard, then it would be quite
    a chaotic condition, and the expression that is usually
    used, that the candidate should be a graduate, I think,
    would be meaningless. Similarly, there are certain research
    institutes, on the results of which so many activities of the
    Central and Provincial Governments depend. Obviously,
    you cannot permit the results of these technical and
    scientific institutes to deteriorate from the normal standard
    and yet allow them to be recognised either for the Central
    purposes, for all­India purposes or the purposes of the
    State.”


</p><p id="p_128">132. The intent of our Constitution Framers while introducing
Entry 66 of the Union List was thus limited only to empowering
the Union to lay down a uniform standard of higher education
throughout the country and not to bereft the State Legislature
of its entire power to legislate in relation to “education” and
organising its own common entrance examination.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                                                       84</span>


</p><p id="p_129">133. If we consider the ambit of the present Entry 66 of the
Union List; no doubt the field of legislation is of very wide
import and determination of standards in institutions for higher
education. In the federal structure of India, as there are many
States, it is for the Union to coordinate between the States to
cause them to work in the field of higher education in their
respective States as per the standards determined by the Union.
Entry 25 in the Concurrent List is available both to the Centre
and the States. However, power of the State is subject to the
provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65, and 66 of the Union List; while
the State is competent to legislate on the education including
technical education, medical education and universities, it
should be as per the standards set by the Union.


</p><p id="p_130">134. The   words   “coordination”    and   “determination   of   the
standards in higher education” are the preserve of Parliament
and are exclusively covered by Entry 66 of the Union List. The
word “coordination” means harmonisation with a view to forge a
uniform pattern for concerted action. The term “fixing of
standards of institutions for higher education” is for the
purpose of harmonising coordination of the various institutions
for higher education across the country. Looking at the present
distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the
States with regard to the field of “education”, that State's power
to legislate in relation to “education, including technical
education, medical education and universities” is analogous to
that of the Union. However, such power is subject to Entries 63,
64, 65 and 66 of the Union List, as laid down in Entry 25 of the
Concurrent List. It is the responsibility of the Central
Government to determine the standards of higher education and
the same should not be lowered at the hands of any particular
State.

</p><p id="p_133">147. Another argument that has been put forth is that the
power to enact laws laying down process of admission in
universities, etc. vests in both Central and State Governments
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                                                      85</span>


under Entry 25 of the Concurrent List only. Under Entry 25 of
the Concurrent List and erstwhile Entry 11 of the State List, the
State Government has enacted various legislations that inter
alia regulate admission process in various institutions. For
instance, Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwavidyalaya Adhiniyam,
Rajiv Gandhi Prodyogiki Vishwavidyalaya Adhiniyam, Rashtriya
Vidhi Sansathan Vishwavidyalaya Adhiniyam, etc. were
established by the State Government in exercise of power under
Entry 25 of the Concurrent List. Similarly, the Central
Government has also enacted various legislations relating to
higher education under Entry 25 of the Concurrent List
pertaining to Centrally funded universities such as the
<a href="/doc/1691997/" id="a_90">Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University Act</a>, 1994, the
<a href="/doc/678206/" id="a_91">Maulana Azad National Urdu University Act</a>, 1996, the Indira
Gandhi National Tribal University Act, 2007, etc. The Central
Government may have the power to regulate the admission
process for Centrally funded institutions like IITs, NIT, JIPMER,
etc. but not in respect of other institutions running in the State.


</p><p id="p_134">148. In view of the above discussion, it can be clearly laid down
that power of the Union under Entry 66 of the Union List is
limited to prescribing standards of higher education to bring
about uniformity in the level of education imparted throughout
the country. Thus, the scope of Entry 66 must be construed
limited to its actual sense of “determining the standards of
higher education” and not of laying down admission process. In
no case is the State denuded of its power to legislate under List
III Entry 25. More so, pertaining to the admission process in
universities imparting higher education.


</p><p id="p_135">149. I have no hesitation in upholding the vires of the
impugned legislation which empowers the State Government to
regulate admission process in institutions imparting higher
education within the State. In fact, the State being responsible
for welfare and development of the people of the State, ought to
take necessary steps for welfare of its student community. The
field of “higher education” being one such field which directly
affects the growth and development of the State, it becomes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                                                             86</span>


       prerogative of the State to take such steps which further the
       welfare of the people and in particular pursuing higher
       education. In fact, the State Government should be the sole
       entity to lay down the procedure for admission and fee, etc.
       governing the institutions running in that particular State
       except the Centrally funded institutions like IIT, NIT, etc.
       because no one can be a better judge of the requirements and
       inequalities­in­opportunity of the people of a particular State
       than that State itself. Only the State legislation can create equal
       level playing field for the students who are coming out from the
       State Board and other streams.”

                                                   (emphasis supplied)


       Thus, as held by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the

case of Modern Dental College (supra), in which this Court

considered catena of earlier decisions of this Court dealing with

the scope and ambit of Entry 66 List I, Entry 66 of List I is a

specific entry having a very specific and limited scope; it deals

with    “Coordination       and     Determination       of   Standards”      in

institutions of higher education or research as well as scientific

and technical institutions. It is further observed that the words

“Coordination and Determination of Standards” would mean

laying down the said standards and therefore when it comes to

prescribe the standards for such institutions of higher learning,

exclusive domain is given to the Union. It is specifically further

observed that that would not include conducting of examination
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                                               87</span>


etc. and admission of students to such institutions or prescribing

the fee in these institutions of higher education, etc.   Thus, in

exercise of powers under Entry 66 List I, the Union cannot

provide for anything with respect to reservation/percentage of

reservation and/or even mode of admission within the State

quota, which powers are conferred upon the States under Entry

25 of List III. In exercise of powers under Entry 25 List III, the

States have power to make provision for mode of admissions,

looking to the requirements and/or need in the concerned State.

10.2 We note that as per catena of decisions of this Court,

“institutional preference” in the postgraduate medical courses is

held to be permissible by the concerned States, (see D.N.

10.3 In a recent decision of this Court in the case of Yatinkumar

Jasubhai Patel (supra), the issue of “institutional preference”

within the State quota was considered in which the Gujarat

University framed the rules for the purpose of governing

admission to postgraduate courses.      One of the rules provided

that 50% of the seats shall be filled in as per the All India 50%

quota and the remaining seats will be available for the candidates

passing from the Gujarat University. That was provided to the

candidates graduating from the Gujarat University. The aforesaid

rule of “institutional preference” was challenged before the High

Court. The vires of the afore­stated rules providing “institutional

preference” giving preference to the candidates graduated from

the Gujarat University was challenged on the ground that in view

of introduction of the NEET and the admissions are given solely

on the basis of the merit and the marks obtained in NEET, the

rules providing “institutional preference” shall be violative of the

<a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_96">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 and the MCI Regulations, 2000

framed under the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_97">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956. The High

Court dismissed the writ petition upholding the “institutional

preference”. The same was the subject matter before this Court.

It was submitted on behalf of the writ petitioners that even the

MCI Regulations for postgraduate admissions, MCI Regulations,

2000, do not permit the “institutional preference” and that the

MCI Regulations, 2000 held by this Court to be a complete code

and therefore no reservation is to be provided unless the same is

permitted under the MCI Regulations, 2000. The decision of this

Court in the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) was also

placed into service.     However, considering the plethora of

decisions of this Court, referred to hereinabove, this Court has

again held that “institutional preference” is permissible and even

the introduction of NEET would not affect the “institutional

preference”. This Court has noted that “institutional preference”

up to 50% seats is permissible.

<p id="p_137">11.   Now let us consider the scope and ambit of the MCI

Regulations, 2000, and whether MCI Regulations, 2000 take

with “Coordination and Determination of Standards” of higher

education for research as well as scientific and technical

     On a fair reading of entire <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_107">Section 33</a> of the MCI Act, it does

not confer any authority and/or power to the MCI to frame the

regulations with respect to reservation in the medical courses,

more particularly, to provide for a separate source of entry for in­

service candidates seeking admission to postgraduate degree

courses, as sought to be contended on behalf of the MCI and

counsel opposing for providing for a separate source of entry for

in­service candidates.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                                                   96</span><p id="p_153">


</p><p id="p_154">12.   In light of the above observations, we shall consider the

relevant provisions of MCI Regulations, 2000, more particularly,

Regulation 9. The title of Regulation 9 is “Procedure for selection

of candidate for postgraduate courses”. Regulation 9(I) provides

that there shall be a single eligibility­cum­entrance examination,

namely, NEET. Regulation 9(II) further provides that 3% seats of

the annual sanctioned intake capacity shall be filled up by

candidates with locomotory disability. Regulation 9(III) provides

for the eligibility criteria. It provides that in order to be eligible

for admission to any postgraduate course in a particular

academic year, it shall be necessary for a candidate to obtain

minimum of marks at 50th percentile in NEET for postgraduate

courses.    However, in respect of candidates belonging to

SC/ST/OBC, the minimum marks shall be at 40 th percentile.

Thus, it can be seen that Regulation 9(III) can be said to be

providing the standards which shall be within the domain and

legislative competence of the Union and the MCI, in exercise of

powers under Entry 66, List I. The first part of Regulation 9(IV)

speaks     for   the     reservation    of    seats    in    medical

colleges/institutions. It provides that the reservation of seats in

medical colleges/institutions for respective categories shall be as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                                                      97</span>


per applicable laws prevailing in States/Union Territories. It

further provides for preparing all­India merit list as well as State­

wise merit list of the eligible candidates on the basis of the marks

obtained     in   NEET   and     candidates   shall   be   admitted    to

postgraduate courses from the said merit lists only.              To that

stage, it can be said that the same is within the legislative

competence of the Union/MCI, in exercise of powers under Entry

66 List I.
</p>
<p id="p_155">      However, proviso to Regulation 9(IV) further provides that in

determining the merit of candidates who are in service of

Government/public authority, weightage in the marks may be

given by the Government/competent authority as an incentive at

the rate of 10% of the marks obtained for each year of service in

remote and/or difficult areas up to the maximum of 30% of the

marks obtained in NEET. It further provides that the remote and

difficult    areas   shall     be   as    defined     by    the     State

Government/competent authority from time to time. Thus, it can

be seen that even the proviso can be said to be with respect to

preparing the merit list only.

12.1 As held by this Court in earlier decisions, Regulation 9(IV) is

limited only to reservation in favour of SC/ST/OBC and as per

the prevailing laws in the States. If that be so, then the proviso

which as such is not dealing with the reservation cannot be said

to be in the form of an exception to first part of Regulation 9(IV)

and it can be seen that it is an independent provision dealing

with the in­service candidates and that too for the purpose of

preparing the merit list.      Thus, the proviso becomes the

substantive provision and is more concerned with the marks to be

allocated which is the concern of Regulation 9(III).      It is also

required to be noted that even this proviso confers a discretion on

the State to provide for weightage in marks for the services

rendered in remote or difficult areas. The proviso only enables

the States by conferring the discretion for weightage. The proviso

has nothing to do with the reservation in the postgraduate degree

courses and therefore it shall not negate the State’s power to

make reservation and/or make special provision to provide for a

separate source of entry for in­service candidates seeking

admission to postgraduate degree courses.        Thus, Regulation

9(IV) as such cannot be said to be taking away the power of the

States under Entry 25, List III, to provide for a separate source of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                                                  99</span>


entry for in­service candidates seeking admission to postgraduate

degree courses. Any contrary view would affect the right of the

States to make reservation and/or to make special provision for

admission in exercise of powers under Entry 25 List III. If it is

construed that Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000, more

particularly Regulation 9(IV) provides for reservation and/or deals

with the reservation for in­service candidates, in that case, it will

be beyond the legislative competence of the Union as well as it

will be ultra vires to the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_108">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956. As

observed hereinabove, <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_109">Section 33</a> of the Indian Medical Council

Act, 1956 does not confer any power on the MCI to make

regulations with respect to reservation. At the cost of repetition,

it is observed that “institutional preference”, despite MCI

Regulations, 2000, has been upheld and held to be permissible by

the concerned States.

     In that case, the Government of Tamil Nadu issued G.O

dated 9.2.1999 laying down the procedure for selection of

candidates for admission to postgraduate diploma, degree, MDS

and higher speciality courses. The Government Order envisaged

reservation confining up to 50% in favour of the in­service

candidates on merit basis and further stipulated that 50% of the

seats available in each of the speciality shall be allotted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                                                              103</span>


exclusively to the service candidates. The Government Order also

enumerated various categories of Medical Officers, who alone will

be treated as in­service candidates and considered for selection

against the 50% of the seats allocated exclusively for service

candidates.   The aforesaid Government Order was challenged

before the High Court. The learned Single Judge, while allowing

the writ petitions held that reservation of 50% of seats for non­

service candidates have to be given effect to or worked out by

selecting candidates from in­service and non­service, on the basis

of merit in the first instance and thereafter the 50% seats

reserved for in­service candidates shall be filled up by the in­

service candidates who could not gain selection on the basis of

merit as against the other 50% earmarked as “open”. The learned

Single Judge was further of the view that there is no category as

“non­service candidates”, and it is only the in­service candidates

who form a separate class.      Aggrieved, some of the selected

candidates filed writ appeals, which came to be dismissed

summarily. The appeals filed by the State came up subsequently

before another Division Bench and finding themselves unable to

agree with the order of dismissal of the earlier appeals, the

matters were referred for consideration by a larger Bench.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                                                          104</span>


Thereupon the matters were placed before the Full Bench, which,

in turn, reversed the judgment of the learned Single Judge and

dismissed the writ petitions. The judgment of the Full Bench was

the subject matter before this Court.             While considering the

aforesaid provisions, this Court answered the question, namely,

“could the State Government have legitimately made a provision

allocating 50% of seats exclusively in favour of in­service

candidates and keep open the avenue for competition for them in

respect of the remaining 50% along with others”, in affirmative.

In paragraphs 8 to 12, it is held as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">     “8. That the Government possesses the right and authority to
     decide from what sources the admissions in educational
     institutions or to particular disciplines and courses therein have
     to be made and that too in what proportion, is well established
     and by now a proposition well settled, too. It has been the
     consistent and authoritatively­settled view of this Court that at
     the super­speciality level, in particular, and even at the
     postgraduate level reservations of the kind known as “protective
     discrimination” in favour of those considered to be backward
     should be avoided as being not permissible. Reservation, even if
     it be claimed to be so in this case, for and in favour of the in­
     service candidates, cannot be equated or treated on par with
     communal reservations envisaged under Articles 15(4) or 16(4)
     and extended the special mechanics of their implementation to
     ensure such reservations to be the minimum by not counting
     those selected in open competition on the basis of their own
     merit as against the quota reserved on communal
     considerations.</blockquote><p id="p_179">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                                                                      105</span>


</p><p id="p_180">      9. Properly speaking, in these cases, we are concerned
with the allocation of seats for admission in the form of a quota
amongst in­service candidates on the one hand, and non­service
or private candidates on the other and the method or manner of
working out in practice the allocation of seats among the
members of the respective category. Could the State
Government have legitimately made a provision allocating 50%
of seats exclusively in favour of the in­service candidates and
keep open the avenue for competition for them in respect of the
remaining 50% along with others, denying a fair contest in
relation to a substantial or sizeable number of other candidates,
who are not in service and who fall under the category of non­
service candidates, will itself be open to serious doubt. One
such attempt seems to have been put in issue before the
Madras High Court which held that reservation in favour of the
in­service candidates for the academic year 1992­93 should be
confined to 50% and awarding of two additional marks, instead
of one additional mark for each completed year of service in
primary health centres was unconstitutional and when the
matter was brought to this Court, in the decision reported
in State of T.N. v. T. Dhilipkumar [(1995) 5 Scale 208 (2)] the
decision of the High Court has been upheld. This Court also
further observed that the Government should appoint a highly­
qualified committee to determine from year to year what, in fact,
should be the percentage­wise reservation required for the in­
service candidates, having regard to the then prevailing
situation and that the percentage of fifty per cent shall, if found
appropriate, be reduced.

<p id="p_181">
</p><p id="p_182">      10. The    stipulations   governing    the    selection   for
admissions in these cases have got to be viewed and construed
in the above backdrop of events and legal position. The learned
Single Judge, in our view, was certainly not right in equating
the provisions made for allocation of seats in the form of fixation
of quota in this case with the usual form of communal
reservations and allowing himself to be carried away by the
peculiar method of working out such reservations in order to
ensure adequate representation to such candidates, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                                                                     106</span>


applying those principles to construe a provision of the nature
involved in these cases. Yet another error in the reasoning of the
learned Single Judge lies in his assumption that “open quota”
seats have to be thrown open to all and are meant only to be
filled up purely on the basis of merit performance and no one
from even the class of candidates in whose favour a special
quota has already been provided can be excluded from
consideration as against the “open quota”. This reasoning of the
learned Single Judge not only ignores the object and scheme
underlying the allocation of seats for admissions for the
academic year 1999­2000, but has the consequence of rewriting
the prospectus and introducing altogether a different pattern of
admissions, overriding the policy of the Government aimed at
meeting out equal justice and affording equality of opportunity
to the different categories classified for the purpose. If the
Government can be said to possess the power to fix a quota for
the exclusive benefit of “in­service” candidates, it is beyond
comprehension or dictates of either reason or logic as to why the
Government cannot equally exclusively earmark the remaining
seats in favour of “non­service” or private candidates, thereby
confining the claims of service candidates to the number of
seats earmarked and allocated to them. As there can be a
classified category of “service candidates”, it is open to the
Government to make classification of all those other than those
falling in the category of service candidates as non­service
candidates and allocate the remaining seats after allotment to
the service candidates for exclusive benefit of the source of non­
service or private candidates. There is nothing in law which
deprives the Government of any such powers and no such
impediment has either been brought to our notice at the time of
hearing or seems to have been brought to the notice of the
learned Single Judge to warrant any such construction, as has
been adopted by him. We are also of the view that it does not lie
in the mouth of the writ petitioners to raise a bogey of selection
based on merit alone, only in respect of a portion of the seats
available for admission to non­service candidates, when they
belong to and are part of a category or class who have got in
their favour fifty per cent of the number of seats in each of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                                                                      107</span>


disciplines allocated to their category of “in­service” candidates
to be filled up exclusively from such “in­service” candidates on
the basis of their own inter se merit and not on the overall merit
performance of all the candidates — both in­service and non­
service put together. The writ petitioners are found to have
applied as in­service candidates and merely because they could
not be selected within the number of seats earmarked for their
category or class on the basis of the inter se merits among their
own class, they cannot be allowed to contend to the contrary in
retrospect and on hindsight experience of having obtained more
marks, than those who got selected as against the seats
earmarked and allocated to the non­service candidates. The
justification, both in law and on facts for exclusive allocation
and stipulation of a definite quota or number of seats for non­
service or private candidates, in our view, lies in the very
principle which warranted or enabled the fixation of a quota of
fifty per cent of seats and exclusively allotted to the in­service
candidates. Any countenance of such claims of the appellants is
likely to also endanger the very allocation of 50% of the seats
exclusively to the category of in­service candidates, too.


</p><p id="p_183">      11. On a consideration of the reasoning of the Full Bench
as also the construction placed upon the Government Order and
the prospectus, we are of the view that the State Government, in
the undoubted exercise of its power, has rightly decided, as a
matter of policy, so far as the admissions to super­speciality­
and­postgraduate diploma/degree/MDS courses for the
academic session 1999­2000 are concerned to have scheme or
pattern of two sources of candidates based upon a broad
classification into two categories, i.e., in­service candidates and
non­service or private candidates with each one of them
allocated exclusively for their own respective category of
candidates fifty per cent of the seats, the ultimate selection for
admission depending upon the inter se merit performance
amongst their own category of candidates. As pointed out by the
Full Bench, the change in the nomenclature of the
categorisation from “open competition” in 1998­1999, to “open
quota” in 1999­2000 and the conspicuous omission in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">                                                                       108</span>


scheme and the prospectus for 1999­2000 of a specific
stipulation like the one contained in clause X (5) in the
prospectus for 1998­1999 that the 50% of the seats available for
open competition shall be made available for selection and
admission of both service and non­service candidates, as also
the stipulation contained in the Government Order and the
prospectus for 1999­2000 under the caption “Criteria for
selection under 50% open quota”, which specifically reads that
all other eligible Medical Officers except those specified in clause
</p><p id="p_184">(iii)(d) above (meaning thereby Medical Officers who will be
treated as service candidates and allowed to apply as such) are
eligible to apply under 50% of the open quota, supports the
stand of the State Government and the Selection Committee and
justifies the selections for admission already made by them. The
further stipulation that the reservation will be confined to and
kept at 50% in favour of the in­service candidates on merit
basis, coupled with the other provisions noticed above make it
abundantly clear that the selection of the in­service candidates
is confined to and has to be kept at 50% only of the total seats
and not against any of the other seats, exclusively earmarked
for the non­service or private candidates.


</p><p id="p_185">      12. The mere use of the word “reservation” per se does
not have the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire
mechanism underlying the constitutional concept of a protective
reservation specially designed for the advancement of any
socially­and­educationally­backward classes of citizens or for
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, to enable them
to enter and adequately represent in various fields. The
meaning, content and purport of that expression will necessarily
depend upon the purpose and object with which it is used.
Since reservation has diverse natures and may be brought
about in diverse ways with varied purposes and manifold
objects, the peculiar principles of interpretation laid down by
the courts for implementing reservations envisaged under the
Constitution in order to ensure adequate and effective
representation to the backward classes as a whole cannot be
readily applied out of context and unmindful of the purpose of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">                                                                          109</span>


     reservations as the one made in this case, more to safeguard the
     interest of candidates who were already in service to enable
     such in­service candidates to acquire higher and advanced
     education in specialised fields to improve their professional
     talents for the benefit of the patients to be treated in such
     medical institutions where the in­service candidates are
     expected to serve. That apart, where the scheme envisaged is
     not by way of a mere reservation but is one of classification of
     the sources from which admissions have to be accorded,
     fixation of respective quota for such classified groups, the
     principles at times applied in construing provisions relating to
     reservation simpliciter will have no relevance or application.
     Though the prescription of a quota may involve in a general
     sense reservation in favour of the particular class or category in
     whose favour a quota is fixed, the concepts of reservation and
     fixation of quota drastically differ in their purport and content
     as well as the object. Fixation of a quota in a given case cannot
     be said to be the same as a mere reservation and whenever a
     quota is fixed or provided for one or more of the classified group
     or category, the candidates falling in or answering the
     description of different classified groups in whose favour a
     respective quota is fixed have to confine their respective claims
     against the quota fixed for each of such category, with no one in
     one category having any right to stake a claim against the quota
     earmarked for the other class or category. Since we are of the
     view that the Full Bench has correctly come to the conclusion
     that the scheme adopted for selection of candidates for
     admissions in question provided for a definite and fixed quota
     for the respective classified sources of admission and the
     reasons assigned therefor do not suffer from any infirmity
     whatsoever to call for any interference at our hands, these
     appeals fail and are dismissed.”

making the Madhya Pradesh Medical and Dental PG Entrance

Examination Rules, 2002, provided for reservation of 20% seats

in PG degree/diploma courses for employees of the Government of

such in­service candidates are exempted from pre­PG Entrance

Examination and shall be nominated for doing postgraduation in

various degree/diploma courses as per selection criteria, terms

and conditions of employer Department.          The Rules further

provided that selection will be done on the basis of the individual

cumulative performance at the first, second and third MBBS

examinations if such examinations have been passed from the

same university. The Rules which were under challenge before

the High Court further provided that only those candidates who

have completed five years of service under the Government of

Madhya Pradesh and who are not serving on contractual basis

will be eligible for selection as candidates who are in­service. The

     candidates. It held that the in­service candidates and open
     category candidates had to be subjected to one common
     entrance test for determining the comparative merit for entrance
     into the postgraduate courses of study, and that the holding of
     two separate tests — one for in­service candidates and one for
     open category candidates — was unsustainable, being in
     contravention of the Regulations framed by the Medical Council
     of India….”

     Having noted the laudable purpose sought to be achieved by

making special provisions for in­service candidates and having

noted,   in­service   candidates     on   attaining    higher    academic

achievements would be available to be posted in rural areas by

the State Government, this Court upheld the Rules providing

reservation for in­service candidates in PG courses. The relevant

observations are in paragraphs 19 to 21, which read as under:

     the in­service candidates — whether it is by way of reservation

quota seats. The State Government had allocated 50% of the
seats exclusively for in­service candidates and left the remaining
50% seats as open quota i.e. to be filled in from out of such
candidates as were not in State Government service. The
classification was made as “service quota” and “open quota”, for
in­service candidates and other candidates respectively,
confining the respective class/cadre candidates to the respective
percentages earmarked for the two of them exclusively. The
Court held:

       proportion;

       another exclusive quota by advancing a claim based on

       would depend on the purpose and object with which the
       expression has been used and that would be

<blockquote id="blockquote_57">     20. K. Duraisamy case [(2001) 2 SCC 538] was considered
and explained by another three­Judge Bench of this Court
in AIIMS Students' Union v. AIIMS [(2002) 1 SCC 428] . The
following observation is appropriate and apposite for the
purpose of the case at hand and is, therefore, extracted and
reproduced hereunder. The Court was considering the question
of allocation of seats between in­service and open category
candidates, the candidates in both the categories being medical
graduates, and not a reservation in favour of the weaker
sections of society or those who deserve or need to be
affirmatively discriminated. The Court then said: (SCC pp. 447­
48, para 31)
           “Some of them had done graduation sometime in
     the past and were either picked up in the government
     service or had sought for joining government service
     because, maybe, they could not get a seat in
     postgraduation and thereby continue their studies
     because of shortage of seats in higher level of studies. On
     account of their having remained occupied with their
     service obligations, they became detached or distanced
     from theoretical studies and therefore could not have
     done so well as to effectively compete with fresh medical
     graduates at the PG entrance examination. Permitting in­
     service candidates to do postgraduation by opening a
     separate channel for admittance would enable their
     continuance in government service after postgraduation
     which would enrich health services of the nation.</blockquote><p id="p_195">
</p><p id="p_196">     Candidates in open category having qualified in
     postgraduation may not necessarily feel attracted to
     public services. Providing two sources of entry at the
     postgraduation level in a certain proportion between in­
     service candidates and other candidates thus achieves the
     laudable object of making available better doctors both in

      public sector and as private practitioners. The object
      sought to be achieved is to benefit two segments of the
      same society by enriching both at the end and not so
      much as to provide protection and encouragement to one
      at the entry level.”

settled that the classification must satisfy the twin tests: (i) it
must be founded on an intelligible differentia which
distinguishes persons or things placed in a group from those left
out or placed not in the group, and (ii) the differentia must have
a rational relation with the object sought to be achieved. It is
permissible to use territories or the nature of the objects or
occupations or the like as the basis for classification. So long as
there is a nexus between the basis of classification and the
object sought to be achieved, the classification is valid. We have,
in the earlier part of the judgment, noted the relevant statistics
as made available to us by the learned Advocate­General under
instructions from Dr Ashok Sharma, Director (Medical Services),
Madhya Pradesh, present in the Court. The rural health services
(if it is an appropriate expression) need to be strengthened. 229
community health centres (CHCs) and 169 first­referral units
(FRUs) need to be manned by specialists and block medical
officers who must be postgraduates. There is nothing wrong in
the State Government setting apart a definite percentage of
educational seats at postgraduation level consisting of degree
and diploma courses exclusively for the in­service candidates.
To the extent of the seats so set apart, there is a separate and
exclusive source of entry or channel for admission. It is not
reservation. In­service candidates, and the candidates not in the
service of the State Government, are two classes based on an
intelligible differentia. There is a laudable purpose sought to be
achieved. In­service candidates, on attaining higher academic
achievements, would be available to be posted in rural areas by
the State Government. It is not that an in­service candidate
would leave the service merely on account of having secured a
postgraduate degree or diploma though secured by virtue of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">                                                                          116</span>


     being in the service of the State Government. If there is any
     misapprehension, the same is allayed by the State Government
     obtaining a bond from such candidates as a condition precedent
     to their taking admission that after completing PG
     degree/diploma course they would serve the State Government
     for another five years. Additionally, a bank guarantee of rupees
     three lakhs is required to be submitted along with the bond.
     There is, thus, clearly a perceptible reasonable nexus between
     the classification and the object sought to be achieved.”

     However, this Court has further held that there shall be only

one common entrance test. In paragraphs 25 to 28, it is held as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_198">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">           “25. The eligibility test, called the entrance test or the
     pre­PG test, is conducted with dual purposes. Firstly, it is held
     with the object of assessing the knowledge and intelligence
     quotient of a candidate whether he would be able to prosecute
     postgraduate studies if allowed an opportunity of doing so;
     secondly, it is for the purpose of assessing the merit inter se of
     the candidates which is of vital significance at the counselling
     when it comes to allotting the successful candidates to different
     disciplines wherein the seats are limited and some disciplines
     are considered to be more creamy and are more coveted than
     the others. The concept of a minimum qualifying percentage
     cannot, therefore, be given a complete go­by. If at all there can
     be departure, that has to be minimal and that too only by
     approval of experts in the field of medical education, which for
     the present are available as a body in the Medical Council of
     India.</blockquote><p id="p_199">


</p><p id="p_200">           26. The Medical Council of India, for the present, insists,
     through its Regulations, on a common entrance test being
     conducted whereat the minimum qualifying marks would be
     50%. The State of Madhya Pradesh must comply with the

requirements of the Regulations framed by the Medical Council
of India and hold a common entrance test even if there are two
separate channels of entry and allow clearance only to such
candidates who secure the minimum qualifying marks as
prescribed by the MCI Regulations. If the State has a case for
making a departure from such rule or for carving out an
exception in favour of any classification then it is for the State
to represent to the Central Government and/or the Medical
Council of India and make out a case of justification
consistently with the afore­quoted observation of this Court
in Dayanand Medical College and Hospital case [(2001) 8 SCC
664] .
</p>
<p id="p_201">
</p><p id="p_202">         27. The in­service candidates may have been away from
academics and theories because of being in service. Still they
need to be assessed as eligible for entrance in PG. For taking up
such examination, they must either keep updating themselves
regularly or concentrate on preparatory studies to entrance
examinations but without sacrificing or compromising with their
obligations to the people whom they are meant to serve on
account of being in State services.
</p>
<p id="p_203">
</p><p id="p_204">         28. Clearly, the State of Madhya Pradesh was not justified
in holding and conducting a separate entrance test for in­
service candidates. Nor could it have devised a formula by
combining clauses (i) and (iii) of Regulation 9(1) by resorting to
clause (iv). Recourse can be had to clause (iii) when there is only
one university. When there is only one university in one State,
the standard of assessment can reasonably be assumed to have
been the same for assessing the academic merit of the students
passing from that university. When there are more universities
than one in a State, the standards of different universities and
their assessment methods cannot obviously be uniform and
may differ. Then it would be futile to assess the comparative
merit of individual performances by reference to clause (iii). The
High Court is, therefore, right in forming an opinion that in the
State of Madhya Pradesh, where five universities exist, the
method of evaluation contemplated by clause (iii) is not available
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">                                                                           118</span>


     either in substitution of or in addition to clause (i). The
     candidates qualified at the pre­PG or PG entrance test held in
     common for in­service and open category candidates, would
     then be divided into two separate merit lists to be prepared for
     the two categories and merit inter se of the successful
     candidates shall be available to be assessed separately in the
     two respective categories.”
                                                 (emphasis supplied)



Ultimately, in paragraph 36, this Court concluded as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">           “36. We sum up our conclusions as under:

14.3 The question with respect to reservation and/or special

provisions for admission to PG courses with respect to in­service

candidates again fell for consideration before this Court in the

case of Sudhir N (supra).    In the said decision, this Court also

considered Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000, which

provided that general category candidates must secure 50%

marks in the common entrance examination.            In the aforesaid

case of Sudhir N (supra), 40% of the seats available in the State of

Kerala for postgraduate medical admission were reserved for in­

service doctors serving in the Health Service Department, Medical

College Lecturers and doctors serving in the ESI department of

the State. However, it was further provided that the admission

shall be made strictly on the basis of inter se seniority of the in­

service candidates who have appeared in the common entrance

examination for the postgraduate medical admission and have

obtained the minimum eligibility benchmark in the test in terms

of the Regulations framed by the MCI. Writ petitions were filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">                                                               120</span>


before the High Court on the ground that the State legislature

could not enact a law that would make selection for admission to

the PG courses dependent solely on the seniority of the in­service

candidates without prescribing the minimum conditions of

eligibility for the candidates concerned.     The High Court in

principle agreed that the admission to PG courses should be

made only on the basis of inter se seniority provided the

candidates appear in the common entrance examination and

qualify.
</p>
<p id="p_207">     After considering various decisions of this Court, ultimately,

this Court upheld the decision of the High Court that inasmuch

as the provision of <a href="/doc/31707573/" id="a_114">Section 5(4)</a> of the 2008 Act which provides for

selection of candidates to be from the one stipulated by the MCI

Regulations, was beyond the legislative competence of the State

Legislature.   However, upheld the reservation for in­service

candidates after considering the decision of this Court in the case

of Gopal D. Tirthani (supra) holding that in­service candidates to

be treated as a separate channel for admission to postgraduate

courses within that category.     Also, admission can be granted

only on the basis of merit.     It is to be noted that in the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                                                                           121</span>


decision, this Court observed that Regulation 9 of the Regulations

2000 is a complete code by itself. However, the said observation

can be said to be confined to the controversy before the Court and

the reference which was made shall be considered and dealt with

hereinbelow at an appropriate stage.
</p>
<p id="p_208">     Thus, making special provision for in­service candidates and

the provisions for providing reservation for in­service candidates

in postgraduate medical courses have been upheld and approved

by this Court in the aforesaid decisions.


14.4 Even in the case of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) also, while

upholding Regulation 9(IV) which provides weightage to the extent

of 10% of the marks obtained by the candidates in the

competition test and to the extent of maximum 30% marks, this

Court has in paragraph 44 has observed as under:

students to apply for admission to postgraduate courses, in
remote and difficult areas as compulsory. That is kept on hold,
as was stated before the Rajya Sabha. The provision in the form
of granting weightage of marks, therefore, was to give incentive
to the in­service candidates and to attract more graduates to
join as medical officers in the State healthcare sector. The
provision was first inserted in 2012. To determine the academic
merit of candidates, merely securing high marks in NEET is not
enough. The academic merit of the candidate must also reckon
the services rendered for the common or public good. Having
served in rural and difficult areas of the State for one year or
above, the incumbent having sacrificed his career by rendering
services for providing healthcare facilities in rural areas, deserve
incentive marks to be reckoned for determining merit. Notably,

areas which are not remote or difficult areas has been so
notified. Suffice it to observe that the mere hypothesis that the
State Government may take an improper decision whilst
notifying the area as remote and difficult, cannot be the basis to
hold that Regulation 9 and in particular proviso to clause (IV) is
unreasonable. Considering the above, the inescapable
conclusion is that the procedure evolved in Regulation 9 in
general and the proviso to clause (IV) in particular is just,
proper and reasonable and also fulfils the test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_115">Article 14</a> of

15.5 In the case of CESC Ltd. (supra), this Court has observed

and held that right to health is a fundamental right.      It went

further and observed that health is not merely absence of

sickness.      The term health implies more than an absence of

sickness.      Medical care and health facilities not only protect

against sickness but also ensure stable manpower for economic

development.        Facilities of health and medical care generate

devotion and dedication to give the workers’ best, physically as

well as mentally, in productivity.

15.6 In the case of <a href="/doc/440471/" id="a_131">Municipal Council, Ratlam v. Vardhichand</a> 27,

this Court through Justice Krishna Iyer observed: “The State will

realize that <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_132">Article 47</a> makes it a paramount principle of

governance that steps are taken for the improvement of public

health as amongst its primary duties.

15.8 <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_133">Article 47</a> of the Constitution reiterates the constitutional

obligation imposed on the State to improve public health.              The

Directive Principle provides as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_67">        “47. Duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and
        the standard of living and to improve public health – The
        State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and
        the standard of living of its people and the improvement
        of public health as among its primary duties and, in
        particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about
        prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal
        purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are
        injurious to health.”




15.9 As observed hereinabove, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_134">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of

India imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the life of

every person. Preservation of human life is thus of paramount

importance. Thus, when the State provides a separate source of

admission for in­service doctors as a distinct class and within the

State quota and the object is laudable, the State is within its

power to provide such separate source of admission in exercise of

the powers under Entry 25 List III, read with Entry 6, List II. It

cannot be said that there is no nexus with the laudable object of

meeting the requirement of qualified postgraduate doctors for the

public health services, more particularly, in the rural, tribal and

difficult areas. As such, there is no conflict between the power of

the Union and the State. As observed hereinabove, the occupied

filed of Union legislation in exercise of power under Entry 66, List

I is related to minimum standards of medical education and the

State is providing the in­service quota without impinging the

prescribed minimum standards. It is a settled proposition of law

that in case of two entries might be overlapping, in that case, the

interpretation must be in furtherance of achieving the ultimate

object, in the present case to provide better health care in the

rural, tribal and difficult areas. Any interpretation which would

negate and/or become nugatory the other entry, is to be avoided.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_219">There must be a harmonious reading between the two entries. In

the present case, as such and as observed hereinabove, there

shall not be any conflict between the power of the Union and the

State, while exercising the powers under Entry 66 List I by the

Union and under Entry 25 List III by the States. Therefore, as

such, the State is within its power and is empowered to make

reservation in the seats of the postgraduate medical courses,

more particularly, for in­service doctors.

15.10     In the federal structure, the State, as well as the

Parliament, have a constitutional directive for the upliftment of

Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and socially and backward

classes.   Therefore, the State Government have the right to

provide reservation and in the field of employment and education,

looking to the specific/special need of public requirement in the

particular area.   There is no constitutional bar to take further

affirmative action as taken by the State Government in the cases

to achieve the goal. Therefore, by allotting a specific percentage

within its State quota and to provide preferential treatment to a

particular class, cannot be said to be beyond the legislative

competence of the State.          On the contrary, as observed

hereinabove, the State is within its power and authority to

provide such a preferential treatment to provide a better public

health in the rural, tribal and hilly areas.

</p><p id="p_220">16.   It is to be noticed that earlier also the concerned States did

provide    reservation    for   in­service     government   medical

officers/doctors and the concerned States, as such, achieved the

goal of meeting the public health services in the rural, tribal and

difficult areas. However, because of the misinterpretation of the

MCI Regulations, 2000, the problems have arisen.

</p><p id="p_221">17.    Even otherwise, Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000

to the extent not providing for any reservation for in­service

candidates working in the rural, tribal and difficult areas can be

declared      ultra        vires   on     the   ground    of     being   arbitrary,

discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the

Constitution of India. It is required to be noted that Regulation 9,

more     particularly         Regulation        9(VII)   makes     provision    for

reservation      for        in­service      candidates     for     admission    to

postgraduate diploma courses only. However, there is no reason

coming out of either from the Regulations or in any form of

material produced by the MCI showing as to on what basis MCI

takes a stand that similar in­service reservation is not permissible

for admission to postgraduate degree courses. Therefore, if the

very   concept        of     in­service    reservation    is     permissible   and

incorporated in the MCI Regulations, 2000, opposition to similar

reservation for postgraduate degree courses is unreasonable and

irrational.

<p id="p_222">18.    Now so far as the observations made by this Court in the

cases of Sudhir N (supra) and Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra) that

clear that the observations made by this Court in the case of

Sudhir N (supra) that Regulation 9 of the MCI Regulations, 2000

is a complete code is required to be considered with reference to

the context and controversy before the Court.




18.1 In the case of Sudhir N (supra), the State law which was

under consideration by the Court provided that the seniority list

of selected candidates to be prepared directly based on seniority

of in­service doctors, irrespective of marks obtained by such in­

service candidates in common PG entrance examination. In that

context, this Court held that Regulation 9 of MCI Regulations,

2000 is the only effective and permissible basis for granting

admission to postgraduate medical courses and therefore it was

observed that Regulation 9 of MCI Regulations, 2000 is a

complete code. Therefore, the observations in the case of Sudhir

N (supra) that Regulation 9 is a complete code in itself may not be

construed with respect to providing reservation and/or making

special provision like providing separate source of entry for in­

service candidates within the State quota and subject to fulfilling

of other criteria fixed and provided by the MCI.    Therefore, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">                                                                 133</span>


observations made by this Court in the case of Dinesh Singh

Chauhan (supra) and as held by this Court in the case of Sudhir N

(supra) that Regulation 9 is a complete code in itself cannot be

accepted and is held to be not a good law.

<p id="p_223">
</p><p id="p_224">19.   When we consider the subsequent amendment in the year

2018, as made by notification dated 12.07.2018, it is provided

that a medical college/medical institution shall be entitled to seek

equal number of Post Graduate Degree (MD/MS) seats by

surrendering recognised diploma seats in corresponding course.

In view of the above, it has so happened that by and large in every

State the diploma seats are converted in PG Degree (MD/MS)

seats by surrendering recognised diploma seats.       The resultant

effect is that in­service candidates/doctors shall not be entitled to

any seat even in PG Diploma courses which has been provided

under Regulation 9(VII) of MCI Regulations 2000, as amended

from time to time. Therefore, ultimately, it will affect the public

health and the common people in the rural, tribal and hilly areas

where there is a dearth of good and highly qualified doctors.

Therefore, if the rights of the States to provide such reservation

for in­service doctors in postgraduate degree/diploma courses is

the country. Legislations pertaining to medical

education in this country is primarily guided

by two entries of the Seventh Schedule to the

Constitution of India, being Entry 66 of List I

(Union     List)     and    Entry     25   of   List   III

(Concurrent List). These entries read:-

   The conflict between the power of the Union

and the State in this set of cases does not

arise     out   of   any    primary    legislation,    but

emerges     out      of    subordinate     or   delegated

so far as the subject-controversy is concerned,

this     expression         really      implies     a    separate

impacting the prospects of in-service doctors

in pursuing higher educational qualifications.

The Medical Council of India (MCI) has started

permitting conversion of seats in post-graduate

diploma      course   to   “degree-seats”     from    July,

2018. So far as the State of Tamil Nadu is

concerned, (who are the respondent no.3 in Writ

degree courses. This has been brought to our

notice by the learned Senior Counsel for the

State of Tamil Nadu, Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan and

Mr. V. Giri. Such conversion, we are apprised,

brought by the MCI to “The Opening of a New or

Post-graduate Course of Study or Training) and

Increase of Admission Capacity in any Course of

Study     or   Training      (including        Post-graduate

This    amendment        permits    medical     colleges    or

institutions       to    surrender    their     postgraduate

diploma seats to be replaced by postgraduate

degree seats. The said amendment was brought

has   been   done    under    Rule     6   of    the   Gujarat

Professional     Postgraduate Medical            Educational

Courses (Regulation of Admission) Rules, 2018.

These Rules have been framed under the Gujarat

Institutions        (Regulation      of     Admission       and

Fixation of Fees) Act, 2007. Subsequently, all

the medical colleges in the State of Gujarat

have applied for conversion of their diploma

seats    into   degree    courses.         The    applicants

contend that such conversion would nullify the

effect of Clause 9(8) of the 2000 Regulations.

The     Association’s        concern       is    that     such

conversion would further shrink future academic

pursuit of the in-service doctors from that

State. It appears that the State of Gujarat had

The   seats      involved      were   for   MD-MS    courses,

which are postgraduate medical degree courses.

In terms of the 2000 Regulations, half of the

total number of seats had been reserved for All

India    quota     and       the   other    half    had   been

reserved for the State quota. After the second

round of counselling, the vacancies remaining

from the national quota were reverted back to

the     State.         The     complaint     of     the   writ

petitioners before the High Court was that the

State was seeking to fill up these reverted

seats in 60:40 ratio for the open category and

in-service candidates. A learned Single Judge

of the High Court allowed the writ petition on

the ground that such reservation was contrary

to the provisions of the 2000 Regulations. The

decision of the First Court was affirmed by a

Division Bench of the High Court. Admission of

the in-service doctors to postgraduate degree

</blockquote><p id="p_285">15. In the aforesaid decision, the three-judge

Bench of this Court proceeded on the basis that

the   procedure   for   admission   to   postgraduate

courses falls within Entry 66 of List I to the

Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.

It was, inter-alia, held in this judgment:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">       “24. By now, it is well established
       that Regulation 9 is a self-contained
       code regarding the procedure to be
       followed for admissions to medical
       courses. It is also well established
       that the State has no authority to
       enact any law much less by executive
       instructions that may undermine the
       procedure      for     admission      to
       postgraduate       medical       courses
       enunciated by the Central legislation
       and regulations framed thereunder,
       being   a   subject    falling    within
       Schedule VII List I Entry 66 of the
       Constitution (see <a href="/doc/1095409/" id="a_143">Preeti Srivastava
       v. State of M.P</a>.). The procedure for
       selection   of   candidates    for   the
       postgraduate degree courses is one
       such   area  on    which   the   Central
       legislation    and   regulations    must
       prevail.

<p id="p_286">25. Thus, we must first ascertain
whether Regulation 9, as applicable
to   the  case   on  hand,   envisages
reservation of seats for in service
medical    officers   generally    for
admission to postgraduate “degree”
courses. Regulation 9 is a composite
provision prescribing procedure for
selection   of   candidates—both   for
postgraduate “degree” as well as
postgraduate “diploma” courses:</p>
<p id="p_287">
25.1. Clause (I) of Regulation 9
mandates that there shall be a single
National      Eligibility-cum-Entrance
Test (hereinafter referred to as
“NEET”)   to  be   conducted  by   the
designated authority.
</p>
<p id="p_288"> 25.2. Clause (II) provides for three
per   cent    seats   of   the   annual
sanctioned intake capacity to be
earmarked     for    candidates    with
locomotory disability of lower limbs.
</p><p id="p_289">We   are   not   concerned  with   this
provision.
</p>
<p id="p_290">
25.3.   Clause  (III) provides  for
eligibility for admission to any
postgraduate course in a particular
academic year.</p>
<p id="p_291">


25.4. Clause (IV) is the relevant
provision.     It     provides     for
reservation   of  seats   in   medical
colleges/institutions   for   reserved
categories as per applicable laws
prevailing       in       States/Union
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_169">                                           169</span>


Territories. The reservation referred
to in the opening part of this clause
is, obviously, with reference to
reservation as per the constitutional
scheme (for the Scheduled Caste, the
Scheduled Tribe or the Other Backward
Class candidates); and not for the
in-service    candidates    or   medical
officers   in   service.    It   further
stipulates that all-India merit list
as well as Statewise merit list of
the eligible candidates shall be
prepared on the basis of the marks
obtained in NEET and the admission to
postgraduate courses in the State
concerned shall be as per the merit
list only. Thus, it is a provision
mandating   admission    of   candidates
strictly as per the merit list of
eligible     candidates      for     the
respective medical courses in the
State.    This    provision,    however,
contains a proviso. It predicates
that in determining the merit of
candidates who are in service of the
Government or a public authority,
weightage in the marks may be given
by the Government/competent authority
as an incentive @ 10% of the marks
obtained for each year of service in
specified remote or difficult areas
of the State up to the maximum of 30%
of the marks obtained in NEET. This
provision even if read liberally does
not provide for reservation for in-
</p><p id="p_292">service   candidates,    but   only   of
giving a weightage in the form of
incentive marks as specified to the
class of in-service candidates (who
have served in notified remote and
difficult areas in the State).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_170">                                          170</span><p id="p_293">


</p><p id="p_294">26. From the plain language of this
proviso, it is amply clear that it
does not envisage reservation for in-
</p><p id="p_295">service candidates in respect of
postgraduate “degree” courses with
which we are presently concerned.
</p><p id="p_296">This    proviso    postulates    giving
weightage of marks to “specified in-
</p><p id="p_297">service candidates” who have worked
in notified remote and/or difficult
areas    in    the    State—both    for
postgraduate “degree” courses as also
for postgraduate “diploma” courses.
</p><p id="p_298">Further, the weightage of marks so
allotted is required to be reckoned
while preparing the merit list of
candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_299">  27. Thus understood, the Central
enactment and the regulations framed
thereunder   do   not   provide   for
reservation for in-service candidates
in postgraduate “degree” courses. As
there   is   no   express   provision
prohibiting reservation to in-service
candidates in respect of admission to
postgraduate “degree” courses, it was
contended that providing for such
reservation by the State Government
is not impermissible in law. Further,
there are precedents of this Court to
suggest that such arrangement is
permissible as a separate channel of
admission for in-service candidates.
</p><p id="p_300">This argument does not commend to us.
</p><p id="p_301">In the first place, the decisions
pressed into service have considered
the provisions regarding admission
process governed by the regulations
in force at the relevant time. The

       admission process in the present case
       is governed by the regulations which
       have   come    into    force    from   the
       academic     year      2013-2014.     This
       Regulation is a self-contained code.
</p><p id="p_302">       There is nothing in this Regulation
       to even remotely indicate that a
       separate channel for admission to in-</p>
<p id="p_303">       service candidates must be provided,
       at least in respect of postgraduate
       “degree”             courses.           In
       contradistinction, however, 50% seats
       are earmarked for the postgraduate
       “diploma”    courses     for   in-service
       candidates, as is discernible from
       clause   (VII).     If   the   regulation
       intended a similar separate channel
       for in-service candidates even in
       respect   of     postgraduate     “degree”
       courses, that position would have
       been made clear in Regulation 9
       itself. In absence thereof, it must
       be presumed that a separate channel
       for in-service candidates is not
       permissible      for      admission     to
       postgraduate “degree” courses. Thus,
       the State Government, in law, had no
       authority to issue a Government Order
       such as dated 28-2-2014, to provide
       to the contrary. Hence, the High
       Court was fully justified in setting
       aside the said government order being
       contrary to the mandate of Regulation
       9   of   the    2000    Regulations,    as
       applicable from the academic year
       2013-2014.”

same.     In    the     petition          instituted       by   the

Association of Tamil Nadu Medical Officers, it

has been pleaded that since the year 1989, the

State of Tamil Nadu had a policy for providing

separate       source       of     entry      for    in-service

candidates to the extent of the 50 per cent of

the seats in degree courses. Thereafter the

State had also provided weightage to those in-

service    doctors       who       have    served    in     rural,

remote or difficult areas.                  The grievances of

the   petitioners       arose       in     the    light    of    the

findings of this Court in the case of Dinesh

Singh     Chauhan        (supra).          The      petitioners’

apprehension was that it would be impermissible

for the State to provide a separate source of

entry for in-service candidates and that any

such exercise of power by State would be in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_173">                                                    173</span>


contradiction of Clause 9 which would cause

grave prejudice to them.     In this context, they

made the prayers which we have already referred

to.    A Bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this

Court, at the time of the admission of the Writ

Petition (Civil) no. 196 of 2018, on 13th April

2018   opined   that   the   said     writ     petition

required   consideration     by   a   larger     bench.

petition has been referred to us. In the other

proceedings which we are hearing now also the

same   question    of   constitutional    law    is

involved. There are, however, certain factual

variations as regards the manner in which such

reservation is contemplated. We shall briefly

discuss first the ratio of the judgment in the

case of R. Chitralekha (supra). This was a case

decided when power was exclusively with the

State Legislature to legislate in respect of

“Education including universities, subject to

the provisions of Items 63, 64, 65 and 66 of

List I and 25 of List III”. At that point of

time, these items were enumerated against Entry

11 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the

Constitution. The dispute in that case before

the Constitution Bench of this Court arose from

an    order     passed    by      the   State      Government

directing reservation of certain percentage of

seats in professional and technical colleges

and   institutions.        Such     reservation       was    for

Backward       Classes    and     Scheduled       Castes     and

Tribes.    The    Government        order    issued    on   26th

July, 1963 also defined Backward Classes. The

criteria for marking, as stipulated, was that

25 per cent of maximum marks for examination in

the   optional     subjects       was   to   be   taken     into

account for making the selection of candidates

for admission to engineering colleges was to be

fixed     as     interview        marks.     Criteria        for

allotting      marks     in   the    interview      was     also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_177">                                                      177</span>


specified. The Selection Committee had evolved

certain      different     marking       criteria     for

interviews. Some of the unsuccessful candidates

had approached the High Court for quashing the

orders issued by the Government in the matter

of   admissions     to    those      institutions.    The

petitioning candidates asked for direction that

admission should be in the order of merit. The

‘reservation’ part of Governmental Order was

sustained by the High Court. The High Court,

however, held that the Selection Committee had

abused     the   powers   conferred      upon   it.   The

interviews were set aside and direction was

issued by the High Court for holding interviews

afresh in accordance with the scheme laid down

by   the   Government.    It   was   urged   before   the

Constitution Bench of this court by the writ

petitioners therein that the State Government

had no power to appoint a selection committee
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_178">                                                   178</span>


for admitting students to colleges on the basis

of qualifications higher than or different from

those prescribed by the university. One of the

grounds for questioning the power of the State

Government to appoint a selection committee was

that     coordination      and   determination     of

standards of a university was a Union subject

and the State had no power to lay down Rules

for    maintaining   the   standards   of   university

education. Referring to an earlier decision of

this Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/1627518/" id="a_147">Gujarat University &amp;

Anr. vs. Shri Krishna &amp; Ors</a>. [(AIR) 1963 SC

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_90">        “The question was whether medium of
        instruction was comprehended by either
        of those entries or whether it fell
        under both. In that context it was
        observed at p. 715-16:</blockquote><p id="p_309">
</p><p id="p_310">          ‘The State has the power to prescribe
        the syllabi and courses of study in the
        institutions named in Entry 66 (but not
        falling within Entries 63 to 65) and as
        an incident thereof it has the power to
        indicate    the    medium   in    which
        instruction should be imparted. But the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_179">                                               179</span>


Union Parliament has an overriding
legislative power to ensure that the
syllabi and courses of study prescribed
and the medium selected do not impair
standards of education or render the
coordination of such standards either
on   an  all   India  or   other  basis
impossible or even difficult.’
This   and     similar     other    passages
indicate that if the law made by the
State by virtue of Entry 11 of List II
of   the    Seventh    Schedule     to   the
Constitution     makes      impossible    or
difficult     the     exercise     of    the
legislative power of the Parliament
under   the    entry    “coordination    and
determination       of      standards     in
institutions for higher education or
research and scientific and technical
institutions” reserved to the Union,
the State law may be bad. This cannot
obviously be decided on speculative and
hypothetical reasoning. If the impact
of the State law providing for such
standards on Entry 66 of List I is so
heavy or devastating as to wipe out or
appreciably abridge the central field,
it may be struck down. But that is a
question of fact to be ascertained in
each case. It is not possible to hold
that if a State Legislature made a law
prescribing a higher percentage of
marks for extra-curricular activities
in the matter of admission to colleges,
it would be directly encroaching on the
field covered by Entry 66 of List I of
the    Seventh       Schedule     to     the
Constitution. If so, it is not disputed
that the State Government would be
within    its     rights     to   prescribe
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_180">                                                       180</span>


         qualifications    for    admission   to
         colleges so long as its action does not
         contravene any other law.”

the   State      in   regulating   certain   aspects   of

<p id="p_314">vocational and technical training of
labour.”


</p><p id="p_315">101.To our mind, Entry 66 in List I is a
specific entry having a very specific
and   limited   scope.     It    deals   with
coordination    and      determination     of
standards in institutions of higher
education   or    research     as   well   as
scientific and technical institutions.
</p><p id="p_316">The      words       “coordination        and
determination of standards” would mean
laying down the said standards. Thus,
when   it   comes    to    prescribing    the
standards   for    such    institutions    of
higher learning, exclusive domain is
given to the Union. However, that would
not include conducting of examination,
etc, and admission of students to such
institutions or prescribing the fee in
these institutions of higher education,
etc. In fact, such coordination and
determination of standards, insofar as
medical   education     is    concerned,   is
achieved by parliamentary legislation in
the form of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_148">Indian Medical Council
Act</a>, 1956 and by creating the statutory
body like Medical Council of India (for
short “MCI”) therein. The functions that
are assigned to MCI include within its
sweep determination of standards in a
medical    institution       as    well    as
coordination of standards and that of
educational institutions. When it comes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_182">                                            182</span>


to regulating “education” as such, which
includes even medical education as well
as universities (which are imparting
higher education), that is prescribed in
List III Entry 25, thereby giving
concurrent powers to both Union as well
as States. It is significant to note
that    earlier   education,    including
universities, was the subject-matter of
List II Entry 11. Thus, power to this
extent    was   given   to    the   State
Legislatures. However, this entry was
omitted by the Constitution (Forty-
</p><p id="p_317">second <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_149">Amendment) Act</a>, 1976 with effect
from 3-7-1977 and at the same time List
II entry 25 was amended. Education,
including university education, was thus
transferred to the concurrent List and
in the process technical and medical
education was also added. Thus, if the
argument of the appellants is accepted,
it may render Entry 25 otiose. When two
entries relating to education, one in
the Union List and the other in the
concurrent List, coexist, they have to
be read harmoniously. Reading in this
manner, it would become manifest that
when it comes to coordination and laying
down   of   standards   in   the   higher
education or research and scientific and
technical institutions, power rests with
the Union/Parliament to the exclusion of
the State Legislatures. However, other
facets of education, including technical
and medical education, as well as
governance of universities is concerned,
even State Legislatures are given power
by virtue of Entry 25. The field covered
by List III entry 25 is wide enough and
as circumscribed to the limited extent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_183">                                             183</span>


of it being subject to List I Entries
63, 64, 65 and 66.”


</p><p id="p_318">102. Most     educational      activities,
including admissions, have two aspects:
the first deals with the adoption and
setting up the minimum standards of
education. The objective in prescribing
minimum standards is to provide a
benchmark of the calibre and quality of
education being imparted by various
educational institutions in the entire
country. Additionally, the coordination
of the standards of education determined
nationwide is ancillary to the very
determination of standards. Realising
the vast diversity of the nation wherein
levels of education fluctuated from lack
of even basic primary education, to
institutions of high excellence, it was
thought   desirable    to  determine   and
prescribe basic minimum standards of
education      at      various     levels,
particularly at the level of research
institutions,     higher   education   and
technical education institutions. As
such, while balancing the needs of
States to impart education as per the
needs and requirements of local and
regional levels, it was essential to lay
down a uniform minimum standard for the
nation. Consequently, the Constitution-
makers provided for List I Entry 66 with
the objective of maintaining uniform
standards of education in fields of
research, higher education and technical
education.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_184">                                               184</span><p id="p_319">


</p><pre id="pre_6">103. The     second/other      aspect     of
education   is    with    regard    to   the
implementation   of    the   standards    of
</pre><p id="p_320">education determined by Parliament, and
the regulation of the complete activity
of education. This activity necessarily
entails the application of the standards
determined    by    Parliament     in    all
educational institutions in accordance
with the local and regional needs. Thus,
while List I Entry 66 dealt with
determination    and     coordination     of
standards, on the other hand, the
original List II Entry 11 granted the
States the exclusive power to legislate
with respect to all other aspects of
education, except the determination of
minimum standards and coordination which
was in national interest. Subsequently,
vide   the   Constitution     (Forty-second
Amendment) Act, 1976, the exclusive
legislative    field     of    the     State
Legislature with regard to education was
removed and deleted, and the same was
replaced by amending List III Entry 25
granting   concurrent    powers    to   both
Parliament and State Legislature the
power to legislate with respect to all
other aspects of education, except that
which was specifically covered by List I
Entries 63 to 66.

(1) SCR 112] , a Bench of five Judges
examined the scope of List II Entry 11
(which is now List III Entry 25) with
reference to List I Entry 66. It was
held that the power of the State to
legislate in respect of education to the
extent it is entrusted to Parliament, is
deemed to be restricted. Coordination
and determination of standards was in
the purview of List I and power of the
State was subject to power of the Union
on the said subject. It was held that
the two entries overlapped to some
extent and to the extent of overlapping
the power conferred by List I Entry 66
must prevail over power of the State.

     VIIth Schedule to the Constitution.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_98">     In the VIIth Schedule as originally
     in force, Entry 11 of List II gave
     to the State an exclusive power to

     provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_99">         Entry 11 of List II was deleted
     and Entry 25 of List III was amended
     with effect from 3-1-1976 as a
     result of the Constitution 42nd
     <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_164">Amendment Act</a> of 1976. The present
     Entry 25 in the Concurrent List is

     technical      education,     medical

     65 and 66 of List I; vocational and
     technical training of labour.”
         Entry 25 is subject, inter alia,
     to Entry 66 of List I. Entry 66 of
     List I is as follows:</blockquote><p id="p_329">

research    and     scientific       and
technical institutions.”
Both the Union as well as the States
have the power to legislate on
education       including         medical
education, subject, inter alia, to
Entry 66 of List I which deals with
laying      down      standards        in
institutions for higher education or
research     and     scientific       and
technical    institutions      as    also
coordination of such standards. A
State has, therefore, the right to
control education including medical
education so long as the field is
not    occupied     by     any      Union
legislation.   Secondly,    the     State
cannot, while controlling education
in the State, impinge on standards
in     institutions      for       higher
education.     Because       this      is
exclusively within the purview of
the   Union   Government.     Therefore,
while prescribing the criteria for
admission to the institutions for
higher education including higher
medical education, the State cannot
adversely affect the standards laid
down by the Union of India under
Entry 66 of List I. Secondly, while
considering the cases on the subject
it is also necessary to remember
that     from     1977,       education,
including, inter alia, medical and
university education, is now in the
Concurrent List so that the Union
can legislate on admission criteria
also. If it does so, the State will

</p><p id="p_332">22.   On the aspect of laying down norms for

admission,   it   was   held   in   the   case   of   Dr.

Preeti Srivastava (supra):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_101">      36. It would not be correct to say
      that the norms for admission have no
      connection with the standard of
      education, or that the rules for
      admission are covered only by Entry
      25 of List III. Norms of admission
      can have a direct impact on the
      standards of education. Of course,
      there can be rules for admission
      which are consistent with or do not
      affect adversely the standards of
      education prescribed by the Union in
      exercise of powers under Entry 66 of
      List I. For example, a State may,
      for admission to the postgraduate
      medical      courses,       lay     down
      qualifications in addition to those
      prescribed under Entry 66 of List I.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_102">      This   would    be    consistent    with
      promoting    higher     standards    for
      admission to the higher educational
      courses. But any lowering of the
      norms laid down can and does have an
      adverse effect on the standards of
      education   in    the    institutes   of
      higher    education.     Standards    of

      college depend on      various     factors.
      Some of these are:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_103">      (1) the    calibre     of    the   teaching
      staff;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_104">      (2) a proper syllabus designed to
      achieve a high level of education in
      the given span of time;

      admitted to the institution;

      facilities, or hospital facilities

      (8)the standard of examinations held
      including the manner in which the
      papers are set and examined and the
      clinical performance is judged.”


</p><p id="p_335">23.   From   a   composite        reading   of   these

authorities, the position of law as emerges, is

that all aspects of admission cannot be said to

be covered by Entry 66 of the Union List, even

if the entire admission process is incorporated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_193">                                                              193</span>


in a single code. Certain aspects of admission

stipulated       by    the     State    may     trespass     into

legislative           zone      of      “coordination         and

determination of standards.” One illustration

of such potential trespass would be lowering

the eligibility criteria for admission fixed by

a Union legislation, the 2000 Regulations in

this case. In such a situation, the State would

be    encroaching       upon    exclusive       field   of   the

Union. The case of Preeti Srivastava (supra)

was    decided    broadly       on     this   rationale.     But

there    can    be     Rules    on     facets    of   admission

process    in    institutions          of    higher   education

framed by the State legislature which would not

have impact on the subjects enumerated against

Entry 66 of the Union List, and thus would not

result    in    conflict       with    the    latter.      While

analysing the State’s power to legislate under

Entry 11 of List II of the Seventh schedule of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_194">                                                        194</span>


the Constitution, as it originally existed, it

has been observed in the case of Modern Dental

College (supra) that “…except the determination

of minimum standards and coordination which was

in    the   national    interest..”,      the   State   had

power to legislate with respect to all other

aspects of education.          Now that the subjects of

erstwhile Entry 11 of List II find their way in

the    Concurrent      List,   the   State’s    power   is

further     subject    to   any   statutory     instrument

owing its origin to any Union legislation, even

if such statutory instrument is not enacted on

the    basis   of   exclusive     power   of    the   Union

contained in Entry 66 of List I.                  In that

context, we would have to examine as to whether

these facets of admission to the postgraduate

medical degree course from a separate entry

channel comprising of in-service doctors stand

already covered or occupied by the statutory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_195">                                                     195</span>


instrument   in   the   form    of    2000   Regulations

owing its origin to a Union legislation comes

within the ambit of Entry 66 of List-I. If not,

the subject-entry would be in the concurrent

list and it would be permissible for the States

to lay down their own norms, which are not

covered by any Union legislations. In the case

of Modern Dental College (supra), this was the

judicial approach of the Constitution Bench.

We find support for taking this view from the

case of R. Chitralekha (supra) also. In the

latter   authority,     of   course,    the    competing

entries were in List I and List II of the

Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the

dispute was on methodology of marking in the

selection    process    as     also   reservation    for

Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes. In R.

Chitralekha (supra), this Court, in substance

took the view that the subject heads of Entry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_196">                                                                   196</span>


66 of List I did not encompass every aspect of

admission       process        in        higher        educational

institutions and opined that State legislative

competence stood retained to deal with certain

features connected with the admission process

also, unless the State’s action in that regard

directly encroached upon the subjects comprised

within    the   Union     List.          There    can       thus   be

certain    features      of    the       admission       procedure

over which the State can also have power to

make    stipulations.          In    a    more    recent       case,

<a href="/doc/130892581/" id="a_165">Yatinkumar Jasubhai Patel and Others vs. State

of Gujarat and Ors</a>. [(2019) 10 SCC 1], a Bench

of another Constitution Bench of this Court,

the case of        Kumari Chitra Ghosh &amp; Anr.(supra).

The dispute in this case was over reservations

made    in    respect     of    certain    categories    of

students for admission to the MBBS course in a

medical college under the Delhi University. 25

per    cent   of    the   seats   (excluding    the    seats

reserved for Government of India nominees) were

reserved      for    girl      students.       There    was,

however,      eight       stipulated       categories     of

students who were eligible for admission. These

categories included being residents of Delhi,

wards of central government servants posted in

Delhi, cultural scholars etc.

</p><p id="p_337">25.    The minimum percentage of marks which a

candidate seeking admission was to obtain in

the aggregate of compulsory subject was 55. The

appellants      obtained       62.5%   marks    and     were

domiciled in Delhi. But they could not obtain

students nominated by the Central Government

who got marks lower to what they had obtained.

</pre><p id="p_339">26. It was held in this judgment, on the aspect

of     classification     of    that    category       of

students:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_110">       “8. As laid down in Shri Ram

       S.R. Tendolkar &amp; Others, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_166">Article
       14</a> forbids class legislation; it
       does    not    forbid    reasonable
       classification. In order to pass
       the     test     of     permissible
       classification    two    conditions
       must be fulfilled- (i) that the
       classification    is   founded   on
       intelligible    differentia   which
       distinguishes persons or things
       that are grouped together from

others left out of the group and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_111">(ii) differentia must have a
rational relation to the object
sought to be achieved. The first
group of persons for whom seats
have been reserved are the sons
and daughters of residents of
Union    Territories     other    than
Delhi. These areas are well known
to be comparatively backward and
with the exception of Himachal
Pradesh they do not have any
Medical College of their own. It
was    necessary      that    persons
desirous    of   receiving    medical
education from these areas should
be provided some facility for
doing so. As regards the sons and
daughters of Central Government
servants     posted      in     Indian
Missions abroad it is equally
well known that due to exigencies
of their service these persons
are     faced     with      lot     of
difficulties in the matter of
education.      Apart     from     the
problems of language, it is not
easy or always possible to get
admission      into      institutions
imparting medical education in
foreign countries. The Cultural,
Colombo     Plan     and     Thailand
scholars are given admission in
medical    institutions     in    this
country by reason of reciprocal
arrangements of educational and
cultural nature. Regarding Jammu
and Kashmir Scholars it must be

remembered    that    the   problems
relating   to    them   are   of   a
peculiar nature and there do not
exist adequate arrangements for
medical education in the State
itself for its residents. The
classification in all these cases
is    based      on     intelligible
differentia which distinguished
them from the group to which the
appellants belong.

which bears the financial burden
of running the medical college.</p>
<p id="p_341">It is for it to lay down the
criteria for eligibility. From
the very nature of things it is
not    possible    to    throw   the
admission open to students from
all    over    the    country.   The
Government cannot be denied the
right to decide from what sources
the admission will be made. That
essentially is a question of
policy and depends inter alia on
an overall assessment and survey
of the requirements of residents
of   particular    territories   and
other categories of persons for
whom it is essential to provide
facilities for medical education.

the manner and method of making
the classification.”

This judgment was founded on the principle of

reasonable     classification          and        has    been

subsequently followed in other cases as well

where   certain    categories     of    candidates       have

been given benefits in the admission process

based on certain specified criteria.
</p>
<p id="p_343">27. The issue to be addressed now is as to

whether    Clause 9 of the 2000 Regulations is

relatable to Entry 66 of List I of Seventh

Schedule of the Constitution or as to whether

the source of power to make such Regulation,

particularly      in   relation        to    providing     a

separate     entry     channel         for        in-service

candidates     come    under    Entry        25     of   the

aforesaid   MCI   Regulations   or   not.   For   this

exercise, however, we shall have to analyse the

deal with two other aspects of dispute having

Constitutional     import   involved        in    this

character of the State quota, which we have so

far referred to as reservation. Clause 9 (4) or

Clause 9 (IV) as it stood prior to 5th April

2018 of the 2000 Regulations permit reservation

as per the applicable laws of the State or the

Union Territory. In the case of Dinesh Singh

Chauhan (supra), the three Judge Bench of this

Court opined that the reservation referred to

in the opening part of the said clause is akin

discrimination. But classifying a category of

candidates     for   such    distinct        or     separate

channel has been upheld consistently, provided

such categorisation is based on intelligible

differentia.    In fact, on the question of such

classification, it has been held in the case of

        the meaning of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_169">Article 14</a> of the
        Constitution, it is well settled
        that   the    classification   must
        satisfy the twin tests: (i) it
        must be founded on an intelligible
        differentia   which   distinguishes
        persons or things placed in a
        group from those left out or

        permissible to use territories or
        the nature of the objects or
        occupations or the like as the
        basis for classification. So long
        as there is a nexus between the

statistics as made available to us
by the learned Advocate-General
under instructions from Dr Ashok
Sharma,        Director         (Medical
Services), Madhya Pradesh, present
in the Court. The rural health
services (if it is an appropriate
expression)        need       to      be
strengthened. 229 community health

manned by specialists and block
medical    officers     who    must   be
postgraduates. There is nothing
wrong in the State Government
setting      apart       a      definite
percentage of educational seats at
postgraduation level consisting of
degree     and      diploma      courses
exclusively     for   the    in-service
candidates. To the extent of the
seats so set apart, there is a
separate and exclusive source of
entry or channel for admission. It
is   not   reservation.      In-service
candidates, and the candidates not
in   the   service     of   the    State
Government, are two classes based
on an intelligible differentia.</p>

         State Government. If there is any
         misapprehension,      the     same    is
         allayed by the State Government
         obtaining    a     bond     from    such
         candidates      as      a     condition

         another five years. Additionally,
         a bank guarantee of rupees three
         lakhs is required to be submitted
         along with the bond. There is,
         thus,    clearly      a     perceptible
         reasonable     nexus      between    the

candidates    and     the    other    for        open-category

candidates.    Provisions       for    these        two    entry

paths were not under challenge in that case.

The    constitutionality              of         institutional

preference in postgraduate courses in favour of

in-house candidates was found to be valid, on

the basis of reasonable classification in the

case of AIIMS (supra). The case of Yatin Kumar

Jasubhai Patel &amp; Ors. (supra) also is based on

similar reasoning.           In order to justify the

retention     of     such    source        of     entry        into

postgraduate       medical   degree        courses,       it    was

argued on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu and

State of West Bengal by Mr. Vaidyanathan and

Mr.   Giri,    for    the    former        and    Mr.     Rakesh

better qualified doctors to serve the remote

areas. This stand has been supported by Mr.

P.V.    Surendranath,        learned   Senior     Advocate

appearing for the West Bengal University of

Health Sciences. The same stand has been taken

by Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Advocate

for the State of Kerala and Mr. Rahul Chitnis,

learned Advocate for the State of Maharashtra.

The theme of argument on behalf of the in-

service      doctors   has   been   that   they   have    to

discharge arduous duties serving a large number

of patients across the respective States and it

is always not possible for them to academically

update to meet the theoretical standards set by

the    MCI    for   the   entrance     examination.      Mr.

Sanjay Hegde and Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned

Senior Advocates have appeared before us for

the petitioners in W.P. (C)No. 252 of 2018,

2018.     Learned      Senior     Advocates        for     these

petitioners as also the appellant in-service

doctors    in    the    appeals      arising      out    of   the

judgment of the High Court of Calcutta have

sought to justify their defence on the same

grounds.        On     the     aspect        of   legislative

competence, the rival arguments have already

been dealt with in our discussions earlier in

this    judgment.        We    are    satisfied       that    the

doctors in employment of the States and allied

sectors form a separate and distinct class and

for the purpose of admission in postgraduate

degree     courses      they    can     be    given      certain

elements of preference. Holding them to be a

distinct group fits in with overall objective

of having medical professionals with superior

qualification for tending to the needs of the

general public. Moreover, the 2000 Regulations

and also providing for 50 per cent reservation

in diploma courses indirectly recognise this

category of doctors as a separate class.                        But

do the provisions of 2000 Regulations permit

the States to provide quota for such in-service

candidates?

<p id="p_349">30. In   the     case       of     Modern       Dental    College

(supra), it has been explained the manner in

which    Entry       66     of     List     I    ought     to    be

interpreted      while      dealing       with    admission       to

postgraduate medical admission course. It has

been held in this judgment that the said entry

in List I is having a very specific and limited

scope.   It    has    also        been    held    in     the    said

decision      that        while    setting       standards        in

educational      institutions            for    higher    studies

would be in the exclusive domain of the Union,

that     might       not         include        conducting        of

examination etc. Regulating medical education

would come within Entry 25 of the List III

giving concurrent powers to both Union as well

as States. In the case of Modern Dental College

(supra), the rules for admission into medical

postgraduate      courses     framed       by     the   State

government were assailed.

<p id="p_350">31. Referring to the judgment of this Court in

the   case   of     Preeti   Srivastava         (supra),    the

Constitution Bench did not find any ground for

holding that the said judgment excluded the

role of States altogether from admissions.

</p><p id="p_351">32. Now, turning to the context in which we are

adjudicating the present set of proceedings, we

have to ascertain as to whether setting apart

specified percentage of seats for in-service

doctors in postgraduate medical degree courses

is    referable     to    matters     of    admissions      or

standards      of        education.        It     has      been

acknowledged in the decision of Modern Dental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_213">                                                            213</span>


College     (supra)      that   there    may    be   certain

overlapping    of     subjects    vis-à-vis      Entry      66,

List I and Entry 25, List III to the Seventh

Schedule of the Constitution of India. In our

opinion, the question of providing a separate

entry-path to in-service doctors may have some

effect on overall standard of medical education

at the                      postgraduate degree level

institutions, as the students who would gain

admission to such courses may not come purely

on the basis of a uniform order of merit. But

that is not the manner in which we ought to

interpret     the        expression      “standards”         in

institutions        of     higher        education.         The

Constitution    Bench      judgment      in    the   case   of

Modern Dental College (supra) has construed the

words     “coordination         and     determination        of

standards” to mean laying down the standards of

education. Analysis of Clause 9 of the 2000
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_214">                                                                   214</span>


Regulations        reveals       that     the        said    clause

provides a minimum entry standard in the form

of clearance of the NEET on obtaining minimum

of marks of 50 per cent by general category

candidates. Once these standards are laid down,

we     are   of    the     view     that        if     the       State

authorities provide an independent channel of

entry for in-service doctors in postgraduate

medical      degree        courses,       who        fulfil        the

aforesaid     minimum       standards,       as       the    latter

expression has been construed in the case of

Modern Dental College (supra), provisions to

that    effect     would    not    be   in      breach       of   the

constitutional          scheme.     The      impact         on     the

“standards”,       as      the    expression          is     to    be

construed in Entry 66 of the first list, would

be far too distant from admission norms framed

by the State authorities for such in-service

doctors.     The    separate      entry-channel             for    in-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_215">                                                       215</span>


service     doctors   would     be    integral   to    the

admission norms, relatable to the Entry 25 of

the Concurrent List. Such admission norms if

compatible with minimum standards laid down by

the MCI, would fall under the items specified

against the aforesaid entry of List III.

</p><p id="p_352">33. The question that arises next is whether

Clause 9 of the 2000 Regulations lay down the

procedure for admission in such a manner that

providing    a   separate     entry   channel    for   in-

service doctors even through the State merit

list   by   an   independent    statutory    instrument

would be contrary to the provisions of the 2000

Regulations or not. If that is the case, then

the    respective      State         legislations      and

Regulations would fall foul of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_173">Article 246</a> and

Additional     Solicitor     General   of    India

and by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Advocate

appearing for the MCI that the said Clause 9 is

a self-contained code and there is an implied

bar upon permitting a separate source of entry

for in-service doctors. Clause 9(4) of the 2000
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_219">                                                           219</span>


Regulations makes provisions for reservation of

seats in postgraduate courses, not making any

distinction between degree and diploma courses.

In Clause 9(8) thereof, or in Clause 9(VII) in

its earlier form, reservation of 50 per cent

seats in diploma courses has been prescribed.

Main stand of the MCI is that the degree course

is     a    full-fledged        three     years   course   and

clinical subjects in such course is one of the

most sought after by the students.                It is MCI’s

case       that    postgraduate         degrees   enable   the

students      to    pursue      super    speciality   courses

later on as well as become teachers in medical

institutes.          The   PG    diploma    course,   on   the

other hand, according to the MCI, is of greater

practical value for treating patients in remote

and difficult or rural areas of the country.

in-service candidates and direct candidates as

also interest of the States in ensuring quality

medical treatment to remote areas, while not

compromising      on   merit.     This    stand     has     been

supported by Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, learned Senior

Advocate representing private respondents from

open- category appearing in the appeals arising

out of the judgment of the Calcutta High Court.

The disadvantages spelt out by the in-service

doctors is of being out of touch with academic

developments because of their pressing duties

often in remote locations. These disadvantages

were considered by this Court in the case of

AIIMS    (supra),      and   it   was    recorded     in    that

judgment,    in     reference     to     the   case    of     K.

being     faced        by     in-service       doctors     can    be

overcome          by         awarding         incentive      marks

contemplated in proviso to sub-clause (4) of

Clause 9.         Even if we proceed on the basis that

Clause 9 is a self-contained code, as held in

interpretation having been approved in the case

of Dinesh Singh Chauhan (supra), in our view a

self-contained              code   can    cover     only     those

subjects which are contained in such code. This

is    not    an     exhaustive          code    covering     every

feature      of    admission       to    postgraduate       degree

courses in medical education. If the code does

not refer to certain matters, which do not have

impact on or dilute the main subject for which

is a shared field between the Union and the

States.         The    legislative       disability       of     the

States     would        occur     only     when     the        Union

legislation covers the same subject on which

State undertakes legislative exercise and the

State legislative instrument is found to be

repugnant to the latter.                 There also can be

vacant legislative zones within a code, and

such    vacant    zones     can    be    filled     up    by    the

instituted proceedings in the High Court at

Calcutta, it was submitted that if a statute

requires a thing to be done in a particular

manner, it must be done in that manner or not

at all as held in Nazir Ahmed vs. King Emperor

AIR   1936   PC   253.   Certain   other   authorities

reiterating the same dictum have been cited.

This principle, however, has become so well-

established in our jurisprudence that we do not

consider it necessary to specifically refer to

those authorities in this judgment. But having

regard to Clause 9(4) of the 2000 Regulations,

we do not think provision for reservation of

in-service doctors by the State from the State-

wise merit list published in pursuance of that

provision    would   result   in   deviation   from    a

mandatory statutory scheme. The aforesaid sub-

clause is required to be construed in the light

of the State’s power to make provisions over
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_225">                                                          225</span>


the admission norms, provided the candidates

fulfil the basic admission criteria contained

in the 2000 Regulations. Having regard to the

legal   and    factual    context   of    this   case     and

considering      the     fact   that     the     issue     of

legislative competence arises in respect of an

entry belonging to shared, and not exclusive

field of legislations, in our opinion the said

sub-clause cannot be interpreted            to mean that

the State is denuded of the power to make a

separate      channel    of   admission     to   the     said

courses for in-service doctors from the State

merit list. This is an issue of legislative

competence and the Nazir Ahmed dictum does not

come into conflict with the interpretation we

are giving to this clause. Application of that

principle      solely    on   the   basis   of    a    Union

legislation, without examining the scope of the

State’s legislative power in the given context,

would be contrary to the constitutional scheme

in having concurrent field of legislation. The

said sub-clause does not prescribe specific bar

on the State authorities in providing for such

reservation or such separate entry-channel. The

principle of implied exclusion also would not

apply here in our opinion. The principle of

implied exclusion is derived from the latin

dictum      “expressio      unius      est     exclusio

alterius”. There are authorities, which caution

the Courts against indiscriminate application

of   this   doctrine,     describing    it    to     be    a

“dangerous master” (<a href="/doc/1262371/" id="a_177">Mary Angel and Ors. vs.

</p><p id="p_367">36.       When a subject falls in a shared field

of legislation, there may be cases where the

dominant legislative body may not have had made

provisions          in    a    legislative        instrument       for

which it had power to do so. But in such a

situation the dominant legislative body cannot

prevent       the    secondary            legislative     body    from

making provisions in that regard. We would make

it    clear     here      that       we    are   using    the    terms

“dominant       legislative           body”      to   describe     the

Union    legislature           and        “secondary     legislative

body” to refer to the State legislature in the

context of the concurrent list only.                            We are

doing so because in case of repugnancy between

two    legislative            instruments        originating      from

the     Union       and       the     State      legislatures       in

relation to any entry therein, the former is to

prevail       as     per       the    constitutional         scheme.

Turning back to the aspect of occupied field,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_228">                                                       228</span>


if certain areas of legislative entry is left

void by the Union Legislature, these void areas

would come within the legislative power of the

secondary      legislative         body        as      the

constitutional entry gives both the legislative

bodies co-existing, power to legislate on such

subjects. Clause 9 of the 2000 Regulations is

no doubt a self-contained code. But as we have

already observed, it is not an exhaustive code

covering     all    aspects       of    admission       in

postgraduate medical degree courses.           The scope

of this code and extent of its operation has

been explained by this Court in the case of

Yatinkumar   Jasubhai     Patel    &amp;    Ors.      (supra).

Negation of power of the State cannot be a

matter of inference, or such negation cannot be

in anticipation that the Union Legislature may

make   provisions    in   future       in   the     vacant

legislative space. The authorities in support

Parliament,     the   Parliamentary     law     would

prevail. We do not find the 2000 Regulations so

overwhelming in its scope and extent that we

can proceed on the presumption that the entire

field   of   admission   to   postgraduate    medical

course stands covered by it. In the facts of

entry (i.e. Entry 11 of List II) was brought

to the Concurrent List by 42nd Amendment to the

and competence of the State.                          We also take

note    of    the       fact    that      reservation        for    in-

service      doctors       has       been    a        long   standing

practise          and     the       rationale          behind      such

reservation appears to be reasonable to us.

But we refrain from dilating on the necessity

of     maintaining         such      practise          as    in    this

judgment, we are primarily concerned with the

question of competence of State authorities in

making Rules providing for such reservation.

the other that of the State. The same was the

scheme of Clause 9(IV) in its erstwhile form.

The dispute in these proceedings, however, is

mainly       on    admission         norms       to     postgraduate

degree       courses.          If   the     State        authorities

from within the State’s own merit list, our

view    is    that     such    an   exercise       would     be

relatable      to    the    admission   process      and    the

same would not be in breach of any prohibition

flowing from the 2000 Regulations. This would

entail some form of variation of the merit

list of the State, but we do not find any

prohibition under the 2000 Regulations against

a State undertaking that exercise.                 Such step

undertaken by the State would be relatable to

the    State’s      legislative     power     derived      from

Entry    25    of     the    Concurrent     List    and     not

covered by the 2000 Regulations.                   We do not

find any repugnancy with the 2000 Regulations

distinct channel of entry.

through        Executive        Orders        of    the        State

Government. We are not to undertake a word to

word comparison of Clause 9 as it prevailed at

different points of time.                    What matters here

is that in its original or earlier version, no

provision for reservation or separate entry-

channel for in-service doctors has been shown

to       us    by     any       of     the    learned     counsel

appearing       for     the      parties.           The        State

Government       Orders       laid     down      such   distinct

source of entry. Interpretation of the same

clause    in    its     present       form     should     also    be

based on the same underlying reasoning.

Postgraduate          Medical        Education     Regulations,

of   in-service   doctors     for   admission    into

take benefit of such separate entry channel,

the aspiring in-service doctors must clear the

NEET Examination with the minimum prescribed

marks as stipulated in the 2000 Regulations.

expressed by the Bench of three Hon’ble Judges

of this Court in the case of the <a href="/doc/197628755/" id="a_183">State of

Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors. vs. Dinesh Singh Chauhan</a>

[(2016) 9 SCC 749] to the extent it has been

held in the said decision that reservation for

the said category of in-service doctors by the

State would be contrary to the provisions of

the correct view under the Constitution. The

reference is answered accordingly.
