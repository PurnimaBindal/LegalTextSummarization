                              the petitioner primarily is, that it provided services to the respondents 2
                              to 4 of the sports training and coaching assignment called &quot;fitness
                              365&quot; meant for the students studying in both the schools. It is the case
                              of the petitioner that several rounds of negotiation took place between
                              the petitioner and the respondent Nos.2 to 4, for conducting the
                              training / coaching assignment of the petitioner. Pursuant thereto, the
                              petitioner had shared a copy of the proposal-cum-agreement of the
                              &quot;fitness 365&quot; during the meeting on March 16, 2019, which according
                              to the petitioner was orally accepted by the respondent Nos. 2 to 4. It
                              was only on the verbal assurance of the said respondents, the petitioner
                              deployed Training team/persons for training / coaching in the

                              agreement said to have been shared by the petitioner with the
                              respondent Nos.2 to 4 would bind the petitioner and the respondents
                              for referring the dispute with regard to non-payment of the invoices to
                              an Arbitrator. The answer to the same has to be „No‟ for more than
                              one reason; firstly the said proposal-cum-agreement has not been
                              signed / executed by the parties. It was only a copy of the proposal-

</p><p id="p_39">                              31.     I have seen the judgment so relied upon by the counsel for the
                              petitioner in the above case; the facts are that the appellant therein was
                              carrying on business in Mumbai inter alia of import and export of
                              commodities and the respondent company having its office at
                              Singapore. On August 20, 2008, the appellant through the broker B.B.
                              Rubber Pvt. Ltd. confirmed the order of purchase of natural rubber.
                              The respondent issued a sales contract at US $2880 per metric tonne,
                              The said sales contract, signed by the representative of the respondent,

                              provided the governing terms as &quot;Singapore Commodity Exchange&quot;.
                              The name of the appellant was described as buyer, who issued
                              Purchase Order. Vide the purchase order the appellant placed orders on
                              the terms and conditions set out therein. The appellant thereafter
                              requested to change the payment term in the said sales contract to be
                              10% advance and 90% by DP. This request for amendment was
                              accepted by the respondent and accordingly it issued invoice for the
                              10% advance payment. It is the case of the respondent that later the
                              invoice was split into two invoices of 100 MT each for which 10% of
                              contract value was US $28,800 which accordingly shipped to Nhava
                              Sheva and the original documents of shipments were couriered to the
                              appellant&#x27;s bank. The dispute arose between the parties in respect of
                              this second sales contract.
</p><p id="p_40">                              32.     The appellant contended that the Singapore Commodity
                              Exchange or its committee did not have the jurisdiction. It was
                              submitted that the jurisdiction shall be in Mumbai. The Arbitral
                              Tribunal made award dated December 18, 2009 directing the appellant
                              to pay to the respondent a sum of US $7,16,283 and also to bear
                              expenses of the said arbitration amounting to SGD 20330. The Arbitral
                              Tribunal, rejected the counterclaim made by the appellant and recorded
                              a finding that Singapore Commodity Exchange has jurisdiction. The
                              appellant did not challenge the award. It filed a suit against the
                              respondent in the High Court inter-alia praying for damages.
</p><p id="p_41">                              33.     During the pendency of the suit, the respondent filed an

                              Single Judge upheld the award and held that the same is enforceable.

                              The High Court also directed the appellant to produce on oath,
                              complete inventory of its assets and properties as prayed for in the
                              execution petition. The plea before the Supreme Court was in the
                              absence of valid arbitration agreement between the parties as
                              contemplated under <a href="/doc/1846895/" id="a_18">Section 7</a> of the Act; Singapore Commodity
                              Exchange had no jurisdiction to appoint any arbitrator on behalf of the
                              appellant or to proceed with the arbitration. In other words,
                              proceedings before the Singapore Commodity Exchange were without
                              jurisdiction and cannot bind the appellant. The plea on behalf of the
                              appellant was that the sale contract issued by the respondent containing
                              and referring the arbitration to Singapore Commodity Exchange was
                              not signed and returned by the appellant. On the contrary, the purchase
                              order sent by the respondent contains commercial terms and conditions
                              including exclusive jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court. The said
                              purchase order was accepted by the respondent and was concluded. It
                              was further contended that the High Court failed to appreciate the case
                              of appellant and grossly erred in holding that the appellant did not raise
                              jurisdiction in the counter claim filed by it. On the other hand, it was
                              contended by the respondent that sales contract is a concluded contract
                              and the appellant acted on the sales contract and issued a supply order
                              to the respondent. The appellant thereafter requested to change the
                              terms of payment mentioned in the sales contract to be 10% advance
                              by TT and 90% by DP. The Supreme Court has held that there cannot
                              be any dispute with regard to settled position of law that agreement if
                              not signed by the parties can be spelt out from correspondence
                              exchanged between the parties. However, it is the duty of the Court to

                              whether there was meeting of mind between the parties which could
                              create a binding contract between them. For this purpose, it is
                              necessary for the Court to find out from the correspondence as to
                              whether the parties were ad idem to the terms of contract.
</p><p id="p_43">                              34.     The Supreme Court in the said case was clearly of the view
                              that the respondent issued a sales contract for supply of goods
                              incorporating various terms including hundred per cent payment
                              against letter of credit and also providing the governing terms as
                              &quot;Singapore Commodity Exchange&quot;. Though the appellant had issued
                              purchase order on terms and conditions set out therein but the appellant
                              requested the respondent to change the payment terms mentioned in
                              the sales contract. Hence, the Court was of the view that it can safely
                              be inferred that there had been a meeting of mind between the parties
                              and they were ad idem to the terms of sales contract which contained
                              the forum of dispute resolution at Singapore Commodity Exchange. It
                              was under these circumstances, in paragraph 21 of the judgment in the
                              case of Govind Rubber Ltd (Supra), the court has held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                      &quot;21. From the documents available on record and also
                                      referred to in the impugned order, it is evident that at the
                                      request of the appellant, the invoice was split into two invoices
                                      and in the said letter of request reference was made to the
                                      sales contract. The respondent proceeded to supply the goods
                                      on the terms contained in the sales contract. The intention of

                                      referred to Singapore Commodity Exchange for arbitration,
                                      the appellant in response to the notice made a counterclaim
                                      before the Arbitral Tribunal contending that the appellant had
                                      incurred huge loss in view of the failure on the part of the
                                      respondent to supply the goods in time. By making a
                                      counterclaim, the appellant indeed submitted to the
                                      jurisdiction of the arbitrator.&quot;

                                      The said judgment is clearly distinguishable on facts in as
                              much as in the case in hand there is no communication produced by the
                              respondent from which it can be inferred that the parties were at ad
                              idem on the arbitration agreement.
</blockquote><p id="p_44">                              35.     In fact in the present case, all correspondence was one way
                              from the petitioner‟s side. Even the whatsapp message on which
                              reliance has been placed, was exclusively with regard to the fee
                              payment and not on the arbitration agreement. Even the invoices raised
                              by the petitioner, refers to an agreement dated April 01, 2019 and not
                              March 16, 2019. That apart, the reference to the arbitration agreement
                              was made for the first time with the invocation notice dated January
                              29, 2020.    The invocation notice has not been replied to by the
                              respondents. Hence, in the absence of any communication it is difficult
                              to infer that the parties were at ad idem with regard to settlement of
                              dispute, if any, through the process of an arbitration. Hence, this
                              judgment will not help the case of the petitioner.

                              Saha who was appointed as a distributor of Servo Brand Lubricants of
                              Indian Oil Corporation Limited. The parties entered into an agreement
                              and in terms of which, the petitioner took delivery of such lubricants
                              from the respondent. The petitioner used to take lubricants on credit
                              facility. It is alleged that the lube distributorship agreement contained
                              an arbitration clause requiring the parties to refer their disputes and
                              differences to the sole arbitration of the Director (Marketing) of Indian

                              to Act as the Arbitrator. Invoking the said arbitration clause, the said
                              corporation referred the disputes and differences between the parties to
                              the arbitration of the Director (Marketing) of the Indian Oil
                              Corporation Limited. The said Director nominated Subrata Ghosh, a
                              Deputy General Manager of the said Corporation, as the sole arbitrator.
                              The petitioner appeared before the Arbitrator and filed an application

                              no valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The petitioner,
                              therefore, requested the arbitrator to rule on his jurisdiction and to drop

                              out from the conduct of the parties. The petitioner admittedly signed
                              the lube distributorship agreement accepting all its terms and
                              conditions. The petitioner in furtherance to the said agreement took
                              delivery of lubricants from the said Corporation. When he has
                              committed defaults, under clause 39 of the agreement, the disputes and
                              differences between the parties have been referred to arbitration. The
                              Court held it is not open to the petitioner, to deny the existence of a
                              valid arbitration agreement.
</p><p id="p_48">                              39.     In the present case, as stated above, none of the parties have
                              signed the agreement referred to by the petitioner.      None of the
                              whatsapp messages or the invoices or communications referred to
                              proposal-cum-agreement dated March 16, 2019; though in one of the
                              whatsapp messages reference is made to the agreement but it is not
                              clear whether the reference is to the proposal-cum-agreement on which
                              reliance has been placed dated March 19, 2019. Expressly a reference
                              to the agreement &quot;fitness 365&quot; proposal-cum-agreement is made in the
                              letter dated January 29, 2020 (document 28) to which admittedly no
                              response was sent by the respondent Nos.2 to 4.
</p><p id="p_49">                              40.     In fact, in the notice dated December 21, 2019, no reference
                              has been made to the proposal-cum-agreement dated March 16, 2019,
                              as such the very existence of the agreement is doubtful. To draw an
                              inference or for showing meeting of minds on the arbitration
                              agreement, a mere exchange of communication shall not suffice. Facts
                              which depict meeting of minds or the parties are at ad idem are
                              relevant, which are missing in this case. Therefore, the judgment in
                              the case of Babaji Automotive (Supra) has no applicability in the facts

</p><p id="p_50">                              41.     Similarly, the counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the
                              judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_24">Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Great
                              Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>., (2008) 1 SCC 503 wherein, it is held that
                              the agreement can be accepted in silence and/or conduct and the same
                              can be inferred under certain circumstances when the offeree&#x27;s silence,
                              coupled with his conduct, takes the form of a positive act, may
                              constitute an acceptance, is also not borne out from the facts of this
                              case. In fact, the very reliance placed by the petitioner on this judgment
                              would show that the petitioner accepted the fact that the respondent
                              had remained silent on the proposal-cum-agreement dated March 16,
                              2019. No positive act of the respondent has been highlighted by the
                              petitioner to show acceptance of the terms of the agreement. Hence,
                              this judgment shall not help the case of the petitioner.

                              arbitration agreement between the parties. The court further examined
                              the question of &quot;existence&quot; by stating that, a reasonable and just
                              interpretation of existence requires understanding the context, purpose
                              and relevant legal norms applicable for a binding and enforceable
                              arbitration agreement. An agreement evidenced in writing has no
                              meaning unless parties can be compelled to adhere and abide by the
                              terms. A party cannot sue and claim rights based on an unenforceable
                              document. Thus, there are good reasons to hold that an arbitration
                              agreement exists only when it is valid and legal. &quot;Existence&quot; of an
                              arbitration agreement means an arbitration agreement that meets and
                              satisfies the statutory requirements of both the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_33">Arbitration Act</a> and the
                              <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_34">Contract Act</a> and when it is enforceable in law.
</p><p id="p_53">                              44.     As I have held, there is no agreement between the parties, the
                              present petition is not maintainable and the prayer made cannot be
                              granted. The same is dismissed. No costs.
