      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANT NATH

JAYANT NATH, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1.    The present suit is filed by the plaintiff seeking a decree of permanent
injunction to restrain the defendant from manufacturing, selling, offering for
sale, advertising, etc. the medicinal products or other related goods under the
trade mark „HEPROTEC‟ or any mark deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟
trade mark „HEPITEC‟ and for other connected reliefs.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    IA No.13265/2011 is an application filed under Order 39 Rules 1 and
2 CPC by the plaintiff seeking interim injunction to restrain the defendant
etc. from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale or dealing in medicinal
products or other related products under the trade mark „HEPROTEC‟ or
any mark deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟ trade mark „HEPITEC‟.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    The matter came up for hearing on 23.08.2011 when this court passed
ex parte injunction restraining the defendant, its directors, principals,
officers, agents, employees and representatives from manufacturing, selling
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                Page 1 of 21</span>
 and advertising directly or indirectly medicinal products under the trade
mark „HEPROTEC‟. The defendant has now filed IA No. 14230/2011
under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC for vacation of the stay. The two applications IA
No.13265/2011 and IA No.14230/2011 are being disposed of together.
</p><p id="p_4">4.    It is the case of the plaintiffs that plaintiff No. 1 is a company
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and plaintiff No.2 is a
company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956. The plaintiffs are
said to be the members of GlaxoSmithKline Group of Companies and
engaged in worldwide business of manufacturing and marketing of a wide
range of pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations and healthcare products
of the highest quality. The word „HEPITEC‟ is said to have been adopted
and conceived by the plaintiffs in and around the year 1998. It is stated that
the word „HEPITEC‟ is an invented word having no dictionary meaning and
thus having the highest degree of distinctiveness, connoting the goods of the
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs/their subsidiaries/affiliated companies have
obtained registration of the said mark „HEPITEC‟ in several countries
including India. In India, the said mark was registered under No. 802647 in
Class 5 since 18.05.1998 in respect of pharmaceutical preparations and
substances. Plaintiff No. 1-Glaxo Group Limited is said to be the proprietor
of the mark. The registration is still subsisting and in force. The said mark is
in the use since 2000 for treatment of Hepatitis. It is stated that the mark has
now become a well known pharmaceutical product in India. The excellent
quality and proven efficacy of the medicine has it is averred made
„HEPITEC‟ highly popular and the medicine has acquired a high level of
reputation and goodwill in India. The plaintiffs are identified with the said
trade mark „HEPITEC‟. The said medicinal preparations are sold and
distributed in India by plaintiff No.2. The sales figures for the period 2006

 and 2010 for India have been reproduced and are stated to be as follows:-
</p><pre id="pre_2">                     Year              Revenue in US Dollars
                     2006              120,320
                     2007              88,300
                     2008              65,280
                     2009              76,800
                     2010              72,960

</pre><p id="p_5">5.    It is stated that in July 2010 the plaintiffs became aware of the
defendant‟s mark „HEPROTEC‟ which was advertised in the Trademarks
Journal No.1443 dated 01.07.2010. The plaintiff has filed a notice of
opposition against the defendant‟s application. It is further stated that cease
and desist letter dated 12.10.2010 was served on the defendant requesting it
to withdraw its application for the mark „HEPROTEC‟ as the mark was
deceptively and confusingly similar to the plaintiffs‟ mark „HEPITEC‟.
However, it is stated that the defendant responded to the same by raising
frivolous contentions and refused to settle the matter amicably. It is further
stated that enquires have revealed to the plaintiffs that the defendant is using
the medicine „HEPROTEC‟ for treatment of liver related ailments. Hence, it
is averred that the defendant‟s adoption of the mark is clearly identical and
is an attempt to take advantage of the reputation and market position of the
plaintiffs. It is urged that the defendant‟s bad faith in adoption of a
deceptively similar mark is evident from various facts including the
following:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "a) The Plaintiffs‟ product HEPITEC is well known in this
      category;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      b)     The marks HEPITEC and HEPROTEC are phonetically,
      structurally and visually similar to cause confusion and
      deception among the trade and public;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      c)     Both the products are meant for treatment of liver related
      ailments
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      d)     The trade channels and target consumers of both products
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                 Page 3 of 21</span>
        are the same."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">6.     Hence, it is stated that in view of the above deception, not only the
consumers but members of the trade are likely to be confused or misled
while dealing with the defendant on account of the deceptive similarities in
the trade mark mischievously adopted by the defendant. Hence the act of the
defendant is dishonest and mala fide and can lead to disastrous
consequences whereby medicines bearing the impugned mark of the
defendant can be mistakenly administered under a wrong impression of it
being some other product. Hence the present suit and application have been
filed by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_7">7.     The defendant has strongly denied the case as set up by the plaintiffs.
It is urged that trade rivalry between them is the main cause for the present
litigation. It is stated that the defendant since it was incorporated in 1997 has
been one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in India and has
in 14 years established an enviable reputation and trade record. It is stated
that „HEPROTEC‟ the mark of the defendant is neither identical nor
deceptively similar to the mark „HEPITEC‟ of the plaintiffs. It is urged that
comparison of the two marks would show that there is not even an iota of
overall phonetic or visual or structure resemblance or similarity between the
two marks of the plaintiffs or defendant.
</p><p id="p_8">8.     It is further urged that the impugned mark „HEPROTEC‟ does not
infringe or violate the common law or statutory rights of the plaintiffs
inasmuch as there are various differentiating factors between the nature of
the products sold under the trade marks of the plaintiffs and that of the
defendant. The distinction between the marks and products of the defendant
and that of the plaintiffs are stated to be as follows:-

</pre><p id="p_9">9.    It is further stated that the mark „HEPITEC‟ of the plaintiffs is
prominently derived from the word „Hepatic‟ or „Hepato‟, which is a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                      Page 5 of 21</span>
 medical term for liver and is derived from the Greek word „Hepar‟. The
medicine of the plaintiffs contains a drug which is used to cure patients
suffering from Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. Hence, the word „hep‟ is used
which is taken from the „Hepatitis‟. Thus it is stated that the prefix „Hep‟ is
generic and cannot be monopolized by any one trader.
</p><p id="p_10">10.   It is further stated that the word „HEPROTEC‟ of the defendant is
coined by tracing the first three letters of the word „HEPatic‟ (medical term
for liver) and the suffix has been coined by telescoping three letters of the
house mark of the defendant „BioTECh‟ and since adoption of this mark the
defendant has been extensively and continuously using it with respect to the
pharmaceutical goods.
</p><p id="p_11">11.   It is further stated that since the adoption of the said mark
„HEPROTEC‟, the defendant sold the products for value of ` 21 lacs. The
turnover for the year 2009-2010 is stated to be `43,924/-, for the year 2010-
2011 sales were `12,05,812/- and for the year 2011-2012 (upto July 2011)
the turnover was `4,56,325/-. It is further stated that the said mark has
prominently featured in print and electronic media including medical
journals, trade journals, etc. The defendant has expended a great amount of
money, time and effort to promote and advertise their said mark
„HEPROTEC‟. The defendant has filed an application for registration of the
said trade mark on 06.04.2009 for medicinal and pharmaceutical
preparations which is now being frivolously opposed by the plaintiffs.
Hence considering the totality of circumstances, it is urged that there can be
no possibility of an unwary consumer of average intelligence being misled
or deceived to buy the defendant‟s product instead of the plaintiffs‟ product.
</p><p id="p_12">12.   It is further stated that the plaintiffs are guilty of gross delay and
latches and have thus waived off any right to object to the use by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                Page 6 of 21</span>
 defendant of their trade mark „HEPROTEC‟. It is stated that the plaintiffs
have also acquiesced to the defendant‟s use of the trade mark „HEPROTEC‟
which is undisturbed since its adoption in 2009. Further the plaintiffs sent a
cease and desist notice on 12.10.2010 to which a reply was sent by the
defendant on 22.10.2010. Despite that the plaintiffs have taken 10 months to
approach this court. Hence it is stated that on account of delay itself the
plaintiffs are not entitled to any protection from this court. Hence it is urged
that the present suit be dismissed and the interim order granted in favour of
the plaintiff be vacated.
</p><p id="p_13">13.     I have heard the submission of learned counsel for the parties.
Learned counsel for the plaintiff has stressed that the defendant has copied
the essential features of the trademark and the same is likely to cause
confusion amongst the consumers. The trademark 'HEPROTEC' is closely
identified with that of the plaintiff. The trademark was registered in 1998
and has been in continuous use since 2000. It is stressed that the defendant
is a much later entrant and was fully aware about the registered trademark of
the plaintiff. The learned counsel has placed on record a compilation of
judgments containing fifteen judgments to support its case. It may not be
necessary to refer each of those judgments. I will, however, rely on some of
them.
</p><p id="p_14">14.     Learned counsel for the defendant has stressed that there is no visual,
phonetic or other similarities between the two trademarks and hence there is
no violation of the trademark of the plaintiff. He has also stressed that the
circumstances as elaborated in the written statement distinguish the two
products and ensure that there is no likelihood of any confusion being
created amongst the consumers. Learned counsel for the defendant stressed
and claimed that there is a huge delay on the part of the plaintiff to approach

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                 Page 7 of 21</span>
 for relief and hence the relief for injunction ought to be declined. It is stated
that the defendant has adopted the trade mark „HEPROTEC‟ since 2009. On
10.12.2010 the plaintiff sent a cease and desist notice which was replied to
in October 2010. Despite this position the plaintiffs have taken 10 months‟
time to approach this Court for relief. On account of this delay it is stated
that the plaintiffs are not entitled to protection. The submissions in the
written statement have been reiterated.
</p><p id="p_15">15.   Learned counsel for the defendant has relied upon the judgment of the
Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_2">Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. vs. The
Zamindara Engineering Co</a>., 1969 (2) SCC 727 where the Court held that
the defendant may be using the plaintiff‟s mark but the get up of the
defendant‟s good may be so different from the get up of the plaintiff‟s goods
and the prices may also be so different that there would be no probability of
deception to the public. He has also relied on judgment of the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_3">Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs. Cadila
Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>., 2001 (5) SCC 73. In that case the disputes pertained
to use of the trademark „FALCITAB‟ by the respondent as against the
trademark of „FALCIGO‟ of the petitioner. In paragraph 6 the defence of
the respondent was noted as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "6. The respondent company stated in the defence that the word
      "Falci", which is the prefix of the mark, is taken from the name
      of the disease 'Falcipharum Malaria' and it is a common
      practice in pharmaceutical trade to use part of the word of the
      disease as a trade mark to indicate to the doctors and chemists
      that a particular product/drug is meant for a particular disease.
      It was also the case of the respondent that admittedly the two
      products in question were Schedule "L" drugs which can be
      sold only to the hospitals and clinics with the result that there
      could not even be a remote chance of confusion and deception.
      It may here be noticed that Schedule "H" drugs are those which
      can be sold by the chemist only on the prescription of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                  Page 8 of 21</span>
         Doctor but Schedule "L" drugs are not sold across the counter
        but are sold only to the hospitals and clinics."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">16.     The Courts below did not grant injunction to the petitioner. The
Supreme Court also did not grant injunction to the petitioner pointing out
that there was a possibility of evidence being required on the merits of the
case.
</p><p id="p_17">17.     Reliance is also placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/769115/" id="a_4">Kalindi Medicure Pvt. Ltd.vs. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Anr</a>.
2007(34) PTC 18 where this court held that in pharmaceutical trade one
finds names of various drugs almost similar to each other having common
prefix or suffix for the reason the drug conveys what salt it is a derivative of.
This Court further held that the distinction between the two medicine was
that one was an anti platelet drug, the other was a critical care medicine used
in acute coronary syndrome. The price difference was also huge. One drug
was sold as pills while the other was sold as syringe. In the circumstances
no stay was granted to the plaintiff. Reliance is also placed on <a href="/doc/1669937/" id="a_5">Palakurthu
Laxmi Ganapathi Rao and Gundu Subhadramma vs. Manisha Video
Vision</a> 2007 (34) PTC 33 (NULL) where the Andhra Pradesh High Court
held that there is delay coupled with other facts and circumstances of the
case including material difference in the packaging price and form of the
drug. In this background the Court held that there are sufficient grounds to
deny ad interim injunction to the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_18">18.     Having heard learned counsel for the parties the first issue for the
purpose of deciding the present application would be as to whether prima
facie it can be said that the defendant is guilty of violating the registered
trademark of the plaintiff 'HEPITEC'. In this context, reference may be had
to <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_6">Section 29(1)</a> of the The Trade Marks Act, 1999 which reads as follows:-
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                 Page 9 of 21</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "29. Infringement of registered trade marks.-(1) A registered
       trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered
       proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in
       the course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or
       deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or
       services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and in
       such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken
       as being used as a trade mark."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">19.    Hence, can it be said that the impugned mark being used by the
defendant is identical with or deceptively similar to the registered trademark
of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_20">20.    In the above context, reference may be had to the judgment of the
Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_7">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma
vs. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>, AIR 1965 SC 980 paragraph
29 of the said judgment reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "29.When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is
       claimed to infringe the plaintiff‟s mark is shown to be "in the
       course of trade", the question whether there has been an
       infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two marks.
       Where the two marks are identical no further questions arise;
       for then the infringement is made out. When the two marks are
       not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark
       used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff‟s
       registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion
       and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered
       (Vide<a href="/doc/1165318/" id="a_8"> s. 21</a>). A point has sometimes been raised as to whether
       the words "or cause confusion" introduce any element which is
       not already covered by the words "likely to deceive" and it has
       sometimes been answered by saying that it is merely an
       extension of the earlier test and does not add very materially to
       the concept indicated by the earlier words "likely to deceive".
       But this apart, as the question arises in an action for
       infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that
       the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of trade in
       the goods in respect of which his mark is registered, is
       deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be ascertained by a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                Page 10 of 21</span>
       comparison of the two marks-the degree of resemblance which
      is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of
      definition by laying down objective standards. The persons who
      would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods
      and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject
      of consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in
      the basic idea represented by the plaintiff‟s mark. The purpose
      of the comparison is for determining whether the essential
      features of the plaintiff‟s trade mark are to be found in that used
      by the defendant. The identification of the essential features of
      the mark is in essence a question of fact and depends on the
      judgment of the Court based on the evidence led before it as
      regards the usage of the trade. It should, however, be borne in
      mind that the object of the enquiry in ultimate analysis is
      whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is
      deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the
      plaintiff."

<p id="p_21">21.   Similarly, this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/197142526/" id="a_9">Bihar Tubes Ltd v. Garg Ispat
Ltd</a>. 166 (2010) DLT 109, in para 14.2 held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "14.2 Therefore, in order to discern whether the mark is
       confusingly or deceptively similar with respect to which
       rights are claimed by the registered owner; the apposite test is
       that, in which, the broad essential features are to be
       construed-when one compares the infringing mark with the
       registered mark. In doing so, the stress ought to be on the
       "overall similarity" and not on the differences in the marks.
       The "overall similarity" test ought to be one, which should
       lead to a conclusion that it would mislead a person usually
       dealing with the goods in issue, to accept the goods of the
       infringer, as those manufactured by the proprietor of the
       registered mark. The "ordinary purchaser is not expected to
       be gifted with the powers of observations of Sherlock
       Homes". <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_10">See Parle Products (P) Ltd v. J.P. and Co.,

</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">22.   Hence what is to be seen is as to whether prima facie the impugned
trade mark is identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff‟s
registered trade mark 'HEPITEC'. The impugned trademark is 'HEPROTEC'.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                 Page 11 of 21</span>
<p id="p_23"> In my view the two words are phonetically and structurally similar. The
basic idea represented by the plaintiff‟s mark has been slavishly copied by
the defendant. The defendant has copied almost the entire mark of the
plaintiff except deleting the word „I‟ and instead adding „RO‟ in the middle.
The prefix and suffix are exactly identical i.e. HEP--TEC. The essential
features have been copied.       It is clear that the impugned trademark
'HEPROTEC' is deceptively similar to the registered trademark of the
plaintiff 'HEPITEC'. The test as laid down in the case of <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_11">Kaviraj Pandit
Durga Dutt Sharma vs. N.P.Laboratories</a> (supra) is clearly satisfied in the
present case.
</p><p id="p_24">23.   The defence taken by the defendant would prima facie be of no help
to the defendant.
</p><p id="p_25">24.   However, for completeness of the order it would be necessary to look
into the merits of the defence set up by the defendant.
</p><p id="p_26">25.   The first submission of the defendant is of course that there is no
visual or phonetic similarity between the two marks. I have already rejected
the said submissions.
</p><p id="p_27">26.   The second submission of the defendant is that there are striking
differences between the two marks and the products of the parties and hence
there can be no confusion whatsoever. It is urged that there is a vast
difference in the nature of the pharmaceutical products sold by the plaintiff
and the defendant including major striking differences in the nature of the
product which are crucial and vital for determining whether confusion will
be caused amongst the consumers. The drug of the defendant is sold in
injectable solutions in ampoules of 10 ml. each. The price of one ampoule is
`219/-. The drug is also sold in strips of tablets. The price of one strip
having 10 tablets is `78.50. The drug of the defendant under the mark

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                              Page 12 of 21</span>
 „HEPROTEC‟ is prescribed by doctors to patients suffering from liver
related ailments other than hepatitis. The drug of the plaintiff „HEPITEC‟ is
a schedule „H‟ drug and thus is prescribed by a doctor and can be dispensed
with by a qualified druggist/chemist only. The said drug is prescribed to
patients diagnosed with HIV-I, HIV-2 or hepatitis B virus. This is an anti
viral medicine. The price of a strip of 14 tablets is `565/-. On the other
hand, the drug of the defendant is not anti viral. Hence, it is urged that given
this basic background, there is no likelihood of any confusion to the one who
would go to purchase the drug „HEPITEC‟ or „HEPROTEC‟.
</p><p id="p_28">27.   The above contentions are akin to the contentions which were rejected
by this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/15654482/" id="a_12">Novartis AG vs Crest Pharma Pvt. Ltd</a>. 2009
(41) PTC 57 (Del) this Court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "21. The second contention of the defendant is that the
      plaintiff's drug is prescribed for urinary respiratory track
      infection and acute otitis media whereas the defendant's product
      being an antibiotic is prescribed mostly for post operative cases
      and the ingredients of the two products are also different and
      used for different purposes of disease. The defendant has also
      contended that the plaintiff's product is used in tablet and oral
      suspension form whereas the defendant's product is only
      available in injection form, therefore, there is no confusion and
      deception between the two products in question.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      22. I do not accept the submission of the learned Counsel for
      the defendant as I feel that it is more dangerous if the
      pharmaceuticals products bearing the same mark is used for
      different purposes for the same ailment or even otherwise. I
      also do not accept the contention of the defendant's counsel that
      there would be no confusion if the product contain different
      ingredients/different salt. In my opinion, it is more dangerous
      and harmful in the trade if the same trade mark is used for
      different ailments."

 paragraph 29 and 33 held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      "29. It may here be noticed that Schedule "H" drugs are those

      but are sold only to the hospitals and clinics. Nevertheless, it is
      not un-common that because of lack of competence or
      otherwise, mistakes can arise specially where the trade marks
      are deceptively similar. In Blansett Pharmaceuticals Co. Vs.
      Carmick Laboratories Inc. 25 USPQ 2nd, 1473 (TTAB
      1993), it was held as under:

      stated:.." The products of the parties are medicinal and
      applicant's product is contraindicated for the disease for which
      opposer's product is indicated. It is apparent that confusion or
      mistake in filling a prescription for either product could
      produce harmful effects. Under such circumstances, it is
      necessary for obvious reasons, to avoid confusion or mistake in
      the dispensing of the pharmaceuticals."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      ....
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      33. It was further submitted on behalf of the appellant that
      although the possibility of confusion in a drug being sold across
      the counter may be higher, the fact that a drug is sold under
      prescription or only to physicians cannot by itself be considered
      a sufficient protection against confusion. The physicians and
      pharmacists are trained people yet they are not infallible and in
      medicines, there can be no provisions for mistake since even a
      possibility of mistake may prove to be fatal."

Court in the case of <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_14">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma vs.
N.P.Laboratories</a> (supra) where in paragraph 28 this Court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      28........In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
      doubt, make out that use of the defendant's mark is likely to
      deceive, but were the similarity between the plaintiff's and the
      defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or
      otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an
      imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the
      plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the
      essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
      adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and
      other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which
      he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or
      indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the
      registered proprietor of the make would be immaterial; whereas
      in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if
      he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his
      goods from those of the plaintiff."

<p id="p_31">Hence, the features that have been elaborated by the defendant to claim that
there are elaborate features to distinguish the products of the parties will not
be of any help to the defendant.
</p><p id="p_32">30.   The next submission of learned counsel for the defendant was that the
prefix „HEP‟ and suffix „TEC‟ are common to the trade. It is urged that
perusal of the search report obtained from the records of the Registrar of
Trade Marks show that it is common for companies to have trademarks
starting with letters „HEP‟ and ending with „TEC‟. It is urged that they have
approximately 582 marks in class 5 for medicinal and pharmaceutical
preparations amongst the trademarks which are registered and defined in
Trademark Journal. Hence, it is urged that the word „HEP‟ is publici juris,
generic and descriptive and common to the trade.

      (51) PTC 585 (Del) is a complete answer to the above
      argument of the learned senior counsel for the defendant. That
      was a case in which the defence taken by the defendant was
      about non-use of prefix PANTO with or without combination.
      This Court stated that law in this regard was quite settled and
      relied upon several judgments. Relevant portion of the same
      reads as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">        "b. In 1989 (7) PTC 14, Express Bottlers Services Pvt. Ltd.
        Vs. Pepsi Inc. &amp; Others, it was held as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">        ...To establish the plea of common use, the use by other
        persons should be shown to be substantial. In the present case,
        there is no evidence regarding the extent of the trade carried
        on by the alleged infringers or their respective position in the
        trade. If the proprietor of the mark is expected to pursue each
        and every insignificant infringer to save his mark, the business
        will come to a standstill. Because there may be occasion when
        the malicious persons, just to harass the proprietor may use his
        mark by way of pinpricks... The mere use of the name is
        irrelevant because a registered proprietor is not expected to go
        on filing suits or proceedings against infringers who are of no
        consequence... Mere delay in taking action against the
        infringers is not sufficient to hold that the registered proprietor
        has lost the mark intentionally unless it is positively proved
        that delay was due to intentional abandonment of the right
        over the registered mark. This Court is inclined to accept the
        submissions of the respondent No. 1 on this point... The
        respondent No. 1 did not lose its mark by not proceeding
        against insignificant infringers...

         run after every infringer and thereby remain involved in
        litigation at the cost of their business time. If the impugned
        infringement is too trivial or insignificant and is not capable of
        harming their business interests, they may overlook and ignore
        petty violations till they assume alarming proportions. If a
        road side Dhaba puts up a board of "Taj Hotel", the owners of
        Taj Group are not expected to swing into action and raise
        objections forthwith. They can wait till the time the user of
        their name starts harming their business interest and starts
        misleading and confusing their customers."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      24. Reference may also be had to the judgement of this Court in
      the case of <a href="/doc/1678394/" id="a_18">P.M. Diesels v. S.M. Diesels</a> (supra) where in para
      8, this Court held as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       "(8) Next contention raised by learned counsel for the
       defendant is that the word Marshal has become common to
       the trade of diesel engines in Rajkot and various other persons
       are using the trade mark in one form or other as inasmuch as
       some are using Airmarshal, Perfect Marshal, Powermarshal
       etc. and the defendant is not the only person who is using the
       trade mark Sonamarshal only. The plaintiff, therefore, cannot
       claim its trade mark to be distinctive of its goods or business
       and no customer is likely to be confused or deceived on
       account of this trade mark. This contention of the learned
       counsel for the defendant is also without force. In this
       connection it is sufficient to say that under the law it is the
       right of two parties before the court which has to be
       determined and the court has not to examine the right of other
       parties. If some other manufacturers are using or suffixing the
       word Marshal on their diesel engines, it is of no consequence.
       Furthermore, if the plaintiff has not taken any action against
       several other infringements, this does not mean that the
       plaintiff has abandoned its trade mark and cannot challenge
       the action of the defendant."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">32.   The submission of the defendant is that the words „HEP‟ and „TEC‟
are common marks used in the trade in question and hence the plaintiff is not
entitled to exclusive protection of the mark. No details are given of the
extent of user, the date of user etc. In view of the legal position the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                                 Page 17 of 21</span>
 contention is rejected.
</p><p id="p_35">33.   The next submission of the defendant relates to alleged delay in filing
the present suit by the plaintiff. In my view, the said submission of the
plaintiff is without merits. It is settled law that mere delay in approaching
the Court would not defeat or delay the right of the plaintiff to seek
injunction in a case of infringement of trademark. (Reference Sh.Swaran
Singh Traders vs. M/s.Usha Industries (India) 29(1986) DLT 110.)
</p><p id="p_36">34.   I will now deal with the judgments relied upon by the learned
counsel for the defendant. Reliance of the defendant on the judgment of
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_19">Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. vs. The
Zamindara Engineering Co</a>., (supra) is misplaced. The Court in
paragraph 4 of the said judgment held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">      "4. The distinction between an infringement action and a
      passing off action is important. Apart from the question as to
      the nature of trade mark the issue in an infringement action is
      quite different from the issue in a passing off action. In a
      passing off action the issue is as follows :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">      Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed or
      calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the
      Plaintiff's goods ?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">      But in an infringement action the issue is as follows :
      Is the defendant using a mark which is the same as or which is a
      colourable imitation of the plaintiff's registered trade mark ?
      It very often happens that although the defendant is not using
      the trade mark of the plaintiff, the get up of the defendant's
      goods may be so much like the plaintiff's that a clear case of
      passing off would be proved. It is on the contrary conceivable
      that although the defendant may be using the plaintiff's mark
      the get up of the defendant's goods may be so different from the
      get up of the plain-tiffs goods and the prices also may be so
      different that there would be no probability of deception of the
      public. Nevertheless, in an action on the trade mark, that is to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                              Page 18 of 21</span>
       say, in an infringement action, an injunction would issue as
      soon as it is proved that the-defendant is improperly using the
      plaintiff's mark."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">35.   Hence, where the defendant is improperly using the plaintiff‟s mark,
an injunction would be issued. The High Court in that case had declined
injunction against the respondent who was using the mark "Rustam India"
as against the appellant‟s trade mark „RUSTON‟. The Hon‟ble Supreme
Court reversed the order of the High Court and granted injunction to the
appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_38">36. The other judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the
defendant would not apply to the facts of this case. <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_20">In Cadila Healthcare
Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. (supra) the Court in paragraph 25
held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      "25. With respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of
      phonetic similarity has to be jettisoned when the manner in
      which the competing words are written is different and the
      conclusion so arrived at is clearly contrary to the binding
      precedent of this Court in Amritdhara's case (supra) where the
      phonetic similarity was applied by judging the two competing
      marks. Similarly, in Durga Dutt Sharma's case (supra), it was
      observed that "in an action for infringement, the plaintiff must,
      no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely
      to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and
      the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or
      otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an
      limitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the
      plaintiff's rights are violated."

<p id="p_39">37.   In the case of <a href="/doc/769115/" id="a_21">Kalindi Medicure Pvt. Ltd.vs. Intas Pharmaceuticals
Ltd. and Anr</a>. (supra) the Court was dealing with the trade name LOPRIN.
The plaintiff‟s registered trademark was LOPRIN and the defendant had
adopted the mark LOPARIN. The drug of the plaintiff LOPRIN was in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS)No.2037/2011                                              Page 19 of 21</span>
 tablet form for treatment of cardiological problems whereas the drug of the
defendant LOPARIN was an injection for intra vascular use and a critical
care medicine used in acute coronary syndrome. The prescriber for the
plaintiff‟s medicine were general practitioners whereas prescriber for the
drug of the defendant were cardiac and other critical care specialist. There
was a vast difference in the cost of the two drugs. On the facts of the case
the Court came to a conclusion that there was no likelihood of any
confusion whatsoever. Further, the defendant already had a huge sales
turn-over of `8 crores in less than a year and hence the balance of
convenience was said to be in favour of the defendant. It was in those facts
that the Court vacated the injunction/stay order.
</p>
<p id="p_40">38.   In view of the above, the submissions made by the defendant are
prima facie without merits. The plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case
in their favour.
</p>
<p id="p_41">39.   The trade mark of the plaintiff was registered in 1998. The mark is
in use since 2000. In contrast, the defendant has only recently started using
the mark in 2000. Real use only started in 2010-2011 when a turnover of
`12.05 lacs was recorded.         The present suit was filed in 2011.
Accordingly, balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff.
Irreparable injury is likely to cause in case ex parte injunction granted is
not continued.
</p>
<p id="p_42">40.    In view of the above, defendant, its agents, proprietors etc. are
restrained from using the impugned trademark „HEPROTEC‟ or any other
mark deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the plaintiff
„HEPITEC‟ till pendency of the accompanying suit.
