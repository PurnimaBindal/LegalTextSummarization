COMMON ORDER:(per V. Ramasubramanaian, J)

        Minority and Non-minority Educational Institutions offering

Professional Graduate and Post Graduate Courses have come up

with these writ petitions challenging some of the Regulations notified

by the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) in Decem-

ber 2016, under the title Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University

Affiliation Procedure and Regulations, for the Academic Year 2017-

2018.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        2. We have heard Mr. S. Sri Ram, Mr. Sri Charan Telaprolu,

and Mr. Tarun G. Reddy, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr.

A. Abhishek Reddy, learned standing counsel for the University.

</p><p id="p_27">        3. The immediate provocation for the petitioners to challenge

the Regulations issued by the University was that some of the Col-

leges were put by the University under "No Admission Category", for

some others, the University granted affiliation for an intake, lesser

than the intake permitted by the AICTE and in respect of two col-

leges, the University rejected affiliation on the ground that the policy

considerations of the State Government did not permit the creation

of new courses or new colleges in respect of certain disciplines.

Therefore, the petitioners have come up with the above writ petitions

challenging not only the Regulations but also the orders passed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>
                                                              VRS, J &amp; NBY, J
                                               W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

the University (i) either putting them under No Admission Category,

or (ii) rejecting affiliation for some of the courses or (iii) granting af-

filiation for a reduced intake. The reason why the petitioners chal-

lenge the Regulations, is that the orders directly affecting the peti-

tioners were purportedly passed on the basis of some of the Regula-

tions.
</p>
<p id="p_28">         4. Before proceeding further, we must bring on record one

more fact namely that the JNTU issues a set of Regulations, in exer-

cise of the power conferred by Section 29 of the Jawaharlal Nehru

Technological University Act, 2008 (JNTU Act), year after year.

Therefore, the impugned Regulations issued in December, 2016 in

respect of the academic year 2017-2018, were replaced by another

set of Regulations issued in December, 2017 in respect of academic

year 2018-2019. These Regulations issued in respect of the aca-

demic year 2018-2019 have also become the subject matter of chal-

lenge in a fresh batch of writ petitions filed in the year 2018.

</p><p id="p_29">         5. In fact, when the present batch of writ petitions came up at

the commencement of the academic year 2017-2018, this Court

passed limited interim directions directing the University to recon-

sider the cases of some of the petitioners at least in respect of some

of the courses, without putting against the petitioners some of the

norms, which were patently irrational. Pursuant to those interim or-

ders, many of the petitioners in this batch of writ petitions got orders

of affiliation for the academic year 2017-18, for the courses for which

they deserved affiliation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     5</span><p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">                                                             VRS, J &amp; NBY, J
                                              W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

</p><p id="p_32">      6. Therefore, in the natural course of things, we thought that

the present batch of writ petitions had become infructuous in view

two things namely (i) that the impugned Regulations have now been

replaced by a new set of Regulations, which have also come under

challenge in a new batch of cases; and (ii) that by virtue of the in-

terim orders passed in some of these writ petitions, many of the peti-

tioners were also granted affiliation and nothing more remained for

the petitioners in respect of the academic year 2017-18.

</p><p id="p_33">      7. But it was pointed out by the learned counsel appearing for

the petitioners and rightly so, that when the very same set of Regula-

tions are issued year after year with some cosmetic changes and

when it is not possible for this Court to finally decide all the writ peti-

tions year after year within the time schedule available for comple-

tion of admissions, it may not be wise to close the writ petitions as

having become infructuous. At some point of time, in respect of

some academic year, the validity of these Regulations have to be

decided so that future litigation can be arrested. If each one of these

Regulations which are under challenge, are upheld in one batch of

cases, then there can be no challenge to the same or similar set of

Regulations in future and to the action taken on the basis of the

same or similar set of Regulations year after year. This will ensure

the arrest of future litigation. On the contrary, if any of these Regula-

tions is held ultra vires, the University will be prohibited from issuing

the same or similar Regulations in future. Therefore, despite the fact

that the academic year 2017-2018 is already over and despite the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                             6</span>
                                                                         VRS, J &amp; NBY, J
                                                       W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

fact that the outcome of these writ petitions will not really have any

substantial impact either upon the colleges or upon the University,

we have been persuaded to undertake this exercise, so as to avoid

future litigation on the very same set of Regulations.

Regulations under challenge:
</p>
<p id="p_34">        8. The Regulations under challenge in these writ petitions are

Regulations 3.25, 3.4, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 7.1 to 7.11 and 12.5. Apart from

these Regulations, Annexure-I relating to Faculty Selection Commit-

tee and the Guidelines for Adjunct Faculty are also under challenge.

While Regulations 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of the impugned Regulations in

relation to the year 2017-2018 are not adopted in relation to the cur-

rent academic year 2018-2019, all other impugned Regulations are

adopted either with some modifications in substance or with a differ-

ence in the language. In order to highlight what these impugned

Regulations provide for and as to whether similar provisions are

available in the Regulations for the current academic year, we ex-

tract below in a tabular column, a comparison between the im-

pugned Regulations relating to the year 2017-18 and the corre-

sponding Regulations relating to the year 2018-19.

<p id="p_60">What the impugned Regulations prescribe and why they are

challenged:
</p>
<p id="p_61">      9. Regulations 3.25 and 5.4 are challenged, because these

Regulations mandate that a Post Graduate programme proposed to

be offered in a Department shall not be affiliated, unless the Under

Graduate program in the concerned department has been granted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>

                                               W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

affiliation. The only exception to this rule is that if the institution is a

standalone Post Graduate Institution or if the institution is offering

MBA or MCA, the grant of affiliation for a P.G. programme need not

depend upon the grant of affiliation for U.G. programme.

</p><p id="p_62">      10. These two Regulations are challenged by the petitioners

on the ground that they are repugnant to the Regulations of AICTE.

According to the petitioners, the Approval Process Handbook issued

by AICTE does not contain such a restriction and that therefore, the

restriction imposed by the University is repugnant and also irrational,

especially when standalone P.G. Institutions are exempt from the

applicability of the provision.
</p>
<p id="p_63">      11. Regulation 3.4 as it stood when these writ petitions were

filed (2017-18) and as it now stands for the current academic year

(2018-19), enables the University to grant affiliation for a lesser in-

take than the intake permitted by AICTE or Pharmacy Council of In-

dia or other statutory bodies. This regulation is opposed on the

ground that the University cannot act like a superior body to other

statutory bodies such as AICTE, Pharmacy Council of India etc., and

that the power to grant affiliation for a reduced intake arrogated to

itself by the University, directly encroaches into the territory occupied

by the statutory bodies like AICTE.
</p>
<p id="p_64">      12. Regulations 5.2 and 5.3 mandate an institution which pro-

poses to start a new college, to obtain a No Objection Certificate

(NOC) from the University before making an application to statutory

bodies such as AICTE/PCI etc. These Regulations enable the Uni-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   11</span>
</p><p id="p_65">                                                           VRS, J &amp; NBY, J
                                            W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

versity to take a call on the request for NOC, based upon the policy

considerations of the State Government. Therefore, these Regula-

tions are opposed on the ground that once a central body is vested

with the power to grant approval for starting a new college or a new

course, there is no scope for the policy considerations of the State to

interfere with the same indirectly through the University. The re-

quirement of a NOC, according to the petitioners, is repugnant to the

Regulation 4.14 of the AICTE Approval Regulations 2012 and the

PCI Regulations. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioners that the State Government as well as the Affiliating Uni-

versity, are required to participate in the consultation initiated by

AICTE and hence, they cannot reserve a veto power for themselves

outside the consultative process. The Regulations conferring a pow-

er upon the University and upon the State Government to have a fi-

nal say in the matter, by requiring a NOC, is, according to the peti-

tioners, repugnant to the Regulations issued by the Central Bodies.

</p><p id="p_66">      13. Regulations 7.1 to 7.11 oblige the institutions to apply on-

line annually as per the schedule prescribed by the University. The

applications are to be verified by FFCA followed by a visit of the

FFCA with a prior notice of 48 hours in case of annual inspections.

The University may also conduct surprise inspections without prior

notice. These regulations also empower the University to grant af-

filiation, course-wise on the basis of the recommendations of the

Standing Committee. Based upon the recommendations of the

Standing Committee, the University is obliged under the Regulations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    12</span>

to communicate deficiencies, if any, to the college, as per the time

schedule. These Regulations are opposed on the ground that they

are used by the University to fix their own norms of equivalence in

the qualifications fixed for faculty members, thereby belittling the sta-

tus of the expert statutory bodies such as AICTE, PCI etc. Therefore,

these Regulations are assailed as being guilty of overreach. Regula-

tion 12.5 stipulates that if the information provided by the college to

AICTE is found to be false during FFCA inspection, the University

may apprise AICTE about the same and the University will grant af-

filiation only after equivalence is obtained from AICTE before the

completion of the admissions. The objection of the petitioners to this

regulation is that the time frame followed by the University provides

very little space or scope for the colleges to take up the matter with

AICTE and hence, the colleges get punished even before the griev-

ances of the colleges can be redressed by the AICTE.

</p><p id="p_67">      14. Annexure-I of the impugned regulations is challenged to

the extent that it mandates the nominees of the University to partici-

pate in the process of selection of faculties of the colleges. Such of

those petitioners who belong to the religious minority, contend that

the prescription contained in Annexure-I is ultra vires <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_1">Article 30 (1)</a> of

the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_68">      15. Annexure-III to the regulations contains guidelines for the

appointment of adjunct faculties. As per these guidelines, the affili-

ated colleges are entitled to appoint adjunct faculties to the extent of

twenty percent of the faculty requirement but the adjunct faculties (1)

should hold the qualifications prescribed by AICTE (2) should pro-

duce NOC from their parent organization, in case they are working in

some organization/industry (3) should be present at the time of in-

spection by the UGC/University/AICTE/ Government agencies (4)

should have atleast 10 years of experience (5) should not be over 70

years of age as on the 31st day of December of the relevant year (6)

should be a member of at least two professional bodies, one of

whom should have recognised his services and contributions (7)

should be an accomplished professional in his chosen field of disci-

pline, comparable to at least the top one-third of the regular faculty

and (8) should have domain knowledge, if he is from an industry,

with such domain knowledge forming part of the curriculum with sig-

nificant value.
</p>
<p id="p_69">      16. The guidelines for appointment of adjunct faculties is chal-

lenged on the ground that they are repugnant to the norms stipu-

lated by the AICTE and that some of these prescriptions bear no

nexus to the object of appointment of adjunct faculties.

</p><p id="p_70">      17. Apart from challenging some of the regulations, the peti-

tioners also have a few other grievances. One is that the University

is not adhering to the time frame for the commencement of the an-

nual process of renewal of affiliations, strictly in accordance with the

law declared by the Supreme Court in Parshvanath Charitable

Trust v. AICTE (2013 (5) SCC 385). The second grievance is the

conduct of surprise inspections and the reliance placed upon the

findings of surprise inspection, without reference to the findings of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                     14</span>

the regular FFCA. The third grievance of the petitioners is to the re-

jection of affiliation based on the performance of the students of the

institutions in the previous academic years. Another grievance of the

petitioners is that the University is insisting on the availability of fac-

ulties, library and laboratory even for the second, third and fourth

year of the additional course or additional intake even when the col-

lege is imparting study only in the first year of the course.

Discussion and Analysis:
</p>
<p id="p_71">      18. Before proceeding to analyze each of the regulations un-

der challenge and the grounds on which they are assailed, it may be

necessary first to have a look at the AICTE Act, the Regulations is-

sued by AICTE and the Approval Process Handbook issued year af-

ter year. It is also necessary to trace the source of power for the uni-

versity to frame regulations and then find out if there is any repug-

nancy.

<p id="p_75">         20. The Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University was estab-

lished under <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_2">State Act</a> No.16/1972, much before the enactment of

A.P. Education Act, 1982 and the enactment of the AICTE Act,

1987. Despite having been issued at least 15 years before the

advent of the AICTE Act, section 4 of the Jawaharlal Nehru

Technological University Act, 1972 made it clear that the ob-

jects of the University enlisted therein would be subject to any

law as may be made by parliament as to coordination and de-

termination of standards in institutions of higher education or

research and scientific and technical institutions. Under Sec-

tion 4(1), the objects of JNTU were made subject to such direc-

tions as may be given by or on behalf of the Central Govern-

ment. Section 27 of the JNTU Act empowers the Executive Council

of the University and the Academic Senate to make regulations, re-

lating to matters that are required to be provided for by the regula-

tions.
</p>
<p id="p_76">         21. But the JNTU Act, 1972 was repealed and replaced by the

Jawaharlal Nehru Technological Universities Act, 2008. The primary

reason as to why a new Act was passed was that the State Govern-

ment wanted to restructure the JNTU into four different universities.

<p id="p_77">      22. The All India Council for Technical Education, as we have

pointed out earlier, was set up in 1945 as a National Expert Body to

advice the Central and State Governments for ensuring the Coordi-

nated Development of Technical Education in accordance with ap-

proved standards. After the mushroom growth of private Engineer-

ing Colleges and Polytechnics and the growing erosion of standards,

the Council felt it necessary that it should be vested with statutory

powers to regulate and maintain standards of Technical Education in

the country. Therefore, a National Working Group was set up in No-

vember, 1985. On the basis of the recommendations made by the

National Working Group, the AICTE Act, 1987 was enacted. <a href="/doc/1136508/" id="a_6">Section

23</a>, which enlists the matters that could be provided for in the Regu-

lations framed by the AICTE, does not include any of the powers in-

dicated in <a href="/doc/223261/" id="a_10">Section 10(1)</a>. Clauses (a) to (e) of sub-section (2) of Sec-

tion 23 deal with the manner in which the meetings of the Council

are to be regulated, the procedure for conducting business at the

meetings of the Council, the terms and conditions of service of offi-

cers and employees of the Council, the constitution and powers of

the Board of Studies etc. But sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1136508/" id="a_11">Section 23</a> makes it

clear that the items listed therein are without prejudice to the gener-

ality of the powers to make Regulations under sub-section (1), for

carrying out the purposes of the Act. This is why Regulations are

issued by AICTE in exercise of the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/1136508/" id="a_12">Section 23</a>

Bench of the Supreme Court pointed out that the question regarding

the impact of Entry 66 of List-I and Entry-25 of List-III must be de-

termined by a reading of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_17">Central Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_18">State Act</a> conjointly.

The Court pointed out that a State Law providing for such stan-

dards, having regard to Entry 66 of List-I, would be struck down

as unconstitutional only if the same is found to be so heavy or

devastating as to wipe out or appreciably abridge the Central

field and not otherwise. The Court also pointed out that if a State

law prescribes higher percentage of marks for extra curricular activi-

ties in the matter of admissions to colleges, it cannot be said that it

would be encroaching on the field covered by Entry 66 of List-I.

followed in several cases including the one in State of Andhra Pra-

Reddy arose under very peculiar circumstances. The State of An-

lack of legislative competence, in view of the <a href="/doc/535576/" id="a_19">University Grants

Commission Act</a>, 1956. Though a Full Bench of this Court rejected

the challenge, the Supreme Court declared the Act as unconstitu-

tional, by its judgment in <a href="/doc/164056/" id="a_20">Osmania University Teachers Associa-

tion v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a> (1987 (4) SCC 671). Thereafter,

the Government of Andhra Pradesh enacted the Andhra Pradesh

State Council of Higher Education Act, 1988. <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_21">This Act</a> was declared

as unconstitutional by a Bench of this court, on the same premise on

which the 1986 Act was declared by the Supreme Court as unconsti-

tutional. When the matter was carried to the Supreme Court, a Two

Member Bench doubted the correctness of the decision in Osmania

University Teachers Association, and hence, the matter landed

before a Three Member Bench. While rejecting the challenge to the

<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_22">State Act</a>, the Supreme Court followed the decision in R. Chi-

tralekha and pointed out that when a <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_23">State Act</a> is in aid of the Par-

liamentary Act, the same would not entrench upon the later. There-

fore, keeping these principles in mind, let us now take a look at the

AICTE Regulations around which the present controversy revolves.

Amended Regulations of AICTE

</p><p id="p_86">      28. Unfortunately, AICTE has been issuing new sets of Regu-

lations or Amendments to the existing Regulations once in a couple

of years, leading to a lot of confusion. There were one set of Regula-

tions known as All India Council for Technical Education (Grant of

Approvals for Technical Institutions) Regulations, 2010, notified in

the Government of India Gazette on 10.12.2010. Subsequently, they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                      20</span>
                                                                VRS, J &amp; NBY, J
                                                W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

were amended by the First Amendment Regulations of the year

2011 notified on 30.09.2011. But in supercession of these Regula-

tions, a new set of Regulations known as All India Council for Tech-

nical Education (Grant of Approvals for the Technical Institutions)

Regulations 2012, were notified on 27.09.2012. But these Regula-

tions were superseded by a new set of Regulations in the year 2016,

notified on 30.11.2016. Since the batch of cases on hand relate to

the academic years 2017-18, we shall take the Regulations of the

year 2016 as the basis.
</p>
<p id="p_87">      29. Regulation 4.1 of the 2016 Regulations requires prior ap-

proval of the AICTE for setting up new Technical Institutions offering

Technical Programs at the Diploma/Post Diploma/Degree/Post

Graduate Degree level. Regulation 4.2 requires existing institutions

to seek prior approval- (1) for Extension and (2) for increase in in-

take and various other things. Regulation 4.3 states that no NOC

shall be required from the Affiliating University/Board/State Govern-

ment, for reduction of intake and the closure of Second Shift

Courses. Regulation 4.3 reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "4.3 - No NOC from Affiliating University/Board/State Govern-
      ment/UT shall be required for reduction in intake to Non-Zero in-
      take and closure of Second Shift Courses."</blockquote><p id="p_88">

</p><p id="p_89">      30. Similarly, Regulation 4.4 of the 2016 Regulations states

that even for the closure of PGDM Courses, NOC from Affiliating

University is not necessary, though an inspection by the Expert Visit

Committee shall be conducted.
</p>
<p id="p_90">      31. Regulation 4.11 empowers the Council to publish, from

time to time, an Approval Process Hand Book, detailing the docu-

ments to be attached to the application, the fee to be remitted,

norms and standards, requirements and procedure by which the ap-

plications are to be processed. Regulation 4.12 mandates that the

applications received under Regulation 4.1 or 4.2 shall be processed

as per the procedures, norms and standards prescribed in the Ap-

proval Process Hand Book as notified by the Council from time to

time in addition to the existing Central, State and Local laws.

</p><p id="p_92">      32. Regulation 4.15 requires all applications for setting up new

institutions, to be made online through the AICTE Web Portal. Upon

an application being so made, a unique User ID will be allotted to

each new applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_93">      33. All applications under Regulation 4.1 and 4.2 are to be

made online, using the Unique User ID, by remitting the prescribed

fee through AICTE's payment gateway on the Web Portal.

</p><p id="p_94">      34. Regulation 4.18 requires the State Government and the Af-

filiating University to forward their views on the applications received

under Regulation 4.1, supported by valid reasons along with the

perspective plan of the State within 21 days of receipt of the applica-

tions. The views expressed by the State Government and the Affiliat-

ing University will be taken into account under Regulation 4.18 by

the Regional Committee for processing the application further.

</p><p id="p_95">      35. Regulation 4.19 of the 2016 Regulations contains a very

important departure from the process that prevailed until the year

2012. Regulation 4.19.a reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">        "There is no scrutiny for applications applied under 4.2. (a)
        and (f), as the processing is based on self-disclosure. If

        there is "Zero Deficiency", then the system shall allot the in-
        take applied for, as per the Approval Process Handbook."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      36. As we have stated earlier, a distinction is maintained be-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_96">tween the applications made under the Regulation 4.1 for setting up

new Technical Institutions and the applications made under Regula-

tion 4.2 for extension of approval. Whenever an application is made

under Regulation 4.2, it is processed only on the basis of the self

disclosure made by the institution. This is made clear by Regulation

4.19.a and further reiterated by a part of Regulation 4.21, which

reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        "4.21.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">        For institutions applied under Clause 4.2 (b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i),
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">        (j) and (k) of these Regulations, the Scrutiny Committee shall
        process the proposals based on the information/documents pro-
        vided by the applicant.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">        For Institutions applying under Clause 4.2 (e), (l) and (m) of these
        Regulations, an Expert Visit Committee shall be conducted to the
        Institutions."</blockquote><p id="p_97">

</p><p id="p_98">      37. Thus in a majority of cases falling under Regulation 4.2,

there is not even an inspection by the Expert Visit Committee. The

applications will be processed solely based upon the self disclosure

made by the institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_99">      38. Regulation 4.30 mandates that Institutions other than Mi-

nority Institutions shall appoint teaching staff/ Principal/ Director and

other technical supporting staff and administrative staff strictly in ac-

cordance with the methods and procedures prescribed by the con-

cerned Affiliating University/Board particularly with reference to se-

lection procedures and selection Committees. Regulation 4.32

makes it clear that a Technical Institution shall not be allowed to par-

ticipate in the Counselling and admission process, without the prop-

er approval of both the AICTE and Affiliating University.

</p><p id="p_101">      39. In view of the fact that the amended Regulations of the

year 2016, which primarily followed the Regulations of the year

2012, enable the AICTE to proceed with the processing of appli-

cations online, merely on the basis of the disclosure made by

the applicant rather than the discovery made during the inspec-

tions, the Institutions have now been let off the hook. But to in-

still the fear of god (if not the fear of law) in the Institutions, the 2016

Regulations contain two provisions, in Regulations 4.35 and 4.36,

respectively providing (i) for penal action if the disclosure was found

to be incorrect or inaccurate and (ii) for surprise inspections without

prior intimation. Regulations 4.35 and 4.36 read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">        4.35 - The applicants are expected to provide the Council true
        and complete information and documents required for various
        purposes. If the information given and/or the documents pro-
        vided to the Council are found to be false, incomplete and/or the
        applicants have failed to disclose factual information and /or
        suppressed/misrepresented the information, the Council shall in-
        itiate action including Withdrawal of Approval/or any other action
        as deemed necessary against the applicants.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">        4.36 - AICTE shall also conduct from time to time inspections
        with or without notifying dates in such cases where specific
        complaints of falsification of documents, misrepresentation, vio-
        lation of norms of standards, malpractices, etc., are received."</blockquote><p id="p_102">

</p><p id="p_103">      40. Regulation 15 of the 2016 Regulations makes it clear that

no Letter of Approval or Extension of Approval shall be granted after

the 30th April of every Calendar Year, in view of the order passed by

the Apex Court in Parshvanath Charitable Trust v. AICTE, on

13.12.2012.

were amended by the First Amendment Regulations, 2017. This

First Amendment, titled as AICTE (Grant of Approvals for Technical

Institutions) (First Amendment) Regulations, 2017, were notified on

05.12.2017. The amendments made by the First Amendment, do not

have a bearing upon the batch of cases on hand. Therefore, it is not

necessary to deal with them in great detail. But in brief it can be

stated that the First Amendment Regulations, 2017 -

it is clear that there is increasing reliance placed by AICTE

upon the good faith and conduct of the Institutions. Since

AICTE has decided to proceed on good faith, after the advent of

the 2012 Regulations, the role and responsibility of the Affiliat-

ing Universities has increased manifold. Cases abound in this

Court where the inspections conducted by the Committees of the

University have exposed the falsity of the claims made by the institu-

tions in the information furnished by them to AICTE online. There-

fore, the challenges made to the prescriptions issued by the Univer-

sity may have to be scrutinized with a lot of care and caution.

</p><p id="p_113">      43. Having taken note of the AICTE Act and the Regulations

issued thereunder, we shall now take up the challenge to each of the

Regulations of the University.
</p>
<p id="p_114">Challenge to Regulation 3.25 and 5.4

</p><p id="p_115">      44. As we have pointed out in paragraph 9, Regulations 3.25

and 5.4 are challenged, since they mandate that a Post Graduate

Programme proposed to be offered in a Department, shall not be af-

filiated, unless the Under Graduate programme in the concerned

Department has been granted affiliation. But if an institution is a

standalone Post Graduate institution or if the Institution is offering

MBA or MCA, then the grant of affiliation for a Post Graduate pro-

gramme need not depend upon the grant of affiliation for Under

Graduate Programme.
</p>
<p id="p_116">      45. These two regulations are challenged on the sole ground

that the Approval Process Handbook issued by AICTE does not con-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                     26</span>

tain such a restriction and that therefore, the Regulations framed by

the University are overreaching and irrational.

</p><p id="p_118">      46. Neither the AICTE Act nor the AICTE Regulations, 2016

specifically deal with the issue as to whether an affiliation for a Post

Graduate programme would depend upon the affiliation to a corre-

sponding Under Graduate programme. The Approval Process Hand-

book issued by the AICTE for the year 2017-18 merely contains the

Norms for faculty requirements and recommended cadre ratio for

Post Graduate programmes in Appendix-VII, Table 7.3. Therefore, it

is clear that AICTE Regulations are silent on the question whether

the grant of approval for a Post Graduate programme, would depend

upon the approval for the Under Graduate programme. This is

sought to be projected as a case of repugnancy between the AICTE

Regulations/Approval Process Hand Book and Regulation 3.25 and

5.4 of the Affiliation Procedure and Regulations of the JNTU.

</p><p id="p_119">      47. But we are unable to see any repugnancy. There is no ex-

press stipulation either in the AICTE Regulations of the year 2016 or

in the Approval Process Handbook that deals with this issue. There-

fore, the field is left unoccupied by the Regulations of the AICTE. So

long as the field is unoccupied by a Central Legislation, there is no

bar for the State Law to make a prescription.
</p>
<p id="p_120">      48. The 2nd argument as against Regulations 3.25 and 5.4 is

that when standalone Post Graduate institutions can be granted af-

filiation, it is completely irrational to say that the institutions offering

both Under Graduate and Post Graduate courses should have af-

filiation for Under Graduate courses to be eligible for affiliation for

Post Graduate courses.
</p>
<p id="p_122">      49. But unfortunately for the petitioners, the rationality or

otherwise of the prescriptions made by Universities and expert

bodies, cannot be tested on the touchstone of what we under-

stand as rationale in common parlance. If an institution applies for

approval to AICTE as a standalone Post Graduate institution, the

Norms prescribed in the Table under Appendix-VII at 7.3 of the Ap-

proval Process Handbook will apply. If an institution has both Under

Graduate and Post Graduate programmes, the tables at 7.2 and 7.3

of Appendix-VII of the Approval Process Handbook will apply.

The combined effect of the same can be ascertained only by the

University and we are not competent to test a particular Regulation

merely on the basis of rationality.
</p>
<p id="p_123">Challenge to Regulation 3.4

</p><p id="p_124">      50. Regulation 3.4 is challenged on the ground that it enables

the University to grant affiliation for a reduced intake, than the intake

permitted by statutory bodies such as AICTE or Pharmacy Council of

India (PCI). According to the petitioners, this prescription enables the

University to overrule the decision taken by the AICTE or PCI and

hence it is not permitted by law.
</p>
<p id="p_125">      51. At the outset, it should be pointed out that all that is stated

in Regulation 3.4 is that the intake in no case shall exceed those

sanctioned by AICTE/PCI and that the University may consider any

variation in intake after obtaining approval from AICTE/PCI prior to

admissions for the current academic year.
</p>
<p id="p_126">      52. In any case, the answer to the argument of the petitioners

can be found by taking two possible scenarios. Take for instance

one possible scenario where the AICTE/PCI grants approval for

a particular intake and the University finds that the institution is enti-

tled to a higher intake. In such cases, Regulation 3.4 prohibits the

University from granting affiliation for a higher intake. The 2nd sce-

nario is where the University feels that the college is entitled to

affiliation only for a lesser intake. To grant affiliation for a lesser in-

take, there is no prohibition under the AICTE Regulations.

</p><p id="p_127">      53. As we have pointed out earlier, after the advent of the

2012 Regulations which is also followed by the 2016 Regulations,

the processing of applications by AICTE is based on self-disclosure.

Regulation 4.19.b obliges the institutions having an approved

intake of less than a Division size, to apply for an intake of full

Division size. They should also maintain faculty-student ratio

accordingly. The word "Division" is defined in Regulation 2.15 of the

2016 Regulations. The size of the Division as defined in Regulation

2.15 varies from course to course and between Under Graduate and

Post Graduate courses.
</p>
<p id="p_128">      54. Therefore, what is controlled by AICTE is only the upper

ceiling limit. It does not mean that after taking into account various

factors, the University cannot grant affiliation for a reduced intake.

</p><p id="p_130">      55. It may be important to note that the 2016 Regulations

do not confer exclusive authority upon AICTE to do what they

like. Regulation 4.12 makes it clear that the applications for es-

tablishment of new institutions under Regulation 4.1 and the

applications for extension of approval under Regulation 4.2, will

be processed as per the procedures prescribed in the Approval

Process Handbook, in addition to the existing Central, State

and Local Laws. Regulation 4.12 of the AICTE Regulations, 2016,

reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      "4.12: The applications received under Clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of
      these Regulations shall be processed as per the procedures,
      norms and standards prescribed in the Approval Process Hand-
      book as notified by the Council from time to time in addition to the
      existing Central, State and Local laws."</blockquote><p id="p_131">


</p><p id="p_132">      56. Regulation 4.18 also gives a role to the State Government

as well as the Affiliating University, while processing the applications

under Regulation 4.1. Therefore, even the Regulations of AICTE

do not declare them as having the final word. The law is well set-

tled that while the Universities cannot dilute the standards as pre-

scribed by AICTE, the Universities are always free to prescribe high-

er standards. Therefore, the challenge to Regulation 3.4 cannot be

sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_133">      57. However, we wish to add a note of caution. If an institution

satisfies the norms and standards prescribed by the AICTE and

upon physical verification by the University, it is found that the insti-

tution does satisfy the norms and standards, it may not be open to

the University arbitrarily to grant affiliation for a reduced intake.

Every individual decision of the University to grant affiliation for

a reduced intake, is susceptible to challenge before this Court.

All that we say in this decision is that Regulation 3.4 per se cannot

be said to be ultra vires.
</p>
<p id="p_135">Challenge to Regulation 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4

</p><p id="p_136">      58. Regulation 5.2 of the University Regulations requires

a new institution proposing to offer Technical Education to first seek

a No Objection Certificate from the University before applying to

AICTE/PCI. Similarly, Regulation 5.3 of the University Regulations

mandates the University to consider the application for establish-

ment of a new college or for starting a new programme,

as per the priority/policy of the State Government. These Regula-

tions are assailed on the ground that they are contrary to Clause 4 of

Chapter-I of AICTE Approval Process Handbook, 2017-18 and Reg-

ulation 4.14 of the Statutory Regulations, 2012.

</p><p id="p_137">      59. It is true that paragraph-4 of the Approval Process Hand-

book, 2017-18 issued by the AICTE contains a detailed procedure

including the kind of documents to be enclosed to the application for

approval. Paragraph-4 of the Approval Process Handbook issued by

AICTE does not contain a stipulation that a No Objection Certificate

should be obtained from the University before hand. It does not also

contain any prescription that the University should take into account

the priority/policy of the State Government.

</p><p id="p_138">      60. But as we have pointed out earlier, the source of the pow-

er for AICTE to issue Approval Process Handbook year after year
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                           31</span>

emanates from Regulation 4.11 of the AICTE Regulations, 2016.

Therefore, no prescription contained in Approval Process Handbook

can be in conflict with AICTE Regulations, 2016. Keeping this in

mind, if we have a look at the AICTE Regulations, 2016,

it may be of interest to note that there are two important prescrip-

tions contained therein. They are in Regulations 4.3 and 4.4. Regu-

lations 4.3 and 4.4 of AICTE Regulations, 2016, read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">        "4.3: No NOC from Affiliating University/ Board/State Govern-
        ment/UT   shall   be   required        for   reduction   in   intake   to
        Non-Zero intake and closure of Second Shift Courses."
        "4.4: For closure of PGDM Course, NOC from Affiliating Univer-
        sity/ Board is not applicable. However, EVC shall be conducted
        and the applicant has to pay the fee as prescribed in Approval
        Process Handbook."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">        61. What is interesting to note is that in the AICTE Regula-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_139">tions, 2016, in entirety, there is no prescription for an institution to

take a No Objection Certificate from the Affiliating University. But

cases where No Objection Certificate is not required are indicated in

Regulations 4.3 and 4.4.
</p>
<p id="p_140">        62. In other words, cases in which No Objection Certificates

from the Affiliating University are required, are not spelt out in the

AICTE Regulations, 2016. But cases in which No Objection Certifi-

cates are not required, is specifically spelt out in Regulations 4.3 and

4.4. This itself makes it clear that AICTE was not averse to the idea

of the University prescribing the requirement of a No Objection Cer-

tificate. If viewed from that angle, the prescription contained in

Regulation 5.2 of the University Regulations cannot be found fault

with.

</p><p id="p_143">      63. Insofar as the policy of the State Government is con-

cerned, Regulation 4.18 of the AICTE Regulations, 2016 recognizes

the stakes involved for the State Government in the matter of grant

of approval. Regulation 4.18 of the AICTE Regulations, 2016 en-

ables the State Government and the Affiliating University to forward

their views with valid reasons along with the perspective plan of the

State, within 21 days of receipt of the applications under Regulation

4.1. This is a positive recognition of the impact that the policy of the

State Government may have on the question of grant of approval.

Hence, Regulation 5.3 of the University Regulations obliging the

University to take into account the policy of the State, cannot be held

to be arbitrary, inasmuch as AICTE itself is obliged to consider the

views of the State Government on the basis of their policy and the

perspective plan. The petitioners have actually placed reliance upon

Regulation 4.14 of the AICTE Regulations, 2012 to assail the Uni-

versity Regulations 5.2 and 5.3. But AICTE Regulations, 2012 were

superseded by the Regulations of the year 2016, notified on 30-11-

2016. Therefore, we have tested the argument against Regulations

5.2 and 5.3, on the touchstone of AICTE Regulations, 2016. In fact,

the language employed in Regulation 4.14 of the AICTE Regula-

tions, 2012 and the language employed in Regulation 4.18 of the

AICTE Regulations, 2016 vary. This may be appreciated by present-

ing hem in a tabular form as follows:

fixed for faculty members and that by fixing independent norms of

equivalence of qualifications, the status of expert bodies such as

always open to the Universities to enhance them. The norms fixed

by the University as such are not under challenge before us.

In any case, there is a long list of decisions of the Supreme Court

giving primacy to the Universities over AICTE. The decision of the

Supreme Court in this regard in Bharathidasan University v.

AICTE 3 , making it clear that AICTE is not a super power with

the decisions in Adhiyaman as well as Jaya Gokul Educational Trust

and came to a conclusion that a careful scanning of the provisions of

the AICTE Act and the provisions of the UGC Act in juxtaposition will

show that the role of the AICTE vis-à-vis the Universities is only ad-

visory, recommendatory and a guiding factor. Since the decision in

Bharathidasan University is subsequent to Adhiyaman and Jaya Go-

University, we are obliged to follow the decision in Bharathidasan

<p id="p_163">      70. Similarly, the decision in Visveswaraya Technological Uni-

sion in Visveswaraya arose out of a judgment of the Division Bench

of the Karnataka High Court, which simply followed Adhiyaman. This

can be found from paragraph-6 of the decision in Visveswaraya. But

the Supreme Court found that the original view taken by the Court in

Adhiyaman stood modified in Dr. Preethi Srivastava v. State of Mad-

hya Pradesh [(1999) 7 SCC 120]. In Visveswaraya, the Supreme

Court pointed out that the observations made in Adhiyaman were

explained in the correct perspective in S.V. Bratheep. Though the

decision in Visveswaraya was also that of a two-member bench, the

Court declared the opinion in paragraph-41(vi) of Adhiyaman as not

a good law.

<p id="p_167">       72. As a matter of fact, we are not concerned in this batch of

cases with any attempt made by the University to belittle the status

of AICTE. As we have pointed out in the first portion of our order,

Section 4 of the JNTU Act, 2008 itself made it clear that the objects

of the University would be subject to any law made by the Parlia-

ment    as   to    coordination   and   determination    of    standards.

The objects of JNTU were also made subject to such directions as

may be made on behalf of the Central Government. Therefore, the

JNTU Act, 2008 and the Regulations issued in the form of Affiliation

Procedure Regulations year after year by JNTU, specifically recog-

nizes the role of AICTE. Similarly, the AICTE Regulations, 2016,

more particularly the Regulations 4.18, 4.3, 4.4 etc., recognized the

role of the State Government and the Affiliating University. In other

words, AICTE itself has fine tuned its Regulations in such a manner

that they provide a space for the State Government and the Univer-

sity so that there is no conflict of interest and all the 3 of them can

work towards the betterment of standards.

versity and Mahatma Gandhi University were not noticed by the Su-

preme Court in Rungta Engineering College, the amended Regula-

tions of AICTE of the year 2016, providing a space for the State

Government and the Affiliating University were also not noted there-

in.
</p>
<p id="p_170">      74. Another important aspect which requires reiteration is that

after the advent of AICTE Regulations, 2012, the applications for ex-

tension of approvals are processed only online, merely on the basis

of the disclosure made by the colleges. If all infrastructural facilities

as prescribed by AICTE are found to be available on paper, the

AICTE grants extension of approval in view of Regulation 4.19.1.

Though AICTE has reserved to itself the power to conduct inspec-

tions and take penal action against colleges for false declarations,

such penal action does not mean anything and does not serve any

purpose for the students who get admitted to such colleges. The

Regulations of the AICTE are silent as to how the students will get

compensated, when penal action is taken against colleges which

host false information online in their applications to AICTE.

</p><p id="p_171">      75. This is why the JNTU has taken upon itself the task of

making inspections, for finding out whether the information furnished

in the application filed online by the institutions with AICTE is correct

or not. In fact, the University has come up in a large number of cas-

es before this very bench, highlighting the discrepancies between

the information furnished by the institutions to the AICTE and the in-

formation furnished in the applications made to the University for af-

filiation. These discrepancies are sought to be explained by the

learned counsel for the petitioners by arguing that AICTE processes

the applications and pass orders before 30th April of every year, but

the University takes up the applications for affiliation only 3 to 4

months later and that during this interregnum period some faculties

leave and some are appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_173">      76. But this is hardly an explanation that can be accepted.

Take a hypothetical case where Universities also accept applications

online and processes the same without physical inspection or verifi-

cation. In such an event, neither the AICTE nor the University will

know what happened after the grant of approval by AICTE and af-

filiation by University. This will leave the students who join such

courses/colleges in the lurch.
</p>
<p id="p_174">      77. Regulations 7.1 to 7.11 of the Affiliation Process Regula-

tions issued by JNTU should be seen in the context of Regulation

4.19.a of the AICTE Regulations, 2016. In fact, we have come

across several cases where the same person is shown as

a faculty in different colleges for getting approval and affiliation. Only

after realizing this, the expert bodies came up with a solution to pro-

vide unique I.D. to faculty members. Even thereafter it was found

that several persons were appointed by colleges just for the purpose

of getting affiliation and were discharged immediately after affiliation

was granted. To plug these loopholes, JNTU has installed

a biometric system of attendance in colleges, but the security of the

same has also been compromised. Very recently, the Vice-Principal

of a private college along with a few others were arrested by the po-

lice in connection with the illegal sale of cloned finger prints of faculty

of colleges to tamper with the bio metric attendance. Thus Colleges

have started inventing newer and newer methods of violating the

norms, forcing the University to come up with newer and newer solu-

tions. Since the system of administration of justice is not always in-

novative, we still try and test these issues on old scales. In fact, a

time may come when the University may have to create a Research

and Development Department to plug the loopholes. Even then they

may be lagging behind the dirty tricks departments of some of the

colleges. Therefore, the challenge to Regulations 7.1 to 7.11 cannot

be countenanced.
</p>
<p id="p_175">Challenge to Annexure-I of the Affiliation Procedure Regula-

tions of the JNTU

</p><p id="p_176">       78. The next challenge is to Annexure-I of the Affiliation Pro-

cedure Regulations of the JNTU, which mandates the nominees of

the University to participate in the process of selection of faculties of

colleges. Some of the petitioners are run by Religious Minority Insti-

tutions and hence they pitch their claim on <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_33">Article 30(1)</a> of the Con-

stitution also.
</p>
<p id="p_177">       79. But unfortunately for the petitioners, the AICTE Regula-

tions, 2016, contained a special prescription in Regulation 4.30

which reads as follows:
</p>

      trative staff strictly in accordance with the methods and procedures of the

      scribed format shall also be uploaded on the Web-Portal of AICTE as per
      the schedule prescribed in the Approval Process Handbook."</blockquote><p id="p_178">


</p><p id="p_179">      80. Therefore, it is clear that institutions other than the Minority

Institutions are required to follow the methods and procedures of the

Affiliating University in the matter of Selection Procedures and Se-

lection Committees. Hence, the challenge made by Non-Minority In-

stitutions to Annexure-I of the Affiliation Procedure Regulations of

the University, is liable to be rejected even on the basis of Regula-

tion 4.30 of AICTE Regulations, 2016. Regulation 4.30 of the AICTE

Regulations, 2016 is not under challenge. Therefore, Non-Minority

Institutions will have to follow the selection procedure and go

through the Selection Committee as stipulated by University.

</p><p id="p_180">     81. Insofar as Minority Institutions are concerned, Regulation

4.30 of the AICTE Regulations 2016 will not apply. But it does not

mean that the power of the university to prescribe a procedure for

the selection of teaching faculties has been taken away by the

AICTE Regulations, 2016. The prescription contained in Regulations

4.30 of the AICTE Regulations 2016, cannot be understood to mean

that in respect of Minority Institutions, there is a positive mandate

from the AICTE not to follow any procedure prescribed by the uni-

versities. All that can be inferred from Regulation 4.30 is that the

mandate of the AICTE in this regard is confined only to Non-minority

Institutions. It would have been a different matter if Regulation 4.30

had also included a prescription that Minority Institutions need not

follow any procedure prescribed by the university. Therefore, the in-

ference is that insofar as Minority Institutions are concerned, the field

is left unoccupied by Regulation 4.30 of the AICTE Regulations

2016. If the field is left unoccupied, then there is no repugnancy.

</p><p id="p_181">         82. But Annexure-I of the Affiliation Procedure Regulations of

the JNTU University mandating the inclusion of the nominees of the

university in the Selection Committees for appointment of teaching

faculties, is challenged not merely on the ground of repugnancy with

the AICTE Regulations, but also on the ground of infringement of the

right under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_34">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution. Reliance is placed in this

regard on the decision of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court

in The Forum of Minority Institutions and Associations v. State

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">                   "19. The general principles relating to establishment and admini-
          stration of educational institution by minorities may be summarized thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">          (i) The right of minorities to establish and administer educational institu-
          tions of their choice comprises the following rights :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">          a) To choose its governing body in whom the founders of the institution
          have faith and confidence to conduct and manage the affairs of the insti-
          tution;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">          b) To appoint teaching staff (Teachers/Lecturers and Head-
          masters/Principals) as also non-teaching staff; and to take action if there
          is dereliction of duty on the part of any of its employees;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">          c) To admit eligible students of their choice and to set up a reasonable
          fee structure;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">          d) To use its properties and assets for the benefit of the institution;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">          (ii) The right conferred on minorities under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_36">Article 30</a> is only to ensure
          equality with the majority and not intended to place the minorities in a
          more advantageous position vis- `-vis the majority. There is no reverse
          discrimination in favour of minorities. The general laws of the land relat-
          ing to national interest, national security, social welfare, public order, mo-
          rality, health, sanitation, taxation etc. applicable to all, will equally apply
          to minority institutions also.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">          (iii) The right to establish and administer educational institutions is not
          absolute. Nor does it include the right to mal-administer. There can be
          regulatory measures for ensuring educational character and standards
          and maintaining academic excellence. There can be checks on admini-
          stration as are necessary to ensure that the administration is efficient
          and sound, so as to serve the academic needs of the institution. Regula-
          tions made by the State concerning generally the welfare of students and
          teachers, regulations laying down eligibility criteria and qualifications for
          appointment, as also conditions of service of employees (both teaching
          and non-teaching), regulations to prevent exploitation or oppression of
          employees, and regulations prescribing syllabus and curriculum of study
          fall under this category. Such regulations do not in any manner interfere
          with the right under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_37">Article 30(1).</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">          (iv) Subject to the eligibility conditions/qualifications prescribed by the
          State being met, the unaided minority educational institutions will have
          the freedom to appoint teachers/Lecturers by adopting any rational pro-
          cedure of selection.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">          (v) Extension of aid by the State, does not alter the nature and character
          of the minority educational institution. Conditions can be imposed by the
          State to ensure proper utilization of the aid, without however diluting or
          abridging the right under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_38">Article 30(1)."</a></blockquote><p id="p_184">

of Minority Institutions and Associations. The challenge before the

Madras High Court was to Clause-3 of the Annexure to the UGC

Regulations, 2000 regarding minimum qualifications for appointment

and career advancement of teachers in universities and colleges.

The Regulation impugned before the Madras High Court stipulated

the constitution of Selection Committees for the appointment of lec-

turers and principals. The Selection Committees for appointment of

principal were required to comprise of - (1) the Chairman of the Go-

verning Body of the College or his nominee; (2) the Principal of the

College; (3) one Senior Teacher/Head of the Department; (4) two

nominees of the Vice Chancellor of the Affiliating University; and (5)

two subject experts not connected with the college to be nominated

by the Chairperson of the Governing Body out of a panel of names

approved by the Vice Chancellor. Similarly Selection Committees

were to be constituted for appointment to the post of university lec-

turers, readers etc. The Division Bench of the Madras High Court

found two issues as arising for consideration, viz., (1) whether the

University Grants Commission has power to make Regulations re-

garding Selection Committees to be constituted by private colleges;

and (2) whether the Regulations infringe upon the rights guaranteed

under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_39">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution in respect of Minority Institu-

tions. On the first question, the Division Bench found that the issue

was already settled by another Division Bench of the Madras High

Court in the <a href="/doc/137386779/" id="a_40">Secretary Kamaraj College v. D.S. Arulmani</a> 15 , to

which one of us (VRS,J) was a party. On the second question, the

Division Bench of the Madras High Court held in favor of the Minority

Institutions and Associations by holding that Regulation 3 of the Uni-

versity Grant Commission Regulations constituted an infringement of

the rights conferred upon the minorities.
</p>
<p id="p_186">        86. Seeking to distinguish the decision of the Division Bench of

the Madras High Court in The Forum of Minority Institutions and As-

sociations, it is contended by Mr. A. Abhishek Reddy, learned Stand-

ing Counsel for the university that Annexure-1 of the University Reg-

ulations does not contain any prescription that will dilute or infringe

the rights of the minorities. According to the learned counsel, An-

nexure-1 of the University Regulations enable the University to pro-

vide a list of five names, who are subject experts, from out of whom

the Chairman of the Governing Body of the college is entitled to se-

lect two. Therefore, it is contended by the learned counsel for the

university that in contrast to Regulation 3 of the UGC Regulations

that was under challenge before the Madras High Court, Annexure-1

of the JNTU Regulations is too soft, too diluted and does not at all

infringe upon the rights of the Minority Institutions.

to have a look at Clause-VI of Annexure-1 of the Affiliation Proce-

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">         88. The prescriptions contained in the relevant part of Annex-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_195">ure-1 of the University Regulations clearly show that the Selection

Committees are overloaded with the nominees of the Vice Chancel-

lor. Say for example, the Selection Committee for appointment to the

post of Assistant Professor should comprise of eight members, only

one of whom is the Chairperson of the Governing Body of the institu-

tion. The other two members will be the Principal and Head of the

Department of the college. The remaining five members will only be

the nominees of the Vice Chancellor. Therefore, it is clear that the

prescriptions in Annexure-1 of the impugned University Regulations

for the constitution of Selection Committees are more serious than

Regulation 3 of the UGC Regulations that was under challenge be-

fore the Madras High Court. As reiterated by the Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/168450156/" id="a_41">Sindhi Education Society v. the Chief Secretary, Government of

NCT of Delhi16</a>, the appointment of a teacher is part of the regular

administration and management of the educational institution. While

it will be open to expert bodies like AICTE and Affiliating Universities

like JNTU to prescribe the qualifications or eligibility criteria for a

teacher to be appointed, it may not be open to them to interfere with

the right of the minority institution to select a teacher of their choice.

If the institutions select people, who do not satisfy the prescribed cri-

teria, qualifications or eligibility, the university may refuse to recog-

nize such appointment. But the university cannot interfere with the

method of selection of teachers by minority institutions. Therefore,

the contention of the petitioners, who are minority educational

institutions, is to be upheld insofar as the prescriptions con-

tained in Annexure-1 about the constitution of Selection Com-

mittees is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_197">      89. The last of the challenges to the impugned University

Regulations, is to the guidelines contained in the University Regula-

tions with regard to the appointment of adjunct faculties.

</p><p id="p_198">      90. The object of allowing institutions to appoint adjunct facul-

ties is to ensure that professionals, who are employed in industries

or persons, who are running industries in the relevant field are able

to come and share the practical wisdom that they have gained in a

particular discipline. All that the university guidelines say is that - (1)

such adjunct faculty should satisfy the educational qualifications

prescribed by AICTE; (2) such adjunct faculty should produce NOC

from the parent organization; (3) such adjunct faculty should be

available as per the timetable; (4) such adjunct faculty should have

10 years of experience and not more than 70 years of age; and (5)

such adjunct faculty should be a member of at least two professional

bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_199">      91. We do not know how these prescriptions can be held to be

illegal. The very object of appointing adjunct faculties is to enhance

the skills of the students in the practical application of their theoreti-

cal knowledge. But this provision should not be used as a handle for

appointing all and sundry who have no expertise in the field. As per

the University Regulations, 20% of the faculty could be adjunct fac-

ulty. When the facility of appointing adjunct faculties, who need not

be in the payroll as full-time teachers, is provided to the institutions,

the institution should not challenge the eligibility criteria fixed for

such adjunct faculties. Therefore, the challenge to these guidelines

should also fail.
</p>
<p id="p_200">Conclusion:
</p>
<p id="p_201">      92. In view of the above, the challenge to Regulations 3.25

read with 5.4, 3.4, 5.2, 5.3, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10, 12.5, Annexure-1 and the

guidelines for adjunct faculty, should fail, except to the extent that

the prescription relating to constitution of Selection Committees con-

tained in Claus-VI of Annexure-1 of the Affiliation Procedure Regula-

tions 2017-18 will not apply to minority educational institutions.

Ancillary grievances:
</p>
<p id="p_202">      93. As we have stated earlier the petitioners have, apart from

challenging the regulations, also ventilated certain grievances. The

first is that the University is not adhering to the time frame for proc-

essing the applications for affiliations, as fixed by the Supreme Court

in its decision in Parshvanath Charitable Trust.

</p><p id="p_203">      94. This grievance is fairly justified. The schedule fixed by the

Supreme Court has to be respected and followed by the Universities,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                      50</span>
                                                                VRS, J &amp; NBY, J
                                                W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

as otherwise the actions of the University may be viewed with suspi-

cion.
</p>
<p id="p_204">        95. The second grievance is about the conduct of surprise in-

spections. We do not know why institutions who have fulfilled all the

requirements should be worried about surprise inspections. There

can be no denial of the fact that there is a huge trust deficit. Colleges

which comply with the statutory requirements need not bother about

surprise inspections and others have no right to come to the Court.

</p><p id="p_205">        96. The third ancillary grievance of the petitioners is about the

rejection of affiliation based upon the performance of the students of

the institutions in the previous academic years. The contention of the

University is that the performance of the students of colleges affili-

ated to the University has a direct bearing upon the reputation of the

University itself. Therefore it is contended by the University that it

should be one of the parameters for deciding the issue of affiliation.

</p><p id="p_206">        97. Technically and legally, the regulations of the University do

not prescribe the performance of the students of an institution, as a

factor to determine the eligibility of the institution for affiliation. But in

practice the number of students who come out of an institution

with flying colors determines the reputation of the institution.

The cumulative reputation of all the institutions affiliated to an

University determines the reputation of the University. Institu-

tions which are incapable of imparting quality education and

enhancing the skills of the students, have no business to sur-

vive, though they may have a business to run. But as a matter of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                    51</span>
                                                            VRS, J &amp; NBY, J
                                             W.P.Nos.18954 of 2017 &amp; batch

fact, the correlation between the performance of students and the

performance of teachers, is at times direct and at times inverse. The

more meritorious students always choose the most reputed colleges

and even if those colleges engage teachers of relatively lesser qual-

ity, the students, by their own efforts, compensate for the lack of effi-

ciency on the part of the teachers. But students at the bottom of the

merit list gain admission only to colleges of relatively lesser reputa-

tion and unless these colleges engage teachers who are better than

those engaged by the best of those colleges, it is not possible to im-

prove the performance of less meritorious students who join these

colleges.
</p>
<p id="p_207">      98. Therefore even while taking the poor performance of stu-

dents of the previous batches, as a factor for determining the eligibil-

ity of a college for affiliation, the University may give some latitude

depending upon the area where the college is located and the social

strata from which the students of these colleges come from.

</p><p id="p_208">      99. The last of the ancillary grievances of the petitioners is that

the University is insisting upon the provision of faculties, library and

laboratory even for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year of the additional course

or additional intake even when the college is imparting the 1st year

of the course of study only. According to the petitioners, they should

be permitted to develop the infrastructure over a period. According to

the petitioners, the investment in infrastructure even for the 2nd, 3rd

and 4th year of the course of study, will be a dead investment when

an additional course or additional intake is sanctioned for the 1st

year for the first time. The petitioners claim that when the students

complete the first year of their course of study, the managements will

put in place the necessary infrastructure for the next year.

</p><p id="p_209">      100. Logically the above contention appears to be right. But

the difficulty is that, if the institutions do not provide sufficient infra-

structure when the students move over from the 1st year to the 2nd

year, the students will be put into great jeopardy. Students get ad-

mitted on the basis of the approval granted by AICTE and the affilia-

tion granted by the University. These two virtually hold out a promise

to the students that all infrastructure is available. Students do not

take admissions based upon promises. Therefore the last of the an-

cillary contentions is also liable to be rejected.

</p><p id="p_210">      101. We are now left with one last contention which revolves

around the FAQs issued by the University. The petitioners claim that

at the commencement of the academic year 2017-18, a video con-

ference was held by the University with all the colleges. Thereafter

the University issued FAQs relating to the affiliation process.

</p><p id="p_211">      102. According to the petitioners, they altered their position in

accordance with the FAQ's by dispensing with the services of some

faculty, who were earlier engaged. But the University later went back

on the FAQ's.
</p>
<p id="p_212">      103. But at the outset we should point out that FAQs cannot

go contrary to the Regulations. The University is as much bound by

the Regulations as the institutions are. There can be no estoppel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                    53</span>

against Statute. Therefore the last contention revolving around

FAQ's is also liable to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_213">      104. In fine--

come from etc. In other words, the pass percentage of students in

the past couple of years cannot be the sole criteria for rejecting the

request for affiliation or for granting affiliation for a reduced intake.

Several factors such as the backwardness of the area in which the
