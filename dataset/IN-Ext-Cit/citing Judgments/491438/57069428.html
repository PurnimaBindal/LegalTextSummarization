<p id="p_2">1.    The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order 



dated   21st  March,   2006   of   the   High   Court   of   Judicature   at 



Allahabad,   Lucknow   Bench,   which   had   partially   accepted   the 



appeal   by   acquitting   the   accused   persons   of   the   offence   under 



Section   323   read   with   <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">Section   34</a>   of   the   Indian   Penal   Code,   1860 



(hereafter,   `<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>'),   but   affirmed   the   imposition   of   life   imprisonment 



for   the   offence   under   <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">Section   302</a>   read   with   <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">Section   34</a>,   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>   as 


awarded   by   the   learned   trial   court   vide   its   judgment   dated   6th 



January,   1982.   The   trial   court   had   found  the   four   accused   Ram 



Dutt (now dead), Thakur Prasad, Mano Dutt and Ram Narain guilty 



of an offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a>, read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">Section 34</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> and also

Rs.1,000/- for the second, in default of which, to undergo rigorous 



imprisonment for three months.

<p id="p_3">2.    This   is   a   case   where   the   incident,   on   22nd  October,   1977, 



which   resulted   in   the   death   of  Siya   Ram,   is   admitted   between  the 



parties.   The primary question that falls for determination is, as to 



which   of   the   parties   was   the   aggressor,   besides   determining   the 



merits of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant.   Before 



noticing the prosecution version, we may notice that in the present 



case,   six   accused   were   charged   and   tried   for   an   offence   under 



<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">Sections 302</a> and <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_13">323</a>, both read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_14">Section 34</a> IPC.  Learned trial 



court,   vide   its   judgment   dated   6th  January,   1982   had   acquitted

Court,   Ram   Dutt   died   and   the   Court   convicted   the   other   accused

<p id="p_5">3.    Thakur   Prasad   had   filed   a   separate   appeal   challenging   the 



said judgment of the High Court, being SLP (Crl.) No.3929 of 2006 



titled <a href="/doc/182051/" id="a_15">Thakur Prasad v. State of U.P</a>. which came to be dismissed by 



order   of   this   Court   dated   18th  August,   2006.     In   other   words,   the 



conviction   of   the   accused   Thakur   Prasad   under   <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_16">Section   302</a>   read 



with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_17">Section 34</a> IPC attained finality.  However, vide the same order, 



this   Court   granted   leave   to   appeal   in   the   case   of   Mano   Dutt   and 



Ram Narain.   This is how the present appeal has come up for final 



hearing before us.
</p>



<p id="p_6">4.    The   case   of   the   prosecution   is   that   Mano   Dutt,   Ram   Narain 



and Jagdish are real brothers  while Ram Dutt and Thakur Prasad 



are   their   cousins.     On   22nd  October,   1977   during   day   time,   Siya 



Ram   was   doing   earth   filling   in   front   of   his  sariya  (a   place   of 



tethering   cattle).    The   four   accused,   namely,   Ram   Dutt,   Thakur 



Prasad, Ram Narain and Mano Dutt out of the six named accused 



had   come   there  and   asked   Siya   Ram   not   to   do   earth   filling.     Siya 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                      3</span>


Ram told them that it was his land and he would not stop the work 



of   land   filling.     Thereupon,   Siya   Ram   called   certain   villagers.     The 



matter  was  discussed with  the  villagers,  all  of whom  said that the 



land was that of Siya Ram and he could carry on with land filling on 



his own land.  After deciding this, the villagers went away and Siya 



Ram  resumed  the filling  of the  earth.   Accused Ram Dutt, Thakur 



Prasad, Mano Dutt, Ram Narain, Jagdish and Sher Bahadur, armed 



with  lathis, came there and chased Siya Ram.   They said that they 



would   finish   Siya   Ram.     Siya   Ram   was   able   to   run   for   a   short 



distance away, whereafter all the accused surrounded him in front 



of   the   house   of   one   Fateh   Mohmad.     Accused   Ram   Dutt,   Thakur 



Prasad, Mano Dutt and Ram Narain started beating Siya Ram with 



their lathis.  The father of Siya Ram, Nankoo and brother Salik Ram 



rushed   towards   Siya   Ram   to   rescue   him.     Accused   Sher   Bahadur 



and   Jagdish   intercepted   them   in   front   of   one   Chiddan's   door   and 



beat   them   with   their  lathis.     Siya   Ram   fell   down   after   getting   the 



lathi blows.  Siya Ram raised alarm, but still these accused persons 



continued   to   beat   him   and   in   the   meanwhile,   Smt.   Sangam   Devi, 



Bhurey and Pradhan came there.  The Pradhan snatched the lathis 



of the four accused, who then fled away from the scene.   Siya Ram

sustained  serious  injuries.     Nankoo   and  Salik  Ram   also  sustained 



injuries.     Pradhan   and   the   other   villagers   took   the   injured   to   the 



Police Station.  
</p>



<p id="p_7">5.    The   incident   was   narrated   in   the   form   of   a   report   of 



occurrence, by the deceased Siya Ram, who was in an injured state 



at that time. The same was transcribed by Panna Lal Pandey, PW3 



and   submitted   to   the   Police   Station,   where   a   First   Information 



Report (hereafter, `FIR') Exhibit Ka7 was prepared.
</p>



<p id="p_8">6.    On this statement, the officer present at the police station had 



registered a case under <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_18">Section 308</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">IPC</a> and the investigation was 



taken   over   by   C.R.   Malviya.    During   investigation,   C.R.   Malviya 



recorded   the   statements   of   a   number   of   witnesses   as   well   as   sent 



Siya Ram to the hospital.   Siya Ram succumbed to his injuries on 



24th  October,   1977  at   about   8.00   a.m.   in   the   District   Hospital, 



Faizabad.    Upon his death, the offence was converted to one under 


<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_20">Section   302</a>,   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a>.       The   Investigating   Officer   visited   the   spot, 


recovered blood-stained earth, Ex. Ka-8 and prepared the site plan, 



Ext. Ka-9 and examined various witnesses.  After completion of the 



investigation,   the   charge   sheet   was   filed   before   the   court   of

July, 1980 charged the accused with offences under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_22">Sections 147</a>,

amended   and   all   the   accused   were   charged   with   offences   under 



<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_27">Sections   302</a>/<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">149-147</a>   and   <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_29">323</a>/<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_30">149</a>,   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31">IPC</a>.       The   accused   pleaded 



not guilty and faced trial before the Court of Sessions.     As already 



noticed,   out   of   the   six   accused,   four   were   convicted   by   the   trial 



court.  One accused, namely Ram Dutt, died during pendency of the 



appeal   before   the   High   Court   and   all   the   other   accused   were 



acquitted of  the offences under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_32">Section  323</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_33">34</a> IPC, but  convicted

he was brought to the hospital on the evening of 22nd October, 1977 



at about 4.30 p.m.    He had noticed lacerated bone-deep wound, 3 



cm   x  0.5   cm,   on  the   frontal   region  of   the   scalp,   from   which   blood

injuries on the bodies of Nankoo and Salik Ram both were found to

             which   the   accused   Ram   Dutt   had   suffered   injuries.     For

       <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_36">Section   302</a>,   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37">IPC</a>.   In   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the

       offence punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_38">Section 304</a>, Part-I, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_39">IPC</a>.

<p id="p_23">v)     The deceased had only three injuries, therefore, on the one 


       hand,   the   story   that   six   accused   had   assaulted   him   with 



       lathis  even   when   he   was   lying   on   the   ground   is   not 



       physically possible and on the other hand, the prosecution 



       has   failed   to   explain   the   injuries   suffered   by   Ram   Dutt, 



       accused.  Thus, it creates a specific doubt in the story of the 



       prosecution.

<p id="p_24">vi)    Lastly,   it   is   contended   that   the   dismissal   of   the   other 


       Special Leave Petition filed by Thakur Prasad does not have 



       any bearing on the fate of the present appeal, inasmuch as 



       the Court is vested with wide powers in terms of <a href="/doc/1138600/" id="a_40">Section 38</a>,

</p>



<p id="p_25">15.    We   have   already   noticed   that   the   incident   in   question   is 



admitted.   According   to   the   accused,   the   fight   was   started   by   the 



deceased   and   his   relations   and   they   had   exercised   their   right   of 



private  self-defence,   to   protect   themselves.     To   the   contrary, 



according  to the witnesses  of the  prosecution  as well as according 



to   the   version   given   by   the   deceased,   the   accused   were   aggressive 



and   had   attacked   the   deceased   and   his   family   members   after 



deliberately   planning   to   assault   and   kill   them.     It   is   not   a   case 



where the circumstances, even remotely, can be construed to have 



satisfied the ingredients of self-defence.  We may examine few of the 



circumstances in this case.   From the record, it appears that Ram 



Dutt had lodged a complaint of the incident that took place on 22nd 



October,   1977   at   about   12.00   p.m.     According   to   this   report   the 



accused   in   that   complaint   (i.e.,   the   deceased   and   his   family 



members)  had been  putting earth  on Ram  Dutt's  sariya, which he 



had forbade.   There was verbal altercation between the parties and 



then   the   accused   in   that   complaint   (i.e.,   the   deceased   herein) 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                                     12</span>


started   assaulting   him   with  lathis  and   it   was   only   by   raising   an 



alarm that the people of the village came to the place of occurrence 



and his life was saved.  According to this complaint, he had suffered 



injuries on his head.  
</p>



<p id="p_26">16.    Firstly,   this   complaint   had   not   been   proved   by   Ram   Dutt 



during   the   trial.     Accordingly,   the   concurrent   view   taken   by   the 



courts   below,   that   this   document   cannot   be   relied  in   evidence, 



cannot be faulted with.   Furthermore, Ram Dutt did not examine a 



single witness  in his defence to prove that he was attacked by the 



deceased and his family members or that they were putting earth at 



the door of Ram Dutt's  sariya.   No doubt, Ram Dutt was subjected 



to   medical   examination   by   the   Medical   Officer   vide   Ex.Kha   1.       It 



was   noticed   that  he   had   suffered   lacerated   wounds   on  the  central 



and  other   regions of skull, and  had complained   of  pain in left  leg. 
</p>


<p id="p_27">This   would   show   that   Ram   Dutt   had   suffered   some   injuries   but 



where   and   how   these   injuries   were   suffered,   was   for   him   to 



establish, particularly when he had taken a specific stand that the 



deceased and his family members were at fault and were aggressive. 
</p>


<p id="p_28">He claims that they had caused serious injuries to his person and 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                                    13</span>


this   incident   happened   in   the   presence   of   the   villagers.   It   is   a 



settled canon of evidence jurisprudence that one who alleges a fact 



must prove the same.   It is also his case that the prosecution has 



not   explained   the   injuries   on   his   person   and,   therefore,   the 



argument   impressed  upon  the   Court   is   that  the   attack   with  lathis 



was in exercise of self-defence and the failure of the prosecution to 



explain injuries on the person of Ram Dutt is a circumstance which 



creates a serious doubt in the story of the prosecution.  We are not 



impressed with this contention primarily for the above reasons and 



also because of the fact that if the police was not investigating into 



the complaint, Ram Dutt was not helpless or remediless in law.  He 



could   have   filed  an   application   before   the   concerned  Magistrate   in 



accordance with the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44"> of Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 



(<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_45">Cr.P.C</a>.) for directing the police to investigate and even to summon 



the accused in that complaint.   But none of the accused, including 



Ram Dutt, took any of the steps available to them in law.   When a 



person claims exercise of private self-defence, the onus lies on him 



to show that there were circumstances and occasions for exercising 



such a right.  In other words, these basic facts must be established 



by the accused.  Just because one circumstance exists amongst the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                                   14</span>


various  factors,   which  appears  to  favour the  person claiming  right 



of   self-defence,   does   not   mean   that   he   gets   the   right   to   cause   the 



death of the other person.   Even the right of self-defence has to be 



exercised directly in proportion to the extent of aggression.  
</p>



<p id="p_29">17.    As   per   the   medical   report,   the   injuries   on   the   body   of   Ram 



Dutt   were   found   to   be   `simple   in   nature'.     On   the   other   hand,   we 



have   a   complete   version   of   the   prosecution,   duly   supported   by 



witnesses,   out   of   which   PW1   and   PW2   are   eye-witnesses   to   the 



occurrence.     The   bone   of   contention   between   the   parties   was   the 



statement of the deceased,  that  he  was  filling  the earth over  some 



land, which he claimed to be his land; according to the accused, the 



earth-filling   was   carried   out   in   front   of   the   door   of   Ram   Dutt. 
</p>


<p id="p_30">According to both the parties, the villagers came to the spot.  Out of 



the   two   versions,   the   one   put   forward   by   the   prosecution   and   the 



other in the defence of the accused, the version of the prosecution, 



as has been disclosed by the eye-witnesses, is trustworthy, reliable 



and   entirely   plausible   in   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case. 
</p>


<p id="p_31">The mere fact that the Investigating Officer has not been produced, 



or   that   there   is   no   specific   explanation   on   record   as   to   how   Ram 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                                       15</span>


Dutt suffered these injuries, would not vitiate the trial or the case of 



the prosecution in its entirety.   These claims of the accused would 



have been  relevant considerations,  provided the accused  had  been 



able   to  establish  the  other   facts   alleged  by  them.     It  is   not always 



mandatory for the prosecution to examine the Investigating Officer, 



provided it can establish its case beyond reasonable doubt even in 



his   absence.     The   present   case   certainly   falls   in   the   latter   class. 
</p>


<p id="p_32">Where the accused lead no defence, they cannot take benefit of the 



fact   that   the   prosecution   did   not   examine   any   independent 



witnesses.  The accused would be deemed to have been aware of the 



consequences   in   law   when   they   gave   a   statement   admitting   the 



occurrence   but   attributing   aggression   and   default   to   the   deceased 



and his family members. 
</p>



<p id="p_33">18.    Accused Thakur Prasad is also stated to own a sariya and was 



also   allegedly   using   his  lathi  in   self-defence,   as   according   to   their 



story, four persons with the deceased and his family members had 



attacked them.  Strangely, Thakur Prasad suffered no injury.  These 



are   the   circumstances   which,   examined   cumulatively,   would 



provide support to the case of prosecution.
</p>




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                                     16</span>


<p id="p_34">19.    Another contention raised on behalf of the accused/appellants 



is   that   only   family   members   of   the   deceased   were   examined   as 



witnesses   and   they   being   interested   witnesses   cannot   be   relied 



upon.     Furthermore,   the   prosecution   did   not   examine   any 



independent witnesses and, therefore, the prosecution has failed to 



establish its case beyond reasonable doubt.  This argument is again 



without   much   substance.     Firstly,   there   is   no   bar   in   law   in 



examining   family   members,   or   any   other   person,   as   witnesses. 
</p>


<p id="p_35">More   often   than   not,   in   such   cases   involving   family   members   of 



both   sides,   it   is   a   member   of   the   family   or   a   friend   who   comes   to 



rescue the injured.  Those alone are the people who take the risk of 



sustaining   injuries   by   jumping   into   such   a   quarrel   and   trying   to 



defuse   the   crisis.     Besides,   when   the   statement   of   witnesses,   who 



are relatives, or are parties known to the affected party, is credible, 



reliable,   trustworthy,   admissible   in   accordance   with   the   law   and 



corroborated   by   other   witnesses   or   documentary   evidence   of   the 



prosecution,   there   would     hardly   be   any   reason   for   the   Court   to 



reject   such   evidence   merely   on   the   ground   that   the   witness   was 



family   member   or   interested   witness   or   person   known   to   the 



affected party.  There can be cases where it would be but inevitable 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                                          17</span>


to   examine   such   witnesses,   because,   as   the   events   occurred,   they 



were   the   natural   or   the   only   eye   witness   available   to   give   the 



complete version of the incident.  In this regard, we may refer to the 



judgments   of   this   Court,   in   the   case   of  <a href="/doc/1379924/" id="a_46">Namdeo   v.   State   of  



Maharashtra</a>,   [(2007)   14   SCC   150].     This   Court   drew   a   clear 



distinction between a chance witness and a natural witness.   Both 



these   witnesses   have   to   be   relied   upon   subject   to   their   evidence 



being trustworthy and admissible in accordance with the law.  This 



Court, in the said judgment, held as under:

would   not   be   proper   to   conclude   that   they   would   shield   the   real

<p id="p_39">23.    In our view, non-examination of Nankoo, to which the accused 



raised   the   objection,   would   not   materially   affect   the   case   of   the 



prosecution.     Normally,   an   injured   witness   would   enjoy   greater 



credibility because he is the sufferer himself and thus, there will be 



no   occasion   for   such  a   person   to   state   an   incorrect   version   of   the 



occurrence, or to involve anybody falsely and in the bargain, protect 



the   real   culprit.     We   need   not   discuss   more   elaborately   the 



weightage that should be attached by the Court to the testimony of

      "28.   Darshan   Singh   (PW   4)   was   an 

      injured   witness.   He   had   been   examined 

      by the doctor. His testimony could not be

                   similar view has been reiterated observing 

                   that   the   testimony   of   a   stamped   witness 

                   has   its   own   relevance   and   efficacy.   The 

                   fact that the witness sustained injuries at 

                   the   time   and   place   of   occurrence,   lends 

                   support   to   his   testimony   that   he   was 

                   present   during   the   occurrence.   In   case 

                   the   injured   witness   is   subjected   to 

                   lengthy   cross-examination   and   nothing 

                   can be elicited to discard his testimony, it

</p>
<p id="p_44">                   State   of   Haryana).   Thus,   we   are   of   the 

                   considered   opinion   that   evidence   of 

                   Darshan   Singh   (PW   4)   has   rightly   been 

                   relied upon by the courts below."
</p>

<p id="p_45">            30.  The   law   on   the   point   can   be   summarised 

            to   the   effect   that   the   testimony   of   the   injured 

            witness   is   accorded   a   special   status   in   law. 
</p>
<p id="p_46">            This   is   as   a   consequence   of   the   fact   that   the 

            injury to the witness is an inbuilt guarantee of 

            his   presence   at   the   scene   of   the   crime   and 

            because   the   witness   will   not   want   to   let   his 

            actual   assailant   go   unpunished   merely   to 

            falsely   implicate   a   third   party   for   the 

            commission   of   the   offence.   Thus,   the 

            deposition   of   the   injured   witness   should   be 

            relied   upon   unless   there   are   strong   grounds 

            for   rejection   of   his   evidence   on   the   basis   of 

            major   contradictions   and   discrepancies 

            therein."

<p id="p_47">24.    To the similar effect is the judgment of this Court in the case 



of Balraje @ Trimbak (supra).  
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                                23</span>


<p id="p_48">25.    Another   argument   with   regard   to   appreciation   of   evidence   is 



that the material witness having not been examined and the entire 



prosecution   story   being   based   upon   the   statements   of   PW1   and 



PW2,   who   are   the   interested   witnesses,   the   entire   prosecution 



evidence suffers from a patent infirmity in law.  
</p>




<p id="p_49">26.    Again,  we  are  not  impressed   by  this  contention,  primarily   for 



the   reasons   afore-recorded.     Furthermore,   it   may   also   be   noticed 



that   non-examination   of   any   independent   witness,   in   the   facts   of 



the   present   case,   is   not   fatal   to   the   case   of   the   prosecution.     The 



Court   can   convict   an   accused   on   the   statement   of   a   sole   witness, 



even   if   he   was   a   relative   of   the   deceased   and   thus,   an   interested 



party.     The   condition   precedent   to   such   an   order   is   that   the 



statement   of   such   witness   should   satisfy   the   legal   parameters 



stated   by   this   Court   in   a   catena   of   judgments.     Once   those 



parameters   are   satisfied   and   the   statement   of   the   witness   is 



trustworthy,   cogent   and   corroborated   by   other   evidence   produced 



by the prosecution, oral or documentary, then the Court would not 



fall in error of law in relying upon the statements of such witness.

wholly unreliable witness that his testimony is discarded in toto and 



no   amount  of  corroboration   can   cure   its  defect.    Reference   in  this 



regard   can   be   made   to   the   judgment   of   this   Court,   in   the   case   of 



Anil Phukan v State of Assam [(1993) 3 SCC 282].
</p>




<p id="p_51">27.    Now we may examine as to the place and manner in which the 



incident occurred.  It is a very important aspect of this case that the 



FIR   itself   was   lodged   by   the   deceased   along   with   PW3   Panna   Lal 



Pandey   who  transcribed  the   same   at   the  police   station  itself.     The 



deceased was seriously injured, but was fully aware of what he was 



doing   and   he   had   no   reason   to   falsely   implicate   any   person.     His 



father   and   brother   had   also   been   injured   in   the   occurrence.     It   is 



specifically recorded in the statement of these witnesses that when 



the   appellant   Mano   Dutt   and   other   accused   came   for   the   second 



time,   to   the   place   where   the   deceased   was   filling   the   earth   at   the 



sariya,   they   gave   a  lalkar  `Maro   sale   ko'   and   then   assaulted   him 



with  lathis. When  he tried  to  run away, he fell  to  the ground  near 



the   house   of   one   Fateh   Mohd.     The   blood-stained   earth   was 



collected   from   the   front   of   Fateh   Mohd.   doors   by   the   Investigating 



Officer vide Ext. Ka-8.  Thereafter, the villagers had come and taken

the lathis away from the accused persons.  The deceased was taken 



to the police station and then to the hospital, where he died on 24th 



October, 1977.  It is evident that all the accused persons had come 



prepared,   mentally   and   physically,   to   assault   the   deceased   and   in 



furtherance   to   their   common   intention,   had   even  given   a  lalkar  to 



kill the deceased.  This incident was witnessed by natural witnesses 



Nankoo   and   PW2   Salik   Ram,   as   well   as   PW1   Smt.   Sangam   Devi.

<p id="p_52">Nankoo   and   Yadav   even   intervened   and   tried   to   protect   their 



son/brother,   but   in   the   process,   they   also   received   number   of 



injuries, as is clear from the medical evidence produced on record. 
</p>


<p id="p_53">During   the   course   of   argument,   the   learned   counsel   for   the 



appellant tried to take advantage of the fact that the deceased ought 



to have suffered a number of injuries, if six people had, at the same 



time,   attacked   him   with  lathis,   but   he   had   actually  received   only 



three injuries.  Thus, the story of the prosecution was improbable.  
</p>



<p id="p_54">28.    We have no hesitation in rejecting this argument, primarily for 



the reason that, as per the medical report and statement of PW5 Dr. 



Surya Bhan Singh, the deceased had suffered a number of injuries 



and not only three.  The collection of the bloodstained earth itself is

consistent view that the normal rule is that whenever the accused 



sustains   injury   in   the   same   occurrence   in   which   the   complainant 



suffered the injury, the prosecution should explain the injury upon

where the court can distinguish the truth from falsehood, the mere 



fact that the injuries on the person of the accused are not explained 



by   the   prosecution   cannot,   by   itself,   be   a   sole   basis   to   reject   the 



testimony of the prosecution witnesses and consequently, the whole

<p id="p_60">31.    PW4   had   clearly   noticed   that   injury   on   the   person   of   the 



deceased, Salik Ram Yadav and Nankoo were all caused by a blunt 



weapon.     He   had   specifically   observed   that   the   injuries   were 



sufficient, in the ordinary course of time, to cause death and had, 



in fact, resulted in the death of the deceased.
</p>



<p id="p_61">32.    The High Court and the trial court have recorded reasons for 



returning  the   concurrent   finding   of  guilt.     The   learned   counsel   for 



the   appellant   strenuously   argued   that  one   of   the   accused,   namely 



Ram   Dutt,   who   is   now   dead,   had   in   his   statement   under   <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_74">Section 



313</a>   Cr.P.C.,   stated   that   the   land   in   between   the   house   of   the 



parties was his and that despite his protest, Salik Ram, Siya Ram, 



Ram   Dhiraj   and  Nankoo   were  putting  earth  on  that land   when   he 



again   objected,   all   of   them   ran   after   him,   rounded   him   up   at   the 



door   of   Fateh   Mohd.   and   started   beating   him.     Thakur   Prasad, 



cousin of Ram Dutt, came and in response, wielded the  lathi  in his 



defence.     To   similar   effect   is   the   statement   of   Thakur   Prasad.     In 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                                     30</span>


view of  this stand,  the   other  accused  cannot  be  said  to  have  been 



involved in the  commission  of the crime.   This argument  is a self-
</p>


<p id="p_62">serving   submission.    All   the   accused   are   related   to   each   other. 
</p>


<p id="p_63">Once   the   plea   of   self-defence   is   disbelieved,   then   a   statement   of   a 



co-accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_75">Section 313</a> CrPC cannot be of any advantage to 



the   co-accused,   as   the   prosecution   has   been   able   to   establish   its 



case   beyond   any   reasonable   doubt.     In   the   present   case,   in   the 



chain of events, nowhere does the plea of self-defence as sought to 



be   raised   by   the   appellant-accused   or   other   accused,   fit   in.     The 



defence   has   miserably   failed   to   prove   any   fact   or   any   need   for 



resorting   to   commission   of   the   offence   in   self-defence.     To   begin 



with,   the   police   had   charged   this   accused   for   an   offence   under 



<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_76">Section   302</a>   read   with   <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_77">Section   149</a>   and   <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_78">323</a>   of   the   IPC.     However, 



two   of   the   accused   were   acquitted   by   the   trial   court   and   the 



remaining   were   convicted   of   an   offence   under   the   said   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_79">Sections 



302</a>/<a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_80">34</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_81">323</a>/<a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_82">34</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_83">IPC</a>.  The High Court acquitted all the accused 



of offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_84">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_85">34</a> IPC and unfortunately, Ram Dutt 



died   during   the   pendency   of   that   appeal.     Because   the   alleged 



number   of   accused   had   become   less   than   five,   nature   of   the 



offences   were   changed   from   offence   under   <a href="/doc/1060179/" id="a_86">Section   149</a>   to   <a href="/doc/821945/" id="a_87">Section

<a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_88">34</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_89">IPC</a>.  In face of the acquittal of the two accused, which was not 



assailed by the State, it must be taken that they were not present. 
</p>


<p id="p_64">Then   remain   three   accused,   Thakur   Dass   and   the   present 



appellants.    Thus, in the circumstances of the case, the possibility 



of presence  of all other  persons  in  the  appellants'  party  cannot be 



excluded.         It   is   also   not   quite   possible   that   the   accused   have 



deposed   incorrectly   before   the   Court   in   regard   to   the   number   of 



persons   and   their   participation.       Even   where   there   are   less   than 



five persons who are accused, but the facts and the evidence of the 



case   is   convincing   as   in   the   present   case,   where   the   accused   had 



returned to the place of occurrence with complete preparedness and 



after giving lalkar had attacked the deceased there, they have to be 



held   liable   for   commission   of   the   crime   (Refer   :  <a href="/doc/1813801/" id="a_90">Kartar   Singh      vs.  



State   of   Punjab</a>,   AIR   1961   SC   1787).     The   learned   counsel   for   the 



respondent-State   also   relied   upon   the   judgment   in   the  <a href="/doc/662558/" id="a_91">Yunis   @  



Kariya v.  State of M.P</a>. [(2003) 1 SCC 425] to contend that an overt 



act   on   the   part   of   one   of   the   accused   is   immaterial   when   his 



presence,   as   part   of   the   unlawful   assembly,   is   established.     This 



case was for an offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_92">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_93">149</a>  IPC and, therefore, 



would not squarely apply to the present case as it has been held by

the   Court   that   the   accused   was   not   constituting   an   unlawful 



assembly   of   five   or   more   persons.     However,   it   cannot   be   ignored 



that the extent of participation, even in a case of common intention 



covered   under   <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_94">Section   34</a>   IPC   would   not   depend   on   the   extent   of 



overt   act.     If   all   the   accused   have   committed   the   offence   with 



common   intention   and     inflicted   injuries   upon   the   deceased   in   a 



pre-planned   manner,   the   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_95">Section   34</a>   would   be 



applicable to all.
</p>



<p id="p_65">33.    The learned counsel had also relied upon the judgment of this 



Court   in  <a href="/doc/1433979/" id="a_96">Marimuthu   &amp;   Ors.  v.     State   of   Tamil   Nadu</a>  [(2008)   3   SCC 



205] to contend that this was a fight at the spur of the moment and 



the conviction of the appellants could be converted into that under 



<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_97">Section 304</a>, Part I of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_98">IPC</a>.  This judgment is distinguishable on 



facts   and   has   no   application   to   the   present   case.     It   was   not   a 



dispute   which   arose   at   the   spur   of   the   moment   as   the   evidence 



clearly   shows   that   the   accused   had   gone   again   to   the   site   in 



question   with   a   common   intention   and   with   the   preparedness   to 



assault   and   even   kill   the   deceased.     Even   the   site   plan,   Ex.Ka9 



clearly   shows   that   all   these   places,   i.e.   the   land   on   which   the

house   of   the   accused   and   that   of   the   deceased   were   all   nearby.

<p id="p_66">This is even fully corroborated by the oral evidence.   Thus, on the 



basis of the documentary and ocular evidence, we are fully satisfied 



that   the   prosecution   has   been   able   to   prove   its   case   beyond 



reasonable   doubt   and   has   brought   home   the   guilt   of   the   accused 



under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_99">Section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_100">Section 34</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_101">IPC</a>.

<p id="p_67">34.    Having   come   to   the   above   finding,   we   do   not   consider   it 



necessary to dwell on the question as to what is the effect in law of
