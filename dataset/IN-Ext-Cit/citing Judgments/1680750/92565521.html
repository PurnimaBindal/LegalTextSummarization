                               ORDER

       M.R. Anitha, J.
</p><p id="p_2">    1. This petition has been filed under Sec.482 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a> to quash
       the proceedings in C.C.252/2017 on the files of Chief
       Judicial Magistrate, Manjeri. Petitioners are accused in
       crime No.1458/2015 of Manjeri police station.
</p>

<p id="p_3">    2. Prosecution case is that on 6.10.2015 at 12.45 noon in room
       No. 20/281 at Seethi Haji bus terminal, Manjeri, (in the
       name and style 'HI TEN TWO') first petitioner/first accused
       with the 2nd petitioner/2nd accused as salesman without the
       knowledge or consent of CW8 in violation of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_2">Copyright Act</a>,
       1957 (hereinafter referred as the 'Act') copied the cinemas,
       KL 10 and Bahubali while copyright is subsisting, using
       computers     and    connected    equipments     and   thereby
       committed the offence punishable under Sec.51 r/w 63 of
       the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_4">    3. Notice was issued to the respondent. Respondent appeared
       through      the    learned   Senior    Public     Prosecutor
       Sri. D.Chandrasenan. Heard both sides.
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              3</span>

</p><p id="p_5">    4. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, the
       offence as alleged against the petitioners will not stand. The
       respondent has not produced any document to prove that
       there exists copyright over the alleged items and there is an
       owner for copyright of those works. It is also his contention
       that the owner of the copyright is not made a witness and he
       also claims that a similar case has been discharged by the
       Chief Judicial Magistrate, Manjeri as per Annexure-A4 order.
</p>

<p id="p_6">    5. The learned public prosecutor on the other hand would
       contend that copyright exists with respect to the CDs of the
       films seized from the shop of the petitioners and the witness
       has also been cited to prove the case.
</p>

<p id="p_7">    6. Annexure-A2, copy of the final report, would show that the
       offence alleged is under Sec.51 r/w 63 of the Act. It will be
       useful in this context to extract Sec.51 of the Act


                    When copyright infringed - Copyright in a work shall
                    be deemed to be infringed -
</p><p id="p_8">                    (a). when any person, without a licence granted by the
                    owner of the copyright or the Registrar of Copyrights
                    under this Act or in contravention of the conditions of a
                    licence so granted or of any condition imposed by a
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                4</span>

                    competent authority under this Act -
</p><p id="p_9">                    (i) does anything, the exclusive right to do which is by
                    this Act conferred upon the owner of the copyright, or
</p><p id="p_10">                    (ii) permits for profit any place to be used for the
                    communication of the work to the public where such
                    communication constitutes an infringement of the
                    copyright in the work, unless he was not aware and
                    had no reasonable ground for believing that such
                    communication to the public would be an infringement
                    of copyright; or
</p><p id="p_11">                    (b) when any person-
</p><p id="p_12">                    (i) makes for sale or hire, or sells or lets for hire, or by
                    way of trade displays or offers for sale or hire, or
</p><p id="p_13">                    (ii) distributes either for the purpose of trade or to such
                    an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the
                    copyright, or
</p><p id="p_14">                    (iii) by way of trade exhibits in public, or
</p><p id="p_15">                    (iv) imports into India,
                    any infringing copies of the work:
</p><p id="p_16">                        Provided that nothing in sub-clause (iv) shall apply
                    to the import of one copy of any work, for the private
                    and domestic use of the importer.
</p>


<p id="p_17">    7. So on going through the above there will not be any doubt to
       the proposition that whenever it is found that any person
       without a licence granted by the owner of the copyright or
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           5</span>

       the Registrar of copyrights under this Act does any act which
       is exclusively conferred upon the owner of the copyright or
       makes for sale or hire, or displays or offers for sale or hire
       any infringed copies of the work, the offence would be
       attracted. Here the allegation against the petitioners is that
       the petitioners herein without the knowledge or consent of
       CW8, without any permit or licence copied and sold the CDs
       of 'KL10' and 'Bahubali' movies. So prima facie the copying
       of the works and display for sale with out licence would be
       an offence under sub-clause (b) of Sec.51.
</p><p id="p_18">    8. Sec.2(m) of the Act says in sub-clause (ii) what is an
       infringement of copy


               "infringing copy" means -
</p><p id="p_19">               (i)..........
</p><p id="p_20">               (ii) in relation to a cinematographic film, a copy of the
               film made on any medium by any means;
</p>


<p id="p_21">    9. A copy of the film made through computer and other devises
       seized by the detecting officer from the shop run by the first
       petitioner/first accused as the owner and second petitioner
       as salesman would show prima facie that the CD seized are
       infringed copies of the film 'Bahubali' and 'KL10'. Here the
       contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          6</span>

       there is no document produced by the respondent to prove
       that the CDs seized are protected/or registered under the
       provisions of the Act and further that owner of the copyright
       if any, is not arrayed as witness. It is also contended that the
       Registrar of the copyright has not been arrayed as witness
       and what is produced is only an undertaking from the Kerala
       Film Producers Association which would not substantiate
       the case of the prosecution. The statement of Kerala Film
       Producers Association is produced                  as Annexure-A5.
       Annexure-A5 is a letter issued by M.Rejnith, Secretary of the
       Association to the SHO stating that during the relevant
       period copyright is subsisting with respect to 'KL10' and
       'Bahubali' movies.
</p>

<p id="p_22">    10.         In this context it is relevant to have a look at Sec.13 of
       the Act which reads as follows :
</p><p id="p_23">       Works in which copyright subsists - (1) Subject to the provisions of
       this section and the other provisions of this act, copyright shall
       subsist throughout India in the following classes of works, that is to
       say, -
</p><p id="p_24">       (a) original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works;
</p><p id="p_25">       (b) cinematograph films; and
</p><p id="p_26">       (c) sound recording.
</p><p id="p_27">       (2) Copyright shall not subsist in any work specified in sub-section
       (1), other than a work to which the provisions of <a href="/doc/903291/" id="a_3">section 40</a> or section
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            7</span>

       41 apply, unless -
</p><p id="p_28">       (i). in the case of published work, the work is first published in India,
       or where the work is first published outside India, the author is at the
       date of such publication, or in a case where the author was dead at
       that date, was at the time of his death, a citizen of India;
</p><p id="p_29">       (ii) in the case of an unpublished work other than work of
       architecture, the author is at the date of the making of the work a
       citizen of India or domiciled in India; and
</p><p id="p_30">       (iii) in the case of work of architecture, the work is located in India.
</p>


<p id="p_31">    11.        Chapter IV of the Act is captioned as 'Ownership of
       Copyright and the Rights of the Owner'. Section 17 of
       Chapter IV is relevant in this context to be extracted. The
       relevant portion reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "17. First owner of copyright.-Subject to the provisions
               of this Act, the author of a work shall be the first owner of
               the copyright therein:"
</blockquote><p id="p_32">    12.        From the above it can be deducted that statutorily
       copyright       subsist     throughout      India    with    respect       to
       cinematograph films. S.17 of the Act provides that the author
       of the work shall be the first owner of copyright subject to
       the provisions of this Act. Petitioner has no case that he is
       the author of the work. So whenever such films are copied
       or published or displayed for sale, the infringement of
       copyright would prima facie comes into play. The petitioners
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        8</span>

       has no case that they have got the licence from the owner to
       take copies of works in question or to sell the same. The
       contention of the learned counsel is that in order to prove
       prima facie that there is infringement of copyrights of the
       films, it should be proved that copyrights of the films are
       registered under Secs 44 and 45 of the Act and there is a
       copyright owner with respect of this works. The learned
       counsel drew my attention to Sec.48 of the Act and would
       contend that the register of copyrights or extracts of entries
       are prima facie evidence to prove copyright ownership. But
       no such register of copyrights or its extracts has been
       produced by the prosecution to prove that there is a
       copyright owner.
</p><p id="p_33">    13.             Secs. 44 and 45 of the Act comes under Chapter X
       which deals with registration of copyright. Sec.44 deals with
       register of copyrights and Sec.45 says about the entries in
       register of copyrights. But when Sec.13 of the Act provides
       that with respect to cinematograph films copyright shall
       subsist throughout India, a further requirement to prove its
       registration as provided under chapter X will not be required
       at this stage. Moreover, S.17 of the Act provides that the
       author of the work is the first owner of the copyright. The
       allegations against the petitioners is that they have copied
       the two films using the computer and other equipments kept
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      9</span>

       in the shop. It will come under infringing of copy as defined
       under S.2(m)ii of the Act. The petitioners also could not
       produce any prima facie material to prove that they have got
       any permission or licence to take copies or sell the copies of
       the works from the owner. So by taking in aid of Secs 44
       and 45 of the Act, the petitioners are not entitled to get the
       quashment of the proceedings.
</p><p id="p_34">    14.        It is relevant in this context to quote <a href="/doc/495948/" id="a_4">Zahir Ahmed v.
       Azam Khan</a> [1996 KHC 2706] wherein while dealing with
       <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_5">Section 63</a> of the Act and Infringement of copyright it has
       been held that there is nothing to indicate under <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_6">Section 63</a>
       and <a href="/doc/1520267/" id="a_7">Section 55</a> to make registration compulsory for availing
       the remedy provided under the Sections. It is also discussed
       that <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_8">Indian Copyright Act</a>, 1914 did not make any provision
       for Registration of Copyrights. The provision for Registration
       of Copyright has been made in S.44 and S.45 of the
       Copyright Act, 1957. The object behind the enactment of
       S.44 of the Act was not to make registration compulsory or
       mandatory for the purpose of enforcement of copyright. An
       option was only provided thereunder. It is, therefore, not
       obligatory for an author to get the copyright registered under
       S.44 of the Act for the purpose of acquiring rights conferred
       by it. It is further held that registration only raises a
       presumption that the person whose name is entered in the
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       10</span>

       Register of Copyrights under S.45 of the Act is the actual
       author. <a href="/doc/263451/" id="a_9">Section 48</a> of the Act provides that the registration of
       copyright shall be prima facie evidence of the particulars
       entered therein and shall be admissible in evidence in all
       Courts without further proof for production of the originals. It
       is also held that if the legislature intended to make the
       requirement of registration mandatory, the language of S.44
       would invariably have been different. The same could have
       been on the lines of S.69 of the Partnership Act. But there
       is no provision in the Act depriving an author of the rights
       conferred by the Act on account of non-registration of the
       copyright.
</p><p id="p_35">    15.        It is also relevant to quote <a href="/doc/1680750/" id="a_10">Fr. Thomas v. State of Kerala</a>
       [2017 (1) KLT 735] wherein while dealing with <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_11">Section 63</a> of
       the Act, a question arose whether registration of copyright is
       sine qua non for prosecution and it was held that proprietor
       of an unregistered copyright can institute and prosecute a
       criminal prosecution under <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_12">Section 63</a> of the Copyright Act,
       if it is infringed. It is also held that registration of copyright is
       not mandatory and it is optional. So without any further
       discussion, it can be concluded that the relief sought by the
       petitioners to quash the proceedings pending against them
       in view of the fact that the alleged infringed copies of the
       cinematograph films is not proved to be registered under the
 Crl.M.C.6577/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       11</span>

       provisions of the Copyrights Act and that the Registrar of
       Copyrights or the owner of the copyright are arraigned as
       witnesses etc. is not sustainable in law.
</p>

<p id="p_36">    16.        In the result, the Crl.M.C. is found to be devoid of merit
       and hence dismissed.
