</p><p id="p_3">             2. P.W.1 and P.W.37 are the paternal uncles of Pintu

aged 19 years, who was the unfortunate victim in this case. The

deceased, P.W. 42, his brother, P.W.1, paternal uncle of the

deceased and P.W.6 together occupied Rajadhani Buildings at

Gopalaprabhu Road in Ernakulam. P.W.37 who was residing in

Asoka Flat was doing business in gold ornaments. Both Pintu and

the first accused used to undertake distribution of gold ornaments

given by P.W.37 to various jewellery shops in the State. Pintu and

the first accused used to supply gold to       customers on their

demand and receive the price for the same.          As usual, on

21.12.2001 also, Pintu         met P.W.37 and received the gold

ornaments      to    be    supplied  to Thekkekara   Jewellery  at

Changanacherry.           After   taking lunch, he   set   out  to

Changanacherry.         By about 5 p.m. on the same day P.W.42

contacted Pintu over phone. Pintu told him that he had managed to

collect amounts from various jewelleries at Changanacherry. By

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    3

7.30 p.m. Pintu informed him that he was able to collect

Rs.6,00,000/- and that he would return soon. Unfortunately Pintu

did not return as promised. P.W.42 tried to contact Pintu as night

advanced and Pintu did not return. But he was unable to get Pintu.

P.W.42 got in touch with P.W.37 and conveyed that though Pintu

had called him at about 7.30 p.m. and told him that he was

returning home at Ernakulam, he had not come home. P.W.37

asked P.W.42 to get in touch with the friends of Pintu. P.W.42 got

in touch with several friends of Pintu, but he got negative replies.

He had called the first accused also. But the first accused did not

respond. P.W.42 and P.W.30 enquired in the Railway Station and

Bus stand. On the next day one Suresh Bhai and P.W.30 went to

Changanacherry by about 10.30 a.m. Meanwhile P.W.2 came to

the house of Pintu. When news about Pintu was conveyed to him,

he said that he had on the previous day contacted Pintu from

Mavelikkara Railway Station      to ascertain whether Pintu was

coming by train to Ernakulam. P.W.2 told P.W.42 that Pintu told

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    4

him that he was not coming by train but in a Maruti Van along with

two of his friends. On 23.12.2001 by about 5 p.m. in the evening

P.W.5 Anil Kumar had come to the house of Pintu and told P.W.42

that he had occasion to see Pintu getting into a blue Maruti car

with Goa registration by about 7.45 p.m. on 22.12.2001. P.W.5

also told him that he had seen first accused sitting in the rear seat

of the car. There was yet another person in the car whom he could

not recognize. Jagadeesh and Suresh Bhai went in search of first

accused and found his house locked.         In the meanwhile, on

23.12.2001 by about 1.30 p.m. P.W.1 had laid First Information

Statement before the police. A crime was registered under the

caption 'man missing'.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             3. On 26.12.2001 Jagadeesh happened to see a news

item about a dead body found within the jurisdiction of

Mulanthuruthy Police Station. P.W.42, Jagadeesh and Praveen

Bhai went to the Mulanthuruthy Police Station to ascertain whether

the dead body was that of Pintu. They were told that the body

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      5

has been buried.         If they so wanted, they can get the body

exhumed.       P.W.37 made a formal request and the same was

allowed. Meanwhile, they had identified M.Os. 1 to 3 recovered

from the body of Pintu when his body was found in a canal.

When the body was exhumed, it was confirmed that it was Pintu.

</p><p id="p_5">             4. On 26.12.2001 on getting information P.W.48, the

Sub Inspector of Police Changanacherry Police Station reached

Mulanthuruthy Police Station. As it was revealed that the body

was that of Pintu, a crime was registered as Crime No.372 of 2001

in Mulanthuruthy Police Station. P.W.48 handed over the files in

his   office     to   P.W.53,   the Circle   Inspector  of   Police,

Changanacherry.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             5. P.W.53 took over the investigation of the crime. On

27.12.2001 P.W.50 informed P.W.53 that a suspect in the case had

been kept under surveillance in the Central Police Station at

Ernakulam. P.W.53 immediately reached the Station. The person

was none other than the first accused in the case. His interrogation

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      6

and the investigation of P.W.53 revealed the story of a gruesome

murder, by the accused, of Pintu for money. Several incriminating

articles in the possession of first accused were recovered. Ext.P41

report was filed by P.W.53 before the Changanacherry Magistrate

Court furnishing details of the accused and also sought to have

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_11">Sections 394</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">302</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_13">201</a> read with

<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_14">Section 34</a> incorporated. He also filed Ext.P40 report before the

R.D.O., Fort Kochi requesting that records of the case may be

called for. Later he had <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_15">Section 120B</a> also incorporated.

</p><p id="p_7">             6. P.W.53 conducted a search in the house taken on

lease by the second accused. He found M.O.24 almirah. He had

forcibly opened the almirh and was able to recover M.Os. 14, 15,

16, 18, 19, 23, 25, 26, 27, 36 and 37, which are bundles of

currency notes of various denominations. He also had the clothes

of second accused seized.        On the basis of the information

furnished by the first accused and as led by him, M.O.28 chopper

was recovered as per Ext.P14 mahazar. On searching the house of

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    7

the first accused, M.Os. 44, 45 and 46, which were bundles of

currency notes of various denominations were found. They were

seized. M.O.47 air pistol and the currency bundles were seized as

per Ext.P31 search list. As per Ext.P32 mahazar M.Os. 48 and 49

belonging to first accused were seized. P.W.53 had utilised the

services of P.W.46, who was then working as Scientific Assistant

attached to Mobile Laboratory of Kottayam District. On a search

conducted in Room No.30 of the Tourist Home where second

accused had resided, he was able to recover M.Os.34, 35 and 36 as

per Ext.P17 search list. Accused No.2 was not available in station.

Enquiry made revealed that he is in prison in connection with an

Abkari Case in Meerut. After obtaining a production warrant from

the JFCM, Changanacherry, the police officers proceeded to

Meerut and got custody of second accused. He was produced

before JFCM, Changanacherry and police custody was obtained

from court.        P.W.53 recorded the statements of witnesses,

completed investigation and laid the charge before court.

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     8




</p><p id="p_8">             7.    JFCM, Changanacherry took cognizance of the

offence as C.P. 5 of 2003. On appearance of the accused before

the said court, all legal formalities were complied with. Finding

that the     offences were exclusively triable by a court of Sessions,

the learned Magistrate committed the case to Sessions Court,

Kottayam.       The said court made over the case to Additional

Sessions Judge (Special), Kottayam for trial and disposal.

</p><p id="p_9">             8.    The latter court on receipt of records issued

summons to the accused and they entered appearance.             After

hearing both sides, charge was framed for the offences punishable

under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_16">Sections 120B</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_17">302</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_18">201</a> and <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_19">394</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_20">Section 34</a>

Indian Penal Code. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to

be tried. Therefore prosecution had P.Ws. 1 to 54 examined

Exts.P1 to P44 marked. M.Os. 1 to 76 were identified and marked.

After the close of the prosecution evidence, the accused were

questioned under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_21">Section 313</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    9

They denied all the incriminating circumstances brought out

against them and maintained that they are innocent. First accused

stated that from 1999 onwards he was dealing in gold ornaments.

On every Sunday he collects gold ornaments from Praveen Bhai

and distributes to various jewellers in various places. He collects

the amounts due and hands it over to Praveen Bhai.               On

22.12.2001 he claims to have gone to the 'Highranges' (high

altitude places in Idukki District) for business purpose.        He

returned in the evening. He was given to understand that Mukesh

Bhai had visited his house. It appears that Mukesh Bhai had

conveyed to the mother of first accused that the son of the sister of

his mother was seriously ill. His mother insisted that she should be

taken to her house at Kozhikode. On 23.12.2001 at about 5.30 in

the morning he and his mother left for Kozhikode. On 26.12.2001

he claims to have returned to the house at Ernakulam. His mother

returned with him. While he was watching T.V at about 6 p.m.,

according to him Praveen Bhai, Anil Metha, Jagadeesh along with

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    10

two other persons came to his house. They invited the deceased to

go out as they wanted to have some conversation with him. Even

though first accused promised that he would follow in the motor

bike, they asked him to go along with them. According to him, he

was directly taken to the police station and entrusted to the police.

He would complain that he had been falsely implicated.

</p><p id="p_10">             9. The second accused in his reply has stated that he

conducts business in textile along with his brother at Ernakulam.

On all days, except Sundays, he goes to various customers and

takes orders. Since he was informed that his father was ill, he left

for Meerut on 30.12.2001. He returned by 19th of January. After

he returned from Meerut he paid the rent to the landlord. While he

was carrying on his employment, he would say that on 20.2.2002

he was informed that his father was ill. He left for Meerut on

20.2.2002. He would say that he was nabbed by the police at

Meerut. He would say that he has been falsely implicated by

manipulating the documents and other records.

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    11




</p><p id="p_11">             10. Finding that the accused could not be acquitted

under <a href="/doc/19163/" id="a_22">Section 232</a> Cr.P.C., they were asked to enter on their

defence. Except for marking Exts.D1 to D10 at the earlier stage,

the accused chose not to adduce any evidence. On an appreciation

of the materials before it, the court below found that the

prosecution has succeeded in establishing the case against the

accused and accordingly conviction and sentence already

mentioned followed. The said conviction and sentence are assailed

in these appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             11.     The question that arises for consideration is

whether the court below was justified in convicting the accused

and sentencing them as already mentioned.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             12. The prosecution case is that on 22.12.2001 Pintu,

who got into the vehicle owned by accused No. 2 to return home

was done away with by the accused, who hatched a conspiracy for

the same. The court below has enumerated sixteen circumstances

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.        12

which the prosecution sought to prove in order to substantiate the

allegations against the accused persons. On an evaluation of the

evidence, the court below found that all the circumstances have

been convincingly established and held the accused guilty.

</p><p id="p_14">             13.     Heard the learned Public Prosecutor and the

counsel for the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             14.     Learned counsel appearing for the appellants

pointed out that the         significant circumstances on which the

prosecution relies to prove the case against the accused are as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      i) Purchase of the Maruti vehicle by Accused Nos. 1 and 2.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ii)   Deceased Pintu had collected amounts from various

      jewellers at Changanacherry and Thiruvalla and kept in

      M.O.4 bag.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      iii) Pintu was seen getting into the Maruti van belonging to

      accused Nos. 1 and 2.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      iv) Pintu did not return thereafter.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    13

</p><p id="p_17">      v) Recovery of the chopper, which is said to have been

      used to attack Pintu.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      vi) Recovery of the money, which Pintu had collected from

      the places where accused Nos. 1 and 2 resided.

</p><p id="p_19">      vii) Recovery of M.Os. 5, 6 and 7, the ornaments said to

      have been worn by late Pintu from one Suresh Bhai at the

      behest of accused No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_20">             15.    Learned counsel appearing for the appellants

unleashed an attack on the findings of the court below. It is

pointed out that even assuming that the accused had purchased a

Maruti van, there is nothing to indicate that the said Maruti van

was used for the offence. There is no evidence at all in this case,

according to learned counsel for the appellants to show that Pintu

was taken on the ill-fated day in the Maruti car owned by accused

Nos.1 and 2. Even assuming that he had been taken in the Maruti

car belonging to accused Nos.1 and 2, there is nothing to indicate

that the Maruti van produced before the court was the vehicle

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      14

owned by second accused. There is nothing to show that there was

anything special with the van which made it possible to identify it

easily. There was only one Maruti van in the compound of the

court at the time of trial and the witnesses simply said that that was

the vehicle into which Pintu had got in.
</p>
<p id="p_21">             16. It was also contended that the Scientific Assistant

noticed blood stains all over the places including the Maruti van.

But he is not able to collect enough blood for the purpose of

grouping.      It is difficult to believe his version and this is a

deliberate attempt on the part of the prosecution to aid the real

culprits. If blood grouping was done, according to the learned

counsel for the appellants, it would have revealed that the accused

had no role to play in the incident. Emphasis was laid on the fact

that the Doctor, who conducted autopsy states that when an injury

as the one suffered by late Pintu is caused, there will be spurt of

blood and it will splash all around. Here the roof of the car had no

blood stains. Going by the medical evidence, it was pointed out

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     15

that, it could easily be seen that the entire prosecution version is

untrue. The definite case of the prosecution is that the murder took

place inside the van. If that be so, there should have been pools of

blood inside the vehicle, which could have been easily detected

and collected by the Scientific Assistant. The failure on the part of

the prosecution to ascertain the group of blood stains collected

shows that the prosecution wants to conceal more than what it

reveals.
</p>
<p id="p_22">             17. As far as the recovery of    money is concerned, it

is true that a few jewellers and certain Bank officials have been

examined. But there is nothing to show that the respective bundles

were given to late Pintu by any of the jewellers. Of course, one

witness says that one of the bundles given by him contained a

particular sign. The Bank officer, who is said to have given the

bundles was examined. He has stated that the alphabet shown

on that particular bundle related to a customer of the Bank and all

the bundles of notes deposited by him contained those alphabets.

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      16

In short, according to the learned counsel, there is nothing to

establish the identity of notes. The court below has also found that

the mode of recovery of M.O.4 bag and M.Os. 5, 6 7 etc., cannot

fall under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_23">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, so also under

<a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_24">Section 8</a>. Holding so, the court should not have relied on those

items of evidence to hold against the accused.

</p><p id="p_23">             18. It was contended by the learned counsel for the

second accused that even assuming that the second accused had

taken a house on rent and also brought an almirah to the building,

the same does not lead to the conclusion that the currency notes

recovered from that almirah were kept by the second accused. It is

stated that by the learned counsel that the almirah was brought

into the rented house soon after it was taken on rent and thereafter

the evidence is to the effect that the accused had not come there till

the date of arrest. If that be so, it is not possible to understand as

to how he could have kept the notes in the almirah. These are

sufficient to show that the entire evidence regarding recovery of

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      17

notes was a stage managed one.
</p>
<p id="p_24">             19. It was also contended by the learned counsel for the

appellants that the evidence revealed that the accused persons were

also business men, first accused was doing the same business as

Pintu and they were considerably rich. It is ridiculous to suggest

that they would think of murdering Pintu for a paltry sum of Rs. 5

to 6 Lakhs.
</p>
<p id="p_25">             20. Learned counsel pointed out that the above aspects

have been omitted to be noticed by the court below and that has

resulted in miscarriage of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_26">             21.    Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor chose to

support the judgment of the court below. It was pointed out by

him that none of the contentions urged by the learned counsel for

the appellants before this court have any basis or foundation.

There is clinching evidence to show that Pintu got into the van

owned by accused No.2 and thereafter he was found missing. The

evidence is also to the effect that the various articles seized during

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    18

investigation were in the possession of the accused persons or were

recovered at their behest. The recovery of M.O.4 bag is clinching

enough to show the culpability of the accused persons. The bag

contained apart from various other things M.Os. 5, 6 and 7, which

were the jewellery usually worn by Pintu. According to learned

Public Prosecutor, even assuming that <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_25">Section 27</a> of the Indian

Evidence Act could not be taken aid of, the fact remains that the

bag was recovered from one Suresh Bhai at the behest of the

second accused. In fact the second accused had knowledge that

the bag had been entrusted to Suresh Bhai by the first accused.

This item of evidence, according to learned Public Prosecutor

could not be ignored as suggested by the appellants. Equally

fallacious is the contention based on identity of notes.       The

jewellery owners from whom Pintu had collected amounts had

deposed before court about the payment of money. The respective

Bank officers have also been examined. But the identification by

various witnesses of the respective bundles and also the fact that

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     19

one of the jewellers has been able to identify the bundles of notes

given by him to Pintu as those bundles contained the wrappers

with letters 'TJ' goes in favour of the prosecution.    The learned

Public Prosecutor pointed out that the recovery has to be viewed in

the facts and circumstances of the case and not in isolation. There

is nothing to indicate that the amounts so recovered by the

investigating officer belong to the accused persons.

</p><p id="p_27">             22. It was pointed out by the learned Public prosecutor

that the vehicle was recovered a few days after the incident and

therefore it is idle for the accused persons to contend that as the

vehicle did not show pools of blood in it, the evidence should be

discarded.       Learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that the

evidence by the Scientific Assistant and the mahazar concerned

will clearly show that the Scientific Assistant was able to trace

blood stains from several portions of the vehicle as well as the

room occupied by 2nd accused. To take an answer in isolation and

then generalizing it would be preposterous.         Learned Public

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     20

Prosecutor      also pointed out that the contention based on the

almirah taken by the second accused is only to be rejected. There

is convincing evidence to show that the house in which M.O.24

almirah was found was taken on rent by the second accused and

also that the almirah had been recently purchased by him.

Attention was drawn by the learned Public prosecutor to the fact

that the key of the almirah was not available and it had to be

broken open. According to the learned Public Prosecutor, it is

ridiculous to suggest that the notes would have been planted by the

</p><p id="p_28">             23. There can be no dispute regarding the fact that the

case is built on circumstantial evidence.     In a case built on

circumstantial evidence, direct proof of the culpability of the

accused is often lacking. When the case rests on circumstantial

evidence, the circumstance must be cogently and firmly

established. The circumstance must point inescapably towards the

guilt of the accused and the accused only, forming an unbroken

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.       21

chain of evidence         ruling out a reasonable likelihood of the

innocence of the accused. Where any link in the chain is missing,

the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt.         In a case of

circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish different

circumstances       beyond     reasonable  doubt   and   all  those

circumstances taken together must lead to no other inference

except the guilt of the accused. When the circumstances lead to

two equally possible inferences, the inference that goes in favour

of the accused is usually accepted. The graver the offence, stricter

the proof. When a case rests on circumstantial evidence, such

evidence must satisfy the following tests:

      words the circumstances must be incapable of

      that of the guilt of the accused; and

</p><p id="p_50">             27. One would notice that in the various decisions it

had been held that the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt unless

all the relevant circumstances are firmly established. Often it is

said that the prosecution has to prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt. The burden is on the prosecution to adduce such evidence

to exclude any reasonable doubt of the accused. It is well settled

that an accused cannot be convicted on the basis of conjectures and

surmises. Where a reasonable doubt arises in the mind of the court

after taking into consideration the entire materials before it

regarding the complicity of the accused, the benefit must go to the

accused. It has been held that the reasonable doubt must be a real

and substantial one and "well founded actual doubt arising out of

the doubt existing after consideration of all the evidence."

</p><p id="p_51">             28. The doubt must be of a reasonable mind.    But one

must remember that he is entitled to only a reasonable doubt, that is

a doubt which a rational thinking man will reasonably, honestly

and conscientiously entertain. One may say that when the incident

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.       31

is not proved, then certainly the accused is entitled to benefit of

doubt. When the evidence is probable and reasonable, and its

consideration creates a doubt in the credibility of the prosecution

case, then again the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt. It will

be useful to refer some of the decisions in this regard.

</p><p id="p_52">             29. In the decision reported in <a href="/doc/137587/" id="a_46">Gangadhar Behera v.

State of Orissa</a> ((2002) 8 SCC 381) it was held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">             "It is submitted that the benefit of doubt should be

      given on account of the co-accused's acquittal. It was

      submitted that the evidence is inadequate to fasten

      guilt, and therefore the prosecution cannot be said to

      have established its case beyond doubt.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">             Exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of

      doubt must not nurture fanciful doubts or lingering

      suspicion and thereby destroy social defence. Justice

      cannot be made sterile on the plea that it is better to let

      a hundred guilty escape than punish an innocent.</blockquote><p id="p_53">

</p><p id="p_54">      Letting the guilty escape is not doing justice according

      to law. (<a href="/doc/21652/" id="a_47">See Gurbachan Singh v. Satpal Singh</a>)

      Prosecution is not required to meet any and every

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     32

      hypothesis put forward by the accused. (<a href="/doc/141148/" id="a_48">See State of

      U.P. v. Ashok Kumar Srivastava</a>). A reasonable doubt

      is not an imaginary , trivial or merely possible doubt,

      but a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense.

      It must grow out of the evidence in the case. If a case is

      proved perfectly, it is argued that it is artificial; if a

      case has some flaws inevitable because human beings

      are prone to err, it is argued that it is too imperfect.

      One wonders whether in the meticulous hypersensitivity

      to eliminate a rare innocent from being punished, many

      guilty persons must be allowed to escape.          Proof

      beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a fetish.

      (<a href="/doc/1669125/" id="a_49">See Inder Singh v. State (Delhi Admn</a>.).           Vague

      hunches cannot take the place of judicial evaluation."

</p><p id="p_55">             30. The evidence in this case is clear to the effect that

Pintu, accused Nos. 1 and 2 were friends and knew each other very

well. In fact, first accused and late Pintu were engaged in the same

business.     First accused was fully aware of the movements of

Pintu. Prosecution has adduced sufficient evidence to show that

Pintu was found missing. The evidence indicates that P.W.42 and

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    33

others went to the house of the first accused, which was found

locked. They tried to reach him over mobile phone, but he did not

respond. The prosecution has adduced evidence to show that the

claim of the first accused the he was at Kozhikode at the relevant

time was not true. The evidence is to the effect that during the

relevant period, he had taken a room in an Inn in Mangalore.

</p><p id="p_56">             31. Before going further into the facts, the cause of

death of Pintu may be ascertained. The body of Pintu was found

floating in Mullackal Canal in Amballoor Village a few days after

he was missing. Since the police officers were unable to identify

the person, the body was buried.         However, the news was

published in newspapers.       That attracted the attention of the

relatives of late Pintu. After reading the news, they reached the

police station concerned. On seeing the articles recovered from the

body and also the photographs of the body, they were convinced

that the person whose body was retrieved was none other than

Pintu. The relatives of late Pintu after following the necessary

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    34

procedures had        the body exhumed.   P.W.41 is the Forensic

Surgeon, who conducted autopsy on the body and furnished

Ext.P29 report. Ext.P29 report gives the details of the findings of

the Forensic Surgeon. Ext.P30 is the chemical analysis report.

There were three injuries noticed by the Forensic Surgeon and they

were all incised wounds. Death was on 22.12.2001 and autopsy

was conducted on 26.12.2001.          The body had started to

decompose. The opinion of the Forensic Surgeon was that the

death must have occurred 3 to 5 days prior to 26.12.2001. Based

on Exts.P29 and 30 P.W.41 had given a definite opinion that the

cause of death was injury No.1 shown in Ext.P29.           He also

deposed before court that use of a weapon like M.O.1 can cause

injury No.1. It is also pointed out by the said doctor that injury

Nos.1 and 2 would be the result of a single act.          In cross-

examination, he deposed that if the victim occupies the left front

seat of the Maruti van and the miscreant occupies the rear seat and

then used the weapon, injury Nos. 1 and 2 can be caused. A

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    35

reading of Ext.P29 and the evidence of P.W.41 leave one in no

doubt that the death of Pintu was the result of the inflicted injury

and it was a case of homicide.
</p>
<p id="p_57">             32. M.O.17 is the Maruti van involved in this case. In

order to prove that it was acquired by the accused persons,

prosecution relied on the evidence of P.W.11, who is an auto

consultant, P.W.8, broker of automobiles, P.W.9, workshop owner

and P.W.12, who affixed sun control film in the vehicle. The

evidence of P.W.8 would show that when he was doing business

at Ayyappankavu, on 18.12.2001 the accused had approached him

and told him that they wanted to buy a Maruti Van. He

immediately took them to Thammanam and showed them a car.

They did not like it. P.W.8 was able to get down another vehicle

by evening and it was shown to accused Nos.1 and 2. They agreed

to purchase the same. Price offered was Rs.1,07,000/-, which was

accepted by P.W.11, who was the owner of the vehicle.            He

deposed regarding the payments agreed to by the parties. The

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    36

evidence shows that the vehicle was registered at Goa. He also

speaks about the execution of Ext.P7 agreement. After making the

initial payment, according to P.W.8, accused No.2 drove the

vehicle away. He then says about the subsequent developments.

</p><p id="p_58">             33. The version of P.W.11 is similar to that of P.W.8

regarding the sale of the vehicle and the purchase of the same by

accused Nos. 1 and 2. P.W.9, the workshop owner says that the

first accused had come to his workshop on 18.12.2001 itself and

told him that he would like to do some repairs to the vehicle and

would come on the next day. They came only on 24.12.2001.

P.W.12 had stated that he was asked to affix sun control film to

the vehicle. All these witnesses have identified the vehicle in court

and so also the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_59">             34. Before the court below, it is contended by the

defence that Ext.P7 is a concocted document. The court below has

rejected the said contention by giving cogent reasons. We find no

reason to differ.
</p>
<p id="p_60">Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     37

</p><p id="p_61">             35. Before this court it was contended that there was no

evidence at all to show that the blue Maruti van purchased by

accused Nos. 1 and 2 was the van into which Pintu had got in on

the ill-fated day.
</p>
<p id="p_62">             36. The contention is least attractive. The tone of the

contention is that the vehicle ought to have been placed along with

the similar vehicles and got identified. Here one needs to refer to

the evidence of P.W.4.           He runs a jewellery shop at

Changancherry. He had taken Pintu on his request in his motor

bike and dropped him near Sangeetha Gift House. He had stated

that he had seen Pintu getting into the car. Going by the evidence

of P.W. 4, P.W.5 was standing by the side of the Maruti van. But

after Pintu had got into the car, P.W.4 says that P.W.5 remained

outside and the vehicle was driven away. It is interesting to note

that though P.W.5 was declared hostile, he had deposed that he had

been at Changanacherry on the very same day. He also says that

he had occasion to see Pintu getting into the Maruti van. He also

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      38

admitted that he had occasion to see Pintu there. Then he deviated

from his earlier stand and deposed that he had not seen anybody

else in the van. He also admits that he reached Ernakulam by

about 5 p.m. on 23.12.2001. He deposed that P.W.2, Suresh Bhai

and Praveen Bhai had enquired about Pintu to him and he had told

them that he had seen Pintu at Changanacherry.             It is also

significant to note at this point that P.W.4 has categorically stated

that the Maruti van into which Pintu had got in had Goa

registration. The evidence is therefore convincing enough to show

that M.O.7 vehicle purchased by Accused Nos. 1 and 2 was the

vehicle taken to Changanacherry on 22.12.2001, and it was that

vehicle in which Pintu had got in. One must notice here that even

though P.W.5 has resiled from his earlier statement, quite a few of

his statements go in favour of the prosecution. The court is fully

justified in law in taking into account those statements in aid of the

prosecution case. It is well settled that the principle falsus in uno

falsus in omnibus        is not applicable in India. In the decision

      Thus, only because she deviated from her statement

      cannot be held to be totally unreliable.

<p id="p_65">             It is, therefore, not possible for us to accept the

      submission of Mr.Sushil Kumar that on these grounds

      alone, we should reject the testimonies of P.W.1 and

      P.W.4. It is trite that a judgment of conviction can also

      particulars."
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">             37. Therefore from the evidence of P.Ws.4 and 5, it is

clear that the Maruti Van, which was standing in the name of

accused No. 2, though purchased with joint fund of first accused,

was at Changanacherry on the relevant date and that Pintu had got

into the same.
</p>
<p id="p_68">Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    41

</p><p id="p_69">             38. The evaluation of the evidence would show that the

death of Pintu was caused after he had got into the vehicle. The

evidence of P.W.4 shows that there were two other persons in the

vehicle. His evidence also shows that Pintu had occupied the front

seat. As already noticed, there is clear evidence to show that the

vehicle at the relevant time was owned by accused Nos. 1 and 2. It

is also clear that there were other persons in the vehicle other than

Pintu. Accused Nos. 1 and 2, being the owners of the vehicle,

ought to give an explanation as to who were in the vehicle, if they

were not in it. We shall come to this aspect little later.

</p><p id="p_70">             39.    Another circumstance heavily relied on by the

prosecution was the recovery of money from accused Nos. 1 and 2.

For the purpose of proving this fact, the prosecution has examined

P.Ws. 3, 4, 6 and 7, who are the owners of jewellery shops from

where Pintu had collected money on the particular day. P.Ws. 14,

19, 20, 21 and 22 are officers of various Banks from where the

money was drawn by various persons. The prosecution also relies

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    42

on the evidence regarding the recovery of M.O.4 bag also. The

evidence of P.W.3 shows that on the day on which Pintu had come

to Changanacherry, he had paid a sum of Rs.2,14,000/-.             His

evidence also disclose that Pintu had put the currency notes in

M.O.4 bag.         P.W.4, the owner of       Thoppil Jewellery at

Changanacherry would say that he had paid Rs.2,46,510/- as price

of the gold ornaments purchased by him and Pintu had kept the

same in the said bag. P.W.4 was also able to identify the currency

notes given by him because they contained their wrappers with

letters 'TJ'. P.W.6 is the salesman of Vettikkattumattom Jewellery

at Changanacherry, who says that Pintu had come to the jewellery

shop on 22.12.2001 at about 5.30 p.m. and received Rs.10,000/-

from him. P.W.7 was running a jewellery in the name and style

Rajan Jewellery at Thiruvalla.        He would depose that on

22.12.2001 at about 4 p.m. Pintu had come to his shop and

received Rs.1,12,535/- from him. All these persons have been able

to identify the bundles of notes given to Pintu. It is also interesting

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    43

to note that these witnesses have been able to identify M.O.4 bag

and M.Os. 5, 6 and 7, which are gold rings and bracelet usually

worn by Pintu. Evidence of these witnesses are sufficient to show

that Pintu had more than Rs.5,00,000/- in his bag on that day. It

has come out in evidence that the second accused had taken the

house belonging to C.W.19, Sankaran on lease. It has also come

out in evidence that he had purchased an almirah and kept it in the

house. Ext.P17 search list prepared by P.W.53, which is attested to

by P.W.29 shows the seizure of M.O.24. The evidence of P.W.29

shows that on 3.1.2002, the police had come to the house of

Sankaran. They were able to open the lock of the house taken on

rent by accused No.2 using a duplicate key. However, since the

key of the almirah was not available, it was broken open. The

inner cabin of the almirah when opened revealed M.O.14, 15, 16,

18, 19, 23, 25, 26, 27, 36 and 37 bundles of currency notes. They

were seized as per Ext.P18 mahazar. Various other articles were

also recovered from the almirah. M.Os. 14, 15, and 16 seized

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    44

from M.O.24 almirah was identified by P.W.4 Shaji, who was

running a jewellery at Changancherry. Likewise M.Os. 18 and 19

were identified by P.W.7 Pradeep Kumar. It is significant to

notice that the Bank Officers, who were examined before the court

below also gave evidence to the effect that the respective bundles

were released from the respective Banks, and they were able to

identify the bundles so released from the Bank. The evidence also

discloses that a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- was recovered from

Sankaran, which is said to have been paid by second accused to

him in pursuance of lease agreement. It appears that in the court

below the signature of second accused in the said document was

disputed.      But the court below has undertaken the task of

comparing it with the admitted signature of accused No.2 and

found it to be similar. P.W.27, who is a neighbour of Sankaran, is

an attestor to Ext.P16 mahazar for the recovery of Rs.2 Lakhs. He

identified the currency notes also.
</p>
<p id="p_71">Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.       45

</p><p id="p_72">             40. P.W.53 had deposed that he had conducted a search

in the house, wherein accused No.1 was residing and was able to

recover M.Os. 44, 45, 46 bundles of currency notes. He also

deposed of having seized M.O.47 air pistol, M.O.21 pair of

chappals as per Ext. 31 search list.
</p>
<p id="p_73">             41. A contention was raised that Accused Nos.1 and 2

were affluent enough and there is nothing surprising if they were

found to have kept money. There is nothing to indicate that the

notes so recovered were the ones received by Pintu, it is pointed

out.
</p>
<p id="p_74">             42. First of all, there is no claim by accused Nos. 1 and

2 that the money belongs to them. As regards the identity of the

notes is concerned, the evidence has already been discussed. May

be there are slight infirmities in the identification of the notes.

However, the evidence of P.W.4 is clinching in this regard. But

the fact remains that several jewellers had paid money to Pintu and

Pintu had kept those amounts in M.O.4 bag. There is no reason as

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     46

to why they should speak falsehood before court. It is too much to

believe that the investigating officer would have placed those

bundles of currency notes in the respective places and made a

mock recovery. The amount comes to more than Rs.Six Lakhs. It

is inconceivable that the investigating officer would have ventured

to place the notes recovered from the M.O.24 almirah and then

make a show of recovery.
</p>
<p id="p_75">             43.    We are not forgetting the fact that there is a

contention by the second accused that after he had taken the house

on rent he had bought an almirah and placed it inside the house, he

had left the place much before 22.12.2001. Thereafter there is

nothing to indicate that he had come back to that house and

therefore it is contended that the money could not have been placed

by him.
</p>
<p id="p_76">             44. There is no merit in the above contention. There is

nothing to indicate that accused No.2 had no access to the house at

any point of time after 22.12.2001. At any rate, it is too far fetched

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    47

to believe that somebody else would have kept the money in the

almirah and the recovery was effected.
</p>
<p id="p_77">             45. Another important item of evidence is the recovery

of M.O.4 bag and other articles. Though the prosecution attempted

to prove the recovery as one in furtherance of the confession

statement said to have been given by the 2nd accused, they failed in

their attempt. The statement given by accused No.2 was that the

first accused had given the bag to one Suresh Bhai and that if he

had been taken to that place, he would show the bag and Suresh

Bhai. As rightly noticed by the court below, the recovery based on

the confession statement cannot fall under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_53">Section 27</a> of the Indian

Evidence Act. But the fact remains that M.O.4 bag and other

articles were recovered from Suresh Bhai as indicated by accused

No.2. In fact, M.O.4 bag, which contained M.Os. 5, 6 and 7 and

other articles such as M.Os. 8, 9, 9(a), 10, 11, 13, 57 and 58 were

recovered from the house of C.W.42 Suresh Bhai. P.W.33, witness

to the seizure speaks about the same and he is a signatory to

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    48

Ext.P22 seizure mahazar. As already noticed M.Os. 5, 6 and 7 are

gold ornaments usually worn by Pintu and they were identified

even by the owners of jewellery shops at Changanacherry and

Thiruvalla, so also M.O.4 bag. Accepting that the recovery cannot

fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_54">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, it

cannot be contended that the recovery effected is of no relevance at

all. At any rate, the recovery has been effected at the behest of

accused No.2 and that is certainly a relevant fact, which goes

against the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_78">             46. Now two aspects need to be considered. It has

been found that on 22.12.2001 by about 7.45 p.m. Pintu had got

into a Maruti Van at Chanaganacherry from the place in front of

Sangeetha Gift House. The accused have taken up a contention that

there is no evidence at all to indicate that they were in the vehicle

at that time. The claim of the accused persons that there is no

evidence to show that the Maruti Car into which Pintu is alleged to

have got in is not the car produced before court has already been

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    49

rejected. The fact that the belongings of Pintu were recovered

from the possession of accused Nos.1 and 2 cast an obligation on

them to explain their possession.     When it is found that the

belongings of Pintu were in their possession, one may go back to

the incident on 22.12.2001. Pintu got into the Maruti van and the

Maruti Van drove away from Changanacherry. It could thus be

seen that Pintu was last seen entering the Maruti van, which, as

already found, had been purchased by the second accused along

with the first accused. Since there is dearth of evidence to show

that accused Nos. 1 and 2 were in the Maruti van at the relevant

time, it may not be possible to say that Pintu was last seen in the

company of these two persons.
</p>
<p id="p_79">             47. But the above fact is of no help to the accused

persons. The evidence clearly shows that the articles belonging to

Pintu, namely, (i) M.O.4 bag, (ii) M.Os.5, 6 and 7 ornaments,

which Pintu usually wears and (iii) the currency notes, which were

given to Pintu by various jewellers at Changanacherry and

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.        50

Thiruvalla found to be in the possession of the accused persons

soon after the murder cast an obligation on the accused to explain

their possession. It might be remembered that among the various

jewellers, at least P.W.4 was able to specifically identify the notes

he had handed over to Pintu on 21.12.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_80">             48.    When the accused persons are found to be in

possession of the stolen articles soon after the death of the person,

it is presumed that the accused had a role to play in the death of the

victim.     True,     the illustrations to <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_55">Section 114</a> of the Indian

Evidence Act may not go that far. But it has been held that under

<a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_56">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act it can be presumed that in

such cases the murder was caused by the person who is found to be

in possession of the stolen articles. The issue as to whether they

were found to be in possession of the stolen articles soon after the

death as contemplated under <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_57">Section 114</a> of the Act will depend

upon the facts and circumstances of each case. There is no fixed

formula to ascertain as to what one means by 'soon after'.

      of the incriminating articles within a reasonable time

      after the incident at the places shown by the accused

      unerringly points to the involvement of the accused. Be

      it noted that the appellants who were in a position to

      explain as to how they could lay their hands on the

      stolen articles or how they had the knowledge of

      concealment of the stolen property, did nothing to

      explain: on the other hand, they denied knowledge of

      recoveries which in the light of the evidence adduced by

      the prosecution must be considered to be false. By

      omitting to explain, it must be inferred that either they

      intended to suppress the truth or invited the risk of

      the commission of offence envisaged by illustration (a)

      (1) the person giving information must be an accused of

      In the present case it cannot be disputed that although

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    55

      the essential requirements existed on the day when

      allowed to be given in evidence because if such an

      false.     In the present case as discussed above the

      confessional statement of the disclosure made by the

      confessional statement was made only when the articles

      were already discovered having been produced by the

      accused.      Similarly the decision rendered in Abdul

      Sattar (AIR 1986 SC 1438) also does not help the

      appellants in the present case. In the case of Abdul

      Sattar recovery of wearing apparels of the deceased is

      said to have been made at the instance of the accused

      of that case more than three weeks after the occurrence

      from a public place accessible to the people of the

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     57

      locality and therefore, no reliance was placed on the

      disclosure statement and recovery of the wearing

      apparels of the deceased. But in the present case it was

      soon after the arrest of appellant Girbachan Singh that

      he took the Police Officer while in custody to the place

      where according to him he had thrown the dead body

      of Urshia wrapped by the incriminating articles. Those

      articles were not found lying on the surface of the

      ground      but they were found       after unearthing

      Khudgraha dumping ground under the hillock. Those

      articles were neither visible nor accessible to the

      people but were hidden under the ground. They were

      discovered only after the place was pointed out and it

      was unearthed by the labourers. No default therefore

      could be found with regard to the discovery and seizure

      of the incriminating articles."
</p>
<p id="p_91">             55. On going through the portion of the confession

statement in the case on hand, which is extracted in the judgment

of the court below, it can be seen that the statement does not

disclose authorship of concealment. In other words, it does not

mention that it was the author, who had concealed the chopper.

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      58

Three conclusions are possible. They are

</p><p id="p_92">      i) it was the accused, who had concealed the weapon, or

</p><p id="p_93">      ii) he had seen somebody else concealing the weapon, or

</p><p id="p_94">      iii) he has knowledge about somebody else concealing the

            weapon in that place.
</p>
<p id="p_95">In such a case it has been held that the benefit of doubt should go

to the accused.         Therefore, it may not be possible for the

prosecution to take the aid of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_71">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence

Act in the case on hand. But nevertheless it is well established that

even assuming that <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_72">Section 27</a> is not attracted, the fact that M.O.

28 chopper was recovered at the instance of accused No.1 qualifies

to be a conduct relevant under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_73">Section 8</a> of the Indian Evidence

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_96">             56.    The chemical analysis report, namely Ext.P39

shows that there were human blood stains on M.O.28 chopper.

</p><p id="p_97">             57. Prosecution also relies on the fact that M.Os.40 and

49 which are the dress said to have been worn by the first accused

at the relevant time, which were seized at the instance of first

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     59

accused. They were recovered from the residence of first accused.

Ext.P32 is the relevant mahazar and P.W.43 is the independent

witness, who supported the prosecution regarding the seizure.

Likewise, in the case of M.O.28, in this case also the chemical

analysis report showed blood stains on M.Os.40 and 49.

</p><p id="p_98">             58.    The motive alleged by the prosecution is that

accused Nos.1 and 2 wanted to rob the money which Pintu had

gone to collect. It has already been noticed that there is evidence

to show that Pintu had got into the Maruti van owned by second

accused. Later it was found that the personal belongings of Pintu

including M.O.4 bag and the cash collected by him were recovered

from the residence of the accused/their friend. Prosecution has

succeeded in its effort to prove the motive.

</p><p id="p_99">             59. One may now have a look at the case put forward

by the accused. According to the first accused he had nothing to

do with the incident. He would claim that on 22.12.2001 he had

gone to the 'Highrange' for business purpose. He returned home by

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.       60

about 7.30 p.m - 8 p.m. He was given to understand that his

nephew at Kozhikode was ill. His mother insisted that she be

taken to Kozhikode. On the next day early morning they left for

Kozhikode. He would claim that he returned to Ernakulam on

27.12.2001.      Thereafter while he was watching TV P.W.42,

Pradeep Bhai etc. came there and asked him to accompany them.

Then he was taken to the police station. As far as second accused

is concerned, he had gone to Meerut on getting information that his

father was sick. He would depose that the police had come to

Meerut and taken him into custody. He would state that he has

been falsely implicated.
</p>
<p id="p_100">             60. It is significant to notice that no evidence has been

adduced by the defence to get over the effect of the facts proved by

the prosecution. We are aware of the fact that it is not necessary

for the accused to adduce evidence in their favour and they can

rely on the evidence adduced by the prosecution to show that the

prosecution has not succeeded in establishing the case beyond

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    61

reasonable doubt. In the case on hand, the entire evidence has

already been discussed and it has been found that the

circumstances relied on by the prosecution have been established.

It has to be noticed that the claim of first accused that he was at

Calicut on 23.12.2001 cannot be accepted in view of the fact that

there is evidence adduced by the prosecution that he had been at

Mangalore. Either the non-explanation or the false explanation

given by the accused person is yet another circumstance which go

against them.
</p>
<p id="p_101">             61. The lower court has also considered in detail the

evidentiary value of the forensic report relating to the blood stains

found in the Maruti van and other articles        sent for chemical

examination.
</p>
<p id="p_102">             62. Of course the defence has been able to show some

pit holes in the prosecution case. One has to keep in mind that the

case is based on circumstantial evidence. If two views are possible,

one in favour of the accused should be accepted. But perfect proof

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.     62

is virtually impossible. Prosecution cannot be called upon to do

what is impossible. In the decision reported in <a href="/doc/845834/" id="a_74">Trimukh Maroti

Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra</a> (2006(4) KL:T 638(SC)),

wherein it was held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">             "The law does not require the prosecution to

      prove the impossible.      All that it requires is the

      establishment of such a decree of probability that a

      prudent man may, on its basis, believe in the existence

      of the fact in issue. Thus, legal proof is not necessarily

      perfect proof; often it is nothing more than a prudent

      man's estimate as to the probabilities of the case. Since

      it is exceedingly difficult, if not absolutely impossible

      for the prosecution to prove facts which are especially

      within the knowledge of the opponent or the accused, it

      is not obliged to prove them as part of its primary

      burden. The pristine rule that the burden of proof is on

      the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused should

      not be taken as a fossilised doctrine as though it admits

      no process of intelligent reasoning. The doctrine of

      presumption is not alien to the above rule, nor would it

      impair the temper of the rule. On the other hand, if the

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    63

      traditional rule relating to burden of proof of the

      prosecution is allowed to be wrapped in pedantic

      coverage, the offenders in serious offences would be the

      major beneficiaries and the society would be the

      casualty. Presumption of fact is an inference as to the

      existence of one fact from the existence of some other

      facts, unless the truth of such inference is disproved.

      Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence tht a

      fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain

      other proved facts. When inferring the existence of a

      fact from other set of proved facts, the court exercises a

      process of reasoning and reaches a logical conclusion

      as the most probable position."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_103">The proper approach would be not to start with the presumption

that the testimony and the evidence are false, but to find out if they

are sufficient to establish the facts in support of the prosecution

case. Minor inconsistencies, contradictions etc., in the evidence of

witnesses are bound to arise. Apart from the fact that human

beings are bound to error, the power of reception, retention and

re-production varies from person to person. In the case on hand,

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    64

the witnesses have only stated what they have actually seen. The

reasonable approach would to read the evidence of all the

witnesses and see whether there is any material contradiction or

inconsistency in the evidence.     The evidence of each witness

should be read as a whole and it my be ascertained whether there is

a ring of truth. The mere non-examination of a witness or non-

production of a document cannot by itself be fatal. The question as

to what degree of probability is necessary to establish the

prosecution case is a question not of logic but of prudence. It is

well established that there are no precedence in the matter of

evaluation of evidence. Each case will have to be decided on the

basis of the evidence adduced before court. The standard to be

employed is that of a reasonable and prudent man. A fact is said to

have been proved when after considering the matters before it the

court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so

probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances to act

upon the supposition that it exists. Therefore two conditions of

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.    65

mind are required. First that in which a man feels absolutely

certain of a fact, or in other words, he believes it to exist and

secondly that in which although he may not feel absolutely certain

of a fact he thinks it so probable that a prudent man would under

the circumstances act on the assumption of its existence. It has

already been observed that the benefit of doubt to which the

accused can claim is only a reasonable doubt and not the doubt of a

vacillating mind or of fleeting nature. The prosecution, in the case

on hand, has succeeded in proving the circumstances, which led

to the irresistible conclusion that the offences were committed by

the accused and the accused alone.             Men may lie, but

circumstances do not.
</p>
<p id="p_104">             63. There is no reason to believe that the accused have

been falsely implicated in this case. No such suggestion was made

to the witnesses or to the investigating officer.        It is rather

inconceivable in a case of this nature either the witnesses or the

investigating agency would enable the real culprit to escape and

Crl.Appeals.2137 &amp; 2223/2005.      66

rope in innocent persons. All the circumstances relied on by the

prosecution have been proved and they form a chain which leads to

the only conclusion that the offence must have been committed by

the accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_105">             The result is that these appeals are without merits and

they are liable to be dismissed.        We do so, confirming the

conviction and sentence passed by the court below.
