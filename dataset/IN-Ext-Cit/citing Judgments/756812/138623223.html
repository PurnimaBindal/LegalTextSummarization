        sentences were directed to run concurrently.

        written report of P.W.9 Ghanshyam Prasad (informant), in short, is

        that he got her daughgter Malti Devi married with appellant

        Awadhesh Mahto according to Hindu rites and rituals and after

        marriage she was living in her matrimonial house and whenever she

        came to her parents‟ house she disclosed her grief and also disclosed

        about assault, torture and threat meted out to her with dire

        consequence if demand of Rs.10,000/- as dowry was not fulfilled.

        Further prosecution case is that on 27.2.1992 she was killed at her

        matrimonial house and informant came to know regarding her death

        after one week of her death from the villagers and thereafter informant

        went to give application to the Officer-in-Charge of Barun Police

        Station but the same was not accepted and, as such, he filed a written

        report to the Superintendent of Police, Aurangabad on 7.3.1992 on

        which Barun P.S.Case No. 41 of 1992 was registered and police after

        investigation submitted charge sheet against all the appellants in both

        the appeals and after cognizance the case was committed to the court

        cause of death of Malti Devi due to diarrhoea while she was taken to

        hospital for treatment.

<p id="p_10">                    7. Learned trial court after conclusion of trial has convicted

        the appellants under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_17">Sections 304B</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_18">34</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_19">201</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_20">34</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_21">498A</a> IPC and

        sentenced them as stated above.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                    8. Contention of learned counsel for the appellants is that

        evidence of P.Ws. 1 to 6 clearly shows that deceased died due to

        diarrhoea while she was taken to hospital for treatment but they have

        not been declared hostile by the prosecution and P.Ws. 7 and 8 are

        formal witnesses and there is nothing in their evidence in support of

        prosecution case and the whole prosecution case is based on the

        solitary evidence of P.W.9, who has stated in his evidence about

        demand of dowry and torture and though the letter purported to have

        been written by appellant Awadhesh Mahto has been produced before

        the court as Ext.3 but the informant has himself admitted that he has

        not produced the same during investigation and, as such, the veracity

        of the same is also under cloud as the handwriting has not been

        compared with the original handwriting of the appellant. Further

        contention of learned counsel is that the letter written by the appellant

        clearly shows that the demand is with respect to opening of shop and

        does not relate to the demand of dowry and so far evidence of torture
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.256 of 2003 dt.23-02-2018

        is concerned, there is vague statement and nothing specific has been

        alleged as to when she was subjected to torture and what type of

        torture she was given and so far demand of dowry and torture are

        concerned, there is nothing specific on record and there is consistent

        evidence regarding death of the deceased who died due to diarrhoea.

</p><p id="p_12">                    9. On the other hand, learned counsel for the State has

        submitted that though the case is based on solitary evidence of P.W.9

        but the evidence of P.W.9 remains unrebutted which shows that she

        was subjected to torture due to demand of dowry and furthermore

        though it is alleged that she died of diarrhoea but no chit of paper has

        been produced on behalf of defence to show that she died due to

        disrrhoea and, as such, the conviction of the appellants appears to be

        just and proper and does not require any interference by this Court.

</p><p id="p_13">                    10. Considering the rival submissions of both sides and on

        perusal of evidence it appears that except P.W.9 none of the witnesses

        has supported the prosecution case, rather P.Ws. 1 to 6 have stated

        that she died due to disrrhoea on way to hospital and they have not

        been declared hostile by the prosecution. On the other hand, P.W.9

        has stated in his evidence that accused persons have burnt the

        deceased and he is not an eye-witness and he has not stated about

        source of information to him. Regarding submission of learned

        counsel for the State that no chit of paper has been produced by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          6/9</span>




        defence in order to show that deceased died due to disrrhoea, to my

        opinion, the prosecution has to establish the existence of all

        ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_22">Section 304B</a> IPC before invoking the presumption

        clause of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_23">Section 113B</a> of Indian Evidence Act by cogent and reliable

        evidence and it cannot take the benefit of lacuna in defence story. In

        the present case the prosecution has failed to prove that she died in

        unnatural circumstances, rather prosecution evidence shows that she

        died of diarrhoea.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                    11. So far demand of dowry is concerned, except evidence of

        P.W.9 there is nothing available on record to show that deceased died

        due to demand of dowry and torture. On the other hand, a letter has

        been produced on behalf of defence purported to have been written by

        appellant Awadhesh Mahto showing that he demanded Rs.5000/- for

        opening a shop and to my opinion such demand will not come within

        the purview of demand of dowry as has been held by Hon‟ble Apex

        Court in the case of <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_24">Appasaheb and another vs. State of

        Maharashtra</a> : (2007) 9 SCC 721 that demand for money on account

        of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic

        expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for

        dowry. Further Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/167568223/" id="a_25">Vipin Jaiswal vs.

        State of Andhra Pradesh</a> : (2013) 3 SCC 684 has held in paragraphs 9,

        10 &amp; 11 of the judgment as follows :

                    "9. We have perused the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4,
                    the father and mother of the deceased respectively.
                    We find that PW 1 has stated that at the time of
                    marriage, gold, silver articles, ornaments, TV, fridge
                    and several other household articles worth more than
                    Rs.2,50,000 were given to the appellant and after the
                    marriage, the deceased joined the appellant in his
                    house at Kagaziguda. He has, thereafter, stated that
                    the appellant used to work in a Xerox-cum-typing
                    institute in Nampally and in the sixth month after
                    marriage, the deceased came to their house and told
                    them that the appellant asked her to bring Rs.50,000
                    from them as he was intending to purchase a computer
                    and set up his own business. Similarly, PW 4 has
                    stated in her evidence that five months after the
                    marriage, the appellant sent her away to their house
                    and when she questioned her, she told that the
                    appellant was demanding Rs.50,000 and that the
                    demand for money is to purchase a computer to start
                    his own business. Thus, the evidence of PW 1 and PW
                    4 is that the demand of Rs.50,000 by the appellant
                    was made six months after the marriage and that too
                    for purchasing a computer to start his own business. It
                    is only with regard to this demand of Rs.50,000 that
                    the trial court has recorded a finding of guilt against
                    the appellant for the offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_26">Section 304B</a> IPC
                    and it is only in relation to this demand of Rs.50,000
                    for purchase of a computer to start a business made by
                    the appellant six months after the marriage that the
                    High Court has also confirmed the findings of the trial
                    court with regard to guilt of the appellant under
                    <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_27">Section 304B</a> IPC. In our view, both the trial court
                    and the High Court failed to appreciate that the
                    demand, if at all made by the appellant on the
                    deceased for purchasing a computer to start a business
                    six months after the marriage, was not in connection
                    with the marriage and was not really a "dowry
                    demand" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_28">Section 2</a> of the
                    Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.

                    Maharashtra</a> : (SCC pp. 726-27, para 11)

                    should be given or agreed to be given either directly
                    or indirectly at or before or any time after the
                    marriage and in connection with the marriage of the
                    said parties. Therefore, the giving or taking of
                    property or valuable security must have some
                    connection with the marriage of the parties and a
                    correlation between the giving or taking of property or
                    valuable security with the marriage of the parties is
                    essential. Being a penal provision it has to be strictly
                    construed. Dowry is a fairly well-known social
                    custom or practice in India. It is well-settled principle
                    of interpretation of statute that if the Act is passed
                    with reference to a particular trade, business or
                    transaction and words are used which everybody
                    conversant with that trade, business or transaction
                    knows or understands to have a particular meaning in
                    it, then the words are to be construed as having that
                    particular meaning. (<a href="/doc/505565/" id="a_30">See Union of India v. Garware

                    prosecution witnesses, and in particular PW 1 and PW
                    4, we find that they have made general allegations of
                    harassment by the appellant towards the deceased and
                    have not brought in evidence any specific acts of
