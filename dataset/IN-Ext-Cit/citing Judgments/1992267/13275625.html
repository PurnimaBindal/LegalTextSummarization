2.1      It is not clear from the pleadings of the parties and the record produced 


before   the   High   Court   and   this   Court   as   to   when   the   decision   was   taken   to 


establish 400/220 KV sub-station at East of Loni Road but this much is evident  


that   by   a   communication   sent   in   August,   2004,   the   DTL   requested   the   Delhi 


Development  Authority (for short, `the DDA') for allotment of land.   For the 


next   about   10   months   nothing   appears   to   have   happened.   Between   June   and 


October, 2005 different functionaries of DTL made some correspondence inter-


se in the matter of establishment of the sub-station. On 5/6.12.2005, Manager 


(400/220   KV   SS&amp;L)   sent   a   communication   to   the   Commissioner   (Planning), 


DDA   wherein   he   emphasized   that   establishment   of   the   sub-station   was 


necessary   to   meet   the   power   demand   of   East   Delhi   and   particularly   the 


upcoming Commonwealth Games.   In his reply dated 8.2.2006, Joint Director 


(MP),   DDA   informed   the   DTL   that   allotment   of   sites   suggested   by   it   is   not

2.2     Between January, 2006 and July, 2008, the officers of the DTL, the DDA 


and   the   Government   of   N.C.T.   of   Delhi   exchanged   letters   on   the   issue   of 


allotment  of land for the sub-station.   While the officers of DTL stressed  the 


need for early allotment of land, the officers of the DDA repeatedly expressed 


their   inability   to   allot   the   particular   site   by   pointing   out   that   the   same   was 


reserved for other purpose. On 28.07.2008, Secretary (Power), Government of 


NCT of Delhi-cum-CMD, DTL requested the DDA to change the land use of 


the particular site and inform the Government of N.C.T. of Delhi so that action  


could be taken for the acquisition of land under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_6">Section 17</a> of the Act.  In that  


letter, it was also mentioned that due to paucity of land, the DTL has proposed 


to establish a GIS indoor type sub-station which could be accommodated in a 


space of about 200 x 125 meters as against the original requirement of 700 x  


500 meters. The relevant portions of that letter are extracted below:

                for   the   allotment   of   land   in   East   Delhi.   Officers   of   Delhi

              the land in question is not acquired by DDA. It was further

              of paramount importance for strengthening the power supply 

              in East Delhi, DDA is requested to change the land use and 

              to inform GNCTD so that action be taken for acquisition of 

              the same under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_7">Section 17</a>, i.e., for the public utility.


              Earlier it was proposed to construct an outdoor 400/200 KV 

              Grid Station but keeping in view the paucity and availability 

              of   land   DTL   has   now   proposed   to   establish   a   GIS   indoor 

              type sub-station which could be accommodated in a space of 

              about 200 x 125 meters. It shall be appreciated if appropriate 

              directions are issued to the concerned officers for doing the 

              needful expeditiously."

      for   the   sub-station   and   that   barren   land   available   in   the   area   could   be

      could justify invoking of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_29">Section 17(1)</a> and (4) of the Act.  They pleaded

      there   was   no   urgency   in   the   establishment   of   the   sub-station   and   the

      17(1)</a> and (4) which resulted in depriving them of their property without 


      being heard. The appellants further pleaded that the Lieutenant Governor 


      had not applied mind on the issue of urgency and approved the proposal 


      prepared by the Land and Building Department, Government of NCT of 


      Delhi   without   satisfying   himself   that   there   was   emergent   need   for   the 


      acquisition   of   land   for   the   purpose   for   which   the   proposal   had   been 


      initiated  prior  to  August,   2004.    The  appellants  also   claimed   that  other 


      parcels of land including waste land belonging to the public authorities 


      and   the   Gaon   Sabha   were   available,   which   could   be   utilized   for

      "The   only   argument   made   was   that   urgency   was   because   of 

      ensuing Common Wealth Games and since those have already 

      concluded,   the   urgency   as   seized   to   exist.     This   is   a   myopic 

      view   of   the   requirement   for   such   a   project.     No   doubt, 

      endeavour   was   to   establish   the   sub-station   before   the 

      Commonwealth Games, 2010 but that was not the only reason 

      for   urgency.     The   primary   reason   for   urgency   was,   and 

      continuous to be, that the substation in East Delhi is needed to 

      evacuate and utilize the power generated from 1500 MW Gas 

      based   Plant   at   Bawana   which   is   being   constructed.     The 

      urgency was, and continuous to exist, i.e. the need for adequate 

      power  supply   to  the   residents  of  this city.      This is  an  urgent 

      need   keeping   in   view   the   wide   gap   between   the   demand   and 

      supply.     No   doubt,     the   plans   were   to   commission   it   before 

      Common Wealth Games.   That has not happened also because 

      of the reason that stay was granted in these proceedings.  Be as

acquisition   of   land   for   a   residential   colony   to   be   constructed   by 


Gorakhpur   Development   Authority,   Gorakhpur.   After   noticing   factual 


matrix of the case and about 16 judgments, the Court held: 




"43.   The   exceptional   and   extraordinary   power   of   doing   away 

with an enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_83">Section 5-A</a> in a case where possession 

of the land is required urgently or in an unforeseen emergency 

is   provided   in   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_84">Section   17</a>   of   the   Act.   Such   power   is   not   a 

routine   power   and   save   circumstances   warranting   immediate 

possession   it   should   not   be   lightly   invoked.   The   guideline   is 

inbuilt in <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_85">Section 17</a> itself for exercise of the exceptional power 

in dispensing with enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_86">Section 5-A</a>. Exceptional the 

power,   the   more   circumspect   the   Government   must   be   in   its 

exercise. The Government obviously, therefore, has to apply its 

mind before it dispenses with enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_87">Section 5-A</a> on the 

aspect   whether   the   urgency   is   of   such   a   nature   that   justifies 

elimination of summary enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_88">Section 5-A</a>.



</p><p id="p_50">44. A repetition of the statutory phrase in the notification that  

the State Government is satisfied that the land specified in the 

notification   is  urgently   needed   and   the   provision   contained   in 

<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_89">Section   5-A</a>   shall   not   apply,   though   may   initially   raise   a 

presumption   in   favour   of   the   Government   that   prerequisite 

conditions for exercise of such power have been satisfied,  but 

such   presumption   may   be   displaced   by   the   circumstances 

themselves   having   no   reasonable   nexus   with   the   purpose   for 

which   the   power   has   been   exercised.   Upon   challenge   being 

made   to   the   use   of   power   under   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_90">Section   17</a>,   the   Government 

must   produce   appropriate   material   before   the   court   that   the 

opinion for dispensing with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_91">Section 5-A</a> has 

been formed by the Government after due application of mind 

on the material placed before it.
</p>
<p id="p_51">

</p><p id="p_52">45. It is true that power conferred upon the Government under 

<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_92">Section   17</a>   is   administrative   and   its   opinion   is  entitled   to   due  

weight, but in a case where the opinion is formed regarding the 

urgency   based   on   considerations   not   germane   to   the   purpose, 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                                      22</span>



the judicial review of such administrative decision may become 

necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_53">

</p><p id="p_54">46. As to in what circumstances the power of emergency can be 

invoked   are   specified   in   <a href="/doc/827679/" id="a_93">Section   17(2)</a>   but   circumstances 

necessitating invocation of urgency under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_94">Section 17(1)</a> are not 

stated   in   the   provision   itself.   Generally   speaking,   the 

development of an area (for residential purposes) or a planned 

development   of   city,   takes   many   years   if   not   decades   and, 

therefore,   there   is   no   reason   why   summary   enquiry   as 

contemplated under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_95">Section 5-A</a> may not be held and objections 

of   landowners/persons   interested   may   not   be   considered.   In 

many cases,  on general assumption  likely delay in completion 

of   enquiry   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_96">Section   5-A</a>   is   set   up   as   a   reason   for 

invocation   of   extraordinary   power   in   dispensing   with   the 

enquiry   little  realising   that  an  important  and   valuable  right  of 

the person interested in the land is being taken away and with 

some effort enquiry could always be completed expeditiously.



</p><p id="p_55">47.   The   special   provision   has   been   made   in   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_97">Section   17</a>   to 

eliminate enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_98">Section 5-A</a> in deserving and cases of 

real   urgency.   The   Government   has   to   apply   its   mind   on   the 

aspect   that   urgency   is   of   such   nature   that   necessitates 

dispensation   of   enquiry   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_99">Section   5-A</a>.   We   have   already 

noticed a few decisions of this Court. There is a conflict of view 

in the two decisions of this Court viz.  Narayan Govind Gavate 

and Pista Devi. In Om Prakash this Court held that the decision 

in  Pista   Devi  must   be   confined   to   the   fact   situation   in   those 

days when it was rendered and the two-Judge Bench could not 

have   laid   down   a   proposition   contrary   to   the   decision   in 

Narayan Govind Gavate. We agree.

<p id="p_56">

</p><p id="p_57">48.   As   regards   the   issue   whether   pre-notification   and   post-

notification   delay   would   render   the   invocation   of   urgency 

power void, again the case  law is not consistent. The view of 

this   Court   has   differed   on   this   aspect   due   to   different   fact 

situation   prevailing   in   those   cases.   In   our   opinion   such   delay

       make the owner landless. The degree of care required to be taken by the

       justice into the law and it cannot be applied to defeat the ends 

       of justice, or to make the law `lifeless, absurd, stultifying, self-

       defeating   or   plainly   contrary   to   the   common   sense   of   the 

       situation'. Since the life of the law is not logic but experience 

       and   every   legal   proposition   must,   in   the   ultimate   analysis,   be 

       tested on the touchstone of pragmatic realism, the audi alteram 

       partem   rule   would,   by   the   experiential   test,   be   excluded,   if 

       importing the right to be heard has the effect of paralysing the 

       administrative   process   or   the   need   for   promptitude   or   the 

       urgency   of   the   situation   so   demands.  But   at   the   same   time   it  

       must be remembered  that this is a rule of vital importance in  

       the field of administrative law and it must not be jettisoned save  

       in very  exceptional circumstances where compulsive necessity  

       so demands. It is a wholesome rule designed to secure the rule  

       of law and the court should not be too ready to eschew it in its  

       application to a given case. True it is that in questions of this 

       kind a fanatical or doctrinaire approach should be avoided, but 

       that   does   not   mean   that   merely   because   the   traditional 

       methodology   of   a   formalised   hearing   may   have   the   effect   of 

       stultifying the exercise of the statutory power, the audi alteram 

       partem should be wholly excluded. The Court must make every  

       effort   to   salvage   this   cardinal   rule   to   the   maximum   extent  

       permissible   in   a   given   case.   It   must   not   be   forgotten   that  

       `natural   justice   is   pragmatically   flexible   and   is   amenable   to  

       capsulation   under  the   compulsive   pressure   of   circumstances'.  

       The audi alteram partem rule is not cast in a rigid mould and  

       judicial   decisions   establish   that   it   may   suffer   situational  

       modifications.   The   core   of   it   must,   however,   remain,   namely,  

       that the person affected must have a reasonable opportunity of  

       being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not  

       an empty public relations exercise."

       "43. Indeed, natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular law 

       where a spiritual touch enlivens legislation, administration and 

       adjudication,   to   make   fairness   a   creed   of   life.   It   has   many 

       colours   and   shades,   many   forms   and   shapes   and,   save   where 

       valid law excludes it, applies when people are affected by acts 

       of authority. It is the hone of healthy Government, recognised 

       from earliest times and not a mystic  testament of Judge-made 

       law.   Indeed,   from   the   legendary   days   of   Adam--and   of 

       Kautilya's Arthashastra--the rule of law has had this stamp of 

       natural   justice   which   makes   it   social   justice.   We   need   not   go 

       into these deeps for the present except to indicate that the roots 

       of natural justice and its foliage are noble and not new-fangled. 

       Today its application must  be sustained by current legislation, 

       case   law   or   other   extant   principle,   not   the   hoary   chords   of 

       legend   and   history.   Our   jurisprudence   has   sanctioned   its 

       prevalence even like the Anglo-American system."



       "48.   Once   we   understand   the   soul   of   the   rule   as   fair   play   in 

       action--and it is so--we must hold that it extends to both the 

       fields. After all, administrative power in a democratic set-up is 

       not   allergic   to   fairness   in   action   and   discretionary   executive 

       justice cannot degenerate into unilateral injustice. Nor is there 

       ground to be frightened of delay, inconvenience and expense, if 

       natural   justice   gains   access.   For   fairness   itself   is   a   flexible, 

       pragmatic   and   relative   concept,   not   a   rigid,   ritualistic   or 

       sophisticated abstraction. It is not a bull in a china shop, nor a 

       bee in one's bonnet. Its essence is good conscience in a given 

       situation: nothing more--but nothing less. The `exceptions' to 

       the rules of natural justice are a  misnomer  or rather are but a 

       shorthand form of expressing the idea that in those exclusionary 

       cases   nothing   unfair   can   be   inferred   by   not   affording   an

       same   point   that   audi   alteram   partem   is  the   justice   of   the   law, 

       without, of course, making law lifeless, absurd, stultifying, self-

       defeating   or   plainly   contrary   to   the   common   sense   of   the

       Bench   of   this   Court   emphasised   the   importance   of   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_149">Section   5-A</a>   in   the 


       following words: 
</p>
<p id="p_93">

       "7. ... Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_150">Section 5-A</a> makes it obligatory on the 

       Collector   to   give   an   objector   an   opportunity   of   being   heard. 

       After hearing all objections and making further inquiry he is to 

       make   a   report   to   the   appropriate   Government   containing   his 

       recommendation   on   the   objections.   The   decision   of   the 

       appropriate   Government   on   the   objections   is   then   final.   The 

       declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_151">Section 6</a> has to be made after the appropriate 

       Government is satisfied, on a consideration of the report, if any, 

       made   by   the   Collector   under   <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_152">Section   5-A(2)</a>.   The   legislature 

       has,   therefore,   made   complete   provisions   for   the   persons 

       interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and 

       for the disposal of their objections. It is only in cases of urgency 

       that   special   powers   have   been   conferred   on   the   appropriate 

       Government to dispense with the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_153">Section 5-A</a>."




</p><p id="p_94">21.    It is also apposite to mention that no tangible evidence was produced by 


       the respondents before the Court to show that the task of establishing the 


       sub-station   at   Mandoli   was  required   to  be   accomplished   within   a   fixed 


       schedule   and   the   urgency   was   such   that   even   few   months   time,   which 


       may have been consumed in the filing of objections by the land owners 


       and other interested persons under <a href="/doc/1229923/" id="a_154">Section 5A(1)</a> and holding of inquiry 


       by the Collector under <a href="/doc/1183388/" id="a_155">Section 5A(2)</a>, would have frustrated the project. 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                                        32</span>



It seems  that the Bench of the High Court was unduly influenced by the 


fact that consumption of power in Delhi was increasing everyday and the 


DTL was making an effort to ensure supply of power to different areas 


and for that purpose establishment of sub-station at village Mandoli was 


absolutely  imperative.  In our view,  the High Court was not justified  in 


rejecting the appellants' challenge to the invoking of urgency provisions 


on the premise that the land was required for implementation of a project 


which  would  benefit  large  section   of the  society.  It  needs no  emphasis  


that   majority   of  the  projects  undertaken   by   the   State   and   its  agencies  / 


instrumentalities,   the   implementation   of   which   requires   public   money, 


are meant to benefit the people at large or substantially large segment of 


the society.   If what the High Court has observed is treated as a correct 


statement   of  law,  then  in  all  such  cases   the  acquiring  authority  will  be  


justified in invoking <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_156">Section 17</a> of the Act and dispense with the inquiry 


contemplated   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_157">Section   5A</a>,   which   would   necessarily   result   in 


depriving   the   owner   of   his   property   without   any   opportunity   to   raise 


legitimate objection. However, as has been repeatedly held by this Court, 


the invoking of the urgency provisions can be justified only if there exists 


real emergency which cannot brook delay of even few weeks or months. 


In other words, the urgency provisions can be invoked only if even small 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                                                33</span>



       delay of few weeks or months may frustrate the public purpose for which 


       the land is sought to be acquired.   Nobody can contest that the purpose 


       for which the appellants' land and land belonging to others was sought to 


       be acquired was a public purpose but it is one thing to say that the State 


       and   its  instrumentality   wants  to   execute   a  project   of  public  importance 


       without loss of time and it is an altogether different thing to say that for 


       execution of such project, private individuals should be deprived of their 


       property without even being heard.   It appears that attention of the High 


       Court   was   not   drawn   to   the   following   observations   made   in   <a href="/doc/354241/" id="a_158">State   of

letters on the issue of allotment of land. On 28.7.2008 Secretary (Power), 


Government of NCT of Delhi-cum-CMD, DTL made a suggestion for the 


acquisition of land by invoking <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_160">Section 17</a> of the Act. This became a tool 


in   the   hands   of   the   concerned   authorities   and   the   Lieutenant   Governor 


mechanically approved the proposal contained in the file without trying 


to find out as to why the urgency provisions were being invoked after a 


time   gap   of   five   years.   If   the   sub-station   was   to   be   established   on 


emergency basis, the authorities of the DTL would not have waited for 


five  years for  the  invoking of urgency  provisions enshrined  in the Act. 


They   would   have   immediately   approached   the   Government   of   NCT   of 


Delhi and made a request that land be acquired by invoking <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_161">Section 17</a> of 


the Act. However, the fact of the matter is that the concerned officers / 


functionaries of the DTL, the DDA and the Government of NCT of Delhi 


leisurely dealt with the matter for over five years. Even after some sign of 


emergency was indicated in letter dated 9.9.2008 of the Joint Secretary 


(Power), who made a mention of the Commonwealth Games scheduled 


to   be   organised   in   October,   2010,   it   took   more   than   one   year   and   two 


months to the competent authority to issue the preliminary notification.

       upon  by  the learned Additional Solicitor General. A cursory reading of 


       the judgment in <a href="/doc/1553455/" id="a_162">Deepak Pahwa v. Lt. Governor of Delhi</a> (supra) (3-Judge 


       Bench)   gives   an   impression   that   the   proposition   contained   therein 


       supports the argument of Shri Malhotra, that pre-notification delay is not 


       relevant   for   deciding   legality   of   the   exercise   of   the   State's   power   of 


       eminent domain and invoking of the urgency provisions contained in the 


       Act   but   careful   reading   of   the   judgment   along   with   the   precedents  


       referred to in paragraph 8 makes it clear that nothing contained therein 


       can be relied upon for overlooking the time gap of five years between the 


       initiation of proposal for establishment of the sub-station and the issue of 


       notification   under   <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_163">Section  4(1)</a>   read   with   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_164">Section  17</a>   (1)  and   (4)   of  the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">       "The other ground of attack is that if regard is had to the  

       considerable   length   of   time   spent   on   inter-departmental 

       discussion before the notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_167">Section 4(1)</a> was 

       published,   it   would   be   apparent   that   there   was   no 

       justification   for   invoking   the   urgency   clause   under 

       <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_168">Section   17(4)</a>   and   dispensing   with   the   enquiry   under 

       <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_169">Section   5-A</a>.   We   are   afraid,   we   cannot   agree   with   this 

       contention.  Very   often   persons   interested   in   the   land 

       proposed to be acquired make various representations to 

       the   concerned   authorities   against   the   proposed 

       acquisition.   This   is   bound   to   result   in   a   multiplicity   of 

       enquiries,   communications   and   discussions   leading 

       invariably   to   delay   in   the   execution   of   even   urgent 

       projects.  Very   often   the  delay   makes   the   problem  more 

       and more acute and increases the urgency of the necessity 

       for acquisition. It is, therefore, not possible to agree with 

       the   submission   that   mere   pre-notification   delay   would 

       render the invocation of the urgency provisions void. We 

       however   wish   to   say   nothing   about   post-notification 

       delay.   <a href="/doc/20367/" id="a_170">In  Jage   Ram  v.  State   of   Haryana</a>   (1971)   1   SCC

       Government   or   the   party   concerned   was   lethargic   at   an 

       earlier stage is not very relevant for deciding the question 

       whether on the date on which the notification was issued, 

       there   was   urgency   or   not.   <a href="/doc/1247947/" id="a_171">In  Kasireddy   Papaiah  v.

       to   nullify   the   urgency   which   existed   at   the   time   of   the 

       issue of the notification and to hold that there was never 

       any   urgency".   In   the   result   both   the   submissions   of   the 

       learned   counsel   for   the   petitioners   are   rejected   and   the

the power corridors by the interested persons which resulted in frustration of the 


public   oriented   projects.   The   general   observations   made   in  Deepak   Pahwa's 


case cannot supply basis for approving the impugned order and the notifications 


challenged   by   the   appellants   because   it   is   neither   the   pleaded   case   of   the 


respondents   nor   it   has   been   suggested   that   the   delay   was   caused   due   to   the

       circumstances   the   Government   was   constrained   to   have 

       recourse   to   <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_183">Section   17</a>   of   the   Act.   The   Government

denied   the   allegation   that   the   facts   of   this   case   did   not 

come   within   the   scope   of   <a href="/doc/3899564/" id="a_184">Section   17(2)(c)</a>.   It   was   also

There   is   no   denying   the   fact   that   starting   of   a   new 

industry is in public interest. It is stated in the affidavit 

filed   on   behalf   of   the   State   Government   that   the   new 

State   of   Haryana   was   lacking   in   industries   and 

consequently   it   had   become   difficult   to   tackle   the 

problem of unemployment. There is also no denying the 

fact   that   the   industrialisation   of   an   area   is   in   public 

interest. That apart, the question whether the starting of 

an   industry   is   in   public   interest   or   not   is   essentially   a 

question that has to be decided by the Government. That 

is   a   socio-economic   question.   This   Court   is   not   in   a 

position   to   go   into   that   question.   So   long   as   it   is   not 

established that the acquisition is sought to be made for 

some   collateral   purpose,   the   declaration   of   the 

Government   that   it   is   made   for   a   public   purpose   is   not 

open to challenge. <a href="/doc/984542/" id="a_185">Section 6(3)</a> says that the declaration 

of the Government that the acquisition made is for public 

purpose   shall   be   conclusive   evidence   that   the   land   is 

needed for a public purpose. Unless it is shown that there 

was a colourable exercise of power, it is not open to this 

Court to go behind that declaration and find out whether 

in  a  particular  case   the  purpose  for  which  the   land  was 

needed was a public purpose or not: see  <a href="/doc/1536600/" id="a_186">Smt Somavanti 

v. State of Punjab</a> and <a href="/doc/35662889/" id="a_187">Raja Anand Brahma Shah v. State 

of U.P.  On</a> the facts of this case there can be hardly any 

doubt that the purpose for which the land was acquired is 

a public purpose.

Now coming to the question of urgency, it is clear from 

the   facts   set   out   earlier   that   there   was   urgency.   The 

Government of India was pleased to extend time for the 

completion of the project up to April 30, 1969. Therefore 

urgent   steps   had   to   be   taken   for   pushing   through   the 

project. The fact that the State Government or the party

                concerned   was   lethargic   at   an   earlier   stage   is   not   very 

                relevant for deciding the question whether on the date on 

                which the notification was issued, there was urgency or 

                not.   The   conclusion   of  the   Government   in  a   given   case 

                that   there   was   urgency   is   entitled   to   weight,   if   not 

                conclusive."

There is nothing in the aforesaid judgment which can possibly support the cause 


of the respondents. The scheme for setting up an industry by a company known 


as   Pilkington   Tiles   Ltd.   of   which   one   H.S.   Somany   was   a   promoter   was 


finalized on 26.11.1968 and the notification was issued on 14/17.3.1969. This 


shows   that   the   time   gap   between   finalization   of   the   scheme   and   the   issue   of 


preliminary notification was less than four months. Therefore, the judgment in 


Jage Ram's case could not have been relied upon for taking the view that pre-


notification   delay   cannot   be   considered   while   deciding   legality   of   the   State's 


action to invoke the urgency provisions. That apart, we have serious reservation 


whether the Court could have approved the invoking of urgency provisions for 


the acquisition of land on behalf of a private company ignoring that there is a 


separate Chapter for such acquisition.

       published in official gazette dated 25.2.1971. The writ petition was filed 


       on 16.9.1971. The High Court held that the time gap of six months was 


       not fatal to the invoking of the urgency provisions because the land was 


       acquired   for   providing   house   sites   to   the   Harijans.   There   is   nothing   in
