<p id="p_1">1.     The present suit has been filed by the plaintiffs for permanent
injunction, damages for infringement of trade mark WORLD BOOK,
passing off, dilution, unfair competition, delivery up, and rendition of

 passed restraining the defendant, its directors, officers, agents,
servants, representatives and assigns etc. from using the trade mark
WORLD BOOK or any other mark that is deceptively similar to the
plaintiffs' trade mark WORLD BOOK or any other mark that is
deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' registered trade mark WORLD
BOOK in respect of printing/publishing of books and other reference
materials and educational products, either in print or in software
versions as also on their website.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     Upon service of interim order, the defendant filed its written
statement and contested the prayer of interim order passed on 27th
May, 2013. The defendant also filed an application under Order 39
Rule 4 for vacation of an ex-parte interim order being I.A.
No.11342/2013. Another application bearing I.A. No.12459/2014 was
also filed by defendant under Order 3 Rule 4 CPC seeking certain
directions against the counsel of the plaintiffs. By this order, I propose
to decide the three pending applications.
</p><p id="p_4">The case of the plaintiffs
</p><p id="p_5">4.     The plaintiff No.1, a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of Delaware, USA, is a publisher of encyclopaedias and
other reference materials that markets hundreds of reference and
educational products in over thirty countries worldwide in more than
twelve languages. The plaintiff No.2, a company based in India, is
responsible       for   the   sales,   marketing   and   distribution        of
goods/services under the trademark/trade name WORLD BOOK. The
claim is made by the plaintiffs that they are the largest selling print
encyclopaedia in the world and well known in the business of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                           Page 2 of 57</span>
 publishing encyclopaedias and other educational reference materials
since its adoption in the year 1917. Plaintiffs' WORLD BOOK
ENCYCLOPEDIA is considered as number one selling print
encyclopaedia in the world.
</p><p id="p_6">4.1. In addition to its use as a trademark, the mark WORLD BOOK
forms part of the corporate identity and trading style of the plaintiff
No.1 as also of its subsidiaries/affiliate companies throughout the
world and their encyclopaedias and other reference materials under
the trademark/trade name WORLD BOOK are available in print,
software      versions   as   also   online   and    are    accessible at
worldbookonline.com.
</p><p id="p_7">4.2. Plaintiffs have obtained registrations of trademark WORLD
BOOK in a number of countries worldwide, covering twenty seven
countries. In India, the plaintiffs are the registered proprietor of the
trademark WORLD BOOK in respect of a wide variety of
goods/services, as detailed in para 5 of the plaint that are valid and
subsisting as on date. On the basis of the said registrations, the
plaintiffs have the exclusive right to the use of the aforesaid
trademarks in India. The products and services of the plaintiffs' under
the trademark/trade name WORLD BOOK have been commercially
available in India since 1993. They have also been advertising and
promoting trademark/trade name WORLD BOOK in various countries
including India, through print and electronic media including
magazines, television, and the internet. It is averred that the plaintiffs
own and have registered over 100 domain names, some of them are
mentioned in para 12 of the plaint. Also, there are various third party


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                           Page 3 of 57</span>
 websites that provide reference to the plaintiffs trademark/trade name
WORLD BOOK and its encyclopaedias and other reference materials
made available thereunder. The details are mentioned in Para 12 of
the plaint.
</p><p id="p_8">5.     It is averred against the defendant that the defendant is a
company registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_1">Indian Companies Act</a>, 1956 and is
engaged in the business of publication and publishing books, etc. In
the first week of September, 2012, plaintiffs discovered that the
defendant had registered a company in the name of World Book
Company Private Limited that contains the dominant and distinctive
element of the plaintiffs' trademark/trade name WORLD BOOK. On
12th September, 2012, the plaintiffs sent a cease and desist notice to
the defendant calling upon it not to use its registered trademark/trade
name WORLD BOOK as part of their corporate name. However, it is
stated that the said notice was not replied to by the defendant and
subsequently, it was also discovered that the defendant had
registered the domain name www.worldbookcompany.in                   also
website, which is stated to be deceptively and/or confusingly similar
to plaintiffs' trademark/trade name WORLD BOOK, including its
domain name worldbook.com.
</p><p id="p_9">5.1. By using the plaintiffs' proprietary trademark/trade name
WORLD BOOK and by adopting the trademark WORLD BOOK as
part of its corporate name, the defendant has committed an
infringement of the registered trademark of the plaintiffs. The act of
the defendant has resulted in deceiving the members of the trade and
public at large into believing that the offending products/services sold


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                         Page 4 of 57</span>
 and offered for sale by the defendant have some connection with the
plaintiffs, whereas in fact, no such connection exists. Since the
defendant is in the same trade of publication of books, etc. as the
plaintiffs, the public is likely to be attracted towards the defendant's
products sold under the trade name WORLD BOOK and inclined to
purchase the same under a mistaken belief and impression that they
are buying the merchandise of the plaintiffs and/or their licensees and
they have some association of any kind with the plaintiffs which in
fact is untrue.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.     The case of the defendant in the written statement is that the
words "World Book" are commonly used words found in the English
dictionary and no one can have exclusive right to use these words
which are not coined. The said words are within the public domain
cannot be claimed as exclusive proprietorship. The defendant's logo
has no resemblance to that of plaintiffs' trademark. The defendant
prints and publishes books unlike that of plaintiffs. The plaintiff has no
business in India. The documents filed by plaintiffs do not show any
advertisement in India. The plaintiffs are unknown in India, the
website owned by the plaintiffs i.e. www.worldbookindia.com does
not mention about the books.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.1. The defendant is involved in publication of novels and has
created goodwill of their own in the market. The defendant's website
www.worldbookcompany.in        also   features    the   other      websites
wbcbooks.com, wbcmart.com and ebukk.com in its webpage clearly
indicating WBC as its brand name and the name of the website of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                             Page 5 of 57</span>
 defendant is registered in the domain registry after a thorough
search. Thus, there is no confusion and deception. The defendants
are not WORLD BOOK but WORLD BOOK COMPANY PVT LTD.
registered under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The plaintiffs only
deal in publishing encyclopaedia, therefore the question of any
resemblance does not arise. Particularly no evidence is produced by
the plaintiffs about their user in India except only a few invoices which
do not indicate any kind of popularity or indication of advertisement in
India.
</p><p id="p_12">         The plaintiff No.2 was registered in India only after the
defendant registered its company. While the plaintiffs have never
published or printed their books in India, the growing popularity of the
defendant's work rather the plaintiffs with an intent to ride on the
goodwill created in the market.       The plaintiffs are attempting to
destroy the business of the defendant.
</p><p id="p_13">7.       As there is no connection whatsoever between two types of
business activities, the question of infringement does not arise. Due
to the ex parte ad interim injunction passed against the defendant
had to suffer extreme loss of reputation, goodwill and financial loss
which the plaintiffs are liable to compensate. The directors of the
company were subjected to humiliation before the investors and were
subjected to debt whereas the defendants were merely publishing
books with their own effort, creativity and hard work and were
progressing extremely well. The plaintiffs undoubtedly have ill motive
to extort money from the defendant company and have illegally
claimed exclusive rights over the words "WORLD BOOK" is a gross


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                          Page 6 of 57</span>
 abuse of the process of law.
</p><p id="p_14">8.     It has also been stated that the plaintiffs first attempt to register
the words "WORLD BOOK" as per Application No 574917, failed as
Status- Abandoned, as per records and subsequent attempt to
register the words WORLD BOOK was later registered as unopposed
with a condition and limitation, i.e. disclaimer imposed to the effect
that the registered proprietor shall have no exclusive rights over the
word BOOK separately.         Thus, the condition and limitation of the
word "BOOK" would show that as per <a href="/doc/1697073/" id="a_2">Section 17</a> of the Act, the
words "WORLD BOOK" are common and no monopoly can be
granted. The word "BOOK" has to be ignored while comparing the
mark. Under these circumstances, the interim order passed by the
Court is liable to be vacated, as no case is made out by the plaintiffs
against the defendant who has already obtained the registration of its
corporate name under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_15">9.     In case submissions of both parties are examined carefully, the
following are the main issues which are to be decided at this interim
stage:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (i)   Whether the case of infringement is made out by the
            plaintiffs against the defendant?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (ii) Whether the defendant is passing off its business and
           services as that of the plaintiffs?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (iii) Whether the plaintiffs are the prior user of the
            mark/name WORLD BOOK and has it acquired goodwill
            and reputation in India and abroad?
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                             Page 7 of 57</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       (iv) Whether the mark/name WORLD BOOK is common to
           trade and publici juris?

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (v) Whether the use of Domain Name by the defendant is
          similar?
</blockquote><p id="p_16">Goodwill and Reputation
</p><p id="p_17">10.    Learned counsel for the defendant argued that there are
innumerable "WORLD BOOK" in combination used worldwide by
different owners and therefore it is impossible for the defendant to
say which "WORLD BOOK" the plaintiffs represent. The words
"WORLD BOOK" are common English words widely used worldwide
by different owners and very general in nature and therefore
monopoly rights by one owner cannot be accorded. The plaintiffs
Trade Mark in America clearly shows the two words with a Globe
device. It is completely incorrect to say that the plaintiff's have any
rights over the words in combination. The plaintiffs have tried to
mislead this Court by mentioning in their interim application that they
have been given rights in combination which is absolutely false and
misleading. It has been argued that dictionary words cannot be
monopolized and directly referring/defining the product cannot be
anyone's sole exclusivity i.e. world of books.
</p><p id="p_18">       The learned counsel for the defendant has also argued that the
word "WORLD" is also a generic term and widely used by several
hundreds of different owners. Some of the trade marks registered in
India with the word "WORLD" are - WORLDTECH, WORLDCARD
INTERNATIONAL,        WORLDLINK,       WORLD      SERIES,      WORLD
TRAVELLER, WORLD CUP etc. Some of the trade marks registered

 around the world with the word "WORLD" are WORLD HEALTH
ORGANIZATION, WORLD CUP FOOTBALL etc. These words are in
public domain for decades. It is also argued that the WORLD BOOK
in combination is used worldwide by different owners:

</p><p id="p_32">11.    It is alleged by him that the words WORLD BOOK when written
in reverse i.e. BOOK WORLD is also owned by innumerable different
owners worldwide. The words "WORLD SCHOOL" similarly are two
generic words combined together to form a meaning and directly




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                     Page 9 of 57</span>
 referring to what they do therefore open to the world for use and are
being used. An example of WORLD SCHOOL is given below:
</p>
<p id="p_33">    GREATER NOIDA WORLD SCHOOL.
</p>
<p id="p_34">    FORTUNE WORLD SCHOOL.
</p>
<p id="p_35">    SANSKAR WORLD SCHOOL.
</p>
<p id="p_36">    KAUSHALYA WORLD SCHOOL ETC.
</p>
<p id="p_37">       It is also argued by him that the words which are of common
use in a language can be adopted by a trader or manufacturers as is
evident from the definition of "mark" under <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_4">Section 2(m)</a> of the Trade
Marks Act.
</p><p id="p_38">12.    It is rightly held in many cases decided by the courts that
Infringement of a registered trademark is caused by the use of the
mark which is identical or nearly resembling to that of registered
trademark in respect of the same, similar or different goods in terms
of provisions of the Act. In that sense, the remedy of infringement is
statutorily conferred upon the registered proprietor.   On the other
hand, passing off action is an action in common law which is
essentially the protection of goodwill and reputation which the person
has created by virtue of carrying out of business activities under a
particular name and style or under a brand name for that matter and
the said action is an action in deceit which is to prevent any
misrepresentation     caused     amongst      public.    The        said
misrepresentation may be in the form of innocent representation or
deliberate representation which is immaterial in the case of passing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                       Page 10 of 57</span>
 off. Actual deception is not required for the party who is infringing the
legal rights of the rightful person even using the name innocently. In
fact, for the purpose of deciding the case of infringement of trade
mark, the plaintiff has not to establish at the initial stage that such
adoption was in bad faith.

</p><p id="p_40">13.    I have heard learned counsel for both the parties who have
made their submissions at bar. It is necessary to discuss <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_5">Section 29</a>
of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 that envisages the law relating to
infringement of a registered trademark and <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_6">Section 28</a> of the Act that
provides for exclusive rights granted by virtue of registration. The said
provisions read as under:-

<a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_7">Section 29</a> of the Act are that the plaintiff's mark must be registered
under the Act; the defendant's mark is identical with or deceptively
similar to the registered trade mark; and the defendant's use of the
mark is in the course of trade in respect of the goods covered by the
registered trade mark. The rival marks are to be compared as a
whole. Where two rival marks are identical, it is not necessary for
the plaintiff to prove further that the use of defendant's trademark is
likely to deceive and cause confusion as the registration shows the
title of the registered proprietor and the things speak for themselves.
In an infringement action, once a mark is used as indicating
commercial origin by the defendant, no amount of added matter
intended to show the true origin of the goods can effect the question.
If Court finds that the defendant's mark is closely, visually and
phonetically similar, even then no further proof is necessary.

</p><p id="p_64">23.    The fundamental difference that passing off is an action which
essentially protects goodwill and not the unregistered trademark has



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                          Page 21 of 57</span>
 been explained in the case of Star Industrial Co. Ltd. v. Yap Kwee
Kor [1976] Fleet Street Patent Law Reports 256 decided by Privy
Council comprising Lord Diplock in his speech wherein it has been
observed that passing off is an action which is to preserve the
goodwill of a person and not aimed at to protect an unregistered
trademark. In the words of Lord Diplock, it has been observed as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">        "Whatever doubts there may have previously been as to
        the legal nature of the rights which were entitled to
        protection by an action for "passing off" in courts of law or
        equity, these were laid to rest more than 60 years ago by
        the speech of Lord Parker of the Waddington in A.G.
        Spalding &amp; Bros. v. A.W. Gamage Ltd. (1915) 32 R.P.C.
        273 ("the Gamage Case") with which the other members of
        the House of Lords agreed. A passing off action is a
        remedy for the invasion of a right of property not in the
        mark, name or get up improperly used, but in the business
        or goodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation
        made by passing-off one person's goods as the goods of
        another. Goodwill, as the subject of proprietary rights, is
        incapable of subsisting by itself. It has no independent
        existence apart from the business to which it is attached. It
        is local in character and divisible; if the business is carried
        on in several countries a separate goodwill attaches to it in
        each. So when the business is carried abandoned in one
        country in which it is acquired a goodwill the goodwill in
        that country perishes with it although the business may
        continue to be carried on in other countries. Once the Hong
        Kong Company had abandoned that part of its former
        business that consisted in manufacturing toothbrushes for
        export to and sale in Singapore it ceased to have any
        proprietary rights in Singapore which was entitled to
        protection in any action for passing-off brought in the courts
        of that country."
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                          Page 22 of 57</span>
<p id="p_65"> 24.    From the reading of the said observation of Lord Diplock's
speech, it is clear that the gist of passing action is goodwill and
reputation      which   is   sought   to   be   protected   and    thereby
misrepresentation is prevented in the course of trade. It is altogether
different matter that misrepresentation may include the use of mark in
the course of trade and ultimate effect of passing off action in most of
the cases is protection of the trademark anyway, but the heart and
soul of the passing off action has always been protection of goodwill
and reputation aimed at to prevent misrepresentation.
</p><p id="p_66">25.    One of the essential ingredients is goodwill. The classic case of
passing off as it existed since its genesis always insist the existence
of goodwill of a merchant in order to give him a locally enforceable
right to sue for passing off. This has been explained by Kerly's in his
book called Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (Fourteenth
Edition) (South Asian Edition 2007), wherein the concept of goodwill
has always been categorized as local in character and the learned
author observed thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">        "Since an essential ingredient of passing off is damage (or
        prospective damage) to goodwill, he (the Plaintiff) must
        show that he had, at the date when the Defendants started
        up, in this country not merely a reputation but a goodwill
        capable of being damaged. Goodwill, however, is local; it is
        situated where the business is. Thus a foreign claimant
        may have a reputation in this country-from travellers or
        periodicals of international circulation or, increasingly, from
        exposure on the Internet-yet still fail in an action for
        passing off because he has here no business and so no
        goodwill. Such cases have been not uncommon in recent
        years, and have caused considerable difficulty. Where
        there is a substantial reputation here, our courts will often


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                          Page 23 of 57</span>
         accept minimal evidence that a business exists here, but
        there has to be some".
</blockquote><p id="p_67">26.    This concept of goodwill and the insistence of localized
business has been traditional concept of passing off which
sometimes is called as classic case of passing off. However, this
concept of passing off has undergone changes due to advent of
technology and modernization. For the said reason the tendency to
insist localized goodwill has been transformed into proving reputation
of a global character. All this would mean that courts entertaining the
case of passing off can discount the localized existence of goodwill
and the business in the territory specific if the substantial nature of
reputation has been proved which has some kind of nexus in the
territory where the protection is sought and the said concept in the
modern language is called trans-border reputation whereas the
goodwill is always local in character, the concept of reputation is
dynamic and is all encompassing. The reputation of a person can
transcend boundaries by virtue of its advertisement in the
newspapers, media circulation, expatriate reputation due to cultural
akin ness and all other relevant factors which connect one countries
business with that of another. This has been aptly explained by the

the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_16">N.R. Dongre and
Ors. vs Whirlpool Corpn. and Anr</a>., 1996 (2) ARB.LR 488 SC
wherein J.S. Verma, J. speaking for the Bench again reiterated the
exposition of law laid down by the Division Bench of Delhi High Court.
This exposition of 1996 in the case of Whirlpool [supra] has been
further revisited by the courts in India more importantly in the case of
<a href="/doc/1913188/" id="a_17">Allergan Inc. v. Milment Oftho Industries</a>, 1999 PTC (19) (DB) 160
wherein Ruma Pal, J. has carefully analyzed the interplay between
the goodwill and reputation in a case of passing off action and has
laid down that the courts in India have followed the third approach
which is a middle path wherein strict insistence of localized business
is not necessary. However, reputation which is sought to be protected
has to be substantial one having global character. The observation
made by Hon'ble Judge is as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">        "13. Reputation is the connection that the public makes
        between a particular product or service and a particular
        source which may or may not be known. Some Courts
        have held that reputation which is built up on the basis of
        trade within the country is entitled to protection from
        passing off. Others Court have made some concession to
        the communication explosion and held that if the plaintiff


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                        Page 25 of 57</span>
         has a reputation in another country, his right to the mark
        will be protected if it is coupled with some actual or
        proposed business activity within the country (See Alain
        Beniardin et Cie v. Pavilion Properties, (1967) RFC 581;
        Amway Corporation. v. Eurway Int. Ltd. (1974) RFC
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">        82."Still other Courts have held that with the increase in
        international commerce, mass media communications and
        the frequency of the foreign travel, political and geographic
        boundaries do not stem the exchange of ideas and instant
        information. Local business is not an essential ingredient of
        a passing off action. However, the reputation must be well
        established or a known one See : Panhard et Levassor v.
        Panhard Motor Co. Ltd., (1901) 18 RPC 405; Sheraton
        Corpn. v. Sheraton Motels, (1964) RPC 202; Orkin
        Exterminating Co. Tnd. v. Pest Co. of Canada (1985) 5
        Canadian Patent Reporter 433; Vitamins L. D.'s Application
        for Trademark, 1956 (1) RPC 1. The decisions which
        reflect the first and second view have so held for reasons
        which are partly historic, partly geographic and partly
        because reputation was equated with goodwill. Goodwill
        has been defined as the benefit derived from reputation. It
        is not the reputation required to found a passing off action.
        The law of passing off is not trammelled by definitions of
        goodwill developed in the field of revenue law [per
        <a href="/doc/1783722/" id="a_18">Hockhart J., Conagra Inc. v. McCain Foods (Aust) P. Ltd</a>.,
        1993 (23) IPR 193 231]. It is an asset of a business
        assessable in terms of money and transferable (See IRC v.
        Muller, (1901) AC 217, Trego v. Hunt (1896) AC 7; ITC v.
        B.C. Srinivas Shetty. In my opinion reputation framing the
        basis of a passing off action need not be so localised.
        Whatever the compulsion for the Courts taking the first or
        second view in other countries, as far as this country is
        concerned, Courts in India prescribe to the third view and
        have held that a plaintiff with a reputation which is
        established internationally can sue to protect it in this
        country even if it does not have any business activity here.
        In other words reputation of a product may precede its
        introduction and may exist without trade in such product in

passed by Division Bench of Kolkata High Court has been further
approved by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_22">Milment
Oftho Industries v. Allergan Inc</a>., (2004) 12 SCC 624 presided by
S.N. Variava, J. wherein the Supreme court has laid down that :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">        "It must also be remembered that nowadays goods are
        widely advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines
        and other media which is available in the country. This
        results in a product acquiring a worldwide reputation. Thus,
        if a mark in respect of a drug is associated with the
        Respondents worldwide it would lead to an anomalous
        situation if an identical mark in respect of a similar drug is
        allowed to be sold in India. However one note of caution
        must be expressed. Multinational corporations, who have
        no intention of coming to India or introducing their product
        in India should not be allowed to throttle an Indian
        Company by not permitting it to sell a product in India, if the
        Indian Company has genuinely adopted the mark and
        developed the product and is first in the market. Thus the
        ultimate test should be who is first in the market".
</blockquote><p id="p_70">It was further observed on the facts of the case as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">        "(9) In the present case, the marks are the same. They are
        in respect of pharmaceutical products. The mere fact that
        the Respondents have not been using the mark in India
        would be irrelevant if they were first in the world market.
        The Division bench had relied upon material which prima
        facie shows that the Respondents product was advertised
        before the Appellants entered the field. On the basis of that

         material the Division Bench has concluded that the
        Respondents were first to adopt the mark. If that be so then
        no fault can be found with the conclusion drawn by the
        Division Bench."
</blockquote><p id="p_71">29.    The Courts in India have started recognizing the global
character of the brand names and have started giving them
protection merely on the basis of global nature of reputation without
insisting any localized business which was significant departure from
the classic trinity laid down by Lord Diplock in the case of Erven
Warnink (Supra).      The position of law uptill Milment has been
followed that the courts in India by placing reliance on the said
decision have proceeded to grant interim orders to the multi-nationals
having their brands which are of global character and prevented the
misuse of the said brands by protecting trans-border reputation
subject to fulfilling of essential characteristics necessary to prove
trans-border reputation. The decision in the case of Milment was also
rendered in the year 2004 when the impact of internet, e-commerce,
social media was yet to be seen and realized.

<p id="p_72">30.    Recently, this Court has rendered a decision in the case of
<a href="/doc/93036610/" id="a_23">Cadbury UK Limited &amp; Anr vs. Lotted India Corporation Ltd</a>.,
reported in 2014 (57) PTC 422 (Delhi) wherein the decision of law
relating to trans-border reputation has been further strengthened and
has been taken to another level wherein the court has not merely
relied upon the decision of Milment (Supra) and Whirlpool (Supra)
but has also extended the principle of trans-border reputation by
observing that the existence of a merchant on web pages which are


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                        Page 28 of 57</span>
 of foreign origin and social media are sufficient to show the trans-
border nature of reputation without having any activity in India at the
relevant time. Though it is very broad extension of the concept of
trans-border reputation, but it is a question of fact in each case as to
how the internet documents are sufficient to show the global
character of the trademark and the reputation attached to the same.
The impact of the said decision which has been given very recently is
yet to be seen and analyzed by the other courts in India in the
upcoming times. Effectively, the concept of trans-border reputation
and goodwill is interesting in academic sense. However, due to
advent of internet media, international travel, the insistence on the
localized business as well as trans-border reputation is nowadays
more or less dealt with in a kind of presumptive approach rather than
by actual establishment of the same. As the international businesses
grow and proximity between the markets would increase, over the
time this concept will become weaker and on one good day world will
be treated as one market.

        (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 12th Edn., para
        16.49), the name under which a business trades will almost
        always be a trade mark (or if the business provides
        services, a service mark, or both). Independently of
        questions of trade or service mark, however, the name of a
        business (a trading business or any other) will normally

        limited to the date of the proceedings; the court will have
        regard to the way in which the business may be carried on
        in the future, and to its not being carried on precisely as
        carried on at the date of the proceedings. Where there is

        goodwill. So to sell merchandise or carry on business

        a manner as to mislead the public into believing that the
        merchandise or business is that of another person is a

        of injury is commonly, though awkwardly, termed that of
        passing-off one's goods or business as the goods or
        business of another and is the most important example of
        the wrong of injurious falsehood. The gist of the conception
        of passing-off is that the goods are in effect telling a
        falsehood about themselves, are saying something about
        themselves which is calculated to mislead. The law on this
        matter is designed to protect traders against that
        form of unfair competition which consists in acquiring
        for oneself, by means of false or misleading devices,
        the benefit of the reputation already achieved by rival
        traders."

associate the business with the Plaintiff such as the name of the
business, whether real or adopted, the mark, design, make-up or
colour of the plaintiffs' goods, the distinctive characteristics of the

such indicia that passing off actions arise. The Court held that the

justification for the injunction.

Competition must remain free. This is the life blood of free enterprise

field of activity. The question arises whether the Defendants are
misleading the public into buying their goods in the belief that they

defendants in these cases start their business fully aware of the fame
of the Plaintiffs name and mark. They want to cash in on the
popularity of the Plaintiffs product. Whether the goods are inferior or
superior, every infringement is, in the way tribute to the excellence of
the Plaintiffs wares. It is a major of the popularity of Plaintiffs goods.

length by referring the facts of the matter. The said narration of facts
are as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">        ".......The words of common language which were held to
        be exclusively appropriated by Reddaway, in that case
        were 'Camel Hair". What was asserted in the Reddaway's

        various persons; that the beltings used to be sold under the
        name of various animals like Yak, Llama, Buffalo, Crocodile

        was their one time employee and that he had started selling
        the beltings under the name 'Camel Hair"; Reddaway also
        asserted that they were entitled to stop others, like

        respect to the beltings manufactured by them.

        sold very large quantities of beltings as 'camel beltings' and

        understood in all the places where their beltings was sold,
        to indicate goods to be of plaintiffs manufacture. It was also

        beltings, which belting was not made by the plaintiffs and

        Belting was a true description of the goods, and that it was
        the name by which a person wanting to buy goods would
        ask for them. Again a judgment was given for the
        Defendants. The plaintiffs then appealed to the House of

        capable of exclusively appropriation, that the words 'Camel
        Hair Belting' have acquired a secondary signification with
        respect to the beltings in the sense that the words 'Camel

        primary meaning, to indicate belting made of camel hair,
        but has acquired a secondary significance or meaning in
        the trade, and came to connote the products of the

         evidence to justify the finding that amongst those who were
        the purchasers of such goods, the words "Camel Hair" were
        not applied to beltings made of that material in general; that
        in short, it did not mean in the market belting made of a
        particular material, but belting made by a particular
        manufacturer. The House of Lords thus came to the
        conclusion that common words of a language can be
        exclusively appropriated to a particular manufacturer as
        they had acquired a special meaning as denoting the goods
        of a particular manufacturer/ trader.

        not have any meaning in the language; and at page 228

        meaningless except as indicating by whom the goods in
        connection with which it is used were made, there could be
        no conceivable legitimate use of it by another person".
        Thus the "coined" "created", "Fancy", or "new" words which
        were not in use in any language before, and which did not
        have any meaning in the ordinary language, us evidenced
        by their absence in authoritative and standard language
        dictionaries, were the exclusive property of the person who
        first "coined", or created them and adopted them for use,
        and used it in connection with any article the only reason
        why a hitherto meaningless word would be used by another
        in connection with his activities would be to deceive the
        public, that the letters article, thing or goods or the articles,
        thing or goods of the former. He also observed that "he was
        unable to see why a man should be allowed in this way,
        more than in any other, to deceive purchasers into the
        belief that they are getting what they are not, and thus to
        filch the business of a rival".

DEFENCE, ARUN and ML unless they acquired reputation and
goodwill or assumed secondary significance. Here, interestingly, the
defendant, itself claims to the exclusive right to use LITE (in
combination with common words) in relation to similar products, such
as electric torches and flashlights, and relies on marks such as
SPOTLITE, PENLITE, CITYLITE, etc. The plaintiff submits therefore
that the defendant cannot challenge the plaintiff's mark as
descriptive, or not being distinctive. <a href="/doc/1221147/" id="a_28">In Automatic Electric Limited v.
R.K. Dhawan</a> 1999 (19) PTC 81 (Del) this Court held that as the
defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary right and
monopoly in DIMMER DOT, it did not lie in their mouth to say that the
word DIMMER was generic. There too, the plaintiff's mark was with a
disclaimer. In view of these circumstances, it is held that the
defendant cannot say that the HOMELITE mark or HOME, or LITE,
separately are descriptive; they are in any case, arbitrary in relation
to electrical torches and flashlights. HOMELITE does not conjure the
vision only of a portable electrical light; it is associated with a range of
home lighting.

that of the Plaintiffs' prior adopted, used, registered &amp; famous trade

which is in the business of publication from the year 1917.               The
plaintiff No.1 has also established its extensive use, goodwill and
reputation accrued to the said mark. The plaintiff No.2 is a wholly
owned subsidiary of plaintiff No.1 which may have been incorporated
few months later than the incorporation of Defendant's company, but
the said fact is of no consequence as the Defendant is much
subsequent to the international adoption, use, goodwill and reputation
of the said mark in India from a date much interior and prior to the

must also keep in mind the fact that nowadays the field of medicine is
of an international character. The Court has to keep in mind the
possibility that with the passage of time, some conflict may occur
between the use of the mark by the Applicant in India and the user by
the overseas company. It was further observed that it must also be
remembered that nowadays goods are widely advertised in
newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other media which is
available in the country. This results in a product acquiring a
worldwide reputation. Thus, if a mark in respect of a drug is
associated with the Respondents worldwide it would lead to an
anomalous situation if an identical mark in respect of a similar drug is

 coming to India or introducing their product in India should not be
allowed to throttle an Indian Company by not permitting it to sell a
product in India, if the Indian Company has genuinely adopted the

its rights in the mark/name WOLRD BOOK as whole and not on the

Mark/trade name WORLD BOOK in the same business with
dishonest intention in a calculated attempt to ride upon the goodwill

infringement          of   trademark WORLD BOOK. In view of              the
documentary evidence available on record, it is also established by
the plaintiffs that the said name/mark is a well-known trade mark
which cannot be by the defendant as part of its corporate name and
the same violates the provisions of sub-rule 4 and 5 of section of 2 of
<a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_31">Section 29</a> of the Trade Marks Act. The defendant under these
circumstances is guilty for infringement of trade marks and passing
off of its business and services as that of the plaintiffs who have
made a classic case of passing off. There is no justification on the
part of defendant to use the impugned name on its corporate
company. The defendant must be aware about the name of plaintiffs
on the date of its adoption and user. Thus, the use of said name is
tainted and dishonest which cannot be purified in any manner. The
stolen property cannot become rightful property in any many in trade
mark and trade name cases.

<p id="p_104"> Domain names

</p><p id="p_105">49.    With regard to domain names, it has been stated that generic
domain names are available for registration on a first come first serve
basis under the INDRP. Therefore, the plaintiffs' claim of registration
of 100 or more domain names are an example of non exclusivity an
attempt to buy each and every domain names available with the
letters of these words. However there are other owners of world book
in combination such as worldbookmart.com, worldbooks.com,
worldbookday.com,         worldbooknight.com,          worldofbooks.com,

world for use and cannot be monopolized by anyone being dictionary
words and directly referring to the product for use.
</p><p id="p_106">       So far as the issue of protection of domain names is
concerned, the law relating to the passing off is well settled. The
principle underlying the action is that no one is entitled to carry on his
business in such a way as to lead to the belief that he is carrying on
the business of another man or to lead to believe that he is carrying
on or has any connection with the business carried by another man. It
is undisputed fact that a domain name serves the same function as
the trade mark and is not a mere address or like finding number on
the Internet and, therefore, is entitled to equal protection as a trade
mark. A domain name is more than a mere Internet Address for it
also identifies the Internet site to those who reach it, much like a
person's name identifies a particular person, or as more relevant to
trade mark disputes, a company's name identifies a specific
company.

and the trade mark law applies to the activities on internet. The mere
fact that petitioner has no registered domain name by itself may not
stand in the way of a passing off action. The following are the
decisions in which the domain name is protected by the Courts:
</p><p id="p_108">(i)    In Marks and Spencer v. One in a Million, (1998) FSR 265, it
       was held that any person who deliberately registers a domain
       name on account of its similarity to the name, brand name or
       trade mark of an unconnected commercial organization must
       expect to find himself on the receiving end of an injunction to
       restrain the threat of passing off, and the injunction will be in
       terms which will make the name commercially useless to the
       dealer. It was held in that decision that the name MARKS &amp;
       SPENCER could not have been chosen for any other reasons
       than that it was associated with the well known retailing group.
       The decision further goes on to say that when the value of the
       name consists solely in its resemblance to the name or trade
       mark of another enterprise, the court will normally assume that
       the public is likely to be deceived, for why else would the
       defendants choose it ? It was also stated that someone seeking
       or coming upon a website called http://marksandspencer.co.uk
       would naturally assume that it was that of the plaintiffs.

              instead of another. This may occur in e- commerce
              with its rapid progress and instant (and theoretically
              limitless) accessibility to users and potential customers
              and particularly so in areas of specific overlap.
              Ordinary consumers/users seeking to locate the
              functions available under one domain name may be
              confused if they accidentally arrived at a different but
              similar web site which offers no such services. Such
              users could well conclude that the first domain name
              owner had mis-represented its goods or services
              through its promotional activities and the first domain
              owner would thereby lose their custom. It is apparent
              therefore that a domain name may have all the
              characteristics of a trademark and could found an
              action for passing off."

               be in terms which will make the name commercially
              useless to the dealer. It was held in the said decision
              that the name 'marks and spencer' could not have
              been chosen for any other reason than that it was
              associated with the well-known retailing group. The
              decision further goes on to say that where the value of
              a name consists solely in its resemblance to the name
              or trade mark of another enterprise, the Court will
              normally assume that the public is likely to be
              deceived, for why else would the defendants choose
              it? It was also said that someone seeking or coming
              upon a website called http:// marksandspencer.co.uk
              would naturally assume that it was that of the plaintiffs.
              Thus, it is seen that although the word 'services' may
              not find place in the expression used in
              <a href="/doc/1580823/" id="a_35">Sections 27</a> and <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_36">29</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_37">Merchandise
              Marks Act</a>, services rendered have come to be
              recognised for an action of passing off. Thus law of
              passing off is an action under the common law which
              also is given a statutory recognition in the Trade Mark
              Act. Thus in the context and light of the aforesaid
              decisions and the development in the concept of law of
              passing off, it is too late in the day to submit that
              passing off action cannot be maintained as against
              services as it could be maintained for goods.

<p id="p_117">              12. The services of the plaintiff under the
              trademark/domain name 'Yahoo!' have been widely
              publicised and written about globally. In an Internet
              service, a particular Internet site could be reached by
              anyone anywhere in the world who proposes to visit
              the said Internet site. With the advancement and
              progress in technology, services rendered in the
              Internet has also come to be recognised and accepted
              and are being given protection so as to protect such
              provider of service from passing off the services
              rendered by others as that of the Plaintiff. As a matter
              of fact in a matter where services rendered through the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                           Page 51 of 57</span>
               domain name in the Internet, a very alert vigil is
              necessary and a strict view is to be taken for its easy
              access and reach by anyone from any corner of the
              globe. There can be no two opinions that the two
              marks/domain names 'Yahoo!' of the plaintiff and
              'Yahooindia' of the defendant are almost similar except
              for use of the suffix 'India' in the latter. The degree of
              the similarity of the marks usually is vitally important
              and significant in an action for passing off for in such a
              case there is every possibility and likelihood of
              confusion and deception being caused. When both the
              domain names are considered, it is crystal clear that
              the two names being almost identical or similar in
              nature, there is every possibility of an Internet user
              being confused and deceived in believing that both the
              domain names belong to one common source and
              connection, although the two belong to two different
              concerns."
</p>
<p id="p_118">51.    The only argument addressed by the learned counsel for the
defendant is that generic domain names are available for registration
on a first come first serve basis under the INDRP. Therefore, the
plaintiffs' claim of registration of 100 or more domain names are an
example of non exclusivity an attempt to buy each and every domain
names available with the letters of these words. These words are
open to the world for use and cannot be monopolized by anyone
being dictionary words and directly referring to the product for use.
The said submissions have no force in view of settled law. The
Supreme Court in the case of Laxmi Kant Patel v. Chetanbhai
Shah, 2002 (24) PTC 1 (SC), in the relevant para 10 held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">        "The law does not permit any one to carry on his business
        in such a way as would persuade the customers or clients
        in believing that his goods or services belonging to

         someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does
        not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or
        otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair
        play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of
        business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to
        adopt a name in connection with his business or services
        which already belongs to someone else it results in
        confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers
        and clients of someone else to himself and thereby
        resulting in injury."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_119">In this case, the Apex Court further observed that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">        "Where there is probability of confusion in business, an
        injunction will be granted even though the defendants
        adopted the name innocently."

<p id="p_120">52.    In a similar situation, this Court in the case of Info Edge (India)
Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. Vs. Shailesh Gupta and Anr. 98 (2002) DLT 499
where the plaintiff was carrying business under the domain name
'Naukri.com' and the defendant had began to use a domain name
'Naukari.com', held that if two contesting parties are involved in the
same area, then there is a grave and immense possibility for
confusion and deception and both the marks were deceptively
similar. While granting a temporary injunction in favour of the plaintiff,
the Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">        "27. The defendant has employed minor mis-spelling of
        the plaintiff's mark, although it has another such mark
        available to it, which is also a registered domain name.
        Therefore, the said action indicates and establishes
        dishonest intention on the part of the defendant. That
        appears to have been done with bad faith in order to gain
        advantage of spelling error made by the internet user
        while attempting to enter into the plaintiff's internet


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">CS(OS) No.1043/2013                                          Page 53 of 57</span>
         address on their web-browser. The very purpose of
        having two registered domain names by the defendant
        only establishes the dishonest intention and bad faith on
        the part of the defendant. The real intention behind
        registering the domain names for the same purpose, of
        which one is deceptively similar to the domain name of
        the plaintiff, is to attract or induce the internet user to
        come to the website of the defendant first by mis-spelling
        the plaintiff's mark and domain name and, thereafter,
        taking the said internet user to the domain name of the
        defendant, which is jobsourceindia.com. The defendant's
        choice of slightly mis-spelt version of the plaintiff's
        domain name was deliberate in order to suit the business
        activities of the defendant and for the purpose of
        diverting traffic of the internet users to websites
        unrelated to the plaintiff. The traffic of the internet users
        to the plaintiff's domain name is sought to be diverted to
        the domain name and website of the defendant by
        confusing the internet users as to sponsorship
        or affiliation with a website that defendant operates
        for commercial gain. Such intention is deceitful
        and dishonest, apart from being an action on bad
        faith."

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">        "29. Both the domain names "Naukri.com" of the plaintiff
        and "Naukri.Com" of the defendant, depicting the nature

        also a possibility for an internet user while searching for
        the website of the plaintiff to enter into the website of the
        defendant through only a small mis-spelling of the
        domain name and, in fact, such incident has occurred in
        the case of the plaintiff itself vis-a-vis the defendant in
        proof of which a documents is also placed on record.
        Such diversion of traffic with the sole intention of ulterior
        gain in the similar business activity by a competitor,

<p id="p_121">53.    As far as use of logo is concerned, the plaintiffs have no
objection if the mark/name and corporate name of WORLD BOOK is
added or used. With regard to the argument of the defendant that
various books, seminars, fairs and events have been happening for
the last many decades under the name WORLD BOOK, the plaintiffs
appear to have raised no grievance. The main case of the plaintiffs is
that the defendant is not entitled to use the trade name/trademark
WORLD BOOK as part of defendant's corporate name or trade
name. The defendant's entitlement to use other corporate name with
different brand name cannot be denied if the defendant would join
any book fair or seminar under different corporate name and
trademark.

<p id="p_123"> The defendant has no right to use the trade mark/trade name of the
plaintiffs in any form whatsoever. The use of the domain name
WORLDBOOKCOMPANY.IN on the part of the defendant is also
likely to cause confusion and deception in the mind of unwary class
of customers. The business of the Plaintiffs' is likely to be diverted to
the defendant on account of features of the domain which contain the
mark of the Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_124">55.    The plaintiffs' mark WORLD BOOK in the present case is highly
distinctive; it has acquired residual goodwill and reputation.
It is a registered trademark. Hence, mere defences raised
by the defendant are moonshine and flimsy which are against the
law.

of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiffs and against the
defendant, if the interim order is not continued, the plaintiffs would
suffer loss and irreparable injury. On the other hand, the defendant is
also under injunction for the last more than one year and four
months. Their adoption of the name is not honest.
