</p><p id="p_7">1.    By this writ application in the nature of a Public Interest
Litigation, the petitioner, a Non Government Organization, has
brought to our notice that the respondent no.4, Ahmedabad
Municipal Corporation and the respondent no.6, Director
(Environment) and Additional Secretary, Forest &amp; Environment
Department, State of Gujarat, has granted permission to the
respondent nos.1 and 2 to construct residential flats in the
name of Paradise Park situated at T.P.No.73, Final Plot
No.38/2/1 and 38/2/2, Ward Ramol-Hathijan, Ta: Dascroi, Mouje
Vinzol, just adjacent to the Hazardous Waste Landfill Site.
According to the petitioner, the same is in violation of the
guidelines framed by the Central Pollution Control Board for
setting-up      of      the   operating      facility   (Hazardous     Waste
Management).
</p>

<p id="p_8">2.    The case made-out by the petitioner may be summarized
as under :
</p>

<p id="p_9">2.1   According to the petitioner, the respondent no.1 is a
partnership firm engaged in the business of construction and
development of land and the respondent no.2 is the Power of
Attorney holder of the partners of the respondent no.1 firm.
According to the petitioner, the respondent no.1 and 2 floated
a scheme of residential flats in the name of Paradise Park

scheme situated at the address referred to above and the
respondent       nos.3   and   4     i.e.    the   Ahmedabad    Municipal
Commissioner and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
issued a letter of commencement (Raja Chitthi) to start with
the construction, despite knowing fully well that the scheme of
residential flats is very much adjoining the Hazardous Waste
Landfill Site which is being maintained by the respondent
no.10 Green Environment Service Cooperative Society Ltd.
</p>

<p id="p_10">2.2   It is the case of the petitioner that having learnt about
the same a letter was addressed to the Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation to take the permission in review in the public
interest.     According to the petitioner, the site where the
construction has been put-up by the respondent nos.1 and 2 is
reserved by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation for the
GIDC Industrial Hazardous Solid Waste Disposal and the said
site was developed in the year 2003 by the respondent no.10
the Green Environment Service Cooperative Society Ltd.
</p>

<p id="p_11">2.3   According to the petitioner, the concerned authorities
granted permission for construction of the residential flats,
without keeping in mind the interest of the general public at
large, more particularly the health of the nearby inhabitants,
and therefore, could not have granted such permission which
is in direct violation of the guidelines framed by the Central
Pollution Control Board so far as the Landfill Site is concerned.
</p>

<p id="p_12">      In such circumstances referred to above, the petitioner
has prayed for the following reliefs:-

</p>



<p id="p_18">3.    Stance of the respondent nos.1 and 2 :
</p>

<p id="p_19">3.1   The petition filed by the NGO is ex-facie malafide and
targeted      only      against   the    project   undertaken    by     the
respondents, namely, the Paradise Park.              The petitioner has
intentionally not raised any grievance against any other
developments which are already in existence and are within
the periphery of 500 meters of the Hazardous Waste Landfill
Site situated at Vinzol, Ahmedabad and Hazardous Waste
Landfill situated at Odhav, Ahmedabad.
</p>

<p id="p_20">3.2   There are EWS Housing Colonies of the AUDA, Dascroi
Mamlatdar's Office, Old Residential colonies (since 1975) like
Vinobabhavenagar with approximately 3000 houses near the
Vatva TSDF, Adinathnagar with approximately 7000 houses
near the Odhav TSDF. There are many residential and
commercial projects including the Paryavaran Mandir which is
a huge conference hall constructed on the Waste Dump Site at
Odhav. The petition is not a genuine PIL filed for the benefit of
the public, but the same has been filed at the instance of few
business rivals.
</p>

<p id="p_21">3.3   The petition deserves to be rejected on the ground of
delay and laches.         The project had commenced way back in
May, 2010 and as on today practically the construction is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  Page 5 of 89</span>

completed and various persons have booked flats in the
project by depositing the earnest money. The agreements to
sell are also executed with various buyers.
</p>

<p id="p_22">3.4   Despite the knowledge of commencement of the project,
the petitioner kept quiet for all these period of time and after
the completion of the construction, the petitioner has raised
this issue. The Government prescribed the criteria/guidelines
for the Hazardous Waste Land Fills somewhere in the year
1998-99 for the owners and operators of the secured land
filling facility. The criteria provides a detailed methodology for
the selection of the site.       It provides that the Landfill Sites
should be at least 500 meters away from a notified habitat
area or a highway.         A zone of 500 meters around a landfill
boundary shall be declared as the no-development buffer zone
after the landfill location is finalized. It also provides that the
Hazardous Waste Landfills should be preferably located in the
areas of low population density.
</p>

<p id="p_23">3.5   According to the respondents the selection of the site
was done without considering in mind the applicable norms
and in violation of the duly approved Zoning and development
plan under the          Town Planning Act whereunder the area in
which the waste dumping site falls, is earmarked as a
residential zone since 1987.
</p>

<p id="p_24">3.6   According to the respondents, after finalizing the site, the
authority concerned ought to have declared 500 meters area
in the periphery of such site as a buffer zone with a clear
public notice that no development shall be permitted in the
buffer zone area. However, no such public notice was issued

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                Page 6 of 89</span>
       C/WPPIL/47/2012                                   CAV JUDGEMENT



by the authorities concerned and thereby gave an impression
that the area was declared as a residential zone.
</p>

<p id="p_25">3.7   If the respondents are restrained from proceeding ahead
with the project at this stage, more particularly, when it has
completed        the    construction    and     has   executed    various
agreement to sell in favour of the buyers of the flats, the same
would amount to depriving them of the property without
complying with the procedure established by law and would be
in violation of the <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_1">Article 300(A)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_26">3.8   According to the respondents, the Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation has directed them to obtain a No Objection
Certificate      from     the   competent       authority    under      the
Environment Law failing which the Corporation would not grant
the Building Use permission. As a result, the Corporation has
not granted the building use permission till date, and
consequently, the respondents have not been able to hand-
over the possession of the flats to the innocent buyers who
have been put in a precarious situation.
</p>

<p id="p_27">3.9   According to the respondents there being no merit in this
petition, the same deserves to be rejected.

<p id="p_30">"4.1 That the Ministry of Environment and Forests had earlier
notified    the Hazardous Waste (M&amp;H) Rules in 1989, which
were subsequently re-notified on 24/09/2008. The Schedule-VII
under rule 23 of the said Rules authorizes Central Pollution
Control Board to prepare guidelines for prevention/reduction/
minimization of the generation and handling of hazardous
Waste and the same is mentioned against its corresponding
duties.

<p id="p_31">4.2   That the directions under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_2">Section 5</a> of the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986 was issued by the Principal Secretary,
Forests &amp; Environment Department to Ahmedabad Municipal

by the Central Pollution Control Board and to ensure that all
provisions of the said guidelines are complied with and a
buffer zone as mentioned in the guidelines is kept, while
granting any permission near the Treatment, Storage and
Disposal Facility (TSDF) site.
</p>

<p id="p_32">4.3   That as per the said guidelines issued by the Central
Pollution Control Board, the habitation has to be at a distance
of at least 500 meters from the landfill site.       It has been
categorically stated in the said guidelines that "A zone of 500
meters around a landfill boundary should be declared a no-
development buffer zone after the landfill location is finalized".

</p>

<p id="p_34">4.5   That the Forests &amp; Environment Department, subsequent
to the letter dated 21st Jan.,2011, had written to the
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation on 9/2/2011, clarifying its
stand and asking the respondent authority to ensure that no
violation of the CPCB guidelines were done.
</p>

<p id="p_35">4.6   That the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had asked
the respondent nos.1 and 2 to obtain NOC from the Forest &amp;
Environment Department for the construction. However, there
is no provision in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 or any
other law to grant permission for the construction of building
by the Forests and Environment Department.                That for the
reasons mentioned herein-before no permission for any such
construction in violation of CPCB guidelines can be granted by
any authority.

<p id="p_36">4.7   That the facility operated by the respondent no.10 has
been notified in the year 1996 and the respondent nos.1 and 2
were granted development permission by the respondent
Corporation in the year 2010. That the CPCB issued the said
guidelines in February, 2001. Thus, looking to the fact that the
landfill site has been notified in the year 1996, the respondent
nos.1 and 2 cannot be granted permission for residential or
commercial building construction. The respondent nos.1 and 2
were very much aware about the fact that the landfill site is

three sites referred to herein before were identified as most
suitable for development of hazardous waste disposal sites in
Ahmedabad region. For the purposes of identification of the
sites, the Council undertook a detailed procedure.                     It
determined an evaluation criterion for determination of the
landfill sites. After following the selection procedure process, in
so far as the Answering Respondent is concerned, the lands at
Vinzol were identified as most suitable for the purpose of
development of the facility. The report specifically records that
the sites identified by the Council were not having any visible
adverse impact on human population.                    In fact it was
specifically recorded that the utilization of the sites, part of
which were waste lands, would have a positive impact on
human population.

<p id="p_47">      The site near Vinzol village (Site No.3) in Vatva was
identified as most suitable due to the following reasons.

&gt;     It is a waste land.
&gt;     Drainage possibilities surface water and leach ate
      are very good.

      Site selection procedures be so adopted so that the
distance of the site is not too close to cause impact, too far as
involve heavy transporting cost and risk. A thick impervious
cushion between the bottom of landfill and the top of the
ground water table, sufficiently big size to have 20 years
future     waste,       good   dispersion           of    air    pollutants,    public
acceptability, safe distance from habitations, (present and

adopting Delphi techniques detailed in the guidelines by
superimposing the rejection maps (GIS) technique, as given in

admeasuring 76 k.m., passing through the land in dispute i.e.
within the area of 500 meters periphery to TSDF Site at Vatva.
Between the years 1998 to 2001, 40% of the land of land
owners owning land on the periphery of the ring road, was
handed over to AUDA.     Necessary betterment charges were
also paid under the clear understanding that the said owners
would be permitted to develop the land in the final plot. The
authorities under the Town Planning Scheme, having taken
possession of 40% of the land belonging to persons within the
periphery of the ring road, situated within 500 meters of TSDFs

around the TSDSF site is to be maintained by the entity who is
using the site for the said purpose.       The other surrounding
land-holders, 40 percent of whose land has been forfeited
towards development, and who have paid betterment charges,
for the development of infrastructure, cannot be compelled to
restrict the usage of their lands whilst all other authorities

transverses through this disputed area. The entire ring road of
76 k.m. is constructed and operational. Non-agricultural use
permission for the development of the said land has already
been granted to several land owners owning and occupying
the land within this area. In that view of the matter, the State
Government would be stopped from restraining the land
owners to develop the land, considering that 40% of the land
holdings has been deducted and the ring road constructed
thereon as also the grant of N.A. permission on payment of
due premium. It is further submitted that under the provisions
of Town Planning Act, the intention to declare the town
planning scheme and the deduction of 40% of the holdings of
land owners within the concerned area itself contains a
permission to develop the balance 60% of the land held by the
land owners. It is further noteworthy that the 40% of the land
so deducted is lost by the land owners and no compensation
for the same is received. Furthermore, additional betterment
charges have also been paid by the land owners towards the
development of the said area. The State Government and its

Persons, who have purchased land in accordance with the

<p id="p_115">8.16 It is respectfully submitted that to the best of the
knowledge of the present deponent, no permission for setting
up of the landfill site at Vatva has been obtained by
respondent no.10 from AUDA or AMC. Under the GDCR of 1987
as also of 2002, no construction can be put up without prior
permission of the concerned authority i.e. AUDA or AMC.
</p>

<p id="p_116">8.17 It is respectfully submitted that section 117 of the Town
Planning       Act        stipulates    that     when      permission     for      such
development has not been obtained under this Act, such
development shall not be deemed to be lawfully undertaken or
carried out by reason only of the fact that permission, approval
or   sanction         required         under     such      other   law    for      such
development has been obtained.                          <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">The Act</a> thus mandates a
permission from the area Development Authorities irrespective
of any other permission obtained from any other authority

as stipulated under the Criteria For Landfills, with regard to

proceeded with the town planning scheme and under the

of the said scheme.
</p>

<p id="p_118">8.19 It is respectfully submitted that all said and done, the
criteria for hazardous waste landfill is merely a guideline to be
followed as far as is possible and feasible.      The activities
period for the present site at Vatva now stand concluded. In
fact, a garden has been set up over the landfill site. Thus, as
on date, there exists no apprehension in so far water and air
pollution is concerned.       It is also    noteworthy that in
Pithampura-Indore, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, there is no
such periphery considered or maintained in and around the
TSDF SITES.

<p id="p_119">8.20 In light of the facts and circumstances referred to herein
above, the State Govt. and the GPCB along with the contesting
respondents, and the Green environment services Co-op

all present as well as future development.      The respondent
no.1 and 2 have suggested remedial measures and the said
measures, at one stage, found favour with the State Govt., and
the AMC on that basis even revoked the suspension orders. It
is respectfully submitted that such remedial measures may be
considered by the Corporation and the State Government and
be made applicable to all occupiers and owners of land in and
around this area.

are to be taken and permission from SPCB/PCC should be
obtained.      Considering that the Green environment services
society put up the TSDF site, within the residential zone and
the PCC consented to the same, the design for the TSDF site,
must have taken suitable design measures.

which have been ensued between the authorities along with
the translated copies which amply convey that for the first
time in the year 2010, the criteria of the guidelines were

several planning schemes have been granted as well as

the Respondent no.11, Ahmedabad Builders Association duly
sworn by one of its members of the Managing Committee,

</p>



<p id="p_123">9.1   The respondent no.11 herein had submitted before the
Hon'ble Court that the land in question, under the 1st
Development Plan as sanctioned in the year 1987, under
section    17      of   the   Gujarat    Town    Planning   and    Urban
Development Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as the T.P. and

1997 is designated as a predominantly residential zone. The
Revised Development Plan of 2002 has also notified the area

in dispute as a residential zone. It was specifically contended
that mandatorily for the development to be carried out within
the area, necessary permission under the T.P.Act, 1976 is
mandatorily required.       In view of the said submissions, this
Hon'ble Court, vide order dated 14/3/2013, was pleased to
direct the A.M.C. i.e. the respondent no.3 and 4 herein and
respondent no.10 i.e. Green Environment Service Co-operative
Society Ltd., to state by way of an affidavit as to whether any
development permission has been obtained by the Green
Environment Service Co-operative Society Ltd.
</p>

<p id="p_124">9.2   The affidavit dated 26/3/2013 filed by the respondent
Corporation, validates the stand of the present deponent. The
Corporation categorically states that as mandatorily required
under the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act,
1976, Green Environment Service Co-operative Society Ltd.,
has not obtained any permission or sanction from the A.M.C.
The Corporation further submits that regulation 2.9 of the
Gujarat     Development      Control      Regulations,     provides      for
definition of hazardous buildings and regulation 3.1 provides
for application for development permission and considered
that the storage of solid waste by dumping on a site, would
constitute hazardous activity. Regulation 32 provides the use
zone table.         In a residential zone, obnoxious use is not
permissible. Under regulation 32(5)(6), development may be
permitted by a competent authority for dumping of solid
industrial waste subject to NOC and conditions laid down by
the Pollution Control Board in the general industrial zone or
special industrial zone or obnoxious and hazardous zone as the
case may be. Even in the agriculture zone, as stated by the
Corporation, permission of the competent authority is required

for dumping of solid industrial waste. Admittedly, in the facts
of the present case, no development permission has been
obtained by the respondent no.10.
</p>

<p id="p_125">9.3   That the contention of the respondent no.10 that since
the site has been put up pursuant to directions issued by this
Hon'ble Court, no development permission or any other
permission is required to be obtained, is incorrect. Approval
from this Hon'ble Court for putting up of the site could never
mean that all other applicable statutory laws enforceable for
any development in the State, need not be complied with and
the Co-operative society be permitted to develop the site as it
so deems appropriate. The TSDF site admeasures 66,885
sq.meters and consists of a solid RCC structure.             If the
development permission is required to be taken by every
authority, society, corporation, individual including statutory
bodies such as the Gujarat Electricity Board for carrying out
any development on the land, the respondent no.10, which is a
co-operative society established by its members to provide
dumping and management of hazardous waste generated by
the industrial units of its members, cannot be precluded from
the mandatory, stipulations of law. Statutory provisions do not
apply selectively. As stated by respondent no.10 in its reply
that the lands bearing Survey Nos. 89, 90 and 91 were
purchased by respondent no.10 after obtaining necessary
permission under section 73 of the Bombay Tenancy and
Agriculture Land Ceiling Act.         The contention raised by
respondent no.10 that they are precluded from the operation
of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act and
the G.D.C.R., is clearly not tenable.      The contention of the
respondent no.10 that the identification of sides, grant o

authorization and closure is regulated under the rules frame
under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment Protection Act</a> of 1986 and no other
permission under any other law so applicable, is required to be
taken, is not only a misreading of the statutory provisions but
an unequivocal admission that no sanction or development
permission as required, has been obtained.
</p>

<p id="p_126">9.4   That the respondent no.10 has further contended that
the present deponent has no authority to file the present
affidavit.      It is respectfully submitted that in the Civil
Application filed, seeking impleadment, the present deponent
had clearly stated that the respondent no.11 is an association
of builders registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act,
bearing      registration   No      GUJ-1979-     Ahmedabad        dated
10/1/1990.         The petitioner Association comprises of 900
members, several of whom are land owners vitally concerned
with the issues raised in the petition.          The resolution of the
Ahmedabad Builders' Association, authorizing the deponent
along with Shri Batukbhai Patel, together or individually, to
litigate, to espouse the cause of its members in the present
litigation, was also placed on record.           The memorandum of
association is not annexed in order to avoid making the record
bulky. The present deponent craves leave to place the same
for the kind perusal of the Hon'ble Court as and when required.
</p>

<p id="p_127">9.5   The Gujarat Pollution Control Board has published its
Action Plan for Vatva TSDF site. The said Action Plan states
that the time limit for the activity of the TSDF site at Vatva
expires on 31/12/2010. The site has been utilized upto the
design capacity and no further dumping is to be carried out at
the said site. It is stated by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                 Page 40 of 89</span>
         C/WPPIL/47/2012                                CAV JUDGEMENT



that the TSDF authority may approach the Ministry of
Industries for upgradation of TSDF under various schemes.
Thus, as per the Gujarat Pollution Control Board itself the time
limit for usage of the site has expired on 31/12/2010.                 The
statement made by the respondent no.10 to the effect that
the site is in the process of closure, is incorrect. Even as on
date, dumping activity is being carried out despite the fact
that as reflected on the Gujarat Pollution Control Board
website, the TSDF at Vatva has attended its optimal capacity
on 31/12/2010. It is noteworthy that the TSDF site is an RCC
structure which is required to be scientifically monitored and
filled up.       In view of the fact that a site is required to be
identified or a new cell is required to be put up, further
continuous dumping on this site would result in the RCC
structure cracking up and hazardous solid waste permeating in
the said site levels, creating serious crises of no return. Even
as on date dumping activities are being carried out on the said
site.

<p id="p_128">9.6     Considering the averments made in the Civil Application
and after hearing all concerned including respondent no.10,
this Hon'ble Court was pleased to allow the Civil Application,

no.11. It is in pursuance of the order passed by this Hon'ble
Court that the present deponent was impleaded as party
respondent and has filed necessary affidavit in response to the
averments and issues raised in the present petition.

<p id="p_129">9.7     The respondent no.10, has further contended that the

annexed at page199 graphically depicts the properties existing
within the periphery of 500 m. of the land fill site.
</p>

<p id="p_130">9.8    As pointed out in the earlier affidavit-in-reply, it is
noteworthy that the Corporation has acquired 40% of the land
of land owners within the Town Planning Scheme 73 and 93 in
so far as Vinzol is concerned and revenue survey no.104, 112
and 113 in so far as Odhav is concerned, has been deducted
by AUDA for development purposes.                        Not only do the said
lands vest with the Area Development Authority and the
concerned land owners have already paid betterment charges
for the development of the said land. The entire ring road of
76 km. is traversing through this disputed area. As on date,
the entire ring road is constructed and operational. Having
deducted 40% of the land holdings of land owners and having
constructed a ring road on the said land and also having
granted N.A. permission on the payment of due premium, the
State Government would be stopped from restricting the land
owners from developing their land.

<p id="p_131">9.9    That in and around the periphery of 500 meters of the
TSDF site at Vatva as well as Odhav, there exists the EWS

</p>
<p id="p_134">       Mr.A.A. Zabuawala, the learned advocate appearing for
the petitioners submitted that the issue raised in this petition
is one relating to the health of lacs of people residing very
much adjacent to the hazardous waste landfill site.              In such
circumstances the respondent nos.1 and 2 could not have
been     granted         permission   by    the   Ahmedabad    Municipal
Corporation to put-up residential flats in the name of Paradise
Park which is just adjacent to the landfill site. Mr.Zabuawala
submitted that thousands of tons of hazardous medical wastes
has been dumped at the landfill site and the ill-effects of the
same on the people could be beyond imagination.
</p>

<p id="p_135">       Mr.Zabuawala submitted that assuming for the moment
that prior to finalization of the location of the landfill site, the
human habitat was already in existence by itself is no ground
to permit other people to start residing in the nearby vicinity at
the cost of their health.             The sum and substance of the
submissions canvassed on behalf of the petitioners is that after
having known that there exists a hazardous waste landfill site,
the Corporation ought not to have granted permission for
construction of residential flats which is just 100 meters from
the landfill site. Even though many persons may have booked
flats in the Paradise Park developed by respondent nos.1 and
2, they should not be permitted to reside at that place as it is
the duty of the State to protect its citizens and take all due
care as regards their health. According to the petitioner, the
permission should be cancelled and the respondent nos.1 and
2 should be directed to refund the money deposited by various
persons who have booked the flats in Paradise Park.

2:
</p>

<p id="p_138">      Mr. C.B.Upadhyay, the learned advocate appearing for
the respondent nos.1 and 2 submitted that this petition in the
nature of a Public Interest Litigation is not a bonafide litigation
and has been filed with an oblique motive.            According to
Mr.Upadhyay it is too late in the day for the petitioner to
submit that people should not be permitted to take-over the
possession of the flats in Paradise Park since the construction
is almost completed and his client is waiting for grant of
Building Use Permission by the Corporation.
</p>

<p id="p_139">      According to Mr.Upadhyay it is only due to the pendency
of this litigation that the Corporation has to withhold the grant
of B.U. Permission. No sooner the B.U. Permission be granted,
than all those people who have booked flats, would be handed-
over the possession of the same and they would start residing.
</p>

<p id="p_140">      Mr.Upadhyay further submitted that the very edifice of
this petition that the health of the people would be affected as
there is a landfill site adjacent to the Paradise Park, is without
any basis because much before the hazardous waste landfill
site came to be established, thousands of people had already
started residing in the vicinity and as on today there are
various residential colonies all around the landfill site. Till this
date there has been no complaint as regards any ill-effects on
human beings due to the hazardous waste landfill site and,
therefore, the apprehension expressed by the petitioner in
public interest regarding the same is without any foundation.

      Mr.Upadhyay submitted that his client started with the
construction only after seeking prior permission which was
duly granted by the Corporation.                His client has invested a
huge sum of money by now and if B U Permission is not
granted by the Corporation, then his clients would suffer a
huge financial loss which perhaps would ruin their whole life.
</p>

<p id="p_142">      Mr.Upadhyay submitted that the authorities in the first
instance ought not to have finalized such a location for the
hazardous landfill site which was already surrounded by a
human habitat. He also submitted that after finalizing the site,
the authority concerned ought to have declared that the area
within 500 meters of such a site would be a buffer zone with a
clear public notice in that regard and with further clarification
that no development would be permitted in the buffer zone.
Having not done so and having permitted his clients to
complete the construction, now at this stage, it would be too
harsh upon his clients to say that the permission was wrongly
granted by the Corporation.

Mr.Jani submitted that the stance of the AMC that the Forest &amp;
Environment Department had granted NOC for construction of
Paradise Park and due to such grant of NOC they had granted
permission for putting-up construction, is absolutely false.
Mr.Jani submitted that there is no provision in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment

       Mr. Jani very vociferously submitted that had the AMC
acted on the directions issued vide letter dated 8/12/2010 and
reviewed the permission granted in favour of the respondent
nos.1 and 2, then the situation which has cropped-up today
could have been avoided.                According to Mr.Jani, in 2010 the
construction had not even commenced and it was the duty on
the part of the AMC to have taken the permission in review and
ought to have passed the necessary order in that regard.
Having not done so, the stance of the Corporation that in the
GDCR framed by the State Government the area has been
earmarked as a residential zone, is nothing but a lame excuse
to wriggle out of their liability.

was identified as the most suitable by the experts and
accordingly the report of the experts was considered by the
High Court and appropriate directions were issued in that

provisions contained in the Hazardous Wastes (Management &amp;

<p id="p_156">      Mr.Shelat submitted that the directions which were
issued by this Court were within the knowledge of Ahmedabd
Municipal Corporation as one of the party respondents in the
said litigation and if that be so then it ought not to have
granted permission in favour of the respondent nos.1 and 2 for
construction of the Paradise Park.
</p>

<p id="p_157">      Mr.Shelat submitted that since inception of the landfill
site, approximately around 12,10,113.95 Metric Tons of solid

Ahmedabad Builders' Association :
</p>

<p id="p_159">      Mr.S.N.Soparkar, the learned senior advocate, assisted by
Ms.Manisha Lavkumar, submitted that no permission could
have been granted for setting-up of the landfill site in the area
in question, more particularly when the authorities were very
much aware that the area surrounding the same had already
been inhabited by lacs of people. Despite such knowledge, the
authorities proceeded ahead with sanctioning of the location
for the landfill site.    Mr.Soparkar submitted that if no
development permission is granted for putting-up construction
within 500 meters of the area, then that would create lots of
problems, inasmuch as huge parcels of land would remain
undeveloped and there is every possibility that the same may
get encroached upon.      Mr.Soparkar submitted that there is
nothing on record to suggest that due to such hazardous

been affected in any manner. Mr.Soparkar submitted that the
members of the Association would sustain huge financial loss,
if it is decided that no permission shall be granted for
development within the area of 500 meters from the landfill
site.   Mr.Soparkar also submitted that even according to the
Gujarat Development Control Regulations, the area in question
falls within the residential zone and in and around the
periphery of 500 meters of the TSDF site of Vatva as well as
Odhav there exists the EWS Housing Colony of AUDA,
Vinobabhavenagar              comprising          of      3000      residential
accommodations, Adinathnagar comprising of 7000 residential
units and several other houses where construction permissions
have been granted.

<p id="p_160">        Mr.Soparkar submitted that to the best of the knowledge
of his client, no permission for setting-up of the landfill site at
Vatva has been obtained by the respondent no.10 from the
AUDA or AMC.              Even under the GDCR of 1987 and 2002 as
well,    no     construction     could    have         been   put-up    by    the

concerned authorities.

Control Board has issued instructions as regards the distance
to be maintained for setting-up of the TSDF site from the
human habitat, yet they remain in the realm of guidelines and
have no statutory force. Mr.Soparkar submitted that some via-
media should be worked-out so as to ensure that the
development is also not stalled and at the same time the
health of the people is also protected.

      ANALYSIS :

</pre><p id="p_162">16.   Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and having gone through the materials on record, the
only question that falls for our determination in this petition is,
whether we should permit the authorities to sanction the
development plans and grant permission for construction of
the housing projects within the radius of 500 meters of the
landfill site.
</p>

<p id="p_163">17.   The picture that emerges from the case made out by the
petitioner, the stance of the respective respondents and the
rival submissions canvassed on either side is thus :-
</p>

<p id="p_164">1)    The respondent nos.1 and 2 have constructed residential
flats in the name of Paradise Park situated at Town Planning
Scheme No.73, Final Plot No.38/2/1 and 38/2/2 , Ward-Ramol-
Hathijan, Ta: Dascroi, Mouje Vinzol.
</p>

<p id="p_165">2)    The Paradise Park constructed by respondent nos.1 and 2
is very much adjacent to the landfill site where the hazardous
waste is       collected, treated, stored and disposed of in
accordance with the Hazardous Wastes (Management &amp;
Handling) Rules, 1989. This landfill site is being maintained by
the   respondent        no.10,   Environment     Service   Cooperative
Society.
</p>

<p id="p_166">3)    The permission to set-up such a landfill site was granted
sometime in the year 1998-99, whereas the permission
granted to the respondent nos.1 and 2 for construction of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                 Page 51 of 89</span>
      C/WPPIL/47/2012                                  CAV JUDGEMENT



Paradise Park was subsequent in point of time, i.e. 2010.
</p>

<p id="p_167">4)   It appears that before the grant of permission to
construct the Paradise Park, the landfill site was already in
operation.
</p>

<p id="p_168">5)   It appears that the State Government, Forests and
Environment Department, vide letter dated 8th December 2010
addressed      to      the   Municipal     Commissioner,   Ahmedabad
Municipal Corporation, directed under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_14">Section 5</a> of the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to take into review the
permission granted by it in favour of the respondent nos.1 and
2 for construction of the Paradise Park. It also appears that
instructions were issued to the local officers of the Ahmedabad
Municipal Corporation dealing with the grant of permission to
the housing projects not to grant permission nearby the TSDF
sites upto the distance of 500 meters. The Corporation was
also directed that no such permissions be given to any
residential projects in the area of 500 meters around the TSDF
sites in other parts of the city of Ahmedabad where such TSDF
sites are located. Along with the letter dated 8 th December
2010, the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control
Board for setting up of operating facility for hazardous waste
management were also forwarded. However, at a later stage,
the State Government addressed one other letter dated 21 st
January 2011 to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to
consider the representation of the respondent nos.1 and 2
seeking permission for construction of the Paradise Park on the
ground that many residential projects near the TSDF sites were
already in existence. Placing reliance on such letter of the
State Government, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation

proceeded ahead to grant permission for construction in favour
of the respondent nos.1 and 2.
</p>

<p id="p_169">6)    According to the criteria fixed for the hazardous waste
landfills, a landfill site should be at least 500 meters away from
a notified habitat area and a zone of 500 meters around a
landfill boundary should be declared as a 'No Development
Buffer Zone' after the landfill location is finalized.
</p>

<p id="p_170">7)    It also appears that when the location for the hazardous
waste landfill was finalized, many residential colonies were
already in existence which is suggestive of the fact that before
finalizing the location and granting permission to set-up the
hazardous       waste        landfill     site,     the   authorities   remained
completely oblivious that very much adjacent to the site
people had already started residing since long.
</p>

<p id="p_171">8)    According         to      the       General         Development     Control
Regulations framed by the State Government, the area where
the landfill site is situated has been notified as a residential
zone and considering the same, permission was granted in
favour of respondent nos.1 and 2 to put-up the construction.
Prior to the establishment of the landfill site at Vatva, the
development plan under the Gujarat Town Planning Act had
already been sanctioned in the year 1987. The entire area in
dispute admeasuring around 20 lac sq.yards was reserved as a
residential zone. The revised development plan sanctioned in
the year 1997 as well as the revised development plan
sanctioned in the year 2002 also notified the area in dispute as
a Residential Zone - R-1.

9)    According to the respondent no.11 - the Ahmedabad
</pre><p id="p_172">Builders' Association, the landfill site could not have been
sanctioned in a residential area inhabited by lacs of people and
it was a mistake on the part of the authorities in finalizing such
location and granting permission for the same.
</p>

<p id="p_173">10)   Around 40% of the land of the owners within the T.P.
Scheme Nos.73 and 93 so far as Vinzol is concerned, has
already been deducted by the AUDA for the development
purposes.       The said land vests with the Area Development
Authority and the respective land owners have also paid the
betterment charges for the development of that land. If on
account of the landfill site permission is refused by the
authorities      for     putting-up     construction,      then    in      such
circumstances thousands of hectares of land will remain as it is
without any development on the same with the likelihood of
the same being encroached upon.
</p>

<p id="p_174">11)   It is not possible to close down the landfill site because as
on today two cells have already outlived its life, whereas the
third cell at the landfill site appears to have been sealed about
three years back and could not be said to be dead. If that be
so, then according to the petitioners, the same would have
serious ill-effects on the health of the people residing within
the vicinity of the same due to soil pollution leading to
contamination of ground water.
</p>

<p id="p_175">18.   It appears from the materials on record that a meeting
was convened on 5th September, 2011 relating to the
environmental           aspects   policy      of   urban    planning       and

and implementation of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and
Control) Rules, under the Chairmanship of Dr.S.K.Nanda, I.A.S,
Principal Secretary, Forests and Environment Department. In
the   said     meeting,        the   issues          relating   to    the   building
construction projects around the TSDF sites were discussed.
The points which were discussed are as under:-
</p>

<p id="p_176">  1. Issue related to Building Construction projects
      around TSDF sites.
</p>

<p id="p_177">              Initiating the discussion, Shri J.K. Vyas, Director
      (Environment),           outlined      about        the     construction       of
      residential        and    commercial             projects      in   the     close
      proximity          of the TSDF sites. Elaborating on it, he
      illustrated about the upcoming of such projects in vicinity
      of TSDF-NEPL on the AUDA ring road. Ahmedabad and
      TSDF-Vatva at Vinzol, Ahmedabad. He stated                            that the
      Forests           and    Environment              Department          received
      representations related to this issue. Environmental and
      Pollution related aspects of the issue were discussed at
      length. Shri J.K.Vyas, Director (Environment), Forests and
      Environment Department informed the participants about
      CPCB guidelines in this regard to keep a buffer zone of
      500m around such TSDF sites.
</p>

<p id="p_178">              Shri I.P.Gautam, Principal Secretary, UD &amp; UHD
      stated that, there was no legal framework for keeping
      buffer zone around such sites under Urban Development
      Regulations. The issue is however important and would
      be included in Development Plans and Town Planning
      Schemes by making appropriate amendments. The issue

      would be also considered while framing the provisions of
      GDCR          so     that        the         developments      of    the
      residential/commercial buildings in the proximity of such
      TSDF sites are avoided. He also stated that the 500 m
      zone around            such sites shall be kept reserved for
      plantation. He suggested that no development zone as
      per the CPCB guidelines is an ideal situation, however,
      issues related to the compensation                 for such land and
      upcoming of the unauthorized development in these
      areas such as slums etc shall also have to be kept in
      mind.

<p id="p_179">              Shri       Hardik   Shah,    Member       Secretary,    Gujarat
      Pollution Control Board suggested that a buffer zone of at
      least 100 m around such sites shall have to be
      maintained, the thick plantation in this buffer zone shall
      also have to be maintained, the ground water withdrawal
      in at least in one kilometer radius of such site shall be
      restricted and concerned authority shall have to ensure
      supply of water in this area by other means to minimize
      the impacts of such sites on its surroundings. He also
      suggested that ground water monitoring and ambient air
      quality monitoring is required to be done in one kilometer
      radius of such sites.

Occupational Health, Meghaninagar, Ahmedabad, as well as
the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Gandhinagar, to visit the
landfill site in question and to give a report as to whether the
said landfill site,          which according to the available report
contained 90% gypsum, would have any adverse effect on the
human habitation residing within the area of 15 to 500 meters

We deem it necessary to highlight few salient features of the
report, throwing considerable light on the issue we are dealing
with.

<p id="p_193">        What is Hazardous Waste?
</p>

<p id="p_194">        As per the definition of Hazardous waste, "It is a waste
        which by reason of its physical, chemical, reactive, toxic,
        flammable, explosive or corrosive characteristics cause
        danger or is likely to cause danger to health or
        environment, whether alone or when in contact with

•   There have been a number of epidemiological studies
    which have investigated                 whether there is a higher
    than usual incidence of adverse health events, such as
    cancer or congenital anomalies, in populations living
    near landfill sites. In general, these studies have used
    routinely collected data to compare the incidence of
    an adverse health outcome in the population living
    around a landfill site, or around a number of landfill
    sites, to the incidence in a reference area, such as the
    rest     of    the   region     or       country.   This    type    of
    epidemiological study is termed as ecological study.
    There are a number of methodological problems with
    this type of study. Such a study can only explore
    whether there is an association between potential
    exposures and the health effect under investigation. It
    cannot say whether or not the landfill site(s) caused
    the adverse health outcome (ie. Whether association
    is causal.) There is no assessment of whether the
    study population is actually subject                     of harmful
    exposures. It is assumed that those living near to the
    landfill site are 'exposed' and those living further away
    are 'unexposed'.

<p id="p_228">•   The scientific reports suggest that the exposure to
    hydrogen sulphide (H2s) gas can irritate the eyes,
    nose and throat. Eyes may become waterly, red and

    shortness of breath, chest pain and other                    health
    related symptoms. Most people can smell H2S                       at
    levels much lower than the levels that                  can cause
    these health effects. Sensitive populations, infants,
    young children, the elderly, people with asthma or
    other respiratory problems and people with heart
    problems may be more likely to experience these
    symptoms from exposure to H2S. Further in the

there should not be any human habitat within the 500 meters

only after the necessary survey carried out by the team of
experts that the true picture of the situation prevailing in the
area has surfaced. The water analysis report of the borewells
in the surrounding areas indicates presence of TDS, fluoride,
magnesium, lead, phenolic compounds, copper, cadmium, etc.
beyond the permissible limits. The Committee has also given
more than a fair picture of the ill effects due to such dumping
of hazardous solid waste at the landfill site.

</p><p id="p_243">25.   The Committee has led much stress on the fact that the
gypsum in the underground environment landfill site may
become wet during the rainy season or due to flooding and
become anaerobic (without oxygen) and would produce
hydrogen sulphide gas (H2S) due to the sulphur bacteria that
feed on the gypsum. The Committee has also stated in its
report about the effects of hydrogen sulphide. There is one
more aspect which we would like to highlight and that is the
sewerage treatment plant situated near the residential site
Paradise Park. According to the report, in the current situation
the sewerage treatment plant situated near the Paradise Park
may also contribute to the H2S concentration. The Committee
has also recommended, taking into consideration the serious
and long lasting effect of hydrogen sulphide and other
potential gases generated from the decomposition of the
harmful materials in the landfill, to take all necessary steps to
prevent the inhabitation from any such exposure.

<p id="p_244">26.   We are not at all impressed by the submission canvassed
by Mr.Soparkar, the learned senior advocate appearing for the
respondent no.11 - Ahmedabad Builders' Association, that the
distance of 500 meters to be maintained as a buffer zone from
a landfill site is more in the nature of a guideline rather than a
statutory restriction imposed by any law or rules in that regard.
We can appreciate the anxiety on the part of the respondent
no.11 to do away with the restriction of maintaining 500
meters of buffer zone from a landfill site but no permission to
develop the land within 500 meters of a landfill site can be
permitted at the cost of health of the people at large.

</p><p id="p_246">27.   The criteria provided by the Central Pollution Control
Board for the hazardous waste landfills make it very clear that
a landfill site should be atleast 500 meters from a notified
habitated area. It further provides that a zone of 500 meters
around a landfill boundary should be declared as a 'no-
development buffer land' after the landfill location is finalized.
This may be in the nature of a criteria or a guideline but the
same should not be ignored on the premise that the law or any
rules do not provide for the same.
</p>

<p id="p_247">28.   We are also not impressed by the submission of
Mr.Soparkar that the report of the experts should not be given
undue importance because there is nothing to even remotely
suggest that the quality of the groundwater has deteriorated
due to the direct impact of the landfill site. The report of the
experts is very clear that the leachate analysis showed much
higher level of almost all the parameters compared to borewell
water, thereby suggesting that the chemicals may have got
percolated into the groundwater.
</p>

<p id="p_248">29.   We are at pains to observe that each of the respondents
is responsible in some manner or the other in creating the
imbroglio. We also noticed during the course of hearing that
each of the respondents tried to throw the blame on the other
but, none was ready to shoulder or accept its responsibility or
mistake. We do agree that when the landfill site was finalized,
the authorities were very much conscious of the fact that in
the surrounding area people had already started residing and,
therefore, no permission, if any, could have been granted for
establishment of the landfill site. However, the authorities
proceeded ahead to give clearance to the landfill site in an

area thickly populated by human habitat. However, it is too
late in the day to find fault with anyone but rather it is time to
act with a view to protect the citizens from any health hazards.
The landfill site is now closed. The society managing the same
has used the site to its maximum and now there is no further
scope of the site being used. Around 12.50 lac Metric Tonnes
of hazardous waste has been dumped at the landfill site. The
third Cell which, according to the experts, is still live, could
pose a serious threat to the health of the people living nearby.
This is not a case where an industry has been setup and is
found to be causing pollution in the area making the life of the
people miserable so that we may issue appropriate directions
for closure. Here is a case of a landfill site which has been used
and sealed for all times to come. Therefore, there is nothing
we can do as on today so far as the landfill site is concerned,
but we can surely intervene with a view to protect the health
of the people.
</p>

<p id="p_249">30.   It appears that to meet with the report filed by the team
of experts comprising of the members of NIOH and GPCB, the
respondent no.11 obtained an independent report of an expert
in the field. In the said report prepared by one Mr.Jaydev
Nansey of New Delhi, it has been stated that the report of the
Committee does not establish any effect of the SLF on the
surface and sub-surface waters around the site. According to
the report of Mr.Nansey, the site has been designed in a
technically and scientifically proven manner with impervious
layers present on bottom, side and top of the SLF that leads to
control and prevention of pollution from the site. It has also
been stated that the ground and surface water studies from
the vicinity of the SLF do not indicates any contamination of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                            Page 77 of 89</span>

the water. The site design has withstood the test of natural
disasters such as earthquakes and flooding of the worse kind
during the past years with no episode of pollution or
contamination. According to Mr.Nansey, in the current situation
the possibility of any effect of the SLF on human habitation in
the vicinity of the facility is not foreseen. In short, the report
placed by the respondent no.11 of an expert seeks to
challenge the findings recorded by the Committee of experts.
</p>

<p id="p_250">31.   The report of Mr.Nansey on which strong reliance has
been placed by the respondent no.11 is hardly of any
consequence so far as the case at hand is concerned. Let us
assume for the moment that the experts are of the opinion
that the landfill site will have no hazardous effect on human
habitation in the vicinity, then in such circumstances, should
we ignore the statutory prohibition imposed by the Legislature
and override the same relying on a report of an expert. The
answer has to be emphatically 'No'. This Court sitting in writ-
jurisdiction cannot say that although there is a restriction
imposed by the authority under a statute so far as the distance
to be maintained from the landfill site and human habitation,
the same should be ignored as the experts are of the opinion
that such a landfill site would not pose any potential health
hazard to the people residing in the vicinity of the same. It is
for the authorities concerned to take into consideration such
opinion, if any, and take appropriate decision in that regard. If
the authorities concerned are of the opinion, having regard to
the ill-effects of a landfill site on the humans, that the distance
of 500 meters is not required to be maintained, then they may
do away with such a restriction but so long as such restriction
remains, we are duty bound to see that the same is complied

found to be ultra vires any statutory provision.
</p>

<p id="p_251">32.   In the aforesaid context, we may profitably look into the
few decisions of the Supreme Court taking the view that court
would not pass any order in exercise of its constitutional power
which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable
or ignoring the statutory provisions dealing with the subject. In
other words, the Supreme Court in many decisions has taken
the view that even acting under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_15">Article 142</a> of the Constitution
of India, it cannot pass an order or grant relief which is totally

      namely, the chance under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_17">Section 139</a>, but it felt that by

      respect, we find this line of reasoning               altogether
      unsupportable. A result flowing from a statutory provision
      is never an evil. A court has no power to ignore that
      provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting
      from its operation. A statute must of course be given
      effect to whether a court likes the result or not. When the
      High Court found that <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_19">Section 131(2)(b)</a> had been

and right to live in a clean city. The legal responsibility of the

ensure his physical and mental wellbeing will, therefore, be a
measure of the individual's right to health in a welfare state.
Every sovereign state has a plenary power to do all things
which promote the health, peace, morals, education and good

the Constitution makers envisaged. The obligation of the State
to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions
congenial to good health is cast by the Constitutional
directives contained in Articles 39(e) &amp; (f), 42 and 47 in part IV
of the Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_256">37.   The Supreme Court in various decisions has held that the
right to live with human dignity enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_29">Article 21</a> derives
its life and breathe from the directive principles of State policy
particularly <a href="/doc/129471/" id="a_30">Article 39(e)</a> <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_31">&amp; (f</a><a href="/doc/1975922/" id="a_32">), 41</a> and <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_33">42</a> and would therefore
include protection of health as envisaged in the directives. The
expanded meaning of right to life is wholly justified, for,
without health of a person being protected and his well being
looked after, it would be impossible for him to enjoy other
fundamental rights such as rights to freedom of speech and
expression, to move freely throughout the territory of India, to
practice any profession or carrying on any trade, occupation or
business, to form associations guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_34">Article 19</a> in a
positive manner. Without a guarantee of health and well being
most of these freedoms cannot be exercised fully. To make
other rights meaningful and effective right to a healthy life is
the basis underlying the constitutional guarantees. All that the
courts have done is to provide redressal by a meaningful and
just interpretation to the right to life and commanding
enforcement of the duties of a welfare State. The Court itself
being an authority and therefore 'State' within the meaning of

of sickness as held by the Supreme Court. The Apex Court of
this country has played a decisive role in realization of the
right to health by recognising the right as a part of the
fundamental right to life and issuing suitable directions to the
State authorities for the discharge of their duties. The Court
has   recognised        that   maintenance       of health   is   a     most
imperative constitutional         goal     whose realisation      requires

protection and improvement of human environment is a

conscious of the fact that all those who are desirous of
developing their land are likely to be put in difficulty but, at the
same time, we cannot permit the authorities to grant
development permission ignoring the statutory restriction and
the hard reality existing as on today. To permit development
and construction near the landfill site will be nothing short of
pushing people to live at such a place where there is a
potential health hazard and more particularly when the law
itself prohibits a landfill site within a radius of 500 meters from
a human habitat.

42.   Our final conclusion is as under :


      (1)     The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation committed
      an    error        in    granting     permission      in    favour    of    the
</pre><p id="p_260">      respondent nos.1 and 2 for construction of the Paradise
      Park on the specious plea that since the area in question
      is falling within the residential zone such permission was
      granted. We are saying so, because even at the time of
      grant of such permission, the Corporation was aware that
      there does exist a landfill site adjoining the site where
      construction was to be made.
</p>

<p id="p_261">      (2) The           reliance placed by the Ahmedabad Municipal
      Corporation on the letter dated 21 st January 2011 of the
      Government              of    Gujarat,      Forests    and     Environment
      Department,             by    which     the      Government      asked      the
      Corporation             to   consider      the    representation      of    the
      respondent nos.1 and 2 permitting them to go ahead with
      the project is also completely misplaced.

<p id="p_262">      (3)     The        Government            of      Gujarat,     Forests       and
      Environment Department, vide letter dated 8th December
      2010 addressed to the Corporation, had issued specific
      direction under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_43">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection)
      Act, 1986, to take the permission granted in favour of the

      regard coupled with instructions to the local officers
      dealing with the grant of permission to the housing
      projects not to grant permission nearby the TSDF sites

January 2011 to consider the representation of the
respondent nos.1 and 2 to go ahead with the construction
on the ground that there were many residential projects
near the TSDF sites already in existence.
</p>

<p id="p_263">(4)     The respondent nos.1 and 2 cannot take advantage
of such illegal permission granted by the Corporation
dehors the statutory restriction as regards the distance to
be maintained from the TSDF sites. If the respondent
nos.1 and 2 are aggrieved in any manner or are of the
view that they acted and proceeded with the construction
on the strength of the permission which was granted by
the Corporation, then it would be open for the respondent
nos.1 and 2 to seek appropriate relief before the
appropriate forum in accordance with law against the
Corporation for damages. However, we make it clear that
we have not gone into the question of damages and it
would be for the appropriate forum to look into the same
in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_264">(5)     The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation shall not
grant any permission to the housing projects nearby the
TSDF sites within the radius of 500 meters in all parts of
the city of Ahmedabad where such TSDF sites are located
including the Building Use Permission to the respondent
nos.1 and 2.

<p id="p_265">(6)     In the report submitted by the experts, it has been
stated that the respondent no.10 - Green Environment
Service Cooperative Society has not provided vents in
Cell No.3 due to which, during the inspection, the

      test/analysis of the emission from vents in Cell No.3.

      shortcomings and the deficiencies pointed out by the
      Committee in its report within a period of four weeks
      from today and inform about such compliance to the
      Committee so that the Committee can once again make
      an inspection to ensure that their suggestions have been
      complied with.

<p id="p_267">      (8)     The authorities are also directed to chalk out a plan
      or a project by which all borewells in the area within 500
      meters of the landfill site could be closed over a period of
      time and necessary arrangements are made for adequate
      supply of potable water through pipelines.
