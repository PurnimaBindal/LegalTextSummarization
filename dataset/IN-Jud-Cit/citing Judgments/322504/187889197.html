                 in all Writ Petitions as follows :-

                          The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.No.11801 of

                 2014 submitted that the notice issued by the fourth respondent to the

                 petitioners&#x27; father under Section 15(2) of the Act is bad in law for the reason

                 that the Act contemplates under Chapter III Section 8 speaks about the

                 construction and development later under the same Section there should be an

                 notification under the sub-section regarding a draft notification after getting

                 objections from the petitioners. The Sub Clause 2 of Section 8 contemplates the

                 benefits under a &amp; b regarding acquisition and under Sub Clause 3 &amp; 4 of

                 Section 8 of the Act speaks about the details of preliminary notification and the

                 proposed building lines and control line. Further, Sections 9 to 14 of the Act

                 have not been followed by the respondents.

                 notification under Section 15(1) of the Act was issued on 29.01.2014 in

                 G.O.Ms.213, Highways and Minor Ports (NH2) dated 27.12.2013, only on a

                 dead person namely Abaranju, who died on 08.03.1996. Therefore, the very

                 notification issued in the dead person name and it is fatal to the acquisition

                 proceedings. The subsequent notices under Sections 15(2) and 16(2) of the Act

                 also issued in the name of the dead person. There was no order passed by the

                 competent authority under Rule 5(5) of the Rules and under Section 15(3) of

                 the Act. The notices under Section 15(2) and 16(2) of the Act contemplate that

                 the District Collector has to hold the enquiry and there is no procedure

                 contemplated to delegate powers to any other authority to hold the enquiry as

                 contemplated under Sub clause 5 and Rules 2,3,4 of the Rules framed under

                 the Act, or in the alternative, the Government should conduct the enquiry and

                 pass orders. Therefore, the entire acquisition proceedings is improper and

                 illegal.

                 the acquisition and requisition of property falls within the concurrent list of the

                 constitution and the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_3">State Act</a> prescribed a procedure for acquisition repugnant

                 to the one laid down in the 1894 Act. Thereafter the Central Act No.30 of 2013

                 enacted with a view to provide for a detailed procedure for the compulsory

                 acquisition of land on payment of compensation including damages. It also

                 repealed the earlier acquisition act of 1894 and as such, the provisions of the

                 <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_4">State Act</a>, 2001 are repugnant and contrary to the provisions of the 2013,

                 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_5">Central Act</a>.



                          5.1.   Admittedly, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_6">Central Act</a> No.30 of 2013 exempting certain acts

                 including the Tamil Nadu Highways Act,2001 from the provisions of the

                 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_7">Central Act</a>, subject to the condition that the State Government shall issue

                 notification within a period of one year directing that the provisions of the 2013

                 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_8">Central Act</a> relating to determination of compensation and rehabilitation shall

                 apply to all cases of land acquisition under the enactments mentioned in the

                 fifth Schedule. The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act was deemed to come into

                 force from 01.01.2014 and the issuance of notification mentioned above has

                 not been complied with till date. Therefore, the Tamil Nadu Highways Act,

                 2001 has become unconstitutional and ultra vires, since the same is repugnant

                 to the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_9">Central Act</a> No.30 of 2013. <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_10">The State Act</a> violates the fundamental right

                 W.P.Nos.13176 to 13180 of 2014 submitted that as per the rules contemplated

                 of the concerned taluk, should publish the substance of the proposed

                 acquisition procedure. Therefore, the entire acquisition proceedings is violated

                 and liable to be quashed. The Chapter III <a href="/doc/105251258/" id="a_26">Section 8</a> speaks about the

                 construction and development later, under the same section there should be

                 objections from the petitioners. The notice under <a href="/doc/94356703/" id="a_27">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act has

                 been issued by the fifth respondent viz., the Special Tasildar (LA) and it cannot

                 be sustained, since it ought to have been issued by the second respondent viz.,

                 the District Collector as such, it is not valid under law. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_28">The Act</a> contemplates

                 acquisition of private lands and transfer of government lands required for the

                 above said project facilities in G.O.S.No.199, Highways and Minor Ports (NH-

                 2) Department dated 04.12.2012.



                          9.1.   Accordingly, the respondents initiated action for acquisition of

                 lands and published notification as required under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_33">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act in

                 held on 19.06.2013. The second petitioner has appeared for enquiry and raised

                 his objections as a large extent of land owned by him was already acquired and

                 as such he requested to refrain from the acquisition. The objections raised by

                 the petitioners have been sent to the requisitioning body viz., the Divisional

                 Engineer to offer his remarks. After considering the objections, he

                 recommended that the objections were not found acceptable for the reason that

                 it is inevitable to acquire the land, since it is required for junction improvement.

                 The government after considering the objections raised by the petitioners and

                 the remarks of the requisitioning body, decided to acquire the subjection

                 properties, by the Government Order in G.O.Ms. No.213, Highways and Minor

                 Ports (NH-2) Department, dated 27.12.2013 and published the notification in

                 the Tamil Nadu gazette dated 29.01.2014. After publication of notice under

                 <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_35">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act, the notice under <a href="/doc/94356703/" id="a_36">Section 16(2)</a> of the Act was issued

                 to the land owners i.e., the petitioners herein on 03.03.2014 to surrender the

                 subject land to the government.



                          9.2.   It is further submitted that the subject land stands in the name of

                 Abaranji viz., the father of the petitioners, who expired on 08.03.1996. After

                 his demise, the petitioners failed to transfer the properties in their names viz.,

                 of the Act was issued in the name of Abaranji. The said notice was duly

                 received by the petitioners and also appeared for the enquiry on 19.06.2013

                 and filed their objections. Therefore, the notice issued in the name of the dead

                          9.3.   The subject land is required for the construction of project facilities

                 such as interchange, bus bay, truck lay bye, wayside amenities and junction

                 improvements, as such the acquisition proceedings are initiated under Section

                 provided in Chapter 4 of the Act and there is not violation of any rules. The

                 grounds raised by the petitioners are under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_38">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894,

                 whereas the acquisition proceedings are initiated under Section 15(2) of the

                 Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001. Therefore, there are no provisions in the

                 rules to inform the land owners before publication of the notification under

                 <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_39">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act.

                 attended the enquiry on 22.10.2013 and refused to give statement. Therefore,

                 the contention of the petitioner is not true and the petitioners were duly served

                 with notice and also they attended the enquiry. Therefore, there is no illegality

                 whatsoever as alleged by the petitioners and the acquisition proceedings are in

                 accordance with law and the Writ Petition is liable to be dismissed.

                          12.    In W.P.Nos.13176 to 13180 of 2014, the respondents filed counter

                 byes, junction improvements, wayside amenities etc., the additional lands are

                 required and hence the private lands involved adjacent to the Chennai outer

                 ring road for providing the above facilities are required to be acquired. By the

                 Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.199, Highways and Minor Ports (NH-2)

                 Department, dated 04.12.2012 have accorded Administrative Sanction for

                 Department dated 26.03.2013. Accordingly, the respondent initiated action for

                 acquisition of the subject lands owned by the petitioners and issued notice

                 the Rules. The enquiry was conducted on 20.06.2013 after issuance of notice to

                 the petitioners. The petitioners had appeared for the enquiry on 20.06.2013 and

                 raised his objection as the land proposed to be acquired is an ancestral property

                 and already a portion of land has been acquired for formation of ORR. Except

                 the subject land no other land is available for his own use. The objections have

                 been sent to the requisitioning body to offer their remarks on the objection. On

                 receipt of the same, it was found that the objections may be overruled.

                 Thereafter, necessary proposals for approval of notification under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_55">Section 15(1)</a>

                 of the Act has been sent to the Government along with objections and also

                 of the requisitioning body, decided to acquire the subject properties and passed

                 owner need not be communicated to them, as there is no provisions in the Act.

                 According to <a href="/doc/94356703/" id="a_56">Section 16(1)</a> of the Act, when a notice under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_57">Section 15(1)</a> is

                 published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, the land to which the said

                 notice shall on and from the date of such publication vest absolutely with the

                 Government free from all encumbrances. Hence the notice under <a href="/doc/94356703/" id="a_58">Section 16(2)</a>

                 of the Act has been served to the petitioners to surrender or deliver the

                 possession of the subject properties. While pending the said notices, the present

                 writ petitions have been filed and as such, all the proceedings and rules have

                 been duly followed. In fact all the Writ Petitioners were dismissed and

                 aggrieved by the same, the petitioners filed Writ Appeal in W.A.No.799 of

                 2014 and the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of this Court allowed the Writ Appeal

                 and remanded back the matter to this Court for hearing the Writ Petition afresh

                 and pass orders on merits and in accordance with law.



                          12.2. The contention of the petitioner in all Writ Petitioner is that the

                 Chapter III of the Act relates to restriction of ribbon development and Chapter

                 IV of the Act relates to acquisition of lands for the purpose of any highways or

                 construction of bridges, culverts or other structures thereon for provision of

                 highways, preparation of maps and powers of highways authorities and other

                 officers. The acquisition of the subject land is being initiated as per the

                 provisions laid down in Chapter IV of the Act and the rules made thereunder.

                 Therefore, Chapter III need not be followed in these cases and there is no

                 violation in the acquisition proceedings and prayed for dismissal of the Writ

                 Petitions.

                          I. Whether the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 has become

                 overruling the objections?

                          III. Whether the acquisition is vitiated, if the notice served on the dead

                 person?

                          16.    <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_71">The Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 was in force throughout the

                 country. After the Union Territories and States have been given concurrent

                 power to legislate, the State of Tamil Nadu enacted three acquisition laws such

                 as, Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Scheme, 1978, Tamil

                 Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purpose Act, 1997, and Tamil Nadu

                 Highways Act, 2001. Besides the Land Acquisition Act, 1984, there was a

                 <a href="/doc/1222415/" id="a_72">National Highways Act</a>, 1956 and it was enacted to provide for the declaration

                 of certain highways to be national highways. Therefore the State of Tamil Nadu

                 obtained Presidential assent as per <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_73">Article 254</a> of the Constitution of India to

                 avoid repugnancy and accordingly, three <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_74">State Act</a>s prevailed in the State of

                 Tamil Nadu.

                 2013 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_75">(Central Act</a> No.30 of 2013) (hereinafter referred to as “the New Act”)

                 received assent of the President of India on 27.09.2013 and came into force

                 with effect from 01.01.2014. It carried <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_76">Section 105</a> to declare that this Act shall

                 have no application to certain enactments made by the Parliament relating to

                 land acquisition specified in the fourth Schedule. Therefore, the State of Tamil

                 Nadu sought to protect and reserve its three State enactments from the

                 operation of the New Act and the Tamil Nadu Amendment Act was effected to

                 the New Act, thereby inserting <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_77">Section 105A</a> in the New Act. The said

                 amendment Act received Presidential assent on 01.01.2015 and was applied

                 retrospectively from 01.01.2014 onwards. The retrospective date has been

                 chosen by the State legislature with the object to protect the acquisition under

                 the three State enactments from being rendered void due to repugnancy after

                 coming into effect of the New Act.



                          16.2. Therefore, the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_78">Amendment Act</a> along with other two enactments

                 subsequent enactments of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_81">Amendment Act</a> with effect from 01.01.2014 would

                 Therefore, the State Government made an attempt to revive the three

                 enactments and tabled a Bill on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. It was

                 titled as the Tamil Nadu Land Acquisition Laws (Revival of Operation,

                 Amendment and <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_83">Validation) Act</a> 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_84">Validation

                 Act</a>”) It was sent for the assent of the President in terms of <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_85">Article 254(2)</a> of

                 the Constitution of India and it was granted on 02.12.2019. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_86">This Act</a> was

                 applied retrospectively from 26.09.2013 with an object to validate all pending

                 acquisitions on and after that date under the State enactments.



                          16.3. The said <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_87">Validation Act</a> challenged before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

                 Court of India in Writ Petition (C) No.1411 of 2020. In the said case, the

                 Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India framed the following issues:-

                                      (i) Whether the State legislature had
                                 legislative competence to enact the 2019 Act, a

                 And in the above case, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India passed judgment on

                 29.06.2021, as follows :-

                                       “46. We may now consider the argument
                                 that the 2019 Act does not remove the defects
                                 found by the High Court and thus, lacks
                                 determinative    principle       thereby       making      it
                                 arbitrary. The 2019 Act is a conscious attempt by
                                 the State legislature to bring four material
                                 aspects of land acquisition under the three State
                                 enactments at par with the 2013 Act i.e.,
                                 compensation, rehabilitation, resettlement and
                                 infrastructure   facilities.     No    doubt,         certain
                                 features of the stated law made by the Parliament
                                 have been left out, but that debate does not fall

                                 enactments results into non removal of defects
                                 pointed by the High Court, is nothing but a
                                 palpable misreading of the judgment of the High
                                 Court.


                                       47. Whereas, the judgment of the High
                                 Court does not even point out the absence of
                                 compensation/rehabilitation/resettlement/infrastr
                                 ucture related provisions as a defect in the State
                                 enactments. It nowhere points out the exact
                                 provisions from the State enactments which are
                                 repugnant to the law made by the Parliament.
                                 The only defect pointed out by the High Court
                                 was the impermissibility of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_89">Section 105A</a> (coming
                                 into effect from 01.01.2014), as a tool for
                                 reviving the State enactments once rendered
                                 repugnant (on 27.09.2013) due to law made by
                                 the Parliament. The State has since been advised
                                 to accept that defect pointed out by the High
                                 Court and has moved on from that thought

                                 from the basic concept of retrospectivity. The
                                 primary objective of retrospective application of
                                 a     law      is     to     alter          an   undesirable     past

                                 ambiguous and that a good deal of confusion has
                                 been caused by the fact that it is used in more
                                 senses than one. In general, however, the courts
                                 regard as retrospective any statute which

                                 operates on cases or facts coming into existence
                                 before its commencement in the sense that it
                                 affects, even if for the future only, the character
                                 or consequences of transactions previously
                                 entered into or of other past conduct. Thus a
                                 statute is not retrospective merely because it
                                 affects existing rights; or is it retrospective
                                 merely because a part of the requisites for its
                                 action is drawn from a time antecedent to its
                                 passing.” (emphasis supplied)


                                       The underlying purpose of retrospectivity,
                                 therefore, is to cure including validate certain
                                 transactions of the past by making a law in the
                                 present and not to compete with the laws existing
                                 in the past at that point of time. In this case, the
                                 objective   was to    save    and   validate     past
                                 acquisitions under the three State enactments,
                                 which were valid until the commencement of the
                                 2013 Act but stood quashed due to the High
                                 Court decision. This was also for altering the
                                 basis of the law in existence at that point of time
                                 and providing for benefits at par with the 2013
                                 Act, so far as it was fit in the wisdom of the State
                                 legislature. No doubt, it may appear anomalous
                                 to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013,

                 in W.P.Nos.11801, 13176 to 13180 of 2014 submitted that under the Act, the

                 land owners are entitled to have a copy of reasons for overruling the objections

                 and the said provisions could not be adopted in the said proceedings. The

                 petitioners never received any copy of the enquiry report submitted by the

                 enquiry committee and as such, the entire land acquisition proceedings are

                 vitiated and liable to be set aside. In this regard, he relayed upon the judgment

                                 is a very valuable right of a person whose

                                 have appropriate and reasonable opportunity of

                          17.5. All the above judgments are arising out of the provisions under

                 objectors in written made to the Collector, and the Collector was given

                 opportunity of hearing to the objectors. After hearing such objections and after

                 making further enquiry, the Collector shall submit a report to the appropriate

                 Government authority containing his recommendation on the objections. It is

                 true that the objections to the acquisition proceedings is not an empty formality

                 and that it is a substantive right. It is a right given to the land owner giving him

                 a reasonable opportunity to persuade the authority concerned, against the

                 respondents issued notice under <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_144">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act and the same was

                 published in Tamil newspapers on 26.05.2013. It was also published in the

                 Act, 2001. The notice was issued to land owners/interested persons including

                 the petitioners. The petitioners were requested to appear for enquiry to be held

                 on 19.06.2013. Accordingly, the second petitioner in W.P.No.11801 of 2014

                 had appeared for enquiry and raised his objection as a large extent of land in

                 S.No.16/4A owned by him has already been acquired and requested to refrain

                 from acquisition.

                 requisitioning body to offer their remarks. The requisitioning body considered

                 the objections raised by the petitioners and recommended that the objections

                 were not found acceptable on the ground that it is inevitable to acquire the land

                 referred to as it is required for junction improvement to the vehicular under

                 pass provided to facilitate the vehicles crossing the project road on either side

                 smoothly. After considering the objections and remarks of the requisition body,

                 the Government have decided to acquire the lands.

                                 despite the same, the authorities did not carry
                                 out   necessary    changes    in     the     <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_149">Section      6</a>
                                 declaration also. In view of such a finding, the
                                 Bench quashed the entire proceedings and that
                                 too at the instance of the legal heir of the
                                 deceased owner. But in the case on hand, the
                                 property has changed several hands and the
                                 appellants purchased the plots much after the
                                 award enquiry was over. It is not the case of the
                                 appellants that anyone ever brought to the notice
                                 of the acquiring authorities, the fact that the
                                 original   owner     was     dead.     Under         such
                                 circumstances it is difficult to comprehend as to
                                 how the authorities can be expected to know that
                                 the original owner was dead. We are entirely in
                                 agreement with the views expressed by the
                                 learned Judges in the aforesaid cases, especially
                                 in the light of their finding in those cases that the
                                 acquiring authorities had knowledge of the death
                                 of the owner of the lands.</blockquote>

</p><p id="p_29">                                    13. The only other contention which remains
                                 to be dealt with is that the order impugned in
                                 this case is not enforceable because it was
                                 directed against the petitioner&#x27;s husband, who
                                 was dead at the date of the order, besides the
                                 other two persons indicated in it who were not
                                 concerned with the premises. In our opinion,
                                 there is no substance in this contention either. An
                                 order like the one passed under <a href="/doc/82246379/" id="a_150">Section 6(4)(a)</a>
                                 of the Act is not in the nature of an order in
                                 judicial proceedings between the Government on
                                 the one hand and other parties named. If the
                                 proceedings were intended by the Act in the
                                 sense of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings
                                 between named parties, it may have been
                                 legitimately argued that an order passed against
                                 a dead man is a complete nullity. But the order
                                 proceeds on the basis that the tenant had ceased
                                 to be in occupation of the premises in October
                                 1952, apparently by reason of the fact that he
                                 had handed over possession of the premises to
                                 the so called &quot;lodger&quot; or &quot;paying guest&quot;.
                                 Admittedly the petitioner&#x27;s husband died after
                                 October 1952. The occupation by the said

                                 of an unauthorised occupation. The fact that the
                                 petitioner&#x27;s husband was dead on the date of the
                                 order impugned has only this effect that in so far

                                 erased from the order. But even so, it does not
                                 affect the enforceability of the same. <a href="/doc/1857501/" id="a_152">Section 13</a>
                                 lays down the different modes of service of an

                                 order is of a general nature or affecting a class
                                 of persons or an individual, corporation or firm.
                                 We are here concerned with the case of an
                                 individual and the section lays down that it can
                                 be served either personally by delivering or

                                 he cannot be found, by affixing a copy of the

                                 down by the Apex Court that a distinction was

                 Abaranji and all the revenue records stood in the name of the deceased. After

<p id="p_38">                                       12. It is pertinent to note that the judgment
                                 in <a href="/doc/1252341/" id="a_188">R.Moorthy v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, 2014 (2)
                                 CWC 763, which was relied upon by the learned
                                 counsel   for   the   petitioners   herein,       was
                                 considered in M/s.Ceedeeyes Standard Towers
                                 Pvt Ltd&#x27; s case, cited supra,         wherein, the
                                 learned Judge while distinguishing R.Morthy&#x27; s
                                 case, cited supra, has held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_39">                                       21. On a reading of the above, it is
                                 evidently clear that the Court did not distinguish
                                 the decision in Jayaraman. But the observation is
                                 that the decision cannot be applied to the facts of
                                 the case relating to R.Moorthy. The reason that
                                 can be culled out from reading of the above

                                                                     W.P.Nos.11801, 13176 to 13180 of 2014
                                                                           W.P.Nos.37245 &amp; 37246 of 2015


                                 mentioned    paragraphs    and    other   relevant
                                 paragraphs of the order is that the Court was of
                                 the firm opinion that the minimum extent of land
                                 alone has to be acquired, viewed from the point
                                 of view of the land owner as well as the
                                 requisitioning body. This appears to have
                                 weighed in the minds of the Court as there are
                                 observations in paragraph No.151 to the effect
                                 that it is always favourable, if minimum extent is
                                 required. Thus, the decision in R.Moorthy cannot
                                 be taken as a decision which has distinguished
                                 Jayaraman. It is to be noted that Jayarman was
                                 rendered by referring to and relying upon a
                                 Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench Judgment in R.Kumar.
                                 Therefore, cogent reasoning was required to
                                 distinguish the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Division
                                 Bench as well as in Jayaraman.-
</p><p id="p_40">                                 Thus, the contention of the learned senior
                                 counsel for the petitioner does not hold good.”

                 This Court held that the notification issued under <a href="/doc/92814899/" id="a_189">Section 8</a> of the Act is not

                 sine qua non for initiating acquisition proceedings under <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_190">Section 15</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_42">                          20.    The learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondents

                 produced the copies of the notice issued under <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_192">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act to the

                 respective petitioners. On perusal of those documents revealed that, the

                 petitioners were duly served notices and they also filed their respective

                 objections. Of course, some of the petitioners failed to attend the enquiry which

                 was conducted by the authority concerned. After having been considered the

                 case shown by the owners of the land/interested person, published the

                 notification under <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_193">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act, thereby acquiring the subject lands

                 in these Writ Petitions.

<p id="p_43">                          20.1. Over all, the respondents duly followed the procedures as

                 contemplated under the Act and Rules for acquiring lands for the purpose of

                 Chenai outer ring road development work including project facilities such as

                 interchanges, bus bays, truck lay byes, junction improvements, wayside

                 amenities, major and minor junction improvements etc. These facilities only
