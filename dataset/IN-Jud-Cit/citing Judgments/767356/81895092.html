 OF INDIAN COPYRIGHT ACT, 1957 FOR INFRINGEMENT AND PASSING
     OFF AND FOR THE RELIEF OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION AND
                 RENDITION OF ACCOUNTS ETC.
</p>

<p id="p_2"> BRIEF FACTS AND REASONS FOR DECISION :-
</p>

<p id="p_3"> 1. The present suit was filed by the plaintiffs for infringement and passing off
 and for the relief of permanent injunction and rendition of accounts etc. It is
 submitted by the plaintiff that it is engaged in the business of manufacturing
 and marketing medicinal preparations and substances for eye ailments.

marketing medicinal and Unani preparations to prevent and cure of cataract
and other eye ailments who has adopted trademark UJALA logo in relation
to his products which has striking resemblance to the trademark of the
plaintiff.   Defendant has adopted it to pass goods of defendant and to
encash upon goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff and to make unlawful
gain by passing off spurious goods. The purchaser will get impression that
the goods belong to the plaintiff and it will create confusion in the mind of
purchaser. The act of defendant is only dishonest, fraudulent and improper.

 to cause confusion and deception and passing off goods by defendant as
goods of plaintiff. It is further prayed that defendants be directed to deliver
the infringed packaging, labels, blocks, dice, articles etc. to the plaintiff for
destruction or their erasure. It is further prayed that defendants be directed

         present suit?
</p>

<p id="p_34">14.     The burden of proof of the present issue was on the defendant. The
plaintiff has filed the suit pleading that it is a company duly incorporated under
the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_21">Indian Companies Act</a>, 1956 having its registered office at E-27, Latowali,
Kankhal, Hardwar-249408, U.P. and the same address is also mentioned in the
title of the plaint.
</p>

<p id="p_35">14.1         It is matter of judicial notice that registration of trademark for the
Northern Region is being done at Delhi and it is settled law that mere

</p>

<p id="p_36">14.2         According to plaintiff, the defendant is using UJALA logo in his
business of manufacturing and marketing medicinal and Unani preparation
which has striking resemblance to the trademark of plaintiff. It is submitted by
the plaintiff at para no. 13 of the plaint that defendant is selling his goods in
 Delhi and other parts of the country. According to plaintiff cause of action has
arose with him on 28.04.1997 when he issued a legal notice to the defendant
and the cause of action is continuous in nature.
</p>

<p id="p_37">14.3         At para no. 17 of the plaint it is submitted by the plaintiff that the
defendant works for gain in Delhi and the acts of passing off are carried out at
Delhi. However plaintiff has failed to mention that how the defendant works for
gain at Delhi when in title of the plaint itself plaintiff has mentioned the business
activity of defendant at Kharkhani, Hardwar-249401(U.P) and administrative
office at Karmagala, Bangalore. In reply to the same it is submitted by the
defendant that the defendants are established at Hardwar and their
administrative office is at Bangalore.
</p>

<p id="p_38">14.4         The citation from Hon'ble High Court of Delhi titled <a href="/doc/123737198/" id="a_22">Ultra Home
Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Purushottam Kumar Chaubey &amp; Ors</a>. on 20 th
January 2016 in FAO (OS) 494/2015 &amp; CM 17816/2015 in relevant para no. 13,
14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 is reproduced as under:
</p>


<p id="p_39">   "13. It is evident from the above observations that the interpretation given to
   the expression "carries on business" in the context of a defendant under section
   20 of the Code has also been employed in the context of a plaintiff under the
   said <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_23">sections 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_24">62(2)</a>. Thus, in addition to the places where suits could
   be filed under section 20 of the Code, the plaintiff can also institute a suit under
   the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_25">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 and the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_26">Copyright Act</a>, 1957, as the case may be, by
   taking advantage of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_27">section 134(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_28">section 62(2)</a>,
   respectively. Both the latter provisions are in pari materia. Under these
   provisions four situations can be contemplated in the context of the plaintiff
   being a corporation (which includes a company). First of all, is the case where
   the plaintiff has a sole office. In such a case, even if the cause of action has
   arisen at a different place, the plaintiff can institute a suit at the place of the sole
 office. Next is the case where the plaintiff has a principal office at one place and
a subordinate or branch office at another place and the cause of action has
arisen at the place of the principal office. In such a case, the plaintiff may sue at
the place of the principal office but cannot sue at the place of the subordinate
office. The third case is where the plaintiff has a principal office at one place and
the cause of action has arisen at the place where its subordinate office is
located. In this eventuality, the plaintiff would be deemed to carry on business at
the place of his subordinate office and not at the place of the principal office.
Thus, the plaintiff could sue at the place of the subordinate office and cannot
sue (under the scheme of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_29">section 134(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_30">62(2)</a>) at the
place of the principal office. The fourth case is where the cause of action neither
arises at the place of the principal office nor at the place of the subordinate
office but at some other place. In this case, the plaintiff would be deemed to
carry on business at the place of its principal office and not at the place of the
subordinate office. And, consequently, it could institute a suit at the place of its
principal office but not at the place of its subordinate office. All these four cases
are set out in the table below for greater clarity:
</p>

<p id="p_40">S.No. Place of Place of Place where Place where Plaintiff's Plaintiff's cause of
Plaintiff can Principal Office Subordinate action arose additionally sue (Sole
office in /Branch under section s.no.1) Office 134(2) and section 62(2)

    2           A           B           A            A

    3           A           B           B            B

    4           A           B           C            A


</p><p id="p_41">14.     The present case falls under S. No. 3 in the above table. The appellant /
plaintiff has its principal office in Delhi (place A). Its subordinate office is at
Deogarh, Jharkhand (place B) where it runs one of its hotels (Amrapali Clarks
Inn), albeit in collaboration with Clarks Inn hotels. The alleged cause of action
has accrued at Deogarh, Jharkhand (place B). Therefore, the appellant/plaintiff
could, in respect of the alleged cause of action in this suit, institute a suit against
the defendants at Deogarh, Jharkhand (place B) but not in Delhi. Thus, the
conclusion arrived at by the learned single judge that this court did not have the
 territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit cannot be faulted.
</p>
<p id="p_42">15. We may point out that the learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff had
also urged that there was some conflict between the decisions of the Supreme
Court in Dhodha House (supra) and Sanjay Dalia (supra). But, that argument is
not available to the learned counsel for multiple reasons. The first and only
reason that we may allude to is that in Sanjay Dalia (supra) itself, the Supreme
Court, considered its decision in Dhodha House (supra) and held that there was
nothing in the interpretation put forth in Sanjay Dalia (supra) which militated
against the observations / conclusions in Dhodha House. The exact language
used by the Supreme Court on this aspect is as under:-
</p>

<p id="p_43">  "42. <a href="/doc/1001948/" id="a_31">In Dhodha House [Dhodha House v. S.K. Maingi</a>, (2006) 9 SCC 41] , the
  question which is posed before us did not come up for consideration and it
  has been observed that the Act provides for an additional forum. Such
  additional forum was provided so as to enable a plaintiff who may not be
  otherwise in a position to file a suit at different places where the copyright
  was violated. We have anxiously considered the aforesaid observations
  made and the object of the Act, we find that the interpretation made by us
  does not militate against the observations made by this Court in <a href="/doc/1001948/" id="a_32">Dhodha
  House [Dhodha House v. S.K. Maingi</a>, (2006) 9 SCC 41] , the precise
  question which is before us, was not involved in the aforesaid case. A
  decision is not to be construed like a statute nor by inferential process can it
  be assumed that this Court has decided the question also which is before
  this Court in the instant cases."
</p>
<p id="p_44">16. Interestingly, in the present case, even if the deeming fiction of the
Explanation in section 20 of the Code is not imported into either of the said
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_33">sections 134(2)</a> or 62(2), on the basis of the averments made in the plaint itself it
becomes clear that the plaintiff carries on business at, inter alia, Deogarh. In
Dhodha House (supra) itself it was observed as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_45">  "46. The expression "carries on business" and the expression "personally
  works for gain" connote two different meanings. For the purpose of carrying
  on business only presence of a man at a place is not necessary. Such
  business may be carried on at a place through an agent or a manager or
  through a servant. The owner may not even visit that place. The phrase
  "carries on business" at a certain place would, therefore, mean having an
  interest in a business at that place, a voice in what is done, a share in the
  gain or loss and some control thereover xxxxx" (underlining added)
</p><p id="p_46">    17. The appellant / plaintiff has a clear and admitted interest in the business
   of its hotel - Amrapali Clarks Inn - at Deogarh. On the basis of the averments in
   the plaint, the plaintiff carries on business through the said hotel at Deogarh. To
   recapitulate, the plaintiff had stated the following in paragraph 39 of the plaint:

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "The plaintiff's has long back presence in the town of Deogarh (Jharkhand)
       where the defendants have launched the impugned project AMBAPALI
       GREEN. The plaintiff has its hotel in Deogarh which is operational and
       running in profit and plaintiff's trademark has been known to the local
       residents and tourists who throng to that place for worship." (underlining

</blockquote><p id="p_47">   18. Clearly, on the basis of the averments in the plaint itself and in the backdrop
   of the observations in Dhodha House (supra), the appellant / plaintiff carries on
   business in Deogarh, Jharkhand. It may also carry on business at Delhi. But,
   because the cause of action has allegedly arisen in Deogarh, Jharkhand, and
   not in Delhi, the appellant/plaintiff cannot sue the defendants/respondents in
   Delhi in view of the decision in Sanjay Dalia (supra). Thus, this court does not
   have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit. And, on this count, the
   decision of the learned single judge cannot be faulted. But, the suit ought not to
   have been dismissed. As this court did not have jurisdiction, the plaint ought to
   have been returned under order 7 rule 10 CPC. Only to that extent, the learned
   single judge had erred."

<p id="p_48">14.5        It is admitted as correct by PW-1 that plaintiff company has no
branch office in Delhi. However plaintiff company has sale of his product at
Delhi. The document of plaintiff are Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/13. The invoice of
plaintiff Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/9 are showing address of Hardwar, U.P. The
plaintiff needs to show that the defendant is selling his products at Delhi. Mere
registration of trademark at Delhi being the office for the entire Northern Region
will not confer jurisdiction on the parties to file suit at Delhi. The plaintiff must
show that it has office in Delhi. Plaintiff has admitted that he has no branch
office at Delhi. Plaintiff has admittedly registered office at Hardwar, U.P. Thus
the plaintiff neither has branch office nor has its Principal office at Delhi. The
plaintiff seeks to rely on the fact that defendant is carrying its business at Delhi
which is denied by the defendant. The onus of proof of the above averments is
 on the plaintiff. It is for the plaintiff to show that defendant is so carrying its
business at Delhi on face of such denial by the defendant. All the documents
filed by the plaintiff which are invoice exhibiting sale of products are pertaining to
the plaintiff.

<p id="p_49">14.6         Hence the plaintiff must show that the defendant has its office at
Delhi. Plaintiff has not filed any document to show the user of its trademark by
the defendant at its office at Delhi.       The invoices filed by the defendant
Ex.DW1/4(colly) page 33 to 36 shows that vide bill no. 7851 goods are sold to
Jupiter Publicity Company at New Delhi and also to Capsons Printer vide bill no.
007649 dated 18.10.1993 at Bazar Sita Ram, Delhi. The said goods are sold by
the defendant to its customers at Delhi. In such case, when cause of action has
arisen at different place, then the plaintiff can institute a suit at the place of its
sole office and not at the place where cause of action has allegedly arose. The
said law is laid down in case titled <a href="/doc/123737198/" id="a_34">Ultra Home Constructions Pvt. Ltd. v.
Purushottam Kumar Chaubey</a> (supra).              Hence, even when the goods of
defendant are sold at Delhi the plaintiff does not has jurisdiction to institute suit
at Delhi in absence of its Principal or branch office at Delhi. For showing of
cause of action in favour of plaintiff at Delhi in the present case the plaintiff must
show that it has branch office at Delhi. Plaintiff has admitted vide PW-1 in cross
examination dated 10.08.2009 at page 4 that it has no branch office at Delhi.
However plaintiff has deposed that it has sale of product at Delhi. Mere sale of
product by plaintiff or defendant at Delhi does not confer jurisdiction before the
present Court in favour of the plaintiff.      Thereby the plaintiff can sue the
defendant only at its Principal office and not even at its branch office when the
cause of action has not arisen at branch office. The plaintiff can sue at branch
office only if cause of action has arisen at its branch office. In the present case
the plaintiff does not have either the Principal office or its branch office at Delhi.
   Thereby merely on the basis of cause of action of selling of goods to its
  customers at Delhi by the plaintiff or selling of goods by the defendant at Delhi
  cannot allow plaintiff to institute the suit at Delhi.
</p>

<p id="p_50">  14.7        Hence, it is held that plaintiff does not have jurisdiction to institute
  the present case before the present Court and suit of the plaintiff is held barred
  by jurisdiction. Hence, the suit of the plaintiff is returned to be filed before the
  Court of competent jurisdiction.
