   THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE M.SATYANARAYANA MURTHY

                    Criminal Appeal No.1133 of 2013

JUDGMENT: (Per Hon'ble Sri Justice M.Satyanarayana Murthy)


       Mr.Begari Gangaiah, the accused in Sessions Case No.389 of

2012 on the file of III Additional District and Sessions Judge (Fast

Track Court), Medak, has preferred this Criminal Appeal under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 374(2)</a> Cr.P.C, challenging the conviction and sentence

passed in calendar and judgment, dated 29.11.2013, wherein he

was found guilty for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> of the Indian

Penal Code (for short, "<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>") and sentenced him to under go Life

Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/-.

       The case of the prosecution, in brief, is that, the marriage of

Putta Mogulamma (the deceased) was performed with Putta

Galaiah (PW.1) and blessed with four children and they lived

happily for some time and thereafter, the deceased-Mogulamma

was necked out by her husband-P.Galaiah (PW.1) on the ground

that she developed illicit intimacy with the accused-appellant.

Then a panchayat was held on 05.05.2011 at the Panchayat Office

and in the said panchayat, the accused and the deceased hurled

abusive language against each other. After that the accused and

the deceased left the panchayat office and in the meanwhile

Mr.B.Niranjan (PW.8) came and informed on the same day at 13.00

hours to Putta Galaiah (PW.1) that the deceased- Mogulamma was

killed by the accused with an axe.           Immediately, Putta Galaiah

(PW.1), the husband of the deceased, went to the scene of offence
                                                             RSC, J &amp; MSM,J
                                                            CrlA_1133_2013


                                 2


and found her deadbody in a pool of blood.       Immediately, Putta

Galaiah (PW.1) lodged a report (Ex.P1) with the Pulkal Police

Station, which was registered as a case in Crime No.42 of 2011 for

the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a> IPC and issued FIR (Ex.P12).

      During investigation, the police examined nineteen witnesses

and recorded their statements under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. and

visited the scene of offence, held inquest on the deadbody,

recovered the bloodstained earth and controlled earth and the

deadbody was sent for post-mortem examination. After conducting

the post-mortem examination by the doctor, and after collecting

the entire material including, post-mortem examination report-

Ex.P-11, FSL Report-Ex.P-13, apprehended the accused on

09.05.2011, recovered MO.4-axe under the cover of Ex.P10-

seizure panchanama based on confession leading to discovery and

having concluded that there is prima-facie material against the

accused for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a> IPC, Mr.D.Krishna, the

Circle Inspector of Police, Jogipet Circle (PW.15), filed the charge-

sheet against the appellant-accused and the case was taken on file

for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> IPC by the Judicial Magistrate of

First Class, Jogipet, and registered the same as PRC No.6 of 2012.

The Judicial Magistrate of First Class committed the case to the

Sessions Division, Medak, as the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_8">Section 302</a> IPC is

exclusively triable by Court of Session. The Principal District and

Sessions Judge, Medak, registered the same as Sessions Case

No.389 of 2012 and later made over the same to the III Additional

District and Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court), Medak.

      After securing the presence of the accused, and upon

hearing, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor and the Defence

Counsel, the Sessions Court framed sole charge against the

appellant-accused for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">Section 302</a>

IPC, read over and explained to him in Telugu, he pleaded not

guilty and claimed to be tried.

      During trial, the prosecution has examined PWs. 1 to 15 and

got marked Exs.P-1 to P-14 and M.Os.1 to 7 to substantiate its

case. After closure of prosecution evidence, the accused was

examined under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C, explained the incriminating

material   that   appeared   against       him    in     testimonies     of    the

prosecution witnesses and he denied the same.

      Upon    hearing    argument         of   learned    Additional      Public

Prosecutor and Defence Counsel, the Court below found the

appellant-accused guilty for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_11">Section

302</a> IPC, convicted and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment

for life and to fine of Rs.5,000/-.

      Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence imposed upon the

appellant-accused for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">Section 302</a> of IPC, in

Sessions Case No.389 of 2012, the present Criminal Appeal is filed

on various grounds. The main grounds urged before this Court are

that, the prosecution failed to establish the links in the chain of

circumstances, more particularly, when the prosecution case is

depending on the circumstantial evidence, apart from that, the

recovery of the MO.4-Axe itself may not establish the root cause of

the prosecution case and it is not a substantive piece of evidence
                                                                   RSC, J &amp; MSM,J
                                                                  CrlA_1133_2013


                                    4


and the prosecution miserably failed to establish the chain of

circumstances, which unerringly pointing the guilt of the accused

without any doubt.       Therefore, in the absence of evidence

completing the links in the chain of circumstances, the conviction

and   sentence   imposed     upon       the   appellant-accused    by     the

impugned calendar and judgment is illegal and requested to set

aside the same by allowing this Criminal Appeal.

      During hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant-

accused reiterated the grounds urged in the memorandum of

appeal and whereas, the learned Public Prosecutor supported the

conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant-accused.

      Considering    rival   contentions,       perusing   the    material

available on record, the points that arise for consideration are:

   1) Whether the appellant-accused caused the death of the
      deceased-Mogulamma? If so, whether the appellant-accused
      is liable for punishment for the offence punishable under
      <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_13">Section 302</a> of IPC?
   2) Whether the conviction and sentence recorded by the III
      Additional District and Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court),
      Medak, in Sessions Case No.389 of 2012, be sustained?

POINT Nos.1 &amp; 2:

      As narrated above, it is the case of a murder of a lady by her

paramour on account of referring the dispute to the elders at the

panchayat office and in the said panchayat, they hurled abusive

language against each other.     Due to that they allegedly left the

panchayat office and went away by leaving PWs.1 and 2 viz.,

P.Galaiah and P.Raju, at the panchayat office. Therefore, PWs.1
                                                                        RSC, J &amp; MSM,J
                                                                       CrlA_1133_2013


                                       5


and 2 are not eye-witnesses to the incident or occurrence, but they

spoke about the panchayat held at the panchayat office for settling

the dispute with regard to the illicit intimacy of the appellant-

accused with the deceased-Mogulamma.

       The circumstances, on which the prosecution relied upon,

are the seizure of MO.4-axe from the heap of sticks under the cover

of seizure panchanama (Ex.P10) and the motive to commit the

offence and abscondence of the appellant-accused after the

omission of offence.        Based on the circumstantial evidence, the

trial Court believed the prosecution case and observed that

B.Niranjan (PW.8) is also not an eye-witness to the occurrence.

Even according to Ex.P-8, the 161 <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Cr.P.C</a>. statement of PW.8, it is

difficult   to   conclude    that   the         appellant-accused    killed    the

deceased-Mogulamma, merely PWs.1, 2, 4 and 6 and others came

to know about it. Thus, the trial Court expressed a serious doubt

about the commission of offence by the appellant-accused and if

the evidence of PWs.1, 2, 4 and 6 is excluded from consideration,

there is absolutely no evidence on record to connect the appellant-

accused with the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">Section 302</a> of IPC.

       The present Criminal Appeal is filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_16">Section 374</a>

Cr.P.C, which conferred a substantive right of appeal on the

accused who is convicted by the Trial Court and this Court while

exercising power under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_17">Section 374(2)</a> Cr.P.C is bound to

re-appreciate     entire    evidence       to    come   to   an     independent

conclusion, uninfluenced by the findings recorded by the Court

below and decide the legality of conviction and sentence passed by
                                                                            RSC, J &amp; MSM,J

the Sessions Court. Therefore, it is the duty of this Court to

re-appreciate entire evidence recorded by the Court below after

giving an opportunity to both the parties, i.e accused and the

respondent, unless the Court finds manifest perversity in the</pre>

<p id="p_1">calendar and judgment or such findings were recorded without

evidence, normally, this Court cannot interfere with such fact

findings in appeal, while exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_18">Section

374(2)</a> Cr.P.C.           It is the sacrosanct duty of the appellate court,

while sitting in appeal against the judgment of the trial Judge, to

be satisfied that the guilt of the accused has been established

beyond all reasonable doubt after proper re-assessment, re-

appreciation            and   re-scrutiny       of   the   material   on     record.

Appreciation of evidence and proper re-assessment to arrive at the

conclusion is imperative in a criminal appeal. That is the quality of

exercise which is expected of the appellate court to be undertaken

and when that is not done, the cause of justice is not sub-served,

for neither an innocent person should be sent to prison without his

fault nor a guilty person should be let off despite evidence on

record to assure his guilt (vide <a href="/doc/60940407/" id="a_19">Kamlesh Prabhudas Tanna &amp; Anr

v. State Of Gujarat1</a>). Keeping the scope of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 374(2)</a> Cr.P.C

we would like to re-appreciate entire evidence on record to come to

an independent conclusion, uninfluenced by the findings recorded

by the Court below.

that, in a case of murder when the prosecution relying on

which are incompatible with innocence of the accused to draw

inference of guilt and such evidence should be tested by touch-

          Similarly, in <a href="/doc/1964010/" id="a_24">G.Parshwanath v. State of Karnataka4</a>, the

Supreme Court is of the view, when the case of the prosecution is

based on proof of circumstantial evidence on the basis of which

conclusion of guilt is drawn must be established fully, individual

chain of circumstances must be complete pointing out the guilt of

accused, all proved facts must lead to inference of guilt of the

accused alone and court has to draw distinction between primary

and basic facts while appreciating the circumstances and regard

must be had to common course of natural events and human

conduct and finally the facts established               should be consistent

only with hypothesis of guilt of accused and it does not mean that

each and every hypothesis suggested by the accused must be

excluded by proved facts. In Rukia Begum v. State of Karnata

with Issaq Sait and another v. State of Karnataka with

<a href="/doc/107668633/" id="a_25">Nasreen v. State of Karnataka5</a>; <a href="/doc/163090059/" id="a_26">Jagroop Singh v. State of

          circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so
          complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that

          the accused and they should be incapable of explanation on
          any hypothesis other than that of the guilt of the accused
          and inconsistent with his innocence


      In view of the settled principle of law, the prosecution has to

made a sincere attempt to prove each and every circumstance,

pointing out the guilt of the accused that the offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_30">Section 302</a> I.P.C by drawing inference from the proved facts

and circumstances which are consistent only with hypothesis of

innocence.</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">      Coming to the present facts and circumstances of this case,

the circumstances relied on are the motive and absconding of the

appellant-accused.      The consistent case of the prosecution from

the beginning is that the appellant-accused had a motive to kill the

deceased-Mogulamma as she hurled abusive language against him

in the panchayat held at the panchayat office in the presence of

her husband and her son. But, this fact was denied by the defence

in the cross-examination by putting suggestions to the prosecution

witnesses. If really both hurled abusive words against each other,

the question of their jointly leaving the panchayat office after

holding    panchayat      is   highly     improbable     to   the       natural

circumstances, when they are in such a bitter enmity. But, this

improbable circumstance was believed by the trial Court for one

reason or the other reason while expressing a doubt as to the

veracity of evidence of PWs.1 to 3 and in the absence of any other

evidence, the prosecution case cannot be accepted.

          One of the circumstances relied by the prosecution is the

motive. But, motive is not a substantive piece of evidence, it is only

a corroborative piece of evidence to complete the links in the chain

of circumstances, and that itself is not sufficient to connect the

appellant-accused to the grave offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_31">Section

302</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_8">          <a href="/doc/1517737/" id="a_32">In Anil Rai v. State of Bihar9</a>, the Apex Court held that the

admitted position of law is that enmity is a double edged weapon

which can be a motive for the crime as also the ground for false

implication of the accused persons. In case of inimical witnesses,

the Courts are required to scrutinize their testimony with anxious

care to find out whether their testimony inspires confidence to be

acceptable notwithstanding the existence of enmity. Where enmity

is proved to be the motive for the commission of the crime, the

accused cannot urge that despite proof of the motive of the crime,

the witnesses proved to be inimical should not be relied upon.

Bitter animosity held to be a double edged weapon may be

instrumental for false involvement or for the witnesses inferring

and strongly believing that the crime must have been committed by

the accused. Such possibility has to be kept in mind while

evaluating the prosecution witnesses regarding the involvement of

the accused in the commission of the crime. Testimony of eye-

witnesses, which is otherwise convincing and consistent, cannot be

discarded simply on the ground that the deceased were related to

the eye-witnesses or previously there were some disputes between

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 11</span>


the accused and the deceased or the witnesses. The existence of

animosity between the accused and the witnesses may, in some

cases, give rise to the possibility of the witnesses exaggerating the

role of some of the accused or trying to rope in more persons as

accused persons for the commission of the crime. Such a

possibility is required to be ascertained on the facts of each case.

However, the mere existence of enmity in this case, particularly

when it is alleged as a motive for the commission of the crime

cannot be made a basis to discard or reject the testimony of the

eye-witnesses, the deposition of whom is otherwise consistent and

convincing.

<p id="p_9">      In the present circumstances of the case, it is abundantly

clear that there was bitter enmity between PWs.1, 2 and the

accused as the deceased-Mogulamma, wife of PW.1, was eloped

with the appellant-accused and they lived for some time as wife

and husband and thereafter, the panchayat was held. Normally,

there was a possibility of enmity between the husband of the

eloped wife and the paramour, the appellant-accused. Therefore,

PWs.1 and 2 are totally inimical witnesses to the appellant-

accused and their evidence cannot be believed and that too, they

are not direct witnesses to the incident.    In their evidence, they

clearly stated that they did not witness who killed the mother of

PW.2 and wife of PW.1. Therefore, their testimony is not helpful to

the prosecution and connect the appellant-accused with the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_33">Section 302</a> of IPC, because the enmity

may be a ground to commit such an offence or to implicate the
                                                             RSC, J &amp; MSM,J

appellant-accused in such a grave crime. If really deceased and

accused were so inimical, the question of their leaving the

panchayat office together does not arise and that itself is

improbable to the natural conduct of human beings.        Therefore,

the motive was not established by the prosecution before the trial

Court, but still while expressing a doubt as to evidence available

on record to conclude that the appellant-accused committed such

grave offence of murder, the trial Court accepted the motive

erroneously.    In view of our discussion, the motive is not

established by the prosecution by producing cogent and convincing

evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      The other circumstance, relied upon by the prosecution, is

recovery of MO.4-Axe, with which, the appellant-accused allegedly

axed the deceased-Mogulamma to death by causing injuries on her

body. The basis for recovery is the statement of Mr.S.Prabhakar

(PW.10), who is a panchayatdar to the recovery, and in whose

presence, the appellant-accused made a confession leading to the

recovery, while in custody of the police.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      According to the evidence of Mr.S.Prabhakar (PW.10), one of

the mediator, in his presence, the accused confessed before the

police that he concealed the MO.4-axe in a heap of sticks and

promised to show the weapon used in the commission offence, if

the police accompanied the accused and accordingly, the accused

led the police and the mediators to the place where MO.4-axe was

concealed i.e. in a heap of sticks and this confession leading to

discovery is marked as Ex.P-10.        The recovery was after a long
                                                                       RSC, J &amp; MSM,J

time, since the appellant-accused was absconding. Therefore, the

recovery of MO.4-axe, after lapse of more than four days from open

place accessible to public in general, cannot be accepted.

discovered' in the second is restricted to a physical or material fact

which can be perceived by the senses, and that it does not include

a mental fact, now it is fairly settled that the expression 'fact

discovered' includes not only the physical object produced, but

also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the

accused as to this, as noted in Pulukuri Kotayya's case.                       The

various requirements of the section can be summed up as follows:-

substantive piece of evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_18">          Even otherwise, in Brijesh Mavi Vs. State of NCT of

Delhi13, the Apex Court, held that recovery evidence, when not

sufficient to prove culpability of accused and no direct evidence

connecting accused to murder. Recovery of weapon of offence at

the instance of accused two years after incident is not believable.

Mere recovery of weapon, therefore, not sufficient to convict the

accused for the offence of murder under Section 302 of I.P.C.

</p><p id="p_19">          In view of the law declared by the Apex Court in the

judgments referred supra, the confession leading to discovery

alone is relevant piece of evidence, but it is not a substantive

evidence.        However, recovery of incriminating material on the

confession leading to discovery after lapse of three days from open

place accessible to public cannot be relied upon to rope the

appellant-accused with a grave offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_42">Section

302</a> of IPC.           Therefore, based on such confession leading to

discovery and recovery of MO.4-axe under the cover of Ex.P10-

confession and seizure panchanama cannot be accepted as a

substantive piece of evidence.        But, the trial Court believed it

basing on the recovery evidence without considering the gap of

time between the alleged commission of offence and the recovery of

MO.4-axe from open place accessible to public in general, under

Ex.P-10. The conclusions arrived by the trial Court are contrary to

the principles laid down in the judgments referred supra.

Therefore, the findings of the trial Court as to recovery of MO.4-axe

allegedly recovered basing on the confession from open place

accessible to public in general after three days and planting MO.4-

axe cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      The other circumstance, relied upon by the prosecution, is

abscondence. Abscondence may be one of the circumstance, but

that itself is not a ground to connect the appellant-accused and

when there were disputes between the two families with regards

developing illicit intimacy by the appellant-accused with the

deceased-Mogulamma and living together for some time as

husband and wife, and in the panchayat, the appellant-accused

was admonished by the elders. Therefore, it is difficult to hold that

there is a possibility of the appellant-accused absconding, on

account of panchayat held at the panchayat office just before the

alleged commission of offence.        Therefore, it is not a strong

circumstance to connect the appellant-accused with grave offence.

</p><p id="p_21">      The other circumstance relied on by the prosecution, if

proved, would not serve any purpose for the reason that the

prosecution failed to establish the main circumstances, which we

discussed in the earlier paragraphs. Since the prosecution failed

to establish all the links in the chain of circumstances, it is

difficult to hold that the appellant-accused is guilty for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_43">Section 302</a> of IPC and apart from that the trial

Court made a clear observation, in para 20 of its judgment, that

the Court cannot conclusively hold that the accused killed the

deceased-Mogulamma merely because of enmity.          When the trial
                                                                    RSC, J &amp; MSM,J

Court itself expressed its doubt as to the commission of offence by

the    appellant-accused,     finding    the    appellant-accused      guilty

without extending the benefit of doubt is a grave illegality and that

too, when the PWs.3 to 6, who are claiming to be the direct

witnesses to the incident, did not support the case of the

prosecution and turned hostile and nothing could be elicited in

their cross-examination by the prosecution, therefore, their

statements cannot be looked into for any purpose.                   If their

statements are not considered, the other evidence is only hear-say

and the circumstantial evidence. When the prosecution based its

case    on   circumstantial    evidence,       it   must   prove   all     the

circumstances linking one and another to complete the chain of

circumstances, unerringly pointing the guilt of the accused,

without any reasonable hypothesis and the circumstances proved

must consistent with the guild of the accused. But, here, in the

present facts of the case, as discussed above, the prosecution

failed to prove the motive for the commission of offence and also

failed to establish recovery of MO.4-axe under Ex.P10-confession

and seizure panchanama, in view of the gap between the alleged

commission of offence and recovery and that too, from an open

place, which is accessible to the public. In such circumstances,

and in view of the reasons discussed supra, it is difficult to sustain

conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant-accused

under the impugned calendar and judgment of the trial Court and

the same is liable to be set aside, finding the appellant-accused not

guilty for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_44">Section 302</a> of IPC holding that the
                                                                   RSC, J &amp; MSM,J

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                    18</span>


prosecution    failed   to   establish   the   links   in   the   chain      of

circumstances and thereby, the appellant-accused is entitled for

acquittal extending benefit of doubt.      Accordingly, both the points

are answered in favour of appellant-accused and against the

prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      In the result, the Criminal Appeal is allowed and the

sentence and conviction imposed against the appellant-accused-
