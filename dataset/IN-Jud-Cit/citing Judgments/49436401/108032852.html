<p id="p_18"> 11.     It is argued by the plaintiff that shots marked as "A" &amp; "B" give an
impression to the common public at large that the Plaintiff's said GM
electrical switches are of extremely inferior quality. The impugned
advertisement disparages the plaintiff's said product by showing the
plaintiff's said GM switches in bad light.
</p><p id="p_19">        The details of the defendant's impugned HAVELLS SHOCK LAGA
advertisement have been given as here in below:
</p><p id="p_20">(a) The impugned HAVELLS SHOCK LAGA advertisement begins with
      one security and safety check measure regarding Peace Summit, India,
      wherein one person is enquiring about the safety and security measure
      at the mentioned place.
</p><p id="p_21">(b) The next frame of the impugned advertisement the person is shown the
      magnetic fields, fish eye camera and the bullet proof machchardani.
</p><p id="p_22">(c) In the next frame of the impugned advertisement, the person wishes to
      use the washroom.
</p><p id="p_23">(d) The advertisement further depicts that when the person went to
      washroom and try to switch on the bathroom lights by touching the
      switch, he gets electric shock.
</p><p id="p_24">(e) The next frame of the advertisement person's face reflects the shock
      and in the background the sound is being displayed "Shock Laga,
      Shock Laga".
</p><p id="p_25">(f)   The electric switches under the Trade Mark GM are being displayed in
      the impugned advertisement from which the person allegedly got the

       is not used that's why the Shock was caused. The said wording is being
      displayed in Hindi language, the said has been given as herein below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "Sab Kuch Lagaya Lekin Havells RCC &amp; MCBB Nahi
             Lagaya Isliye Shock Laga"

             MCB is not used, that's why the shock is being caused to
             the mentioned person).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">12.     It is also submitted that the impugned advertisement is nothing but is
a clandestine attempt by the Defendant to increase the market share by
disparaging the tremendous goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff's said
Switches under the Plaintiff's said Trade Mark/Design GM. All the indicia
described in the impugned advertisement as well as the surrounding
circumstances shown therein points towards the singular fact without
leaving any room for doubt towards the defendant's impugned malafide
intention.
</p><p id="p_28">13.     The impugned advertisement is viewed/broadcasted on various
television serials which are also viewed by many people at large in India and
outside India also. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the impugned
advertisement far outreaches the limit of allowed competitive advertisement
and blatantly disparages the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff's said
product namely switches under the said Trade Mark/Design GM. The
impugned HAVELLS SHOCK LAGA advertisement not only shows that
the defendant's impugned product is good but also very clear the electric
switch of the plaintiff under the said Trade Mark/Design GM of the plaintiff
is inferior. The impugned advertisement amounts to disparaging and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">I.A. No.10946/2014 in CS(OS) No.1720/2014                          Page 10 of 19</span>
 defaming the product of a competitor i.e. plaintiff by the defendant or
promoting its own products.
</p><p id="p_29">14.     Mr.Amit Sibal, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
plaintiff submits that the defendant is not denying that the switch shown in
the advertisement is of the plaintiff whose trade mark GM is also shown in a
blurred condition. There is no justification on behalf of the defendant to
show the plaintiff's product in bad faith when admittedly the defendant itself
is manufacturing the electric switches. The defendant ought to have been
shown its own switch if the defendant is making any impression being given
that "Sab Kuch Lagaya Lekin Havells RCC &amp; MCBB Nahi Lagaya Isliye
Shock Laga". He argues that it is a clear case of product disparagement and
it is deliberately done by the defendant in order to disparage the product of
the plaintiff and to promote its product otherwise there is no justification
why the defendant is doing this and what is the fault of the plaintiff and why
they should suffer at the hand of the defendant who is the competitor of the
plaintiff and why they have not used the switches in the advertisement or
any other product which is not the product of the plaintiff and its trade mark.
It is argued that it is a clear case of malafide where the thing speaks for
itself. It is argued that in case, the interim orders are not passed, the plaintiff
would suffer an irreparable loss and injury as the plaintiff has already
received various complaints from their dealers and distributors about the
said advertisement.
</p><p id="p_30">15.     Mrs.Prathiba M. Singh, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of
the defendant, on the other hand, has argued that no case of grant of interim
order is made out. There is no disparagement of the plaintiff's product. The
trade mark of the plaintiff GM is not feasible if the advertisement is seen.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">I.A. No.10946/2014 in CS(OS) No.1720/2014                              Page 11 of 19</span>
<p id="p_31"> No one can read mark GM from the said advertisement. The defendant is
only promoting its product HAVELLS' RCCB and MCB.                  The main
purpose of advertisement is that if MCB is not used, it may cause electric
shock, thus it was imperative to show the electric switch in the
advertisement.
</p><p id="p_32">16.     It is also argued that in the impugned advertisement, no untrue,
falsehood or malicious statement is made. It is the case of trade label. The
plaintiff has failed to make out any case that the statement made in the
advertisement is untrue or thus have suffered any damages by such an action
of the defendant. Their claim is unsubstantiated. They should not be hyper-
sensitive. It is wrong perception of the plaintiff. She referred the following
three decisions of this Court in support of her submissions:-

</blockquote><p id="p_33">17.     While arguing the case, she has not specifically denied that the
product shown in the advertisement is not of the plaintiff, except it was
submitted that many manufacturing of using switches with the similar
design. The following principles have been discussed and approved by
many Courts while dealing with the cases of disparagement from time to

<p id="p_34">18.     In the very recent judgment delivered by the Division Bench of this
Court on 31st January, 2014 in the case of <a href="/doc/64885934/" id="a_4">Hindustan Unilever Limited vs.
Reckitt Benckiser India Limited</a>, reported in 2014(57) PTC 495 (Del) (DB),
the learned Division Bench has confirmed the judgment and decree of
learned Single Bench rendered by my esteemed brother Shri Badar Durrez
Ahmed, J. who after trial has decreed the suit as well as granted damages to
the tune of Rs.5 lacs. The Division Bench after upholding the decision of
the Single Bench not only dismissed the appeal filed by the defendant but
also enhanced the damages to Rs.20 lacs and quantified the cost at
Rs.55,000/-.        The relevant facts and discussion of the judgment of the
learned Single Judge are reproduced as below:-

                 misgiving that the bar of soap which has been shown in
                the said advertisement is of a colour similar to that of the
                plaintiff's DETTOL soap. The contours, curvature as well
                as the overall shape of the orange bar of soap in the
                advertisement itself, are virtually the same as that of the
                contours, curvature and overall shape of the plaintiff's
                DETTOL Original soap. Moreover, the clear impression
                given in the advertisement is that the said orange bar of
                soap has been taken out from a green wrapper/
                packaging. It must also be noted that the design of the
                plaintiff's soap has been registered by the plaintiff as
                indicated by Ext.PW1/DX-1. While it is true that there
                may be other orange coloured soaps and other soaps sold
                in the pre-dominantly green packaging and other soaps
                which have an oval shape, it is also true that it is only the
                plaintiff's soap which has a combination of all the three
                elements, i.e., orange colour, curved oval shape and pre-
                dominantly green packaging. Apart from this, it is only
                the plaintiff's soap which has contours in the manner
                indicated in the bar of soap in the said advertisement. No
                evidence has been produced by the defendant to show
                that there is any ordinary antiseptic soap with the same
                combination of the aforesaid elements of colour, shape,
                design and packaging. I have absolutely no doubt that the
                orange bar of soap shown in the advertisement refers to
                the plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                24. It has been contended on behalf of the defendant
                that the plaintiff has not produced any evidence of
                consumers to indicate that the orange bar of soap in the
                said advertisement appears to be the plaintiff's DETTOL
                Original soap. In response the learned counsel for the
                plaintiff submitted that producing such evidence would
                be counter-productive and is not necessary. He submitted
                that the plaintiff could produce witnesses stating that the
                orange bar of soap shown in the advertisement had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">I.A. No.10946/2014 in CS(OS) No.1720/2014                              Page 14 of 19</span>
                 reference to the plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap.
                Similarly, the defendant could also produce witnesses to
                state the contrary. Ultimately, it would be for the court to
                make a judgment from the perspective of an average
                person with imperfect recollection, a test which has been
                well established, particularly in passing off cases.
                Though slander of goods and disparaging advertisements
                stand on a slightly different footing to passing off cases, I
                find myself to be in agreement with the submissions
                made by the learned counsel for the plaintiff. For,
                ultimately, it is a question of perception and the
                perception has to be determined from the stand point of
                an average person man with imperfect recollection but,
                with a corollary, which shall stated be shortly. One could
                normally expect that there would be a difference in
                perception between two distinct classes of persons -- (1)
                Persons who are using DETTOL Original soap and (2)
                persons who do not use that soap. A person belonging to
                the latter category may not be aware of the orange
                coloured bar of soap of the plaintiff with its distinctive
                shape, curvature and contours. He may also not be aware
                of the packaging employed by the plaintiff. Therefore,
                such a person may not link the bar of soap shown in the
                advertisement with the plaintiff's product when he sees
                the advertisement or when he comes upon the plaintiff's
                product in a shop. Such a person, in all likelihood, would
                perceive the orange bar of soap shown in the
                advertisement as being some unbranded bar of soap. On
                the other hand, a person belonging to the former
                category, being a user of the plaintiff's DETTOL Original
                soap, would immediately recognise the bar of soap
                shown in the advertisement as referring to the plaintiff's
                DETTOL Original soap. This is because, such a person is
                familiar with the plaintiff's product. He is "intimately"
                aware of the look and feel of the soap because he uses it
                everyday. He knows its colour, shape, size and contours.
                The moment, he sees the bar of soap in the
                advertisement, he would immediately correlate the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">I.A. No.10946/2014 in CS(OS) No.1720/2014                              Page 15 of 19</span>
                 colour, shape, size and contours including the colour of
                the wrapper/packaging with that of the soap that he uses
                everyday, that is, the plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap.
                Moreover, it is not as a matter of co-incidence that all
                these features of colour, shape, curvature and colour of
                the packaging have come together. It has been done
                deliberately so that it is obvious to users of the plaintiff's
                DETTOL Original soap that it is the very soap that they
                use everyday which is shown in the advertisement.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                26. The difference in approach in a passing off action
                and one for disparagement must also be highlighted. In a
                case of passing off, the question invariably is whether the
                trade mark or trade dress employed by A for his product
                is so deceptively similar to the established mark or trade
                dress of B's product that A's product could be confused
                by or passed off to consumers as B's product? Here the
                comparison is of rival products having a similar trade
                mark, get-up or trade dress. Familiarity with the
                established mark, trade dress or get-up is presumed.
                Because, it is this familiarity that the person intending to
                pass off his goods as those of the famous or more
                popular, exploits. In the case of disparagement, the one
                who disparages another's product, does not seek to make
                his product similar to the disparaged product, but to
                distinguish it from the disparaged product. The object of
                disparagement is to make the disparaged product appear
                to be as near or similar to the competitor's product. The
                comparisons, therefore, in cases of passing off and in
                cases of disparagement are different. Consequently, the
                comparison must be from the perspective of an average
                person with imperfect recollection but, that person must
                be picked from the category of users of the product
                allegedly sought to be disparaged or slandered.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                 36. The advertisement can be viewed in two parts. One
                part is where the orange coloured soap is shown as being
                harmful and used by people who are naïve and without
                any wisdom and who could be saved only through
                prayers. The other part is where the defendant's product
                is shown as having the qualities of providing a protective
                wall against dry cracked skin and as an eliminator of
                germs. There can be no grievance in respect of the
                second part of the advertisement, where the qualities of
                the defendant's soap are sought to be demonstrated:
                whether those qualities exist or not is not an issue. That
                part, even if untrue, would be mere puffery. However, the
                first part of the advertisement, where the orange bar of
                soap has been slighted and shown in bad light and in fact,
                as something which is harmful, cannot but be construed
                as disparagement and denigration of the orange bar of
                soap shown in the advertisement. It is one thing to say
                that a person's product is the best or that his product is
                better than somebody else's product, but, it is entirely a
                different matter to say that his product is good whereas
                another's product is bad and harmful. Puffing up of one's
                product is permissible in law but slighting or rubbishing
                or otherwise denigrating or disparaging another's product
                is not. From the standpoint of a reasonable person, the
                advertisement, in question, certainly disparages and
                denigrates the orange bar of soap shown therein which I
                have held, under Issue No.1, to refer to the plaintiff's
                DETTOL Original soap.

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">                66. Since the findings returned by me are that the said
                disparaging advertisement was a deliberate act on the
                part of the defendant aimed at reducing the sales of the
                plaintiff's product and thereby increasing its own sale,
                through the device of slander of goods/disparaging and/or
                denigrating advertising, the plaintiff would be entitled to
                punitive damages in the same manner as was awarded in
                Time Incorporated (supra). Cases of slander of goods,
                malicious falsehood and disparaging advertising have to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">I.A. No.10946/2014 in CS(OS) No.1720/2014                             Page 17 of 19</span>
                 be decided on the crucible of fairness. There is no
                impediment to a trader employing any means possible,
                provided such means are fair, to increase his sales, even
                at the cost of its competitors. But the law does not permit
                any person to use unfair means or practices to gain and
                profit to the detriment of his competitors. Such unfair
                means or practices include disparaging advertisements/
                slander of goods. In the fiercely competitive world that
                we live in, businesses compete with each other on
                various fronts including quality of goods. The differences
                in quality of the goods are sought to be made known to
                the public through advertising. While providing such
                information, the law permits a businessman to puff up his
                product and show it in a better light than that of his
                competitors. However, as we have seen above, the law
                does not permit a manufacturer or a trader to advertise in
                such a manner that it slanders the products of its
                competitors, virtually rubbishing the same, while
                promoting his own product. As the competition gets
                fierce, price differences get reduced and businesses tend
                to play for a larger market share by employing practices
                such as slandering of goods/disparaging advertising
                which are unfair business practices and ought to be
                curbed. Since the question is of fairness versus
                unfairness, when this Court has found that the defendant
                has been deliberately unfair in its said advertising
                campaign, it is reason enough for this Court to impose
                punitive damages so as to discourage such a sharp
                practice and to put to an end to this growing tendency.
                Consequently, I am of the view that the plaintiff is
                entitled to punitive damages from the defendant, which I
                quantify as Rs.5,00,000/-."

 clear to the Court that if the intent of the defendant is to damage the product
itself of the other party and it is intended to gain its business by promoting
its product, then a classic case of injunction is also made out. From the facts
of the present case, I am of the considered view that prima facie the
impugned advertisement of the defendant falls within the principle
mentioned in para 18 of my judgment. Therefore, the plaintiff has made out
a prima facie case for the grant of an ad-interim injunction. In case, the
interim order is not passed, the plaintiff will suffer an irreparable loss and
injury. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff and
against the defendant.           Till the next date of hearing, the defendant is
restrained from telecasting, displaying, showing, broadcasting the impugned
advertisement, in any media whatsoever including electronic media.
However, it is made clear that in case, the defendant shall delete/erase the
shot "A" and the contents of shot "B" from the said advertisement, then they
are entitled to continue with the impugned advertisement.
