<p id="p_1">     The sole accused in S.C.No.353/2004 on the files of

away the defacto complainant, stabbed him with a knife,

on the left side of his abdomen and thereby caused

grievous injury and consequential removal of his kidney.

On the above facts, crime No.171/2002 was registered by

Kaliyar Police   and the matter was investigated. Finally,

charge alleging commission of offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_2">Section 307</a>

of IPC by the accused was laid before the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-II, Thodupuzha. The jurisdictional

Magistrate committed the case to the court of Sessions,

Thodupuzha and in turn, the case was made over to the

Additional Sessions Court, Thodupuzha for trial and

disposal.

and proceeded with trial.

of the prosecution.

was questioned under <a href="/doc/886494/" id="a_4">Section 313(1)(b)</a> of Cr.P.C and the

accused denied the incriminating circumstances found in

the evidence against him and he filed a written statement

to the effect that the accused was not present at the spot

of occurrence at the time of occurrence.

sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period

year also was imposed with direction to pay the same as

compensation to the injured/PW1.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     9.   The learned counsel for the accused argued that

the learned Sessions Judge relied on feeble evidence to

convict and sentence the accused in this matter, where

the prosecution miserably failed to prove commission of

offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_6">Section 307</a> of IPC by the accused beyond

the reasonable doubt. He had given emphasis to the

deposition of PW1, whereby PW1 deposed during cross-

examination that he had disclosed the name of the

assailant before the doctor with submission that the said

portion of evidence is a contradiction, since PW1 not given

any such statement before the defence. Apart from that,

the learned counsel placed plea of alibi relying on the

evidence of DW1 and DW2 and Ext.D1 positing that the

accused was not present at the time of occurrence in the

place of occurrence.

</p><p id="p_13">       10. Dispelling this argument, the learned Public

Prosecutor vehemently supported                the conviction and

sentence imposed by the trial court, pointing out the fact

that    PW1,    the   injured/defacto    complainant        and    two

independent witnesses, viz., PW2 and PW6 supported the

occurrence in a convincing manner though PW7, another

occurrence witness, did not support the prosecution fully.

The learned Public Prosecutor also highlighted medical

evidence in this case in support of the conviction and

sentence. Accordingly, it is submitted that the conviction

and sentence do not require any interference.

</p><p id="p_14">       11. In this case, the prosecution allegation is that the

accused caused stab injury on the left side of the abdomen of

PW1 on 16.12.2002 at Vellamohira in Kodikulam - Vellamchira

road at 7.30 p.m., by using a knife with intention to do away

him. PW1 is the defacto complainant and the injured. PW1

deposed        that   the   occurrence   was    at   7.30   p.m.    on
 CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>



16.12.2002 at Millumpady bagam in Kodikulam. His

evidence further is that while he was talking with his wife

by sitting on the veranda of the house, the accused came

there holding a knife. Then he rushed towards PW1 for

stabbing him. PW1 ran to the house of Jolly (PW7) for the

purpose of telephoning the Panchayat Vice President to

inform the stab attempt. But he did not get the Panchayat

Vice President on line. When PW1 came to the road from

the house of PW7, the accused came in front of him and

stabbed on the left side of his abdomen with the knife he

held. Thereby PW1 sustained injury and he was taken to

Holly Family Hospital, Muthalakkodam in an auto-rickshaw

and then to Co-operative Hospital, Thodupuzha and then

to Medical College Hospital, Kolencherry.   A surgery was

conducted and one of his kidneys was removed. He

admitted that he had given Ext.P1 FI statement. The

evidence of PW1 further is that PW1 and the accused are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>



rubber   tappers   and   the   accused   stabbed   him   with

intention to kill him, on the belief that it was PW1, who

had told others that the accused had stolen latex.       PW1

identified MO1 as the knife used by the accused to stab

him. Similarly, he identified MO2 - shirt and MO3 - lungi

worn by him at the time of occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     12. During cross-examination, as pointed out by the

learned counsel for the accused, PW1 given evidence that

he told the name of the assailant to the doctor, who

treated him. But it was suggested that no such statement

was given, without reference to the relevant previous

statement in this regard. Therefore, the attempt to

contradict the witness in the matter of this omission is not

succeeded since the previous statement regarding the

same was not referred to the witness. That apart, when

the doctor was examined as PW8, no question asked to

him to prove the contradiction otherwise. Therefore, the
 CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    9</span>



attempt to contradict PW1 regarding the said omission, in

fact, failed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     13. Although          during       chief   examination,     PW1&#x27;s

evidence was that he ran to the house of Jolly, during

cross examination, it was stated that he ran towards the

house of Tandel Omana, since the said house was closed,

he ran towards the house of Jolly (PW7), which is adjacent

to his house. In fact, this aspect is of no much

significance.         Thus it appears that nothing extracted

during examination by PW1 to disbelieve him in any

manner and PW1 withstood the cross-examination by

supporting the prosecution case without any ambiguity.

</p><p id="p_17">     14. PW2, PW6 and PW7 are the other occurrence

witnesses examined by the prosecution. Among them,

PW6 is the wife of PW1. PW6 corroborated the evidence

of PW1 without any ambiguity and nothing extracted to

disbelieve      the    version   of      PW6     also   during   cross

examination.    That       apart,    PW2,      another   occurrence

witness, also deposed fully in support of the prosecution.

PW2 deposed that when PW2 and her husband - Raju

were at Millumpady bus stop for picking the bus towards

Kaliyar at 7:40 pm, in front of the house of PW1, and

when PW2 and her husband were talking with PW1, at the

bus stop, the accused came there shouting that he would

not spare PW1 and attempted to stab PW1 and PW1 ran

away. PW1 ran towards the house of Jolly (PW7) and the

accused chased him with a knife and the wife of the

accused was also followed the accused with intention to

dissuade the accused from stabbing PW1. But the accused

stabbed on the left side of the abdomen of PW1 with the

knife he held. Later, PW2 and her husband boarded the

bus towards Kaliyar.          During cross examination, the

defence counsel failed to shake the version of PW2 also.

accused stabbing PW1 with a knife. But he admitted that

PW1 had reached his house while he was offering prayers,

to telephone the Panchayat Vice President and PW7

allowed to make the call. But having failed to connect to

the Panchayat Vice President, he went out of the house.

Then PW7 continued his prayers and he then heard sound

from outside and later he saw PW1 was lying injured. In

this matter, though PW7 turned hostile to the prosecution

in so far as the overt-act of stabbing alleged to be done by

the accused, he supported the prosecution case prior to

the occurrence of stabbing and the subsequent event in

tune with the versions of PW1, PW2 and PW6.

</p><p id="p_19">     16. As far as the injury sustained to PW1 as a result

of stabbing is concerned, PW8 and PW9 given evidence

supporting Ext.P5 wound certificate and Ext.P6 discharge

summary. PW8 given evidence that while he was working

as Casualty Medical Officer, Medical College Hospital,

Kolencherry, at about 9.55 pm, on 16.12.2002, he had

examined PW1 and noted a penetrating injury on the

lower part of left hypochondrial region 3cm x 2cm. PW8

had given evidence further that the said injury could be

caused by stabbing with MO1. He also deposed that the

injury was serious and the same in its nature could be

sufficient to cause death. Supporting the evidence of PW9,

the   Urologist    attached     to    Medical   College    Hospital,

Kolencherry deposed that PW8 referred PW1 before him.

He was subjected to ultra sound scan and CT scan

examinations and the same revealed a tear in the mid

portion of left kidney with blood round the kidney and

peritoneum. His shock was connected with the blood

transfusion.      Explorative    laprotomy      was       performed

immediately. There was about 4 litres of blood in the

abdomen and profused oozing of blood from the lacerated

left kidney.   Though initially, it was attempted to repair

the injury on the kidney, since the patient was found to

going to shock again, his left kidney had to be removed

and accordingly, left kidney was removed. He was

discharged on 08.01.2003.     Thus, it appears that   apart

from the oral version of PW1, PW2 and PW6, the Doctors

also corroborated the stab injury caused on PW1 and

which led to removal of left kidney of PW1. PW12 and

PW13 are the investigating officers.   In this case PW12,

who recorded FIS and registered the FIR, supported the

prosecution case in that regard.
</p>
<p id="p_20">     17. Apart from that, it was PW12, who arrested the

accused and recovered MO1 knife at the instance of the

accused under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_7">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act acting on

the disclosure statement given by the accused, regarding

authorship of concealment of       MO1 weapon as stated

before PW12 while he was in police custody. PW12 given

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                             14</span>



evidence that he had arrested the accused on 20.12.2002

and Ext.P9 is the arrest memo. While the accused was in

police custody, he had given disclosure statement that the

knife was concealed beneath a plantain tree nearby the

property of his house and he could show it, if he was

brought to the said place.   Accordingly, PW12 reached the

property as led by the accused, at the place of occurrence

and MO1 was recovered by the accused.        According to

PW12, Ext.P3 is the mahazar prepared at the time of

recovery of MO1.     It is interesting to note that PW4,

examined by the prosecution to prove Ext.P3 mahazar,

fully supported the recovery as well as Ext.P3 Mahazar

after admitting his signature therein as a witness. Though

PW4 was cross-examined, nothing extracted to disbelieve

the recovery in any manner and the cross-examination is

confined generally on other aspects with a suggestion that

PW4 was brought into to support the false case of the
 CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                              15</span>



prosecution by giving false evidence. PW13, in fact,

verified the investigation as on 01.03.2003 and filed the

final report before the jurisdictional magistrate court. Thus

the recovery of MO1 as per the disclosure statement as

per Ext.P11 is proved without any iota of doubt through

the evidence of PW12 and PW4 and as per Ext.P3

mahazar.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     18. It is argued by the learned counsel for the

appellant that there was delay in recovering MO2 and

MO3, shirt and lungi respectively, worn by the injured at

the time of accident. PW13, who verified the investigation

before filing charge, given evidence that the delay was

occasioned since the injured was at the hospital in

consequence    of   serious   injuries   sustained   in   this

occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     19. It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the

appellant that the prosecution witness No.17 (CW17), who
 CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               16</span>



conducted a part of the investigation, was not examined

by   the   prosecution   and   the   same   is   fatal   to   the

prosecution. While addressing this argument, I have

perused the evidence of PW12. It is noticed that vital part

of the investigation is the volition of PW12, though CW17

prepared the scene mahazar marked as Ext.P2 and

recorded the statements of witness Nos.2 to 8 as deposed

by PW12. The prosecution marked Ext.P2 scene mahazar,

MO2 shirt and MO3 lungi through PW12 in the absence of

CW17.      It is true that CW17 was not examined by the

prosecution as his presence could not be secured since he

was abroad. This fact was deposed by PW12.

</p><p id="p_23">     20. Thus a question arises for consideration is as to

whether non-examination of CW17, who conducted part of

the investigation is a reason to disbelieve the prosecution

case in toto and to acquit the accused for the said reason

alone. It is true that the prosecution is duty bound to
 CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 17</span>



examine    all     material     witnesses,        particularly,   the

investigating officer to prove the prosecution case. But

such examination is possible in relation to witnesses

whose presence could be secured by the means known to

law. If a crucial witness or the investigating officer dies or

their presence could not be secured for valid reasons,

non-examination of crucial witnesses or the investigating

officer by itself is not a ground to disbelieve the

prosecution      case   in   toto,    if   the   evidence   adduced

otherwise emphatically established the prosecution case.

That apart, in this case, CW17 prepared the scene

mahazar as Ext.P2 and for which no serious challenge

raised by the accused.          Similarly, CW17 recorded the

previous statements of witness Nos.2 to 8.               In fact, no

material contradiction extracted during cross-examination

of the witnesses so as to get the contradiction proved by

the evidence of CW17. It is relevant to note that Ext.P1

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                 18</span>



FIS was recorded by PW12 and Ext.P8 FIR was registered

by him.        The arrest of the accused, recording of his

disclosure statement and recovery of MO1 knife were at

the instance of PW12 and thus it appears that the major

part of the investigation in this case is that of PW12 and in

such a case, non-examination of CW17, the investigating

officer, cannot be the sole ground for acquittal of the

accused. Therefore, this argument cannot be appreciated.

</p><p id="p_24">       21. Therefore, non-examination of CW17 is not a

reason to disbelieve the entire case put up by the

prosecution in a convincing manner. In this case, after

appreciating the evidence, the learned Sessions Judge

found that the accused committed offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_8">Section

307</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_25">       22. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_9">Section 307</a> provides that whoever does any act

capable of causing death should have been inflicted.          An

penultimate act foreboding death. It is sufficient in law, if

there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in

intended and if the attempt has gone so far that it would

which frustrated its consummation.          There are different

stages in a crime. First, the intention to commit it;

second, the preparation to commit it; third, an attempt to

commit it.     If at the third stage, the attempt fails, the

crime is not complete but the law punishes for attempting

the   same.    An   attempt     to     commit   crime    must    be

death, and hurt is caused, then the provisions of S.307

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">I.P.C</a>. would be applicable.     There is no requirement for

the injury to be on a &quot;vital part&quot; of the body, merely

causing &#x27;hurt&#x27; is sufficient to attract S.307 I.P.C.

</p><p id="p_30">     27. Similarly, in the decision reported in <a href="/doc/115651329/" id="a_20">Jage Ram

v. State of Haryana</a> (2015 (11) SCC 366), the Apex

Court held that, for the purpose of conviction under S.307

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a>, prosecution has to establish (i) the intention to

commit murder and (ii) the act done by the accused. The

burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted

to commit the murder of the prosecution witness. Whether

the accused person intended to commit murder of another

person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of

each case. To justify a conviction under S.307 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22">IPC</a>, it is

not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death

should have been caused. Although the nature of injury

actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a

finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention

may also be adduced from other circumstances. The

intention of the accused is to be gathered from the

circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words

used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of

the accused, parts of the body where the injury was

caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows

given etc.

</p><p id="p_31">     28. In this case, the appellant/accused raised plea

of alibi on the submission that he was not present at the

time of occurrence and the place of occurrence and,

therefore, the entire prosecution story against him as

false.   That apart, he filed a statement after he was

questioned under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_23">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C and in the said

statement, he put up a case that he was a worker of

Kerala Congress (M) and he resigned from the party due

to difference of opinion with witness No.7. Further on the

influence of witness No.7, a theft case was registered

against him and the same ended in acquittal. Further he

stated that on 10.12.2002 at about 5 p.m, there occurred

a scuffle in between the workers of Indian National

Congress and Kerala Congress(M) and PW1 sustained stab

injury in the above scuffle. In fact, no evidence adduced

by the accused in support of the above case put up.

</p><p id="p_32">     29. Now I shall address the plea of alibi attempted

to be established by the evidence of DW1 and DW2 and as

per Ext.D1 by the accused. The Sessions Judge discussed

the said evidence and negatived the plea of alibi as per

the narration in paragraph 26 of the judgment.                 For

clarity, I am inclined to extract the same as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          &quot;26.   In order to prove the alibi raised by the
          accused he examined DWs 1 and 2 DW1 is Vicar,

          that he issued Ex D1 certificate stating that Rosa

         funeral was held on 17.12.07. DW1 stated that
         he does not know the accused in this case. He
         also does not know about the relationship
         between the accused and deceased. Hence the
         evidence of DW1 is not at all helpful to the
         accused. DW2 deposed that he knows the
         accused. When asked whether he knows that the
         father&#x27;s sister of the accused died on 16.12.02.
         he deposed that he knows about it. The son of
         the deceased was a classmate of DW2. DW2
         stated that he had seen the accused in the
         house   of   the   deceased   dusk   in   the   cross
         examination he stated the he does not know the
         name of the father&#x27;s sister of the accused. He
         does not know when and how the father&#x27;s sister
         of the accused died. He does not know as to how
         many brothers and sisters the father of the
         accused have. DW2 studied only up to 4 th
         standard. After that there was no occasions for
         him to meet the son of the deceased. There is a
         distance of 6 kms from his house land the house
         of the deceased. When asked by the court DW2
         stated that only when he was examined before
         court he knew that it was the father&#x27;s sister of
         the accused who died. It was the accused who
         told him that it was his father&#x27;s sister who died.</blockquote><p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">         When DW2 was examined before court he was

          smelling   liquor.   He   admitted   that   he   had
          consumed liquor on that day. He does not even
          know the name of the husband of the deceased.
          He does not know how many children the
          deceased had. The evidence of DW2 would
          clearly show that he is only a hired witness.
          There is nothing to show that Rosa who died on
          16.12.02 was the father&#x27;s sister of the accused.
          Even if it was a father&#x27;s sister of the accused
          who died on 16.12.02, there is nothing to show
          that the accused was present in the house of the
          deceased at 7:30 pm on 16.12.02. Pws1, 2 and
          6 have clearly deposed before court that it was
          the accused who stabbed PW1. The reason for
          the enmity on the part of the accused towards
          PW1 is also stated by PWs 1 and 6. Hence it is
          proved beyond doubt that it was the accused
          himself who stabbed PW1 with MO1 knife. The
          alibi raised by the accused stands not proved.
</p><p id="p_35">     30. On reading paragraph 26 along with deposition

of DW1 and DW2, in the evidence of DW1 there is nothing

to suggest that the appellant/accused was not at the place

of occurrence on the relevant time of occurrence. It is to

be noted further that the contents of Ext.D1, a certificate
 CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                             27</span>



stating that Rosa, W/o. Mathai died on 16.12.2002 also

not proved by extracting the contents of the document

from the mouth of DW1. In fact, nothing in the evidence

of DW1 to prove the plea of alibi.
</p>
<p id="p_36">     31. Coming to the evidence of DW2, as rightly

observed by the learned Sessions Judge, he could be held

as a hired witness for the reason stated in para.26 of the

judgment of the trial court as extracted above. Coming to

his evidence, he deposed that he had seen the accused

on 16.12.2002 at the house of the deceased (the sister of

the father of the accused) at dusk.   DW2 not stated the

exact time he had seen the accused at the above house

though the occurrence in this case is on 16.12.2002 at

7.30 p.m. It is relevant to note that DW2 entered into the

witness box with smell of liquor       and during cross

examination he admitted that he had consumed liquor on

that day. During further cross-examination, DW2 failed to

say even the name of the husband of the deceased. His

evidence further is that the accused told him that his

father&#x27;s sister was died.     Therefore, no credence can be

given to the evidence of DW2 to prove the alibi.               It is

settled law that when plea of alibi is raised, it is the

bounden duty of the accused to prove the same in a

convincing manner and on failure to do so, the plea of alibi

shall be negatived.
</p>
<p id="p_37">     32. In the decision reported in [AIR 1997 SC 322],

<a href="/doc/1460988/" id="a_24">Binay Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar</a>, the Apex Court

while dealing with the plea of alibi held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         &quot;22. The Latin word alibi means &quot;elsewhere&quot; and
    that word is used for convenience when an accused
    takes recourse to a defence line that when the
    occurrence took place he was so far away from the
    place of occurrence that it is extremely improbable that
    he would have participated in the crime. It is basic law
    that in a criminal case, in which the accused is alleged
    to have inflicted physical injury to another person, the
    burden is on the prosecution to prove that the accused
    was present at the scene and has participated in the
 CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                  29</span>



    crime. The burden would not be lessened by the mere
    fact that the accused had adopted the defence of alibi.
    The plea of the accused in such cases need be
    considered only when the burden has been discharged
    by   the   prosecution   satisfactorily.   But   once   the
    prosecution succeeds in discharging the burden it is
    incumbent on the accused, who adopts the plea of alibi,
    to prove it with absolute certainty so as to exclude the
    possibility of his presence at the place of occurrence.
    When the presence of the accused at the scene of
    occurrence has been established satisfactorily by the
    prosecution through reliable evidence, normally the
    Court would be slow to believe any counter-evidence to
    the effect that he was elsewhere when the occurrence
    happened. But if the evidence adduced by the accused
    is of such a quality and of such a standard that the
    Court may entertain some reasonable doubt regarding
    his presence at the scene when the occurrence took
    place, the accused would, no doubt, be entitled to the
    benefit of that reasonable doubt.      For that purpose, it
    would be a sound proposition to be laid down that, in
    such circumstances, the burden on the accused is
    rather heavy. It follows, therefore, that strict proof is
    required for establishing the plea of alibi.     This Court
    has observed so on earlier occasions (vide Dudh Nath
    Pandey v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (1981) 2 SCC 166 :
    (AIR 1981 1 SC 911); State of Maharashtra v.
</blockquote><p id="p_38"> CRL.A NO. 331 OF 2007

    Narisingrao Gangaram Pimple, AIR 1984 SC 63).


In this case, the plea of alibi raised by the appellant

relying on the evidence of DW1 and DW2 is not

established at all, though a heavy burden is cast upon him

to establish the said plea by strict proof.

</p><p id="p_39">     33. On re-appreciation of evidence at par with the

argument advanced by the learned counsel for the

appellant and the learned Public Prosecutor, it has to be

held that the available evidence would suggest that the

accused reached the house of PW1 by holding a knife and

he attempted to stab PW1 uttering that he would not

spare PW1. Although PW1 ran away to the house of PW7

to telephone the Panchayat Vice President to inform the

attempt, the accused followed him and stabbed him in the

presence of his wife (PW6) and PW2, who being a chance

witness present at the place of occurrence while awaiting

bus to reach Kaliyar.    The evidence of the doctors, PW8

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                     31</span>



and PW9, who were examined, read along with Ext.P5

wound      certificate     and       Ext.P6     discharge       summary

categorically established that PW1 sustained a fatal injury

which, in turn, led to removal of his left kidney.                     The

prosecution well established recovery of MO1 identified by

PW1 as the knife used for stabbing at the instance of the

accused    under        <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_25">Section   27</a>      of   the    Evidence   Act    to

corroborate       the    prosecution       case      espoused    by    the

evidence of the occurrence witnesses and the doctors.

Therefore,    I    am     of   the    view     that    the   prosecution

successfully established the ingredients to attract offence

under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_26">Section 307</a> of IPC, viz., (i) the intention to commit

murder and (ii) the act done by the accused in that

attempt.      Further, the entire evidence and from the

attending circumstances read along with the animosity

between PW1 and the accused on the ground that PW1

told others that accused had stolen latex and he had used

MO1, a knife capable of causing fatal injuries to stab PW1,

and in his attempt to stab the accused to do away PW1,

he caused a stab injury which resulted in removal of the

left kidney of PW1, it has to be held that the prosecution

succeeded in establishing the offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_27">Section 307</a> of

IPC.     Therefore, the conviction does not require any

interference. Therefore, the same stands confirmed.

sentenced the accused by imposing rigorous imprisonment

for a period of 8 years and to pay a fine of Rs.50,000/-. In

default of payment of fine, default imprisonment for a

period of one year also was imposed with direction to give

the fine amount as compensation to PW1.

<p id="p_41">       35. <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_28">Section 307</a> of IPC provides that a person if

fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such act, the

offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or

such punishment as is herein before.       It is submitted by

the learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant is

the only bread winner of his family, and therefore,

leniency in the matter of sentence may be shown. In view

of the above submission, taking a lenient view, I am

inclined to reduce the sentence of rigorous imprisonment

for a period of 5 years instead of 8 years imposed by the

trial court without altering the fine. Therefore, the

sentence is modified as indicated below.
