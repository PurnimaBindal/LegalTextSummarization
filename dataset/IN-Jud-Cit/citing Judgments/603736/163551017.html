HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE RAMESH RANGANATHAN               

WRIT PETITION Nos.4205 of 2013 AND 7543 OF 2014      

COMMON ORDER:                                   

      W.P. No.4205 of 2013 is filed by 18 individuals questioning
the action of the respondents in constituting Dubbaka Nagar
Panchayat, with Dubbaka, Dharmajipet, Lachapet, Chervapur, 
Dumpalapally, Chellapur and Mallaipally Grampanchayat of 
Medak District, as illegal and unconstitutional.  W.P. No.7543 of
2014 is filed by five individuals questioning the action of the
respondents in seeking to conduct elections for the posts of
Chairman, Mandal Parishad, Dubbaka the members of the MPTCs     
in Dubbaka Mandal, the ZPTC, of Dubbaka and Chairman, Zilla 
Parishad, Medak District, while leaving out the Dubbaka,
Dharmajipet, Latchapet, Chervapur, Dumpalapally, Chellapur and
Mallaipally MPTCs from the present electoral process, as arbitrary,
illegal and unconstitutional.

      Facts</pre><p id="p_1">, to the extent relevant, are that the Member of the
Legislative Assembly, Dubbaka, (M.L.A. for short) requested the
Minister for Municipal Administration, vide his letter dated
31.01.2012, to propose creation of a new Municipality at Dubbaka
in view of the long pending demand from the public in his
constituency.  He enclosed thereto, a brief note submitted by the
Revenue Divisional Officer, Siddipet for creation of a new
Municipality in Dubbaka town and mandal.  The Government, vide 
letter dated 11.04.2012, informed the M.L.A. that the proposal for
creation of Dubbaka Municipality would be considered in the next
phase, as the pre-election process i.e., identification of B.C. voters
in all the urban bodies had already started.  The MLA again
addressed letter dated 03.11.2012 to the District Collector, Medak
informing him that a proposal, for creation of Dubaka
Municipality, had been submitted to the Government under the
Indiramma Bata programme which was held at Dubbaka on    
29.10.2012; the Government should consider creation of Dubbaka 
as a Municipality so that the on going development works, weaker
section houses etc., may be taken up; and the subject villages had
no objection to merge themselves to constitute Dubbaka
Municipality.  Along with his letter dated 03.11.2012, the M.L.A.
enclosed the alleged agreements of 12 Gram panchayats to merge  
their villages for creation of Dubbaka as a Municipality. The M.L.A
requested the District Collector to recommend, creation of
Dubbaka as a Municipality, to the government at the earliest.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      In the meanwhile the Minister for Municipal Administration
and Urban Development, vide U.O. note dated 01.01.2013, 
requested the Secretary, Municipal Administration to circulate the
file regarding upgradation of Dubaka Gram panchayat as a
Nagarpanchayat. The Secretary to the Government MA&amp;UD, vide   
memo dated 08.01.2013, forwarded a copy of the letter of the MLA
dated 31.01.2012 to the Commissioner and Director of Municipal
Administration, and informed him that the Government had
agreed, in principle, to consider constitution of Dubbaka Gram
panchayat as a Municipality subject to fulfilment of the parameters
required for constitution of a Nagar panchayat/Municipality.  The
Commissioner was requested to send proposals, duly examining  
the parameters required for constituting a Nagar
Panchayat/Municipality.
</p><p id="p_3">      The Special Secretary to the Government vide memo dated
15.01.2013, while drawing his attention to the letter of the M.L.A
dated 31.01.2012 and the memo of the Secretary dated 
08.01.2013, requested the Commissioner and Director of
Municipal Administration to expedite the proposal for further
action to be taken in the matter.  The Commissioner of Municipal
Administration, vide letter dated 17.01.2013, informed the District
Collector that a representation was submitted by the Dubbaka
M.L.A on 31.01.2012; the Government had agreed, in principle, to
consider constitution of Dubbaka Grampanchayat as a 
Municipality subject to fulfilment of the parameters; proposals for
constituting it as a Nagar panchayat/Municipality should be sent;
and the particulars, as required under the Andhra Pradesh
Transitional Area and Smaller urban Areas (Fixation of criteria)
Rules, 2013; (notified in G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013)
(hereinafter called the 2013 Rules), be furnished regarding
Dubbaka Gram panchayat and other Gram panchayats as     
proposed by the M.L.A for merger, and to constitute Dubbaka as a
Nagar panchayat/Municipality;  and to offer specific remarks in
the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The District Panchayat Officer, Medak informed the District
Collector, Medak, vide letter dated 18.01.2013, that the MPDO had
submitted resolutions and information relating to the 12 gram
panchayats proposed for constitution of Dubbaka Municipality
duly merging the gram panchayat; as per the information given by
the Mandal Parishad Development Officer, Dubbaka, five gram
panchayats were located at a distance of more than 3 kms; it was
not feasible, therefore, to merge these five gram panchayats for
constitution of Dubbaka Nagar panchayat/Municipality, in terms
of G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013; after excluding these five gram
panchayats from the list of 12 gram panchayats as proposed by
the M.L.A, seven gram panchayats could be considered for merger, 
and constitution of the Dubbaka Nagar panchayat/Municipality as
it was feasible under the Rules notified in G.O.Ms. No.16.01.2013;
and necessary proposals may be submitted to the Government for  
upgradation of these seven gram panchayats into Dubbaka Nagar  
panchayat, while merging the gram panchayats, keeping in view
the fast development of gram panchayats.  To his proposal dated
18.01.2013, the District Panchayat Officer enclosed the letter of
the M.L.A, the alleged resolutions of the gram panchayats, and
information relating to these gram panchayats in the prescribed
proforma in Annexures I to VIII.
</p><p id="p_5">      Annexures I to VIII include the alleged resolutions of the
gramsabhas of six other villages, and the alleged resolution of
Dubbaka grampanchayat.  The gram sabha resolutions were   
attested by the respective Special Officers and the Panchayat
Secretaries.  The District Collector, in turn, addressed letter dated
21.01.2013 to the Commissioner &amp; Director of Municipal
Administration requesting him to consider creation of Dubbaka
Nagar Panchayat/Municipality duly merging seven gram  
panchayats; and the resolutions of the gram panchayats, and
information regarding these gram panchayats, were being
submitted, in the prescribed proforma in Annexure I to VIII, gram
panchayats wise.  What was, in fact, submitted was not the
resolutions of the seven gram panchayats, but the resolution of
Dubbaka Gram panchayat dated 02.11.2013 consisting of its 
Special Officer and Executive Officer; and the gram sabha
resolutions of Dharmajipet, Lachapet, Chervapur, Dumpalapally,
Chellapur and Mallaipally gram panchayats attested by the Special
Officers and the Panchayat Secretaries of the respective gram
panchayats. 
</p><p id="p_6">      The Commissioner &amp; Director of Municipal Administration,
vide letter dated 23.01.2013, informed that the Dubbaka gram
panchayat would be converted, duly merging the surrounding
gram panchayats, to that of a Nagar panchayat as the norms 
prescribed in G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013 were satisfied.  He
requested the Government to take necessary action in the matter,
and to issue suitable orders.  Pursuant thereto G.O.Ms. No.33 PR
&amp; RD dated 31.01.2013 was issued, in the exercise of the powers
under Section 3(2)(f) of the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act (hereafter called,
the 1994 Act) read with Rule 12(1) (i) of the Andhra Pradesh Gram
Panchayats (Declaration of Villages) Rules, 2007 notified in
G.O.Ms. No.542 dated 03.12.2007 (hereafter called, the 2007
Rules), cancelling the earlier notifications (whereby Dubbaka,
Dharmajipet, Lachapet, Chervapur, Dumpalapally, Chellapur and
Mallaipally villages were declared as Gram Panchayats) so as to
declare these areas as a Nagar panchayat.  G.O.Ms. No.37 MA &amp;   
UD (Elec.I) Dept dated 31.01.2013 was issued, in the exercise of
the powers conferred by Section 2(42-a) of the A.P. Municipalities
Act, 1965 (hereafter called, the 1965 Act) read with rule 2 of the
2013 Rules, specifying the areas, covered under the erstwhile
Dubbaka, Dharmajipet, Lachapet, Chervapur, Dumpalapally, 
Chellapur and Mallaipally Grampanchayats of Medak District, as
the Dubbaka transitional area (Nagar Panchayat) with immediate
effect for the purposes of the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The 1st petitioner in W.P. No.4205 of 2013 is the Ex-
surpanch of Lachapet village and a resident thereof.  He, and the
other petitioners, claim to be residents of the villages which are
now made part of Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat.  Petitioners 3, 7, 9,
12, 15, 17 also claim to be the card holders of <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_1">Mahatma Gandhi
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act</a> (MGNREGA), and the     
beneficiaries thereof.   Petitioners 4, 5, 8, 10, 13 and 14 claim to be
Antyodaya ration card holders, poor agriculturists and weavers in
distress.  It is the petitioners case that the population of Dubbaka
Gram panchayat is 11,368 as per the 2001 census; it does not
even have a cinema hall; there is no industry thereat; most of its
inhabitants are agricultural labourers and beedi workers; nearly
120 weavers committed suicide because of recession, and several 
others have become daily wage labourers; 3506 families are eking
out their livelihood, under the MGNREGA, in Dubbaka alone i.e,
more than 30% of the population; the local panchayat officer had
called for a gram sabha in their areas in November, 2012; he had
not followed the prescribed procedure while calling for the gram
sabhas; neither was any agenda circulated nor were the villagers
given due notice; the gram sabhas, convened in all the subject
gram panchayats, were told that there was a proposal for creating
a municipality with Dubbaka as the headquarter; 12 villages were
proposed to be merged with Dubbaka to constitute a Municipality;
and, as the elected body of the regular panchayat was not in
existence, the gram sabha was conducted.  The petitioners claim
that all the gram sabhas had opposed the proposal; no gram sabha 
was even held for Dubbaka gram panchayat; the special officer and
the panchayat secretary had alone proposed and passed the 
resolution; except for these two officers, there was no consultation
with the villagers of Dubbaka gram panchayat; in the gram sabha
convened in Lachapet gram panchayat, the petitioners had insisted
on the authorities recording the resolution, in the minutes book,
that they were opposing the merger of their village with the
proposed municipality; the officers had, instead, sent a letter that
the gram sabhas had accepted the proposal; similar resolutions
were passed for villages, other than Latchapet also; it later came to
light that the proceedings were manipulated, and the local M.L.A
was instrumental in floating this proposal; representations were
made, processions were taken out, and dharnas were held by the 
villagers; in view of the opposition to the formation of a
Municipality, the officers appeared to have dropped the proposal;
however, in the last week of January, 2013, authorities from the
district headquarters were seen in the panchayat offices collecting
information; on enquiry the 1st petitioner learnt that Dubbaka
Nagar Panchayat was formed; not even a copy of the G.O. was sent  
to the Gram Panchayat; while the earlier proposal, placed before
the Gram sabha, was for constitution of a Municipality, a Nagar
Panchayat was, instead, declared; the proposal for constitution of a
Nagar Panchayat was not even placed before the gram sabha; on  
an application made under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_2">RTI Act</a>, certain documents were
furnished to them which revealed that the local M.L.A had written
letter dated 03.11.2012 seeking creation of Dubbaka Municipality;
curiously the officers had conducted the gramsabhas a day earlier
i.e., 02.11.2012 itself; the MPDO, acting at the behest of the M.L.A,
had sent a letter to the District Collector; no prior notice was given
or objections called for by placing the proposals in the notice board
of the gram panchayat; while the respondents claimed that
Dharmajipet is 3 kms from Dubbaka, and the other villages, in the
proposed Nagar panchayat, were located 2 kms away, the distance  
is more than the prescribed maximum distance of 3 kms; the 
impugned GO is in violation of <a href="/doc/15169/" id="a_3">Article 243-Q</a> of the Constitution of
India; Dubbaka Mandal was declared as a drought prone area in
the previous year; it has been suffering drought conditions for the
past several decades; people belonging to the poorer sections in
these villages depend on the MGNREGA scheme for their  
livelihood; they would all loose their sustenance if this area is
declared an urban area; from out of the total population of 25661,
in the proposed Nagar panchayat, there are around ten thousands
MGNREGA wage workers i.e, nearly 40% of the population; others  
are agricultural labourers; the 40% criteria, in non-agricultural
earnings, has also been violated; these issues raised in the gram
sabhas were not even considered; no notice was given to the gram
panchayat either for their de-notification or for constituting them
as a Nagar panchayat; the resolutions of the gram sabhas,
rejecting the proposal for forming the Municipality, were sent as if
the gram sabhas had accepted the proposal for formation of
Dubbaka Municipality; even though no gram sabha was held in 
Dubbaka gram panchayat, proceedings were issued by the   
Panchayat officer referring to an earlier resolution without any
date; the income criteria, stipulated under the Rules, were not
reflected correctly in the proposal; the distances were also wrongly
mentioned; none of these grampanchayats have any urban  
characteristics; a majority of the poorer sections in these gram
panchayats get their sustenance from the MGNREGA scheme,     
which would no longer be available once it is declared an urban
area; nearly 90% of the population are white ration card holders;
they would all be burdened with more taxes; other areas in Medak
District, with greater population and with a higher income,  have
not been converted either into Municipalities or as Nagar
Panchayats; the action of the respondents, in creating Dubbaka
Nagar Panchayat, is arbitrary and in violation of Articles 14 and 21
of the Constitution of India; it is vitiated by non-application of
mind; the impugned order is a colourable exercise of power and is
based on false and fudged figures; the proceedings were
manipulated for extraneous reasons; and the order suffers from
legal malafides.
</p><p id="p_8">      In the counter-affidavit, filed on behalf of the 1st respondent,
it is stated that, keeping in view rapid urbanization and transition
of rural areas, the Government took a decision to consider the
proposal for upgradation of areas, which acquired urban
characteristics and were covered in gram panchayats, to that of
Nagar panchayats/Municipalities for providing better civic
amenities and to attend to urban needs; all the District Collectors
in the State were requested to submit proposals in respect of areas
which fulfilled the criteria for upgradation as Urban local bodies;
the District Collectors had sent proposals to the Government for
upgradation of certain gram panchayats as Nagar
Panchayats/Municipalities, and for merger of surrounding areas
into the existing Municipalities/Municipal corporations; the
petitioners contention that the proposal for constitution of Nagar
Panchayats were not placed before the gram sabha, and the gram  
sabhas were not consulted before orders were issued constituting
the Dubbaka Nagar panchayat, is not tenable as the guidelines in
G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013 do not stipulate any such 
condition; the District Collector, Medak submitted a detailed
proposal to the 3rd respondent, vide letter dated 21.01.2013, to
consider creation of Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat/Municipality duly
merging Dubbaka, Dharmajipet, Latchapet, Chervpur, 
Dumapalally, Chellapur and Malliahpur gram panchayats; after its
detailed scrutiny, the proposal was sent to the 1st respondent, vide
letter dated 25.01.2013, for constitution of Dubbaka Nagar
panchayat; the 1st respondent had, thereafter, issued a notification
in G.O.Ms. No.37 dated 21.01.2013 declaring Dubbaka as a gram  
panchchayat, after merging it with six other gram panchayats;
and, in PIL Nos.359, 360, 368 and 369 of 2013 dated 29.07.2013,
a Division Bench of this Court held that a policy decision, taken in
accordance with law, cannot be scrutinised by the Court; and the
Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat was constituted in accordance with the  
guidelines issued by the Government in G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 
16.01.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      In the counter-affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent, the
petitioners locus standi to question the impugned GOs is put in
issue.  It is stated therein that the impugned orders were passed
considering the resolution of the respective gram panchayats;
under Rule 10 of the 2007 Rules, it is for the concerned gram
panchayat to file a revision before the Government; it is only after
considering the viability of constitution of a Nagar panchayat, with
reference to the existing norms, was the impugned G.O. issued by
the Government; the population of the Dubbaka Nagar  Panchayat 
is 25,669, and it qualifies to be a Nagar panchayat in terms of
G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013; the population criteria for,
constitution of a Nagar Panchayat, as per the last census is 20,000
to 40,000; 10 rice mills are located in the vicinity of the Nagar
Panchayat limits; most of them are mainly dependant on 
agriculture;  these gram panchayats are situated near Siddipet
Town, and the density of population is increasing day by day; gram
sabhas were conducted in the 11 to be merged gram panchayats,  
including Dubbaka; the members of these gram sabhas gave their 
consent for formation of a Nagar panchayat; by his proceedings
dated 18.01.2013, the MPDO submitted proposals for upgradation 
of Dubbaka grampanchayat, with 11 surrounding gram  
panchayats, into a Nagar panchayat; the MPDO had stated that it
was viable to form a Nagar panchayat with Dubbaka, and 11 other
gram panchayats, as it satisfied the norms of population and
revenue; public at large were seeking benefits of the Indiramma
Bata programme which is available only to urban local bodies; the
MPDO Dubbaka had also submitted resolutions of the Gram   
panchayats passed in the Gram sabhas, as well as in the gram 
panchayat meetings, resolving to merge the gram panchayats into 
Dubbaka, and to upgrade it into a Nagar panchayat; the proposals
were submitted to the District Collector, Medak, vide proceedings
dated 18.01.2013, recommending formation of the Dubbaka Nagar  
Panchayat, excluding five gram panchayats i.e., Ramakkapet, 
Habsipur, Cheekode, Kammarpally and Balwantpur as they were   
more than 3 kms away from the peripheral jurisdiction  of
Dubbaka gram panchayat; the District Collector, Medak had 
submitted his report on 21.01.2013 to the Government; the
criteria, for constitution of a Nagar Panchayat, is fully satisfied
such as market potential, income importance and scope for
industrialisation; the distance from the outer periphery of these
gram panchayats to Dubbaka gram panchayat is less than 3 kms;   
gram sabhas were conducted in all the 12 gram panchayats, 
sought to be merged with Dubbaka Gram Panchayat, to constitute  
a Nagar Panchayat; and all the members of the gram sabhas had  
given their consent, and had passed resolutions to form the Nagar
panchayat merging their villages into Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat.
Para 6 of the counter-affidavit contains a table wherein details are
furnished regarding compliance of various parameters for
constitution of a Nagar Panchayat.  It is further stated that
Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat satisfies all these requirements; it was
only after detailed verification was G.O.Ms. No.33 dated
31.01.2013 issued de-notifying seven gram panchayats of
Dubbaka Mandal for the purpose of constituting it into the
Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat; Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat is situated    
25 kms from NH7 high way road, and 26 kms from Rajiv  
Rahadary, leading to the State capital; it has acquired urban
characteristics; the distance between the six merged villages and
Dubbaka is around 3 kms, and satisfies the criteria prescribed in
G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013; MGNREGA  programme would       
be continued, and the petitioners apprehension of their sustenance
being in danger is misplaced; the population of Dubbaka Nagar
Panchayat is 25,914 as per the 2011 census, and satisfies the
prescribed norms; gram sabhas were conducted and all the 
members of the gram panchayats, sought to be merged with  
Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat, had given their consent; they had 
overwhelmingly supported the resolutions to form the Nagar
Panchayat, and to merge their villages in Dubbaka Nagar
panchayat; this Court passed an interim order on 01.03.2013
recording that the State Government was committed, for the next
one year, to continue the National Rural Employment Guarantee 
Scheme in the six villages; the petitioner filed W.A. No.432 of 2013
against the said interim order; and the Division bench had passed
an interim order on 13.06.2013 staying elections to the Dubbaka
Nagar Panchayat. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">      In the counter-affidavit, filed on behalf of the Dubbaka Nagar
panchayat, it is stated that, while Dubbaka and Lachapet
panchayats continued as notified gram panchayats since 1960, the 
other gram panchayats continued as non-notified panchayats till
they were merged with the Dubbaka Nagar panchayat; both  
Dubbaka and Lachapet villages are reputed for their handlooms,
power looms etc., for the past 50 years; beedi making small scale
industries and rice mills etc., are located thereat; a large number
of people earn their livelihood from sources other than agriculture;
there are many central and state government offices located at
Dubbaka which was, hitherto, the Taluq head quarters and,
thereafter, the Mandal Head quarters; it also has a bus depot
wherefrom buses ply to surrounding villages; in addition to its
population of 25914, it also has a floating population of around
10,000; resolutions were passed by the Special Officers in
consultation with the public; the petitioners were manipulating
and fabricating truth to suit their convenience; proposals were
submitted with the prior consent of all the panchayats and gram
sabhas; there are no procedural lapses; the conditions, fixed for
constitution of Nagar panchayats, have not been violated; the
distance certificate, produced by the petitioners, were issued
reckoning the distance from the mandal office to the merged gram
panchayat, instead of the periphery of the outer habitation of the
merged villages; the actual distance of the surrounding villages is
well within 3 kms from the periphery of the main gram panchayat;
declaration of these areas as drought prone areas does not
preclude these grampanchayats from being constituted as a Nagar 
panchayat; a number of schemes are being implemented in urban  
local bodies to uplift the poor; resolutions were passed by the gram
panchayats and the gram sabhas; the proposals were not rejected 
either by the gram panchayats or the gram sabhas; the income of
the gram panchayats were correctly shown as per the records; the
Nagar Panchayat is continuing till date; consequent on its
formation, the requisite post constitution activities of Dubbaka
Nagar Panchayat were completed and implemented; all the staff 
have exercised their option to continue to serve the Nagar
Panchayat; they were all absorbed in the Municipal Administration
Department, and were posted in other Municipalities after their in-
terse-seniority was fixed; it is not possible to restore the action
taken and implemented; division of the Nagar panchayat into 20
wards was approved in G.O.Ms. No.277 dated 17.06.2013; a slum  
survey was conducted and completed, and 14 slums were   
identified in Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat; and proposals have been 
submitted for their notification as slums.  The counter-affidavit
details the development activities taken up by the Nagar
Panchayat.  It is further stated that petitioner Nos.6 and 18 are not
residents of any of the villages which were merged and formed as
the Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">      The Ex-Sarpanches of some of these Gram Panchayats  
impleaded themselves as respondents to this Writ Petition.  In their
counter-affidavit, it is stated that the 2007 Rules prescribes a
notice to be given to the Panchayat, and not to individual villagers;
no gram panchayat is before this Court complaining of violation of
Rule 12(2)  of the 2007 Rules; the gram panchayats had passed 
resolutions, through Gram sabhas, to constitute the Dubbaka
Nagar panchayat after merger of the respective villages; the Writ
Petition as filed is not maintainable either in law or on facts; on
examining the request made by the villagers, and on being satisfied
that the Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat has attained urban 
characteristics, the 1st respondent declared it as a Nagar
Panchayat as the conditions stipulated in G.O.Ms. No.16 dated
16.01.2013 were satisfied; consequently G.O.Ms. No.37 dated 
13.01.2013 was issued constituting the Dubbaka Nagar 
Panchayat; the petitioners, being individuals, are not entitled to
question the action of the Government; it is only the Gram
Panchayats which are entitled to question the same; Dubbaka was 
a panchayat samithi even in the late 1960s; Dubbaka town was 
declared as the Taluq Headquarters and, after formation of
Mandals, as the Mandal Head quarters; and its strategic location,
and availability of suitable land in plenty in and around, has
resulted in Dubbaka rapidly acquiring urban characteristics.  The
counter-affidavit details various facilities available in these areas
which, according to them, satisfy the conditions stipulated in
G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013, in constituting these gram
panchayats as a Nagar Panchayat.  It is further stated that they
had submitted a representation to the M.L.A for merger of the
neighbouring villages for the purpose of formation of a Nagar
panchayat; they had also submitted a representation to the Chief
Minister during the Indiramma Bata programme on 29.10.2012; 
acting on their representation, the MPDO had submitted proposals
for upgradation of Dubbaka Gram Panchayat, with 11 surrounding 
gram panchayats, as the Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat; respondents    
1 to 6 had examined the proposals and the resolutions passed by
the respective gram panchayats; they were satisfied that Dubbaka
Nagar panchayat had fulfilled the criteria laid down in G.O.Ms.
No.16 dated 16.01.2013; while the initial proposal was to form
Dubbaka Municipality, after merging 11 villages which fell within a
distance of 5 kms, the Government, after taking into consideration
the conditions laid down in G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 16.01.2013, on
being satisfied that six villages were located within the periphery of
3 kms from Dubbaka gram panchayat, and their revenues were  
more than 40 lakhs, had issued G.O.Ms. No.37 dated 31.01.2013  
constituting Dubbaka Gram panchayat as a Nagar Panchayat; the   
3rd respondent issued proceedings dated 05.02.2013 appointing a
Special Officer to discharge functions under the 1965 Act; the
Special Officer has assumed charge on 06.02.2013; thereafter, a
regular Commissioner was appointed; for the past more than a
year, permissions have been granted by the Nagar panchayat for
construction of residential houses; betterment charges, collected in
this regard, have been deposited in the Treasury; the respondents
have substantially complied with all procedural aspects stipulated
for formation of Dubbaka Nagar panchayat; there was no
necessity, therefore, for the Government to issue a notice to the
gram panchayat under Rule 12(2) of the Rules notified in G.O.Ms.
No.542 dated 03.12.2007; and the petitioners lack the locus standi
to challenge the impugned notifications issued in larger public
interest.
</p><p id="p_12">      Elaborate submissions, both oral and written, were made by
Sri K.S.Murthy, Learned Counsel for the petitioners, and Sri
B.Mahendar Reddy, Learned Counsel for respondents 8 to 11.  The 
Learned Government Pleaders for Panchayat Raj and Municipal  
Administration put forth their submissions and produced the
records.  Sri D.Bhaskar Reddy, Learned Standing Counsel 
appearing for respondent No.12, put forth his contentions on the
need to permit Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat to function.  It is
convenient to examine the rival submissions, made by Counsel on 
either side, under different heads.
</p><p id="p_13">I. ARE THE A.P. GRAM PANCHAYAT (DECLARATION OF           
     VILLAGES) RULES, 2007 DIRECTORY OR MANDATORY?           
</p>
<p id="p_14">      Sri K.S. Murthy, Learned Counsel for the petitioner, submits
that the 2007 Rules are mandatory; even otherwise there is no
substantial compliance of the said Rules; no resolution has been
passed by any of the Gram Panchayats, except by the Special  
Officer of Dubbaka gram panchayat, expressing their consent to
the constitution of a Municipality; all Officers, from the Mandal
level upto the Principal Secretary, have made false statements
before this Court that the Gram Panchayats had passed 
resolutions agreeing to merge their gram panchayat for
constitution of a Nagar Panchayat; even if Gram Sabhas were
conducted as per rules, they are of no consequence as it is the
Gram Panchayats which have to resolve/respond, and not the 
Grama Sabha; no notice was issued by the government to the  
subject gram panchayats; resolutions were passed by the Special 
Officers of the Gram Panchayats; the whole process is vitiated by
fraud; constitution of Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat is a sham; and
the respondents have reduced the entire process, of de-notifying
the Gram panchayats, to a mockery.  Learned Counsel would rely 
on Yerusu Appalakonda v. The Govt. of A.P, Panchayat Raj, 
Hyderabad ; and Vemuri Venkata Swamy v. Spl. Secretary,  
Transport Dept, Hyderabad ).
</p><p id="p_15">      On the other hand Sri B. Mahender Reddy, learned counsel
for respondents 8 to 11, would submit that, under Sec.3(2)(f) of the
1994 Act for cancellation of the earlier notification constituting a
village, it is mandatory for a notification to be issued; in the
present case, in terms of the mandatory provision, a notification
has been issued; the 2007 Rules prescribes the procedure for de-
notification of villages, and for a notice  to be issued to the Gram
Panchayat calling for their objections, if any; the 2007 Rules are
procedural in nature; procedural laws are, ordinarily, directory,
and not mandatory;  no negative words are used in the 2007
Rules, and no consequences are provided for its violation; the 2007
Rules are, hence, directory; the 2007 Rules do not provide for
notice to individual villagers, but only to the Gram Panchayat; the
consent of the Gram Sabha is also not required;  in the absence of
an elected body to the village, the Special Officer, appointed to the
Gram Panchayat, represents the Gram Panchayat u/s.143(4); the  
gram panchayats have not raised any dispute regarding violation of
Rule 12(2) i.e., non issuance of a notice to the Gram Panchayats;
they have also not raised any objection for its de-notification; on
the contrary, the Gram Panchayats have consented to the 
constitution of a Nagar Panchayat; the 2007 Rules have been
substantially complied with; if the Rules are directory, its violation
does not result in invalidation of the action already taken; and
substantial compliance of the directory rule is sufficient. Learned
counsel would rely on Mahadev Govind Gharge v. LAO ; <a href="/doc/287512/" id="a_4">May  
George v. Special Tahsildar</a> ;  <a href="/doc/646679/" id="a_5">Balwant Singh v. Anand Kumar
Sharma</a> ; <a href="/doc/623061/" id="a_6">Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd</a>., ;

Government of A.P . 
</p><p id="p_16">      <a href="/doc/1224706/" id="a_9">In Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal</a>  the Supreme
Court held that, while considering the consequence of non-
compliance of a procedural requirement, it must be kept in view
that such a requirement is designed to facilitate justice and further
its ends; and, therefore, if the consequence of non-compliance is
not provided, the requirement may be held to be directory.  In
Mahadev Govind Gharge3, the Supreme Court held that  
procedural laws, like the Code, are intended to control and
regulate the procedure of judicial proceedings to achieve the
objects of justice and expeditious disposal of cases; procedural
laws, which do not provide for penal consequences in default of
their compliance, should normally be construed as directory, and
should receive a liberal construction; and the Court should always
keep in mind the object of the statute, and adopt an interpretation
which would further such cause in the light of attendant
circumstances. In Yeni Reddy Raghava Reddy8 this Court held  
that, jurisprudentially, it is well established that, in an election,
the right of the elected person is neither a fundamental right nor
an equitable right; it is a statutory right and can be exercised or
taken away strictly in terms of the statute; nothing had been
pointed out whereby, by the Legislature, it has been provided that
non-compliance of processual or procedural provisions of service of
notice or the form of notice would render the vote of no-confidence
invalid; the object of procedural law is to serve the person or
apprise the person that a vote of no-confidence would be held on a
particular date and at a particular time for consideration of the
motion of no-confidence; it is only the intention of the proposer
which has to be intimated to the members; and the notice being
only directory, the mere use of the word "shall" would not make it
mandatory especially when no consequence for non-compliance of  
the requirements of the notice in Form-V has been provided by
legislation.
</p><p id="p_17">      The difference between a mandatory and a directory rule is
that the former requires strict observance while, in the case of
latter, substantial compliance with the rule may suffice.  Where the
statute provides that failure to observe a particular rule would lead
to a specific consequence, the provision has to be construed as
mandatory. (<a href="/doc/396572/" id="a_10">Sharif-ud-Din v. Abdul Gani Lone</a> ; Balwant
Singh5; Bhavnagar University6 Chandrika Prasad Yadav v. State 
of Bihar ; May George4).  If a rule is mandatory, it must be
strictly construed and followed, and an act done in breach thereof
will be invalid. But if it is directory, the act will be valid although
its non-compliance may give rise to some other penalty, if any,
provided by the Statute. A mandatory enactment must be obeyed  
or fulfilled exactly, but non-compliance of a directory provision
would not affect the validity of the act done in breach thereof.
(<a href="/doc/1542502/" id="a_11">Ram Deen Maurya (Dr.) v. State of U.P</a>. ).   Often the question
whether a mandatory or directory construction should be given to
a statutory provision may be determined by an expression in the
statute itself of the result that shall follow non-compliance with the
provision. As a corollary to this rule, the fact that no consequences
of non-compliance are stated in the statute, has been considered
as a factor tending towards a directory construction. But this is
only an element to be considered, and is by no means conclusive.
(Balwant Singh5; Sutherlands Statutory Construction, 3rd
Edn., Vol. 3).
</p>
<p id="p_18">      The primary key to the problem, whether a statutory
provision is mandatory or directory, is the intention of the law-
maker as expressed in the law itself. The reason behind the
provision may be a further aid to the ascertainment of that
intention. If the provision is couched in prohibitive or negative
language, it can rarely be directory, the use of peremptory
language in a negative form is per se indicative of the intent that
the provision is to be mandatory (Crawford, the Construction of
Statutes; Lachmi Narain7).  It is impossible to lay down any
general rule for determining whether a provision is imperative or
directory. [Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes 12th Ed.
p. 314; <a href="/doc/1465475/" id="a_12">Karnal Leather Karamchari Sanghatan v. Liberty
Footwear Company</a> ). It is the duty of the Court to try to get at
the real intention of the Legislature carefully attending to the whole
scope of the statute to be construed, (<a href="/doc/132533/" id="a_13">Bhikraj Jaipuria v. Union of
India</a> ; Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner ), and analysing the
scope of the statute or the Section or the phrase under
consideration. (<a href="/doc/943497/" id="a_14">Sarla Goel v. Kishan Chand</a> ; <a href="/doc/129507/" id="a_15">Mohan Singh v.
International Airport Authority of India</a> ).  The question as to
whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends on the
intention of the legislature, and not upon the language in which
the intent is clothed. (Crawford on Statutory Construction 
<a href="/doc/358206/" id="a_16">Article 261</a> at p. 516; <a href="/doc/138715291/" id="a_17">State of U.P. v. Manbodhan Lal
Srivastava</a> ; <a href="/doc/450732/" id="a_18">State of M.P. v. Pradeep Kumar</a> ; <a href="/doc/329988/" id="a_19">Govindlal
Chhaganlal Patel v. Agricultural Produce Market Committee</a> ).
One must look into the subject-matter and consider the
importance of the provision disregarded, and the relation of that
provision to the general object intended to be secured. The
determination of the question whether a provision is mandatory or
directory would, in the ultimate analysis, depend upon the intent
of the law-maker. (<a href="/doc/892303/" id="a_20">State of Mysore v. V.K. Kangan</a> ).  In
ascertaining the real intention of the Legislature, the Court may
consider, inter alia, the nature and the design of the statute, and
the consequences which would follow from construing it one way
or the other, the impact of other provisions whereby the necessity
of complying with the provisions in question is avoided, the
circumstance, namely, that the statute provides for a contingency
of the non-compliance with the provisions, the fact that the non-
compliance with the provisions is or is not visited by some penalty,
the serious or trivial consequences that flow therefrom and, above
all, whether the object of the legislation will be defeated or
furthered. (<a href="/doc/1540511/" id="a_21">State of U.P. v. Babu Ram Upadhya</a> ; May George4; 
<a href="/doc/930201/" id="a_22">Dattatraya Moreshwar v. State of Bombay</a> ; <a href="/doc/1113126/" id="a_23">Raza Buland Sugar  
Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Board</a>, Rampur ; and V.K. Kangan22).
</p>        
<p id="p_19">      When a statute is passed for the purpose of enabling
something to be done, and prescribes the formalities which are to
attend its performance, those prescribed formalities which are
essential to the validity of the thing when done are called
imperative or absolute; but those which are not essential, and may
be disregarded without invalidating the thing to be done, are called
directory.  (Craeis on Statute Law 5th Ed. p. 63; and Karnal
Leather Karamchari Sanghatan14).  Where a statute requires that
a thing shall be done in the prescribed manner or form but does
not set out the consequences of non-compliance, the question
whether the provision is mandatory or directory has to be adjudged
in the light of the intention of the legislature as disclosed by the
object, purpose and scope of the statute.   (Bhikraj15).  The
wording of a provision is not determinative as to whether it is
absolute or directory. Even the absence of a penal provision for
non- compliance does not lead to an inference that it is only
directory. The Court must, therefore, ascertain the purpose to be
achieved notwithstanding the text of the provision. (Karnal
Leather Karamchari Sanghatan14).  
</p>
<p id="p_20">      In order to determine whether Rule 12(2) of the 2007 Rules
is mandatory or directory, the legislative intent in conferring
constitutional status on Gram Panchayats by the 73rd
Constitutional amendment under Part IX of the Constitution of
India, and in treating them as body corporates, and distinct legal
entities under the provisions of the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1994,
must be ascertained.  Questions depending on the intention of the
legislature cannot be answered without an examination of the
provisions and purposes of the Act/Rules. In considering the true
meaning of words or expressions used by the legislature, the Court
must have regard to the aim, object and scope of the
statute/statutory rule as read in its entirety. The Court must
ascertain the intention of the legislature/rule making authority by
directing its attention not merely to the clauses to be construed
but to the entire Statute/statutory rule.  It must compare the
clause with the other parts of the law, and the setting in which the
clause to be interpreted occurs.  (<a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_24">State of W.B. v. Union of
India</a> ; <a href="/doc/1048929/" id="a_25">Province of Bombay v. Municipal Corporation of the
City of Bombay</a> ; <a href="/doc/1764677/" id="a_26">State of Punjab v. Okara Grain Buyers'
Syndicate Ltd</a>., ). The Court must compare the clause to be
construed with the other parts of the law and the setting in which
the clause to be interpreted occurs. (<a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_27">State of W.B. v. Union of
India25</a>; <a href="/doc/995861/" id="a_28">R.S. Raghunath v. State of Karnataka</a> ; and <a href="/doc/1277713/" id="a_29">Manik Lal
Majumdar v. Gouranga Chandra Dey</a> ).  The Court should  
examine every word of a statute/statutory Rule in its context.
Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. That
interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation
match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know
why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read,
first as a whole and then Section by Section, Clause by Clause,
phrase by phrase and word by word. No part of a statute and no
word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be
construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its
place. (R.S. Raghunath29; <a href="/doc/1149874/" id="a_30">Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless
General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd</a>. ). The distinction
between the purpose or object of an enactment, and the legislative
intention governing it, is that the former relates to the mischief to
which the enactment is directed and its remedy, while the latter
relates to the legal meaning of the enactment.  There is a clear
distinction between the two. While the purpose or object of the
legislation is to provide a remedy for the malady, the legislative
intention relates to the meaning or exposition of the remedy as
enacted. (<a href="/doc/1061804/" id="a_31">Shashikant Laxman Kale v. Union of India</a> ; Francis

         BACKGROUND:  </blockquote>

<p id="p_22">      <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_33">Article 40</a>, one of the directive principles of the Constitution
of India, reads as under:
</p><p id="p_23">   40. Organisation of Village Panchayats.The State shall
take steps to organise Village Panchayats and endow them with 
such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them  
to function as units of self-government.
</p>
<p id="p_24">The Constitutions quest for an inclusive governance, voiced in the
Preamble, was found not to be consistent with the panchayats
being treated merely as units of self-government and only as a part
of the directive principles.   From the Constituent Assembly
Debates, one finds that even that constitutional provision about
panchayat was inducted after strenuous efforts by some of the
members.  There was a substantial difference of opinion between
one set of members who wanted to finalise the Constitution solely
on the parliamentary model totally ignoring the importance of
panchayat principles, and another group of members who wanted  
to mould the Constitution on Gandhian principles of Village
Panchayats.  The word panchayat did not even once appear in
the Draft Constitution. The Drafting Committee did not even
discuss, in its meetings, the alternative principles of the Gandhian
view of the panchayats. The Draft Constitution was published on
26-2-1948.
</p><p id="p_25">      One of the strongest critics of the Draft Constitution was Dr.
Rajendra Prasad and he opined that the village has been and will
ever continue to be our unit in this country. Subsequently, other
members like Sri M.A.Ayangar and Sri N.G. Ranga also suggested   
some amendments to the Draft Constitution and both harped on 
the introduction of the Panchayat Raj principles. Their arguments
were on the following lines The State shall establish self-governing
panchayats for every village or a group of villages with adequate
powers and funds to give training to rural people in democracy and
to pave the way for effective decentralisation of political and
economic power. Mr.Ayangar expressed his views very strongly 
saying democracy is not worth anything, if once in a blue moon
individuals are brought together for one common purpose, merely
electing X, Y and Z to the Assembly and then disperse. A
somewhat similar opinion was expressed by Sri S.C. Mazumdar   
that the main sources of Indias strength lay in revitalised villages
but he accepted that a strong unifying central authority was a
necessity. The opinion expressed by Sri S.C. Mazumdar   struck a
balance between Gandhian principles and the parliamentary model 
of the Constitution.  Under strong criticism from various members,
the Constituent Assembly grudgingly accepted that an Article
concerning the panchayat should be included in the directive
principles. On 22-11-1948, Sri K.Santhanam moved the official
amendment and that is how <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_34">Article 40</a>, in its present form, came
into existence. The amendment was accepted by Dr. Ambedkar.   
(<a href="/doc/10378377/" id="a_35">Bhanumati v. State of U.P</a>., ; Granville Austin  Indian
Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation).
</p>
<p id="p_26">      The incorporation of <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_36">Article 40</a> in the Constitution has
proved to have been less a gesture to romantic sentiment than a
bow to realistic insight. And the aim of the article has long been
generally accepted: if India is to progress, it must do so through
reawakened village life.  (Granville Austin  Indian Constitution:
Cornerstone of a Nation; Bhanumati33).  From the very start the
idea of organising the government, on the basis of the village
panchayat as a unit, was not entertained, a strong central
government having been generally accepted as inevitable. The
inclusion of <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_37">Article 40</a> appears to have been a sop for those who
held that a democratic Indian Constitution should be founded on
the village as a unit of Government. (Constitution of India 
H.M.Seervai  Silver Jubilee Edition; The Indian Constitution
 Cornerstone of a Nation  Granville Austian).
</p><p id="p_27">      In other representative democracies of the World, committed
to a written Constitution and the rule of law, the principles of self-
government are also part of the constitutional doctrine. It has been
accepted in the American Constitution that the right to local self-
government is treated as inherent in cities and towns. Such rights
cannot be taken away even by the legislature. (Bhanumati33; Vol.
56, American Jurisprudence, <a href="/doc/1312011/" id="a_38">Article 125</a>). Local Self-
Government, realistically speaking, is a simulacrum of <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_39">Article 40</a>
and democratically speaking a half-hearted euphemism for, in
substance, these elected species were talking phantoms with a
hierarchy of state officials hobbling their locomotion. Their
exercises were strictly overseen by the State Government, their
resources were precariously dependent on the grace of the latter,
and their functions were fulfilled through a Chief Executive
appointed by the State Government. Floor-level democracy in India
is a devalued rupee, <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_40">Article 40</a> and the evocative opening words of
the Constitution notwithstanding. Grassroots never sprout until
decentralization becomes a fighting creed, not a pious chant.

</p>
<p id="p_30">   The 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments were introduced
in Parliament in September, 1991 in the form of two separate bills
i.e., the 72nd Amendment Bill for Panchayats and the 73rd
Amendment Bill for Municipalities.  They were referred to a joint
select Committee of Parliament and were, ultimately, passed as the
73rd and 74th Amendment in December, 1992.  After the bills were
ratified by the State assemblies of more than half the States, the
President gave his assent on April 20th 1993.  The Statement of
Objects and Reasons of a Constitutional Amendment Bill or an Act
can be referred to for the limited purpose of ascertaining the
conditions prevailing at the time which actuated the sponsor of the
Bill to introduce the same, and the extent and urgency of the evil
which he sought to remedy. (<a href="/doc/973363/" id="a_42">State of West Bengal v. Subodh

Taong Shang v. Commander S.D. Baijal</a> ).   For determining the
purpose or object of the legislation, it is permissible to look into the
circumstances which prevailed at the time when the law was
passed and which necessitated the passing of that law. For the
limited purpose of appreciating the background and the antecedent
factual matrix leading to the legislation, it is permissible to look
into the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill which
actuated the step to provide a remedy for the then existing malady.

</p><p id="p_31">      In order to understand the purport of the Seventy-third
Constitutional Amendment in Part IX of the Constitution, it is
useful to refer to the Statements of Objects and Reasons for the
amendment. Excerpts thereof are set out:
</p><p id="p_32">    THE CONSTITUTION (SEVENTY-THIRD AMENDMENT) ACT, 1992           
Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution 
(Seventy-second Amendment) Bill, 1991 which was enacted as the  
Constitution (Seventy-third Amendment) Act, 1992

    Though the Panchayati Raj institutions have been in existence for a long
time, it has been observed that these institutions have not been able to
acquire the status and dignity of viable and responsive peoples bodies due
to a number of reasons including absence of regular elections, prolonged
supersessions, insufficient representation of weaker sections like Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women, inadequate devolution of powers and  
lack of financial resources.
</p><p id="p_33">    2. <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_48">Article 40</a> of the Constitution which enshrines one of the directive
principles of State Policy lays down that the State shall take steps to
organise Village Panchayats and endow them with such powers and   
authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-
government. In the light of the experience in the last forty years and in view
of the shortcomings which have been observed, it is considered that there is
an imperative need to enshrine in the Constitution certain basic and
essential  features of Panchayati Raj institutions to impart certainty,
continuity and strength to them.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      Likewise the speech made by the mover of the Bill,
explaining the reason for its introduction, can be referred to for the
purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied by the
legislation, and the object and purpose for which the legislation
was enacted. (<a href="/doc/611866/" id="a_49">Doypack Systems (P) Ltd. v. Union of India</a> ; and
<a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_50">K.P. Varghese v. ITO</a> ). Reference can usefully be made, in this
context, to the Lok Sabha debate, dated 1st December 1992, 
wherein it was stated:
</p><p id="p_35">       "..At a broad level, we are seeking to provide a Constitutional
guarantee to certain basic and essential features including regular
elections to Panchayat Raj Institutions, representations in these bodies for
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Women and devolution of financial 
and administrative powers with the co-operation of the States. I would now
like to dwell briefly on some of the basic features of the Constitution
Amendment   
Bill as reported by the Joint Committee and the rationale behind them.
</p><p id="p_36">       The Gram Sabha, which is the foundation of our Panchayati Raj System,
has been envisaged to discharge wider duties. It shall perform such functions
and exercise such powers as may be entrusted to it by the State Legislatures.
There should be participatory decision making and the structure at the village
level should be the image of participatory democracy. It is in this light that
we 
have given a central place to the Gram Sabha. It has been our endeavour that
uniformity and rigidity is not imposed on the States. Therefore, whereas the
Bill
envisages a three tier system of Panchayat Raj at the village, intermediate and
district level, small States having a population not exceeding twenty lakhs have
been given the option not to constitute the Panchayat at the intermediate level
While we have agreed with the three tier structure recommended by the Joint
Committee, we have provided an option for smaller States, on the same lines as
in the very first Constitution Amendment Bill of 1989 on this subject. I hope
the
House will agree with our views"     
</p><p id="p_37">       .Keeping the spirit of this amendment and retaining the core
items contained in it, the State Governments are at liberty to enact their own
laws to provide for a strong Panchayat Raj set up within their States. We will
also evolve suitable guidelines in this regard to assist the State Governments
in
undertaking comprehensive legislation in this regard, if they so desire. We
reiterate our commitment to genuine democratic decentralization. We reaffirm
our commitment to the emergency of democratic bodies at the grass-root
level elected on the basis of equality and justice, truly representative of
people and genuinely concerned with their development.
</p><p id="p_38">       Before concluding, I wish to emphasise that this Constitution
Amendment Bill is only the beginning and represents our earnestness in
this endeavour. Gandhiji had said:
</p><p id="p_39">       "Independence must begin at the bottom. Thus every village will be
a Republic or Panchayat having full powers."
</p><p id="p_40">       This must be our goal and I seek the cooperation of all sections of
the House in achieving it.   
</p><p id="p_41">      Later in the Rajya Sabha, on 23rd December 1992, it was
stated:
</p><p id="p_42">       "Sir, as we know, the idea of the Bills is that there should be
participation of people at the grass-root level in the development and in
the administrative processes of the country  
       Even during the British period we had the system throughout 
the country. The Panchayats, the Municipalities and the Zilla Parishads were the
primary centers of administrative system in our country. The Constitution of
India in the Directive Principles of State Policy has referred to
organizations of Village Panchayats under <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_51">Article 40</a> and has stipulated
that the Panchayats' self-Government should be strong in this country. Yet
in free India, the Panchayats and the Municipalities gradually have become
weaker and weaker. "Panchas" means the collective wisdom of common    
men for the good of all. Gandhiji, the Father of the Nation, used to talk
about Gram Swaraj as the composite, self-sufficient and self-reliant village.
He said; "My idea of Village Swaraj is that it is a complete republic,
independent of its neighbours. Every village will grow its crop and cotton
for its clothes. It shall have a reserve of its cattle, a recreation place and a
play-ground. The village will maintain a village theatre, a school, a public
hall. It will have its own water supply. This can be done through control
over wells and tanks. As far as possible, every activity will be conducted in
a co-operative basis. There will be no caste system." This was his dream of
the Gram Swaraj. Had we followed it today India would have seen a
different composite culture, emanating from the grass-root level.."
(Ranga Reddy District Sarpanchas Association34). 
</p><p id="p_43">        The Constitution (Seventy-third) Amendment Act, 1992 was
enacted with a view to provide for democracy at the grass-root
level. (<a href="/doc/1072861/" id="a_52">Lalit Mohan Pandey v. Pooran Singh</a> ).  What was in a
nebulous state, as one of the directive principles under <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_53">Article 40</a>,
has, through the Seventy-third Constitutional Amendment,
metamorphosed into a distinct part of the Constitutional
dispensation with detailed provision for functioning of panchayats.
The main purpose behind this Amendment is to ensure democratic  
decentralisation on the Gandhian principle of participatory
democracy so that the panchayat may become viable and   
responsive peoples bodies as an institution of governance.  It may
thus acquire the necessary status, and function with dignity,
inspiring respect of the common man. The Seventy-third
Amendment of the Constitution was introduced to strengthen the
Preambular vision of democratic republicanism which is inherent
in the Constitutional framework.  (Bhanumati33).
</p><p id="p_44">      The Panchayat, which was previously a mere unit of self-
government under <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_54">Article 40</a>, became an institution of self-
governance under the Seventy-third Amendment of the 
Constitution.  It took four decades for the Parliament to pass this
epoch-making Seventy-third Constitution Amendmenta turning   
point in the history of local self-governance with sweeping
consequences in view of decentralisation, grass-root democracy,
peoples participation, gender equality and social justice.
Decentralisation is perceived as a precondition for preservation of
the basic values of a free society.  The Seventy-third Amendment is
a powerful tool of social engineering, and has the potential for
social transformation.  While this amendment may not see a
quantum jump, it will certainly pioneer a major change, albeit in a
painfully slow process. (Bhanumati33).
</p><p id="p_45">      Part IX of the Constitution of India relates to Panchayats.
<a href="/doc/1872315/" id="a_55">Article 243(d)</a> defines panchayat to mean an institution (by
whatever name called) of self-government constituted under <a href="/doc/1472158/" id="a_56">Article
243-B</a> for the rural areas. <a href="/doc/848879/" id="a_57">Article 243(e)</a> defines panchayat area to
mean the territorial area of a Panchayat.  <a href="/doc/1472158/" id="a_58">Article 243-B</a> stipulates
that there shall be constituted in every State, Panchayats at the
village, intermediate and district levels in accordance with the
provisions of Part IX.  <a href="/doc/1756813/" id="a_59">Article 243C(1)</a> provides that, subject to the
provisions of Part IX, the Legislature of a State may, by law, make
provisions with respect to the composition of Panchayats.  While
<a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_60">Article 40</a> envisaged village panchayats as units of self Government,
<a href="/doc/1872315/" id="a_61">Article 243(d)</a> elevated them to the status of institutions of self-
government.  Self-government is the process by which a group
exercises rule over themselves, without being controlled by outside
forces.  Self-government is a government of a group that is guided
by its own members.  <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_62">Article 3</a> of the European Charter of Local
Self-Government-Strasbourg 15 defines Local-Self Government to
denote the right and the ability of local authorities, within the
limits of the law, to regulate and manage a substantial share of
public affairs under their own responsibility and in the interests of
the local population. (Ranga Reddy District Sarpanches
Association34).
</p><p id="p_46">      <a href="/doc/186367556/" id="a_63">Section 2(17)</a>, of the Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act,
1994, (hereinafter called the 1994 Act) defines Gram Panchayat
to mean the body constituted for the local administration of a
village under the Act.  <a href="/doc/133902462/" id="a_64">Section 4</a> relates to the constitution of Gram
Panchayats for villages, and their incorporation.  Under sub-
section (1) thereof, a Gram Panchayat shall be deemed to have
been constituted for a village on the date of publication of the
notification under <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_65">Section 3</a> in respect of that village, and the
Special Officer, appointed under <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_66">Section 143(1)</a>, is required to
make arrangements for the election of the members and of the
Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat as provided in that Section.
<a href="/doc/6506719/" id="a_67">Section 4(2)</a> stipulates that, subject to the provisions of the Act,
the administration of the village shall vest in the Gram Panchayat,
but the Gram Panchayat shall not be entitled to exercise functions
expressly assigned by or under the Act or any other law on its
Sarpanch or executive authority or on any other local authority or
other authority.  Under <a href="/doc/47901864/" id="a_68">Section 4(3)</a>, every Gram Panchayat shall
be a body corporate by the name of the village specified in the
notification issued under <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_69">Section 3</a>; it shall have perpetual
succession and a common seal and, subject to any restriction or
qualification imposed by or under the Act or any other law, shall
be vested with the capacity of suing or being sued in its corporate
name, of acquiring, holding and transferring property, of entering
into contracts, and of doing all things necessary, proper or
expedient for the purposes for which it is constituted.  Panchayats
which were, hitherto, constituted merely as administrative units,
are now body corporates with perpetual succession and a common  
seal, with the capacity of suing or being sued in its corporate
name.  They are also vested with the capacity of acquiring, holding
and transferring property.  Having gone to such great lengths to
protect and safeguard panchayats, constituted as Institutions of self-
government and as body corporates, can the State Legislature be
said to have conferred power on the Executive to bring the
existence of gram panchayats to an end without rhyme or reason 
merely by way of a notification, and without even putting the
concerned gram panchayats on notice and giving them an  
opportunity of submitting their objections to the proposal in this
regard?  The answer can only be in the negative.

      UNDER SECTION 3(2) OF THE 1994 ACT, ARE

</p>
<p id="p_48">      <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_70">Section 3</a> of the 1994 Act relates to declaration of a village
for the purposes of the Act and, under sub-section (1) thereof, the
Government may, by notification and in accordance with the rules
made in this behalf, declare any revenue village or hamlet thereof
or any part of a Mandal to be a village for the purposes of the Act
and specify the name of the village.  <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_71">Section 3(2)</a> enables the
Government, by notification and in accordance with such rules as
may be prescribed in this behalf, to (a) form a new village by
separation of a local area from any village or by uniting two or
more villages or parts of villages or by uniting any local area to a
part of any village; (b) increase the local area of any village; (c)
diminish the local area of any village; (d) alter the boundaries of
any village; (e) alter the name of any village; and (f) cancel a
notification issued under sub-section (1). While a village
constituted under <a href="/doc/116657969/" id="a_72">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act would remain in
existence, albeit in a different form, even after the Government
exercises its powers under clauses (a) to (e) of <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_73">Section 3(2)</a>, the
village would cease to exist on the Government exercising its
powers, under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_74">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the Act, to cancel the notification,
issued earlier under <a href="/doc/116657969/" id="a_75">Section 3(1)</a>, constituting the village as a gram
panchayat for the purposes of the Act.
</p><p id="p_49">      Exercise of power by the government under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_76">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of
the Act, to cancel the notification issued earlier under <a href="/doc/116657969/" id="a_77">Section 3(1)</a>
of the Act, is subject to twin limitations.  The cancellation is to be
made by way of (1) a notification; and (2) in accordance with such
rules as may be prescribed in this behalf.  <a href="/doc/186367556/" id="a_78">Section 2(25)</a> of the
1994 Act defines Notification to mean a notification published in
the Andhra Pradesh Gazette and requires the word notified to be
construed accordingly.  <a href="/doc/186367556/" id="a_79">Section 2(30)</a> defines prescribed to mean
prescribed by the Government by rules made under the Act.  As is
evident from the use of the word and in <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_80">Section 3(2)</a>, the twin
limitations stipulated therein are not in the alternative.  The clear
intention of the Legislature, as expressed in the impugned Act read
as a whole, must be given effect to in reading the word "and" as
conjunctive or disjunctive.  (<a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_81">State of Bombay v. R.M.D.
Chamarbaugwala</a> ). Ordinarily, provisions separated by the use of
the conjunction `and' must be read conjointly. (<a href="/doc/1604860/" id="a_82">Hyderabad
Asbestos Cement Products v. Union of India</a> ).    Words in a
statute should be read conjuctively if it subserves the object of the
Act.  (<a href="/doc/1256540/" id="a_83">Paras Ram v. State of Haryana</a> ).  It would, therefore, not
suffice merely to issue a notification cancelling the earlier
notification issued under <a href="/doc/116657969/" id="a_84">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act.  The cancellation
is also to be made in accordance with the Rules prescribed in this
behalf i.e, the 2007 Rules.  Compliance with the procedure
prescribed in the 2007 Rules is, therefore, mandatory and not
directory.  Accepting the contention that it is merely directory
would mean that the very existence of an institution of self-
government under <a href="/doc/1872315/" id="a_85">Article 243(d)</a> of Part IX of the Constitution, and
a body corporate under <a href="/doc/47901864/" id="a_86">Section 4(3)</a> of the 1994 Act, can be
brought to an end by an executive fiat and on its mere whims and
fancies.
</p><p id="p_50">      Part IX of the Constitution seeks to control executive
interference and has entrusted the task of protecting the Gram
Panchayats - institutions of self-government - on the State
Legislature.  Under <a href="/doc/1419768/" id="a_87">Article 243G</a>, subject to the provisions of the
Constitution of India, the Legislature of a State may, by law, endow
the Panchayats with such powers and authority as may be  
necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self
government and such law may contain provisions for the
devolution of powers and responsibilities upon Panchayats, at the
appropriate level, subject to such conditions as may be specified
therein with respect to (a) the preparation of plans for economic
development and social justice; and (b) the implementation of
schemes for economic development and social justice as may be  
entrusted to them including those in relation to the matters listed
in the Eleventh Schedule.  The Eleventh Schedule, to the
Constitution of India, lists 29 matters in respect of which the State
Legislature may devolve powers and responsibilities on Panchayats
for implementation of schemes for economic development and 
social justice.  Out of 29 subjects in Schedule XI of the
Constitution, orders have been issued in respect of 17 subjects,
and monitoring and review functions in relation to these
programmes have been devolved on Panchayat Raj Institutions.

</p><p id="p_51">      The State Legislature has in turn, under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_88">Section 3(2)</a> of the
1994 Act, prescribed two conditions for bringing the existence of a
gram panchayat to an end.  If the State Legislature intended to
confer power on the Executive to do so merely by way of a
notification, it would neither have stipulated that they should act
in accordance with the Rules nor would it have used the word and
in <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_89">Section 3(2)</a>.  The legislative intent is clear.  The 2007 Rules,
including Rule 12(2) thereof, are mandatory in character and
necessitate strict adherence, notwithstanding that no penal
consequences are prescribed for its non-compliance.  The
government note file placed before this Court discloses that the
Principal Secretary approved the proposal, for upgradation of the
Dubbaka Gram Panchayat as a Nagar Panchayat duly merging the    
surrounding six gram panchayats, as all the gram panchayats had 
passed resolutions accepting the upgradation proposals, on
24.01.2013; the Minister for Panchayat Raj approved the proposal
on 25.01.2013; the Minister for MA &amp; UD approved it on
30.01.2013; the Chief Minister approved it on the same day; and
after the draft G.Os were approved by the Law department, the
impugned notifications were issued.  No effort was made at any
stage to ascertain whether the requirements of the 2007 Rules was
complied with, or to ensure its compliance.

       RULES: THEIR SCOPE:

<p id="p_53">      In the exercise of the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_90">Section 3</a> (1)&amp;(2)
r/w. <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_91">Section 268(1)</a> of the 1994 Act, the Government of Andhra
Pradesh made the 2007 Rules.  Rule 2(iii) of the 2007 Rules
defines local area to mean any area comprised within the
jurisdiction of a Gram Panchayat, and to include any area not
previously included in any Gram Panchayat that may be declared 
to be or to form part of a Gram Panchayat.   Rule 10 of the 2007
Rules provides that, where a notification for the declaration of a
village has been issued by the Government, it shall be open to any
affected Gram Panchayat to prefer a revision petition to the
Government, through the Commissioner, within fifteen days from
the date of publication of such notification and the Government
may pass such orders thereon as they may deem fit.  Rule 12(1)(i)
enables the Government to cancel a notification, under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_92">Section 3(2)</a>

before issuing a notification
under clause (f) of sub-section
(2) of <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_95">section 3</a> of the Act, give to

<p id="p_62">      As in Rule 12(2), a similar opportunity to show cause against
the proposal, made under clauses (a) to (e) of <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_96">Section 3(2)</a> of the
1994 Act, is provided for under Rule 9 of the 2007 Rules.  While
Rule 9 has two provisos, Rule 12(2) has only one.  A proviso has
several functions and, while interpreting a statutory provision, the
court is required to carefully scrutinise and find out the real object
of the proviso appended to that provision. A provision and the
proviso thereto must be construed as a whole. A proviso is
normally used to remove special cases from the general enactment 
and provide for them specially.  A proviso qualifies the generality of
the main enactment by providing an exception and taking out from
the main provision a portion which, but for the proviso, would be a
part of the main provision. A proviso must, therefore, be
considered in relation to the principal matter to which it stands as
a proviso.  A proviso cannot be torn apart from the main Section
nor can it be used to nullify or set at naught the real object of the
main Section. (<a href="/doc/969224/" id="a_97">S. Sundaram Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman</a> ;
Craies: Statute Law 7th Edn.). A proviso must be construed
harmoniously with the main enactment. (<a href="/doc/807985/" id="a_98">Abdul Jabar Butt v.
State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir</a> ; <a href="/doc/134612/" id="a_99">CIT v. Indo Mercantile Bank
Ltd</a>. ; <a href="/doc/506242/" id="a_100">Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of
Sales Tax</a> ; and <a href="/doc/1659123/" id="a_101">State of Punjab v. Kailash Nath</a> ).
</p>
<p id="p_63">      The proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a
case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the
main enactment. (<a href="/doc/361854/" id="a_102">Madras &amp; Southern Mahratta Railway   
Company Ltd. v. Bezwada Municipality</a> ; <a href="/doc/1706953/" id="a_103">Holani Auto Links (P)
Ltd. v. State of M.P</a>. ; Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd.48; <a href="/doc/1375346/" id="a_104">A.N. Sehgal
v. Raje Ram Sheoran</a> ).  A proviso is a qualification of the
preceding provision, and is not to be interpreted as stating a
general rule. (<a href="/doc/73830580/" id="a_105">Haryana State Coop. Land Development Bank Ltd. 
v. Banks Employees Union</a> ; <a href="/doc/544776/" id="a_106">Shah Bhojraj Kuverji Oil Mills
and Ginning Factory v. Subhash Chandra Yograj Sinha</a> ; 
<a href="/doc/109918/" id="a_107">Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd. v. Corpn. of Calcutt</a> ; A.N.

Tribunal</a>  and <a href="/doc/27395/" id="a_109">Kerala State Housing Board v. Ramapriya
Hotels (P) Ltd</a> ).  A proviso, to a particular provision of a statute,
only embraces the field which is covered by the said provision. It
carves out an exception to the provision to which it has been
enacted as a proviso, and to no other. (Indo-Mercantile Bank
Ltd.,48; A.N. Sehgal53; Tribhovandas Haribhai Tamboli57;
Ramapriya Hotels (P) Ltd.58; Binani Industries Ltd. v. CCT ;
Bezwada Municipality51; <a href="/doc/718562/" id="a_110">Nagar Palika Nigam v. Krishi Upaj
Mandi Samiti</a> ; Ram Narain Sons Ltd.49).   The ordinary and
proper function of a proviso, coming after a general enactment, is
to limit that general enactment in certain instances.  (Jennings v.
Kelly ; Binani Industries Ltd.59).   As a general rule, in
construing an enactment containing a proviso, it is proper to
construe the provisions together without making either of them
redundant or otiose.   (<a href="/doc/1754826/" id="a_111">J.K. Industries Ltd. v. Chief Inspector of
Factories &amp; Boilers</a> ). It would not be a reasonable construction
of any statute to say that a proviso, which in terms purports to
create an exception, should be held to be otiose. (<a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_112">Durga Dutt
Sharma v. N.P. Laboratories</a> ).  A sincere attempt should be
made to reconcile the enacting clause and the proviso and to avoid
repugnancy between the two. (<a href="/doc/56195/" id="a_113">Tahsildar Singh v. State of U.P</a>. ).
</p><p id="p_64">      Both Rules 9 and 12(2) of the 2007 Rules require the
government, before issuing a notification under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_114">Section 3(2)</a> of the
1994 Act, to give the gram panchayat, which will be effected by the
issue of such notification, an opportunity of showing cause against
the proposal, to indicate its decision within ten days from the date
of receipt of the show cause notice, and consider the objections, if
any, of such gram panchayat.  The first proviso to Rule 9 carves
out an exception to the main provision (Rule 9) and provides for a
situation where there is no elected body of the Gram Panchayat in
office, and a special officer has been appointed to exercise the
powers and perform the functions of the Gram Panchayat and its
sarpanch and Executive authority.  Rule 12(2) does not contain
any provision similar to the first proviso to Rule 9.  The second
proviso to Rule 9 is similar to the proviso to Rule 12(2), except
that, while the latter only uses the words gram panchayat, the
former uses both the words gram panchayat and Special Officer.
This distinction is significant. While Rule 9 requires the
government to give the affected gram panchayat an opportunity to
show cause, the first proviso thereto requires the notice, to show
cause against the proposal, to be given to the Special Officer where
a Special Officer has been appointed to exercise the powers and
perform the fucntions of the gram panchayat and its Sarpanch and
Executive Authority.  A special officer is appointed under <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_115">Section
143</a> only in the absence of an elected body of the Gram Panchayat.
<a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_116">Section 143(1)</a> stipulates that, notwithstanding anything in the
Act, when a local area is notified as a village under <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_117">Section 3</a>, for
the first time, the commissioner shall appoint a special officer to
exercise the powers and perform the functions of the gram
panchayat, and its sarpanch and executive authority, until the
members and sarpanch thereof, who are duly elected, assume  
office.   <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_118">Section 143(2)</a> requires the special officer to cause
arrangements for the election of the member of the gram
panchayat, to be made before such date as may be fixed by the 
Commissioner in this behalf.  Under the proviso thereto the
Commissioner may, from time to time, postpone the date so fixed
if, for any reason, the elections cannot be completed before such
date.  Under <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_119">Section 143(3)</a> the Government, or as the case may be
an officer authorised by the Government, shall appoint a special
officer or a person-in-charge or a committee of persons-in-charge
to a gram panchayat if, for any reason, the process of election to
such gram panchayat is not completed.   Under <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_120">Section 143(4)</a> the
special officer or person-in-charge or the Committee of persons-in-
charge, appointed under sub-section (3), shall exercise the powers
and perform the functions of the Gram Panchayat and its
Sarpanch and executive authority until the members and
Sarpanch elected thereof assume office.  <a href="/doc/186367556/" id="a_121">Section 2(12)</a> of the 1994
Act defines executive authority to mean the Panchayat Secretary
appointed to each Gram Panchayat.  <a href="/doc/186367556/" id="a_122">Section 2(37)</a> defines 
sarpanch to mean the Sarpanch of a Gram Panchayat elected  
under <a href="/doc/103973376/" id="a_123">Section 14</a>.  Under <a href="/doc/66560386/" id="a_124">Section 14(1)</a>, there shall be a Sarpanch,
for every gram panchayat, who shall be elected in the prescribed
manner by the persons, whose names appear in the electoral roll
for the gram panchayat, from among themselves.  <a href="/doc/22659133/" id="a_125">Section 7</a> relates
to the total strength of a Gram Panchayat.  Under <a href="/doc/42702148/" id="a_126">Section 7(1)</a> a
Gram Panchayat shall consist of such number of elected members,  
inclusive of its Sarpanch, as may be notified, from time to time, by
the Commissioner in accordance with the table referred to therein.
Under <a href="/doc/57454754/" id="a_127">Section 7(2)</a>, an M.P.T.C. Member is a permanent invitee to
the meetings of Gram Panchayats, but would not be entitled to
vote at any such meeting. Under <a href="/doc/97389677/" id="a_128">Section 7(3)</a> one representative
from each category of Self Help Groups/Functional Groups, to be
elected in a meeting of the Self Help Group/Functional Group
which shall be presided over by the Sarpanch, shall be co-opted in
the manner prescribed, and shall have the right to speak or
otherwise to take part in proceedings of any meeting but they shall
not be entitled to vote at any such meeting. The power which the
special officers are empowered, under <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_129">Section 143(3)</a>, to discharge
are only till the members of the gram panchayat, and the sarpanch
elected thereof, assume office.

delegated to him by the Government under G.O.Ms.No.269 PR &amp;    
RD (Election &amp; Rules) Department dated 22.08.2011, issued 
proceedings No.2142/2011/A1-Pts., dated 22.08.2011 appointing 
Special Officers to the Gram Panchayats in Medak district as
shown in the annexure appended to the said proceedings.  With
respect to these 7 villages, the officers appointed were in the cadre
of: 1) Dubbaka- M.P.D.O; 2) Dharmajipet  M.P.D.O; 3) Latchapet 
</p><p id="p_66">- E.O. (PR&amp;RD); 4) Chervapur  M.P.D.O; 5) Dampalapalli  M.A.O; 
</p><p id="p_67">6) Chellapur  E.O. (PR&amp;RD); and 7) Mallaipalli  M.P.D.O.  The
duties which these Special Officers were empowered to perform,
under <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_130">Section 143(4)</a> of the Act, were the functions of the gram
panchayat and its sarpanch and executive authority. Where an
elected gram panchayat is not in office, the representation which
the Special Officer is empowered to make against the proposal,
under the first proviso to Rule 9, is only after taking into
consideration the views expressed by the members of the gram 
sabha at a special meeting convened for the purpose.  While Rules
9 and 12(2) empower the Gram panchayat to indicate its decision
and submit its objections to the Government, the first proviso to
Rule 9 enables the Special Officer to submit his representation.
This power conferred on the Special Officer to submit a
representation is also fettered by the requirement of taking into
consideration the views expressed by the members of the Gram 
sabha.  The Rule making authority was conscious of the possibility
of Special Officers, who are government servants, readily accepting
the proposal of the Government to denotify gram panchayat and
terminate its very existence. Bearing in mind that gram panchayats
are institutions of self-government, the Rule making authority has
cast an obligation on the Special Officer, who holds office only in
the absence of the elected body of the gram panchayat, to ascertain
and take into consideration the views of the gram sabha.

<p id="p_68">(e). TWO DIFFERENT WORDS, USED IN STATUTORY RULES,            
       MUST BE CONSTRUED AS CARRYING DIFFERENT          
       MEANINGS: 
</p>
<p id="p_69">      The absence of a proviso, similar to the first proviso to Rule
9, in Rule 12(2) of the Rules is also significant.   When two
different words are used by the same statute, one has to construe
these different words as carrying different meanings. (<a href="/doc/1187237/" id="a_131">Kailash
Nath Agarwal v. Pradeshiya Industrial &amp; Investment Corpn. of
U.P. Ltd</a>., ).  Different use of words in two provisions of a statute,
or two different Articles in the Constitution, is for a purpose.  If the
field of the two provisions/Articles were to be the same, the same
words would have been used. (<a href="/doc/243782/" id="a_132">B.R. Enterprises v. State of
U.P</a>., ).  When two words of different import are used in a statute
in two consecutive provisions, it would be difficult to maintain that
they are used in the same sense, and the conclusion must follow
that the two expressions have different connotations. (<a href="/doc/1553487/" id="a_133">Member,
Board of Revenue v. Arthur Paul Benthall</a> ).  When the
legislature has taken care of using different phrases in different
sections, normally different meaning is required to be assigned to
the language used by the legislature.  If, in relation to the same
subject-matter, different words of different import are used in the
same statute, there is a presumption that they are not used in the
same sense. (Arthur Paul Benthall67; <a href="/doc/190580/" id="a_134">Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.
v. Hansrajbhai V. Kodala</a> ).  If the legislative intention was not to
distinguish, and while stating Special Officer it was intended to
convey the idea of a gram panchayat, there would have been no
necessity of expressing the position differently.   When the
situation has been differently expressed the legislature must be
taken to have intended to express a different intention.  (<a href="/doc/756481/" id="a_135">CIT v.
East West Import and Export (P) Ltd</a>., ).  Use of both the words
gram panchayat and Special Officer, in both the provisos to Rule 9,
show that the words Special Officer was understood as distinct
from, and not to mean, the gram panchayat.
</p><p id="p_70">(f). NOSCITUR A SOCIIS:  
</p>
<p id="p_71">      Rule 9 is applicable only where a local area is excluded from
one village and included in another; or where two or more villages
or parts of villages are united; or where the boundaries of any
village are altered; or the name of any village is altered in
accordance with <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_136">Section 3(2)(a)</a> to (e) of the 1994 Act.  The said
Rule has no application where the very existence of the gram
panchayat is sought to be brought to an end by the Government in
the exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_137">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the 1994 Act.
The Special Officer is permitted, under the first proviso to Rule 9 of
the 2007 Rules, to submit a representation against the proposal
made by the government under clauses (a) to (e) of <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_138">Section 3(2)</a>,
only after taking into consideration the views of the gram sabha.
Unlike the first proviso to Rule 9, Rule 12(2) does not provide for a
representation to be made by a Special Officer.  It is a legitimate
rule of construction to construe words, in a statutory enactment or
Rules, with reference to words found in immediate connection with
them (M.K. Ranganathan36; Angus Robertson v. George Day ).   
In construing the words Gram Panchayat and Special Officer, which
are used in association with each other in Rule 9 and its two
provisos, the rule of construction noscitur a sociis may be applied.
The meaning of each of these words is to be understood by the
company it keeps.  These words, read in juxtaposition, indicate
that the meaning of one takes colour from the other. The Rule is
explained differently: that meaning of doubtful words may be
ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with
it. (<a href="/doc/494100/" id="a_139">Ahmedabad (P) Primary Teachers Assn. v. Administrative
Officer</a> ).  The setting and context in which both the words
Special Officer and gram panchayat are used in the two provisos to
Rule 9 of the 2007 Rules, would require the word Special Officer
not to be understood dissociated from the word Gram Panchayat,
and the word Special Officer not be read and construed to mean a
Gram Panchayat. (Ahmedabad (P) Primary Teachers Assn.71) for,  
if both these words were to mean the same, it would have sufficed
only to provide for one of these words and not both.  It is not a
sound principle of construction to brush aside words in a statute
as being inapposite surplusage, if they can have appropriate
application in circumstances conceivably within the contemplation
of the Statute. (<a href="/doc/350457/" id="a_140">Aswini Kumar Ghose v. Arabhinda Bose</a> ).
   Both Rules 9 and 12(2) of the 2007 Rules stipulate that only the
Gram Panchayat is entitled to indicate its decision and submit its
objections to the proposal of the Government under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_141">Section 3(2)</a> of
the 1994 Act.  The power conferred on the Special Officer, under
the first proviso to Rule 9, is confined only to make a
representation, and not to indicate his decision or to put forth his
objections.  As it is only the gram panchayat which is given the
opportunity to show cause against the proposal, to indicate its
decision and submit its objections, and not the Special Officer, it is
evident that the proposal to cancel the notification can be made,
and the power under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_142">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the 1994 Act exercised, by
the Government only where an elected gram panchayat holds  
office, and not when a Special Officer is appointed to discharge the
functions of the gram panchayat, its sarpanch and executive
authority, in the absence of the elected body of the gram
panchayat. 
</p><p id="p_72">      It is no doubt true that the Government discharges
administrative functions in making the proposal to cancel a
notification issued under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_143">Section 3</a> of the 1994
Act, and in cancelling such notification after considering the
objections raised by the concerned gram Panchayats to the said
proposal. (<a href="/doc/1348944/" id="a_144">K. Nagabhushanam v. Collector, Krishana District</a> ).
It is also true that the explanation submitted by the
Grampanchayat need not be considered extensively, for the reason
that the functions discharged by the Government, with regard to
conversion of Grampanchayat into the Municipality, are
administrative and are not quasi judicial; and, therefore,
authorities are not expected to give detailed reasons.  (<a href="/doc/201117/" id="a_145">Puttur
Gram Panchayat, Puttur v. Government of A.P</a>. ).  That does
not, however, mean that the Government can avoid complying with 
the mandatory requirements of Rule 12(2) of the 2007 Rules, and
cancel the earlier notification, whereby the gram panchayats were
constituted, without putting the gram panchayats on notice of
such proposal, and without giving them an opportunity to show
cause against the proposal by indicating their decision and
submitting their objections thereto.
</p><p id="p_73">      On the question whether or not the impugned notification
was issued in conformity with the procedure prescribed under Rule
12 of the A.P. Gram Panchayat (Declaration of Villages) Rules,
1994 this Court, in Sambari Prabhakar9, held that, in the case on
hand, the Gram Panchayat had itself passed a unanimous  
resolution for upgrading the said Gram Panchayat into a
Municipality; on the basis of the said resolution, the District
Collector had requested the Government to take necessary action
to upgrade the Gram Panchayat into a Municipality; the impugned
notifications were accordingly issued; Rule 12, of the Rules made
under G.O.Ms.No.515, dated 17-09-1994 in the exercise of the
powers conferred by sub-Sections (1) &amp; (2) of <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_146">Section 3</a> read with
<a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_147">Section 268</a> of the Act, required that, before issuing a notification
under clause (f) of Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_148">Section 3</a> of the Act, the Gram
Panchayat, which will be affected by issue of such a notification,
shall be given an opportunity of showing cause against the
proposal to indicate its decision; however, in the light of the
unanimous resolution passed by the Gram Panchayat for  
upgradation of the Gram Panchayat into a Municipality much prior
to the impugned notifications, issuance of a notice under Rule 12
could not be held to be mandatory; failure to issue such a notice
did not vitiate the impugned action; under G.O.Ms.No.515 dated
17-09-1994 the Government is also vested with the power to relax
the rules contained in the said order; and the impugned
notification cannot be held to be in violation of principles of
natural justice or as contrary to Rule 12 of the Rules.
</p><p id="p_74">      Unlike in Sambari Prabhakar9, where the gram panchayat
had passed a unanimous resolution, in the case on hand no such 
resolution was passed as there was no elected body of the Gram 
Panchayats holding office.  Except in the case of Dubbaka Gram
Panchayats, none of the Special Officers of the other gram
panchayats have even passed any resolution for denotification of
the gram panchaayt or for its constitution as a Nagar panchayat.
Reliance placed, on Sambari Prabhakar9, by Sri B. Mahender 
Reddy, Learned Counsel for respondents 8 to 11, is therefore
misplaced.   It is wholly unnecessary for this Court to examine
whether the Government can relax the Rules to such an extent as
to avoid complying with the procedural requirement of Rule 12(2),
as it is not even the case of the respondents that the Government

      THE 2007 RULES IS MANDATORY:     
</p>
<p id="p_76">      Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules is a regulatory provision and must
be construed having regard to the purpose it seeks to achieve.
(<a href="/doc/1119469/" id="a_149">DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust v. 
State of Haryana</a> ).     In interpreting a statute the court has to
ascertain the will and policy of the legislature as discernible from
the object and scheme of the enactment and the language used 
therein. (Chern Taong Shang37).  The fairest and most rational
method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his
intention at the time when the law was made, by signs most
natural and probable. And these signs are the words, the context,
the subject matter, the effect and consequence, or the spirit and
reason of the law. (Blackstone Commentaries on the Laws of
England (Facsimile of 1st edn. 1765, University of Chicago
Press 1979 Vol. 1 at 59; Doypack Systems (P) Ltd.40).   Rule
12(2) of the 2007 Rules uses the word shall.  The word shall, in
its ordinary significance, is obligatory or mandatory and the court
shall, ordinarily, give that interpretation to that term unless such
an interpretation leads to some absurd or inconvenient
consequence, or be at variance with the intent of the Legislature.
(Govindlal Chhaganlal Patel21; <a href="/doc/212063/" id="a_150">Khub Chand v. State of
Rajasthan</a> ; Babu Ram Upadhya23).  The requirement of giving 
the gram panchayats, which would be effected by the issue of the
notification under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_151">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the Act, an opportunity of
showing cause against the proposal and to indicate the  ir decision
within a period of ten days, is therefore mandatory and failure to
comply with this mandatory requirement would render the
notification, issued under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_152">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the Act, illegal.
</p><p id="p_77"> (h). A DECISION RENDERED PER INCURIAM IS NOT A         
        BINDING PRECEDENT:   
</p>
<p id="p_78">      <a href="/doc/99013458/" id="a_153">In Vaddepalli Narsimhulu v. The Government of A.P</a> ,
this Court held:
</p><p id="p_79">       .No statutory provision  plenary or subordinate  has been
brought to the notice of this Court which requires the Government to issue
a show-cause notice, under Rule 12(2) of the Rules, only to the elected
body of a gram panchayat; and not to the Special Officers, appointed for
such gram panchayats, in the place of the elected body.  It is evident,
therefore, that the requirement of Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules has not been
violated by the respondents in issuing the impugned notification, under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_154">Section
3(2)(f)</a> of the 1994 Act, to cancel the notifications issued earlier constituting
them as gram Panchayats so that they can, thereafter, be constituted as a
Municipality (Nagar panchayat)  (emphasis supplied)    

      In so holding, this Court failed to notice the distinction
between the provisos to Rule 9 and Rule 12(2); unlike the first
proviso to Rule 9 which provides for a situation where an elected
body of the Gram Panchayat is not in office, Rule 12(2) does not;
and, consequently, the requirement of giving an opportunity to
show cause, indicate its decision regarding the proposal and
submit their objections thereto, is only to the elected body of the
gram panchayat and not its special officer.
</p><p id="p_80">      A precedent ceases to be a binding precedent when it is
rendered per incuriam. (<a href="/doc/1933586/" id="a_155">Commissioner of Income-tax v. B.R.
Constructions</a> ).  The Latin expression per incuriam means
through inadvertence. (<a href="/doc/67608/" id="a_156">Punjab Land Development and 
Reclamation Corporation Ltd., Chandighar v. Presiding Officer,
Labour</a> Court, Chandighar ). Incuria literally means
carelessness. In practice per incuriam appears to mean per
ignoratium. English courts have developed this principle in
relaxation of the rule of stare decisis. The quotable in law is
avoided and ignored if it is rendered in ignoratium of a statute or
other binding authority. (Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd ).
This principle has been accepted, approved and adopted by the
Supreme Court while interpreting <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_157">Article 141</a> of the Constitution of
India which embodies the doctrine of precedents as a matter of
law. (<a href="/doc/1488034/" id="a_158">State of U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd</a>. ). A
decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given
in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force
of a statute. A judgment delivered without argument and without
reference to the relevant statutory provisions is not binding.
(<a href="/doc/327169/" id="a_159">Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Gurnam Kaur</a> ).   Where, by
obvious inadvertence or oversight, a judgment fails to notice a
plain statutory provision or obligatory authority running counter to
the reasoning and result reached, it may not have the sway of a
binding precedent. (<a href="/doc/538289/" id="a_160">Mamleshwar v. Kanahaiya Lal</a> ; Morelle v.
Wakeling ). The judgment of this Court, in Vaddepalli
Narsimhlu77, to the extent it held that no statutory provision 
plenary or subordinate  had been brought to its notice which
required the Government to issue the show-cause notice, under
Rule 12(2) of the Rules, only to the elected body of the gram
panchayats, and not the special officer appointed for such gram
panchayats in the place of the elected body, is a decision rendered
per incuriam.

case in regard to the construction of <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_162">Section 80-M</a> must be held to
be erroneous and it must be corrected. In Hotel Balaji v. State of
A.P. , S. Ranganathan, J had no hesitation in accepting the point
of view, presented before the Supreme Court which appealed to
him as more realistic, appropriate and preferable, particularly
when he saw that the view one way or the other would affect the
validity of a large number of similar legislations all over India,
merely because it may not be consistent with the view he took in
Good year <a href="/doc/762574/" id="a_163">India Ltd. v. State of Haryana</a> , as consistency, for

Andhra Pradesh made the rules relating to the holding of meetings
of the Gram Sabha.  These Rules were notified in G.O.Ms.No.162 
Panchayat Raj and Rural Development (Pts.I) Department, dated 
04.04.1997 (hereinafter called the 1997 Rules).  Rule 1 stipulates
that the two common dates namely, the 14th April and 3rd October
in a year shall be fixed for the conduct of Gram Sabha meetings;
the Divisional Panchayat Officer shall prepare a common list of
Officers, by consulting the Mandal Praja Parishad Development
Officers and Mandal Revenue Officers in his jurisdiction, and allot
such Officers, available in the Division, to attend the Gram Sabhas
in all Gram Panchayats; and the action of the Divisional Panchayat
Officer (allotment of officers) should be over by the 7th of April and
25th of September every year.  Rule 2 stipulates that the gram
sabha meeting shall be held at such place, within the limits of the
Gram Panchayat, as considered convenient and sufficient to
accommodate the members of the Gram Sabha; and meetings of     
the Gram Sabha may be held in rotation in each of the constituent
villages of the Gram Panchayats.  Rule 3 stipulates that the
meeting may be held at any time during the day between sunrise
and sunset. Under Rule 4(1) no meeting shall be held unless notice
of the place where, and of the day and time when, the meeting is to
be held and of the business to be transacted thereat, has been
given at least two clear days before the day of the meeting.    Rule
4(2) stipulates that the notice, referred to in sub-rule (1), shall be
given (i) by beat of drum in the village; (ii) by affixing the notice at
three conspicuous places in the village; and (iii) by affixing the
notice on the notice board of the Gram Panchayat Office.  Under
Rule 6 all questions which may come up before such meeting shall
be decided by ascertaining the consensus of opinion of the
members of the Gram Sabha present at the meeting through the  
speeches delivered by them; at the end of meeting, the presiding
member is required to read the proceedings of the Gram Sabha,
and get the approval of the members; and the members are 
required to raise their hands in token of their approval.  Rule 7
stipulates that the meeting of the Gram Sabha may be adjourned if
the members present thereat agree to it.  Rule 9 requires an
attendance register to be maintained in which the presiding
member shall obtain the signatures or thumb impressions, as the
case may be, of all the members present at the meeting of the
Gram Sabha.  Rule 11 requires the minutes of the proceedings of
every meeting to be drawn up and entered in a book to be kept for
the purpose, and to be signed by the presiding member of the
meeting; and the suggestions, if any, of the meeting are required to
be reported by the presiding member to the Gram Panchayat at its
next meeting for its due consideration.  Rule 12 stipulates that, in
addition to the matters listed under clauses (i) to (v) of <a href="/doc/69814808/" id="a_180">Section 6(3)</a>
of the 1994 Act, the following matters shall also be placed before
the Gram Sabha for its consideration, viz., i) the village agricultural
production plans; ii) the work of village volunteer force; iii) the
work of Defence Labour Banks; iv) the utilisation of land funds; v)
the work of Co-operatives; vi) the list of the location of the common
lands in villages i.e, Porambokes vesting in Panchayats and other
relevant particulars; vii) the list of transfer of ownership of houses
and other immovable properties; viii) a copy of the approved budget
estimates of the Gram Panchayat, and x) a list of defaulters, who
are in arrears of payment of taxes and fees due to the Gram
Panchayat.  Rule 13(i) requires the executive authority to maintain
two bound registers one for writing meeting notice-cum-agenda
and minutes and another for Attendance of the members at 
meeting.  Rule 13(ii) stipulates that, besides giving advance notice
about the meeting and its agenda, the agenda copy shall also be
distributed to all the members present in the meeting before the
start of the meeting.
</p><p id="p_89">      Registers of the seven Gram Panchayats, containing the
gram sabha resolutions allegedly passed by each of these gram 
panchayats, have been placed before this Court. The Register
containing the gram sabha resolutions of Lachapet Gram 
panchayat discloses that a gram sabha was convened on  
02.11.2012 at 10.30 A.M. on the oral directions of the MPDO,
Dubbaka; and the gram sabha of Lachapet Gram Panchayat    
resolved to reject the proposal, to merge Lachapet Gram panchayat
with the Dubbaka Gram Panchayat for its constitution as a
Municipality, as they would be denied the benefits of the National
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, and as there would be an    
increase in water tax, house tax, prescribed fee for construction of
new buildings etc.  This gram sabha resolution was signed by 36
members and was attested by the Special Officer and Executive 
Officer of Lachapet gram panchayat.
</p><p id="p_90">      The aforesaid Register contains a subsequent resolution
allegedly passed by the gram sabha of Lachapet Gram panchayat  
in a meeting held, in the office of the Gram panchayat, in the after-
noon of 02.11.2012.  The minutes of the said meeting records that
some members of the gram sabha had earlier resolved to reject the
proposal to merge Lachapet gram panchayat with Dubbaka gram   
panchayat for being constituted as a Municipality; thereafter, in
the after-noon of 02.11.2012, certain villagers of Lachapet gram
panchayat had come to the office of the Mandal Praja Parishad;
they had requested that the Lachapet Gram panchayat be merged   
with Dubbaka gram panchayat for being constituted as the
Dubbaka Municipality; a gram sabha meeting was, therefore,
convened on 02.11.2012 at the Lachapet Gram panchayat office 
under the supervision of the Special Officer; it was unanimously
resolved by the gram sabha to merge Lachapet gram panchayat  
with Dubbaka gram panchayat for its constitution as a
Municipality; and to request that the benefits of the National Rural
Employment Guarantee scheme be continued.  This resolution,  
which contains the signatures of 75 members, was also attested by
the Special Officer and the Executive Officer of Lachapet Gram
Panchayat.  As noted hereinabove, Rule 7 enables a gram sabha  
meeting to be adjourned if the members present thereat agree to it.
While the earlier meeting of the gram sabha, held at 10.30 AM on
02.11.2012, resolved to reject the proposal, there is no material on
record to show that they had agreed to re-convene in the afternoon
of the same day.  No notices, as stipulated in Rules 4(1) &amp; (2), for
convening the meetings of the gram sabhas has been placed before 
this Court, much less details of the manner of its affixture.  None
of the attendance registers, of the meetings of the gram sabhas of
any of the seven gram panchayats as required to be maintained
under Rule 7, has been placed before this Court.  While Registers
containing the alleged minutes of the meetings of the seven gram
sabhas have been produced, these Registers make no reference to 
any notice or agenda.  These Registers do not satisfy the
requirement of Rule 13(i) of the 1997 Rules.  Agenda copies,
required to be distributed to the members present at the gram
sabhas in terms of Rule 13(ii), have also not been placed before
this Court.
</p><p id="p_91">      The gram sabha resolution register of Mallaipally gram
panchayat contains only the resolution of the gram sabha dated
02.11.2012, the signatures of eight members of the gram sabha,
and the left thumb impressions of five others.  The said Register
does not contain any other resolution either before 02.11.2012 or
thereafter.  Even worse are the Registers, containing the gram
sabha resolutions, of Dumpalapally, Chellapur, Dharmajipet and
Chervapur gram panchayats.  Each of the registers, of these four
gram panchayats, contain only the resolution of the gram sabha
dated 02.11.2012.  Except for this resolution, the Registers make
no reference to any resolution of the gram sabha passed either
prior thereto or thereafter.  Even more disconcerting is that the
gram sabha resolutions dated 02.11.2012, allegedly passed by the
villagers of these four gram panchayats, bear only the signature of
the Special Officers and the Panchayat Secretaries of these gram
panchayats, and do not contain the signature of even one member 
of the respective gramsabhas.
</p>
<p id="p_92">      The Dubbaka gram panchayat resolution dated 02.11.2012,
for conversion of Dubbaka Gram Panchayat into a Municipality, is
signed by the Special Officer and Panchayat Secretary of the said
panchayat.  While the gram sabha minutes book of Dubbaka gram   
panchayat contains certain resolutions of the gram sabhas prior to
02.11.2012 also, the resolution of the gram sabha dated
02.11.2012 merely bears the signatures of the Executive Officer
and the Special Officer of Dubbaka Gram panchayat.  None of the
members of the gram sabha, of Dubbaka Gram Panchayat, have    
signed on the resolution allegedly passed by the gram sabha of
Dubbaka Gram panchayat on 02.11.2012 for its merger with other 
gram panchayats, and for its constitution as a Municipality.  I find
considerable force in the submission of Sri K.S.Murthy, Learned
Counsel for the petitioners, that these records have now been
created only for the purpose of this Writ Petition, and to justify the
illegal and arbitrary acts of the respondent in denotifying the seven
gram panchayats in flagrant violation of the statutory rules.
</p><p id="p_93">      Sri B.Mahendar Reddy, Learned Counsel for respondents 8
to 11, would submit that, as the Special Officers have attested the
gram sabha resolutions, it is evident that they were aware of the
gram sabha resolutions; and, as they did not choose to submit
their representation to the Government, it must be presumed that
they had no objection to the denotification of the gram panchayats.
This contention needs only to be noted to be rejected.  While Rule
12(2) requires only the elected body of the gram panchayats to be
informed of the proposal, to convey their decision and submit their
objections, if any, and not for the consent of the Gram Sabha,
reference is being made herein to some of the Gram Sabha 
Resolution Registers, which are, obviously, cooked up, only to
highlight the desperate attempts of the respondents to cover up
their illegal acts.  The requirement of Rule 12(2) is to put the gram
panchayats on notice of the proposals, asking them to show cause 
there-against.  The gram panchayats are entitled to convey their
decision, and submit their objections thereto.  Silence of the
Special Officers, or their failure to submit a representation, would
not render the impugned G.Os valid more so as Rule 12(2) neither
provides for a representation to be submitted by the Special officer
nor does it require the views of the gram sabhas to be ascertained.
III. FAILURE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE            
      REQUIREMENT OF RULE 12(2) OF THE 2007 RULES         
      WOULD THIS COURT BE JUSTIFIED IN EXERCISING       
      RESTRAINT ON APPLICATION OF THE TEST OF ABSENCE           
      OF PREJUDICE?  
</p>
<p id="p_94">      Sri B. Mahender Reddy, Learned Counsel for respondents 8
to 11, would submit that mere violation of principles of natural
justice is not sufficient to interfere with the action taken, unless
the petitioners show prejudice having been caused to them as a
result of the alleged violation. Learned counsel would rely on
<a href="/doc/198387/" id="a_181">Aligarh Muslim University v. Mansoor Ali Khan</a> ; <a href="/doc/1246653/" id="a_182">ECIL v. B.
Karunakar</a> ; and <a href="/doc/187806921/" id="a_183">Burdwan Central Cooperative Bank Ltd., v.
Asim Chatterjee</a>  in this regard.
</p><p id="p_95">      Where no prejudice is caused to the person concerned,
interference under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_184">Article 226</a> is not necessary. (Aligarh Muslim
University92; <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_185">M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a> ). The theory of
reasonable opportunity and the principles of natural justice have
been evolved to uphold the rule of law and to assist the individual
to vindicate his just rights. They are not incantations to be invoked
nor rites to be performed on all and sundry occasions. Whether, in
fact, prejudice has been caused on account of the denial of
reasonable opportunity has to be considered on the facts and
circumstances of each case. Where, even after compliance with 
principles of natural justice, no different consequence would have
followed, it would be a perversion of justice to set aside the order.
It amounts to stretching the  concept of justice to illogical and
exasperating limits. It also amounts to an unnatural expansion of
natural justice which, in itself, is antithetical to justice. (B.
Karunakar93; Asim Chatterjee94). It is not possible to lay down
rigid rules as to when the principles of natural justice are to apply,
nor as to their scope and extent. There must also have been some
real prejudice to the complainant. There is no such thing as a
merely technical infringement of natural justice. The requirements
of natural justice must depend on the facts and  circumstances of
the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the
tribunal is acting, the subject-matter to be dealt with, and so forth.
(Aligarh Muslim University92; <a href="/doc/447308/" id="a_186">K.L. Tripathi v. State Bank of
India</a> ; Wades Administrative Law (5th Edn., pp. 472-75);
<a href="/doc/1865791/" id="a_187">State Bank of Patiala v. S.K. Sharma</a> ; and <a href="/doc/1129467/" id="a_188">Rajendra Singh v.
State of M.P</a>. ).   If, upon admitted or indisputable facts, only one
conclusion is possible then, in such a case, the principle, that
breach of natural justice was in itself prejudice, would not apply.
In other words if no other conclusion is possible on admitted or
indisputable facts, it is not necessary to quash the order which is
passed in violation of natural justice.  This being an exception,
great care must be taken in its application. (Aligarh Muslim
University92; <a href="/doc/1306907/" id="a_189">S.L. Kapoor v. Jagmohan</a>  ).
</p><p id="p_96">      As noted hereinabove, none of the subject Gram Panchayats
have passed any resolutions giving their consent to their merger
with, and for being constituted as a Nagar panchayat.  Except for
Dubbaka Gram panchayat, even the Special Officers of the other
gram panchayats have not passed any resolution for their merger
and constitution even as a Municipality.  The record discloses that
the alleged gram sabha resolutions of Dumpalapally, Chellapur,
Dharmajipet and Chervapur gram panchayats were signed not by  
the members of the gram sabhas, but merely by the Special Officer
and the panchayat secretary of these gram panchayats.  Even in
Lachapet gram panchayat, while the earlier gram sabha resolution
was to reject the proposal for de-notification of the gram
panchayat, and for its constitution as a Nagar panchayat, the
resolution allegedly passed subsequent thereto is contrary to the
statutory rules prescribed for convening and holding a gram
sabha.  Admittedly, the Government has neither issued any notice
to the gram panchayats, indicating its proposal to denotify the
subject gram panchayats for their being constituted as a Nagar
panchayat, nor were the gram panchayats informed that they 
could submit their decision against, and their objections to, such a
proposal.  Failure to adhere to the statutory rules renders the very
exercise of jurisdiction to de-notify these gram panchayats illegal,
and contrary to law.
</p><p id="p_97">      The object of ascertaining the views of the elected body of the
gram panchayat, or the gram sabha where no elected body of the 
gram panchayat is in office, is not a mere ritual or an empty
formality.  The views expressed by the gram panchayats/gram 
sabhas, either for or against the proposal, must be given due
consideration by the Government in taking a decision whether or
not to de-notify the said Gram Panchayat under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_190">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of
the 1994 Act.  An institution of self-government, a constitutional
body under Part IX of the Constitution, is entitled to be heard, and
its decision/objection considered, when its very existence is sought
to be brought to an end.  The requirement of a notice and an
opportunity being afforded to the gram panchayats to show cause,
indicate its decision and submit their objection, or the gram
sabhas to express their views to the Special Officer enabling him to
submit a representation, is not a needless exercise.  The Executive
cannot presume that every gram panchayat would readily consent 
to their very existence being brought to an end, and for their being
constituted as a Nagar panchayat, as is evident from the resolution
of the Lachapet gram sabha conveying their view that the said
proposal should be rejected.  The plea of absence of prejudice is,
therefore, misplaced.
</p><p id="p_98">      The statutorily prescribed procedure, of putting the gram
panchayats on notice and giving them an opportunity to submit
their objections before their existence is brought to an end, must
be adhered to.  When a procedure has been laid down, the
authority must act strictly in terms thereof.  (Taylor v. Taylor ).
If a statute has conferred a power to do an act, and has laid down
the method in which that power has to be exercised, it necessarily
prohibits the doing of the act in any manner other than that which
has been prescribed.  The principle behind the rule is that if this
were not so, the statutory provision might as well not have been
enacted. (<a href="/doc/407511/" id="a_191">State of U.P. v. Singhara Singh</a> ; <a href="/doc/1056564/" id="a_192">Dhananjaya Reddy

State of Maharashtra</a> ; and <a href="/doc/673450/" id="a_194">State of Gujarat v. Shantilal
Mangaldas</a> ).  Failure to adhere to the statutorily prescribed
procedure would necessitate the impugned GOs being set aside.

<p id="p_99">IV. THE REPOSITORY OF POWER MUST ACT INTRA-VIRES            
       THE POWER GRANTED TO IT:    
</p>
<p id="p_100">      In Adepu Veeraswamy v. The Govt. of A.p. rep. by its
Principal Secretary, Panchayat Raj &amp; Rural Development 
Dept.    a Division bench of this Court held that a decision taken
in accordance with law cannot be scrutinized by the Court; it is the
decision of the Government that some areas should be brought
within the municipal area so as to bring them within urban life;
and this policy decision, unless it is absolutely malafide and with
an oblique motive, cannot be examined by the Court.
</p><p id="p_101">      Whether a gram panchayat should be denotified as such,
and whether it should be constituted as a Nagar Panchayat, are
matters in the executive realm.  This Court would not take upon
itself the task of examining the wisdom or otherwise of such
executive decisions - save resultant constitutional and statutory
violations.  While Part-IX and Part-IX-A of the Constitution of India
place emphasis on establishing and promoting local bodies as self-
sustainable institutions of self-government, they do not disable a
gram panchayat from being constituted as a Nagar Panchayat  
provided the statutory provisions  in this regard  both plenary and
subordinate  are satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_102">      The power conferred on the Government, to cancel a
notification in terms of <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_195">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the 1994 Act, must be
exercised strictly in accordance with the procedure prescribed
under Rule 12(2) of the 2007 Rules.  The power delegated by a
statute/statutory rule is limited by its terms, and subordinate to
its objects. The delegate must act in good faith, reasonably, intra
vires the power granted, and on relevant consideration of material
facts. All his decisions must be reasonably related to the purposes
of the enabling legislation. If they are manifestly unjust or
oppressive or outrageous or directed to an unauthorised end or do
not tend in some degree to the accomplishment of the objects of
the delegation, the Court might well say that they are
unreasonable and ultra vires. (<a href="/doc/682224/" id="a_196">Shri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. v.
Union of India</a> ; Leila Mourning v. Family Publications
Service ; and Kruse v. Johnson .).  The repository of power
must act within the bounds of the power delegated, and should not
abuse his power. He must act reasonably and in good faith. A
repository of power acts ultra vires either when he acts in excess of
his power in the narrow sense or when he abuses his power by
acting in bad faith or for an inadmissible purpose or on irrelevant
grounds or without regard to relevant considerations or with gross
unreasonableness.  (Shri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd.106; <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_197">Maneka 
Gandhi v. Union of India</a> ; Associated Provincial Picture
Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation ; and Mayor &amp; C.  
Westminster Corporation v. London and North Western  
Railway ).      
</p>
<p id="p_103">      The exercise of administrative power will be set aside if there
is manifest error in its exercise or if it is manifestly arbitrary.
Similarly, if the power has been exercised on a non-consideration
or non-application of mind to relevant factors, the exercise of
power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous. If the power is
exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and which are
patently erroneous, such exercise of power will stand vitiated. (Shri
Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd.106; and <a href="/doc/307101/" id="a_198">General Electric Company v. 
Renusagar</a> ).  As the 2007 Rules empower the Government to  
cancel the earlier notification, constituting a gram panchayat, only
where an elected body of the Gram panchayat is in office, the
impugned notifications, which were issued when all the subject
gram panchayats were administered by the Special Officers in the
absence of an elected body, are ultravires the powers conferred on
the Government under Rule 12(2) of the 2007 Rules.

</pre><p id="p_113">      In Chirala Veera Raghava Reddy113, this Court held:
       ..It hardly needs any mention that howsoever attractive the
upgradation of a Gram Panchayat into a Nagar Panchayat or Municipality
may be, it would have its own impact upon the lives of citizens in terms of
tax regime, their freedom to undertake constructions etc. It is not without
reason that the Legislature insisted that the PENA must be not less than 50%
for a Gram Panchayat to be upgraded as Nagar Panchayat. Even if a particular
Gram Panchayat is flourishing and large in size, it cannot be converted into a
Nagar Panchayat, in case, the population is predominately dependant upon
agriculture. The upgradation of a Gram Panchayat into a municipality would
have its own adverse effect upon agriculture. So many restrictions come to be
imposed and the culture brought about in the habitat would not only discourage
but also, in a way, make it impossible for the agriculture to be carried on in
the
normal course. Therefore, the respondents ought to have been more careful
and certain in ensuring the fulfillment of the parameters, before the Gram
Panchayat was upgraded into Nagar Panchayat. Since it has emerged that the  
facts and figures on an important aspect were totally at variance, the
notifications cannot be sustained.  (emphasis supplied)

        The parameters stipulated under the 2013 Rules for
constitution of a Nagar Panchayat is different from those stipulated
for constitution of a Municipality.  While the earlier proposal of the
M.L.A, and the resolution of the Dubbaka Gram Panchayat  
represented by a Special Officer, was for constitution of a
Municipality, what was eventually constituted was a Nagar
panchayat.  The alleged resolution of the Dubbaka Gram Sabha 
was also to constitute a Municipality.  Likewise the resolutions,
allegedly passed by the gram sabhas of the other gram panchayats, 
were only for constitution of a Municipality and not a Nagar
Panchayat.  While this Court would not take upon itself the task of
determining whether the parameters for the constitution of a Nagar
panchayat are satisfied, or sit in appeal over the conclusion of
officials that the prescribed conditions have been fulfilled, the fact
remains that these parameters should have been made part of the
proposal, and the gram panchayats asked to show cause  
thereagainst.  This would have enabled the gram panchayats, while
conveying their decisions and submitting their objections, to point
out any discrepancies therein, and satisfy the Government that the
parameters for constitution of a Nagar Panchayat/Municipality, as
stipulated under the 2013 Rules, are not satisfied.  I see no reason
to examine the submission of Sri K.S. Murthy, that the parameters
for constituting a Nagar panchayat is not satisfied, on merits as
the impugned G.Os. are being set aside on other grounds
mentioned hereinabove.

that the 2007 Rules deal with de-notification of a Gram Panahayat;
Rule 12(2) stipulates that the Government must give notice to the
Gram Panchayat concerned for its consideration, and objections, if
any; a gram panchayat is a body created by a statute, and a body
corporate; it has a special status after the 73rd Constitution
Amendment; every resident of the Gram Panchayat can agitate, if
the very existence of the Gram Panchayat is sought to be snuffed
out by unscrupulous officers fudging records, misrepresenting
facts and violating the law at the behest of their political masters;
poor MGNREGA workers, who eke out their livelihood under the 
MGNREGA Scheme, would be adversely affected on the gram     
panchayats being de-notified, and the de-notified villages
constituted as a Nagar Panchayat; and, hence, the villagers of the
affected villages have the locus standi to invoke the jurisdiction of

rights; they lack the locus standi to maintain this Writ Petition;
Rule 12(2) of the 2007 Rules requires a notice to be issued to the
Gram Panchayat, inviting objections to the proposed de-
notification for the purpose of creating a transitional area; the said
Rule does not require notice to be given to individual villagers,
much less the petitioners herein; the petitioners are, hence, not
persons aggrieved; a legal right is  conferred only on the gram
panchayats under the 2007 Rules, and not on the petitioners; a
Gram Panchayat must be sued in its corporate name, and not in 
the name of individual villagers; as there is no elected body, the
Special Officer appointed under <a href="/doc/137942173/" id="a_225">Section 143(3)</a> of the Act

forming a separate panchayat for Dayyalakuntapalle village, and
appointing an executive officer as the Special Officer of the newly
constituted Dayyalakuntapalle gram panchayat, was under 
challenge before this Court.  It is in this context that the Division
bench of this Court held that in case a notification is issued either
by the District Collector or by the Commissioner, who have the
power to declare a particular area as a Gram Panchayat or to
include in or exclude therefrom any village or a part thereof, the
aggrieved person, if any, would only be the Gram-Panchayat; in
case a Gram Panchayat is affected by any such declaration or
notification, it can challenge the same by way of a revision to the
Government through the Commissioner; the Rules are not 
permanent in nature, and are subject to relaxation by the
Government, as and when the exigencies demand; any bifurcation, 
declaration, inclusion or deletion etc., can be made by the
authorities concerned by way of appropriate orders; interference is
justified only when such an order is either arbitrary or malafide;
and an individual cannot challenge such an order as he is not the
aggrieved party.
</p>
<p id="p_118">      In Pabba Ramesh118, the action of the respondents in
seeking to hold elections to the subject gram panchayat, by
including the voters of the village and the tribal tandas, was
questioned before this Court by one of the villagers.  It is in this
context that a Division bench of this Court held:
</p><p id="p_119">       ..From the above narration of facts, it is clear that there
was no notification of the collector under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_229">Section 3(2)</a> of the Act which
alone could be questioned in revision under Rule 10 of the Rules.  Rule
10 of the Rules reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_120">       Where a notification for the declaration of village has been issued by
the
Commissioner, it shall be open to any Gram Panchayat affected to prefer
revision petition to the Government through the Commissioner within fifteen
days from the date of publication of such notification and the Government, may
pass such order thereon as they may deem fit.
</p>
<p id="p_121">       From a perusal of the Rule extracted above, it is evident that (1) a
revision lies against a notification making declaration of a village by the
Commissioner, (2) the affeceted Gram Panchayat alone can prefer the
revision; (3) that such a revision has to be filed through the
Commissioner; and (4) a revision ought to be filed within 15 days from
the date of publication of the Notification.
</p><p id="p_122">       In so far as the requirements 1,2 and 4 are concerned, in our view
they are mandatory; without there being a notification duly declaring a
village issued by the Commissioner, there would be no cause to approach
the Government under Rule 10. It is equally clear that the Gram
Panchayat alone would be the affected party and can file a revision.
In our view, advisedly, the Rules keep an individual away from
seeking remedy under Rule 10 as, in the matter of declaration of
villages and elections of Gram Panchayat, the body affected would
be Gram panchayat, but not any individual; and, if individual
residents are given the right to approach the revisional authority,
the whole process of election and the administration of villages
would be brought to a grinding halt and would be adversely
affected                                               (emphasis supplied)

      Unlike in D. Venkata Rushi Reddy117 which related to the
bifurcation of an existing Gram panchayat and forming a separate
panchayat for one of the constituent villages, and Pabba
Ramesh118 wherein the validity of the elections held to the subject
gram panchayat after including voters of another village and the
tribal tandas was in issue, in the present case the very existence of
the subject gram panchayats was brought to an end by way of a 
notification issued under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_230">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the 1994 Act.  Rule 10 of
the 2007 Rules stipulates that, where a notification for declaration
of a village has been issued by the Government, it shall be open to
any Gram panchayat affected to prefer a revision to the
Government through the Commissioner within fifteen days from
the date of publication of such notification.  The remedy of a
revision to the Government, under Rule 10 of the 2007 Rules,
which is conferred only on the Gram panchayat, is available only
in cases where a notification, for the declaration of a village, has
been issued by the Government.  Such a notification is
contemplated only in the circumstances mentioned in Rule 9 of the
2007 Rules.  Unlike a notification for declaration of a village under
Rule 9, Rule 12 prescribes the procedure for issuance of a
notification to cancel the earlier notification constituting a gram
panchayat.  Rule 10 has no application where the Government has 
taken action to de-notify an existing gram panchayat under
<a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_231">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the 1994 Act read with Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules.
</p><p id="p_123">      Accepting this contention of Sri B. Mahender Reddy, Learned
Counsel for respondents 8 to 11, would have absurd
consequences.   On a notification being issued under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_232">Section 3(2)(f)</a>
of the 1994 Act, read with Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules, the subject
gram panchayat ceases to exist.  A non-existent gram panchayat 
cannot avail the remedy of a revision to the Government under
Rule 10 of the Rules, as the remedy is available only to an existing
gram panchayat.  If no one else has the locus standi to question
such a de-notification, it would result in the illegal and
highhanded acts of the Executive, in de-notifying a gram
panchayat, going unchallenged and unchecked.  Such a  
convoluted construction placed on Rule 10 of the Rules
necessitates rejection.  Interpretation of statutory provisions
should not be stretched to exasperating and illogical limits.  As the
remedy of a revision under Rule 10 is only in the circumstances
mentioned in Rule 9, and not where Rule 12 of the Rules is
attracted, reliance placed by Sri B. Mahender Reddy, on D.
Venkata Rushi Reddy117 and Pabba Ramesh118, is misplaced.     
</p><p id="p_124">      An application for a writ of mandamus can be made by a
person aggrieved by an order, and not a total stranger.
(<a href="/doc/309358/" id="a_233">Duryodhan v. Jitendra Kumar Mishra</a> ). The meaning of the
expression "person aggrieved" may vary according to the context of
the statute, and the facts of the case.  Normally a 'person aggrieved'
is a man who has suffered a legal grievance or against whom a
decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him 
of something or he has been wrongfully refused something or his
title to something has been wrongfully affected.  (<a href="/doc/1922606/" id="a_234">Thammanna v.

Maharashtra v. M.V. Dabholkar</a> ; and <a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_236">J. M. Desai v. Roshan
Kumar</a> ).  Existence of a legal right is the foundation of the
exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_237">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India. The legal right, that can be enforced under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_238">Article 226</a>,
must, ordinarily, be the right of the petitioner himself who
complains of infraction of such a right and approaches the Court
for relief.  The right that can be enforced under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_239">Article 226</a> shall
also, ordinarily, be the personal or individual right of the petitioner
himself. (Enercon (India) Ltd.116; <a href="/doc/693740/" id="a_240">State of Orissa v. Madan Gopal
Rungta</a> ; <a href="/doc/4354/" id="a_241">Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India</a> ).
</p><p id="p_125">      The term locus standi can be understood as a legal capacity
to challenge an act, an order or a decision.  (<a href="/doc/156913133/" id="a_242">Andhra Pradesh Wine
Dealers Association v. Deputy Director of Income Tax
(Investigation</a>) ).  The traditional rule of locus standi is that
judicial redress is available only to a person who has suffered a
legal injury by reason of a violation of his legal right or legally
protected interest by the impugned action of the State or a public
authority or any other person or who is likely to suffer a legal
injury by reason of threatened violation of his legal right or legally
protected interest by any such action. The basis of entitlement to
judicial redress is a personal injury to the property, body, mind or
reputation arising from violation, actual or threatened, of the legal
right or legally protected interest of the person seeking such
redress. This is a rule of ancient vintage, and arose during an era
when private law dominated the legal scene and public law had not
yet been born.  (<a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_243">S.P. Gupta v. Union of India</a> ).
</p><p id="p_126">      The traditional rule of standing, which confines access to the
judicial process only to those to whom legal injury is caused or a
legal wrong is done, has now been jettisoned by Courts and the
narrow confines within which the rule of standing was imprisoned
for long, as a result of the inheritance of the Anglo-Saxon system of
jurisprudence, has been broken and a new dimension has been  
given to the doctrine of locus standi. (Peoples Union for
<a href="/doc/496663/" id="a_244">Democratic Rights v. Union of India</a> ; Andhra Pradesh Wine
Dealers Association126).  The orthodox rule of interpretation,
regarding the locus standi of a person to reach the Court, has
undergone a sea change with the development of Constitutional
law in our Country. Constitutional Courts have, of late, been
adopting a liberal approach in dealing with cases, or in dislodging
the claim of a litigant, merely on hypertechnical grounds. If a
person approaching the court can satisfy that the impugned action
is likely to adversely affect his right which is shown to have source
in some statutory provision, the petition filed by such a person
cannot be rejected on the ground of his not having the locus
standi. In other words, if the person is found to be not merely a
stranger having no right whatsoever, he cannot be non-suited on
the ground of his not having the locus standi. (Ghulam Qadir115).
The strict rule of locus standi applicable to private litigation has
been relaxed, and a broad rule has been evolved which gives the
right of locus standi to any member of the pubic acting bona fide
and having sufficient interest in instituting an action for redressal
of public wrong or public injury, but who is not a mere busy body
or a meddlesome interloper. (<a href="/doc/1830927/" id="a_245">Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary</a> ;
Andhra Pradesh Wine Dealers Association117).   A member of the  
public, having no personal gain or oblique motive, is empowered to
approach the Court for enforcement of his Constitutional or Legal
rights. (<a href="/doc/1691368/" id="a_246">Sheela Barse v. Union of India</a> ; Andhra Pradesh Wine
Dealers Association126).
</p><p id="p_127">        In M.S. Jayaraj114, the Supreme Court observed:
       .In this context we noticed that this Court has
changed from the earlier strict interpretation regarding locus standi
as adopted in <a href="/doc/1298157/" id="a_247">Nagar Rice and Flour Mills v. N. Teekappa Gowda and 
Bros</a>., (1970) 1 SCC 575 : (AIR 1971 SC 246) and <a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_248">Jasbhai Motibhai 
Desai v. Roshan Kumar Haji Bashir Ahmed</a>, (1976) 1 SCC 671 : (AIR  
1976 SC 578) and a much wider canvass has been adopted in later 
years regarding a person's entitlement to move the High Court
involving writ jurisdiction. A four Judge Bench in Jasbhai Motibhai
Desai (AIR 1976 SC 578) (supra) pointed out three categories of
persons vis-a-vis the locus standi : (1) a person aggrieved; (2) a
stranger; (3) a busybody or a meddlesome interloper. Learned Judges
in that decision pointed out that any one belonging to the third
category is easily distinguishable and such person interferes in
things which do not concern him as he masquerades to be a 
crusader of justice. The Judgment has cautioned that the High
Court should do well to reject the petitions of such busybody at the
threshold itself. Then their Lordships observed the following (para
37 of AIR) :
</p>
<p id="p_128">"The distinction between the first and second categories of applicants,
though real, is not always well demarcated. The first category has as it
were, two concentric zones; a solid central zone of certainty, and a grey
outer circle of lessening certainty in a sliding centrifugal scale, with an
outermost nebulous fringe of uncertainty. Applicants falling within the
central zone are those whose legal rights have been infringed. Such
applicants undoubtedly stand in the category of 'persons aggrieved'. In the
grey outer circle the bounds which separate the first category from the
second, intermix, interfuse and overlap increasingly in a centrifugal
direction. All persons in this outer zone may not be persons aggrieved."
</p><p id="p_129">       A recent decision delivered by a two Judge Bench of this Court (of
which one of us is a party - Sethi, J.) in <a href="/doc/113663/" id="a_249">Chairman, Railway Board v.
Chandrima Das</a>, (2000) 2 SCC 465 : (2000 AIR SCW 649 : AIR 2000    
SC 988 : 2000 Cri LJ 1473) after making a survey of the later decisions
held thus (para 17 of AIR, Cri LJ) :
</p>
<p id="p_130">"In the context of public interest litigation, however, the Court in its various
judgments has given the widest amplitude and meaning to the concept of locus
standi. In People's Union for <a href="/doc/496663/" id="a_250">Democratic Rights v. Union of India</a> (1982) 3 SCC
235 : (AIR 1982 SC 1473 : 1982 Lab IC 1646) it was laid down that public
interest litigation could be initiated not only by filing formal petitions in
the High
Court but even by sending letters and telegrams so as to provide easy access to
Court. On the right to approach the Court in the realm of public interest
litigation. <a href="/doc/1460318/" id="a_251">In Bangalore Medical Trust v. B. S. Muddappa</a> (1991) 4 SCC 54 :
(1991 AIR SCW 2082 : AIR 1991 SC 1902) the Court held that the restricted
meaning of aggrieved person and the narrow outlook of a specific injury has
yielded in favour of a broad and wide construction in the wake of public
interest
litigation. The Court further observed that public spirited citizens having
faith in
the rule of law are rendering great social and legal service by espousing causes
of publc nature. They cannot be ignored or overlooked on a technical or
conservative yardstick of the rule of locus standi of the absence of personal
loss
or injury. There has, thus, been a spectacular expansion of the concept of locus
standi. The concept is much wider and it takes in its stride anyone who is not a
mere busybody." 
</p><p id="p_131">       In the light of the expanded concept of the locus standi and
also in view of the finding of the Division Bench of the High Court
that the order of the Excise Commissioner was passed in violation of
law, we do not wish to nip the motion out solely on the ground of
locus standi. If the Excise Commissioner has no authority to permit
a liquor shop owner to move out of the range (for which auction was
held) and have his business in another range it would be improper to
allow such an order to remain alive and operative on the sole ground
that the person who filed the writ petition has strictly no locus
standi. So we proceed to consider the contentions on merits.    
</p><p id="p_132">                                                                (emphasis supplied)

      The statutory remedy of a revision cannot be equated with
the constitutional remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_252">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India.  The jurisdiction of this Court can be invoked by any person
who has a modicum of a right, and is not a mere busy body or a
meddlesome interloper.  Petitioners 3, 7, 9, 12, 15 and 17 claim to
be card- holders of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
Employment Guarantee Scheme, and the beneficiaries thereof.  
<a href="/doc/433162/" id="a_253">Section 2(o)</a> of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,
2005 (Act 42 of 2005) defines rural area to mean any area in a
State except those areas covered by any urban local body or a
Cantonment Board established or constituted under any law for
the time being in force. Clause (p) of <a href="/doc/186367556/" id="a_254">Section 2</a> defines Scheme to
mean a Scheme notified by the State Government under <a href="/doc/29798117/" id="a_255">Section  
4(1)</a>.  <a href="/doc/116657969/" id="a_256">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act stipulates that, save as otherwise
provided, the State Government shall, in such rural area in the
State as my be notified by the Central Government, provide to
every household, whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled
manual work, not less than one hundred days of such work in a
financial year in accordance with the Scheme made under the Act.
Under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_257">Section 3(2)</a>, every person who has done the work given to
him under the Scheme shall be entitled to receive wages at the
wage rate for each day of work.  <a href="/doc/133902462/" id="a_258">Section 4</a> provides for an
employment guarantee scheme for the rural areas and, under sub- 
section (1) thereof, for the purposes of giving effect to the
provisions of <a href="/doc/184226656/" id="a_259">Section 3</a>, every State Government shall, within one
year from the commencement of the Act, by notification, make a
scheme, for providing not less than one hundred days of
guaranteed employment in a financial year to every household in
the rural areas covered under the scheme and whose adult
members, by application, volunteer to do unskilled manual work
subject to the conditions laid down by  or under the Act, and in the
scheme. 
</p><p id="p_133">      Adult members, of households in rural areas, are alone
entitled to the benefits of the Employment Guarantee Scheme, and
not those living in urban areas.  Some of the petitioners, who claim
to be the card holders under the MGNREGA scheme, would be    
disentitled to the benefits of the Scheme on the Gram panchayats
being de-notified, and the subject villages constituted as a Nagar
panchayat (a local body created under Part IX-A of the
Constitution of India and the provisions of the A.P. Municipalities
Act, 1965).  This Court may not be understood to have opined that
the Government is prohibited from constituting a Nagar panchayat,
after merging two or more gram panchayats for the said purpose,
merely because some of the villagers would, thereby, be denied the
benefits of the MGRNEGA scheme.  All that this Court has held is
that persons, who would be deprived of the benefits of the National
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme consequent upon de-     
notification of the Gram Panchayat and its constitution as a Nagar
panchayat, have the locus standi to invoke the jurisdiction of this
Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_260">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, to question
the validity of such de-notification and the consequent constitution
of a transitional area (Nagar panchayat), as such persons would
have sufficient interest in instituting an action for redressal of a
public wrong and they cannot be said to be mere busy bodies or
meddlesome interlopers. In view of the expanded rule of standing
in M.S. Jayaraj114, I see no reason to non-suit the petitioners on
the specious plea that they lack the locus standi to file this writ
petition.

</p>
<p id="p_136">        Sri B. Mahender Reddy, learned counsel for respondents 8 to
11, would submit that this Writ Petition has been filed questioning
the de-notification of the village, (cancellation of the earlier
notification constituting the village), under <a href="/doc/77079634/" id="a_261">Section 3(2)(f)</a> of the
1994 Act, vide GOMs. No.33 dated 31.01.2013; the petitioners
sought interim suspension of GOMs. No.33 dated 31.01.2013, and  
the consequential GOMs.No.37 dated 31.01.2013 constituting a 
transitional area; a learned single judge of this Court refused to
grant an interim order in WPMP No.5250/2013, dt. 13.3.2013; the
petitioners filed W.A.No.432 of 2013 questioning refusal of the
interim order; W.A.No.432 of 2013 was admitted and, by order in
W.A.M.P.No.1066/2013 dated 13.09.2013, the Division Bench   
directed that elections to the Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat not be
conducted; as the Writ Appeal is still pending before the Division
Bench, the Writ Petition cannot be heard till the Writ Appeal is
finally disposed of; otherwise, the possibility of conflicting
judgments being passed, one by the single judge, and another by
the Division Bench, cannot be ruled out; propriety and judicial
discipline requires the Writ Petition to be disposed of only after
disposal of Writ Appeal arising from the said Writ Petition; and the
petitioners cannot enjoy an interim order in the Writ Appeal and,
simultaneously, seek disposal of  the Writ Petition during the
pendency of the Writ Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_137">      This Court, in its order dated 01.03.2013, recorded the
assurance of the Government Pleader that, for the next one year,
the State Government had committed itself to continue the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the six villages 
which were earlier notified as Gram Panchayats; and they would
not be disbanded for atleast one year so that the apprehension of a
large chunk of people, losing their right to guaranteed minimum
number of days of work, would not continue and they would earn
their living honourably.  Notice before admission, returnable in ten
days, was ordered and the Registry was directed to list the matter
after ten days in the Motion List.  Aggrieved thereby the petitioner
preferred W.A. No.432 of 2012 and the Division Bench of this
Court, in its order dated 13.06.2013, observed that the contention
of the Learned Counsel for the appellant that, as per Rule 12(2) of
the A.P. Gram Panchayat (Declaration of Villages) Rules, 2007, the
Government has not issued any notice to the Gram Panchayats  
was not disputed by the Learned Government Pleader for 
Panchayat Raj.  After taking note of the submission, made on
behalf of respondents 8 to 11, that the gram sabhas had
themselves passed resolutions requesting merger with the Nagar
panchayat, the Division Bench directed that the elections, which
were going to be conducted for Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat, be  
stayed until further orders.
</p><p id="p_138">      W.A. No.432 of 2012 is said to be still pending before the
Division Bench.  The order passed by this Court in W.P. No.4205 of
2013 dated 01.03.2013, recording the submission of the Learned
Government Pleader for Panchayat Raj, is an interlocutory order.
The Writ Appeal preferred thereagainst is limited to an examination
of the validity or otherwise of the said interlocutory order, and for
grant of the interim order sought for by the petitioners. The
aforementioned order of the Division Bench is, therefore, also an
interlocutory order.  Interlocutory orders are made in aid of final
orders, and not vice versa. No interlocutory order will survive after
the original proceeding comes to an end.  (<a href="/doc/1968235/" id="a_262">Shipping Corporation
of India Ltd. v. Machado Brothers</a> ; <a href="/doc/708348/" id="a_263">Kavita Trehan v. Balsara
Hygiene Products Ltd</a> ; and <a href="/doc/1604894/" id="a_264">Pitta Naveen Kumar v. Raja
Narasaiah Zangiti</a> ). When a party obtains an interim order, and
the final proceedings come to an end, the interim order also,
automatically, comes to an end.  (<a href="/doc/863466/" id="a_265">V. Ramakrishna v. Smt. N.
Sarojini</a> ).
</p><p id="p_139">       Neither has any statutory provision, nor any binding
precedent, been shown to this Court which would require it to
refrain from hearing a Writ Petition finally, merely because the Writ
Appeal preferred against the interlocutory order passed earlier in
the very same Writ Petition, or for grant of the interim order sought
for in the Writ Petition, is pending adjudication before the Division
Bench.  On the Writ Petition being finally heard and decided, the
interlocutory order passed earlier would not survive and the Writ
Appeal preferred thereagainst, or for grant of an interim order as
sought for in the Writ Petition, would be rendered infructuous
thereby.  As the Writ Petition is finally disposed of, the possibility
of conflicting judgments being passed by the single judge and the
Division Bench would not arise.  All that is required is for any of
the parties to bring the fact of disposal of the main Writ Petition to
the notice of the Division bench and request it to dismiss the Writ
Appeal as infructuous.  Mere pendency of W.A. No.432 of 2012 
would not bar this Court from hearing and adjudicating the main
Writ Petition. This contention of Sri B. Mahender Reddy
necessitates rejection.

      IMPUGNED G.OS, WHEREBY THEY WERE SO

<p id="p_141">        Both Sri B. Mahendar Reddy, Learned Standing Counsel for 
respondents 8 to 11, and Sri D. Bhaskar Reddy, Learned Standing 
Counsel for respondent No.12, would submit that, subsequent to
the constitution of Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat, a Municipal
Commissioner was appointed, and is working for the last more
than one year; the government has already released several crores
of rupees as funds to the Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat for its
development under Municipal Funds; and, in view of the above, the
present Writ Petition should be dismissed with exemplary costs.
</p><p id="p_142">        It is not even the case of the respondents that the Writ
Petition is hit by delay and laches.  W.P.No.4205 of 2013 was filed
on 11.02.2013 less than a fortnight after the impugned G.Os were
issued.  As the Writ Petition was pending adjudication, on the file
of this Court, for more than a year, the petitioners cannot be
denied relief taking subsequent events into consideration, more so
as the impugned G.Os. were issued in flagrant violation of the
statutory rules, and the very existence of the gram panchayats
were brought an end at the mere whims and fancies of the
government.  Larger public interest would require this Courts
intervention to ensure observance of the rule of law by the
executive while denotifying gram panchayats  which are
institutions of self-government under Part IX of the Constitution.
VIII.   CONCLUSION:    
</p><p id="p_143">      Viewed from any angle, the impugneed G.Os. (G.O.Ms. No.33 
PR &amp; RD dated 31.01.2013 and G.O.Ms. No.37 MA &amp; UD (Elec.I)    
Dept dated 31.01.2013) must be, and are accordingly, set aside.
As a result the subject Gram Panchayats, which were denotified by
G.O.Ms.No.33 dated 31.01.2013, shall stand revived.  It is made
clear that this order shall not preclude the State Government, if it
so chooses, from taking action afresh, for constitution of a Nagar
Panchayat, strictly in accordance with law.  As the subject Gram
Panchayats now stand revived, and the Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat   
ceases to remain in existence, the question of conducting elections
to the Dubbaka Nagar Panchayat would not arise.  With regards 
conduct of elections to the posts of M.P.T.C. in Dubbaka Mandal
and other offices, I have no reason to doubt that the State Election
Commission will take necessary action in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_144">      Both the Writ Petitions are, accordingly, disposed of.
However, in the circumstances, without costs.  The miscellaneous
petitions, pending if any, shall also stand disposed of.
