19(2)-Joint trial of vendor and distributor of food <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2">article-
If</a> legal-S. 20A-Scope of.



HEADNOTE:
The appellant, a firm of ghee merchants, through its partner
as A2 was charged with having sold ghee to Al (the vendor of
ghee).	 A  sample  of	that  ghee  purchased  by  the	Food
Inspector  was found (on analysis) to be  adulterated.	 The
two  accused were prosecuted jointly under<a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_3"> ss. 7</a> and  <a href="/doc/151999671/" id="a_4">16</a>  of
the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
At  the	 trial,	 the  vendor prayed  for  the  discharge  or
acquittal  of  the warrantor so that he	 might	examine	 the
warrantor  as his defence witness to prove his own  purchase
of  the	 article under a warranty.   The  trying  magistrate
acquitted the partner of the appellant.	 The vendor was also
acquitted on the ground that he was protected by a  warranty
covered by<a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_5"> s. 19(2)</a> of the Act.
On appeal, the High Court, while maintaining acquittal of A-
1,  set aside the acquittal of the appellant (A-2).  On	 the
question  whether the charge should be quashed	because	 two
accused were set tip for trial jointly.
HELD  : The High Court was right in holding that  the  joint
trial  of  the appellant with the vendor  was  not  illegal.
[42A]
(1)(a)	In a suitable case, a vendor, a distributor,  and  a
manufacturer   could   be  tried   together   provided	 the
allegations  made  before  the Court show  that	 there	were
connecting   links  between  their  activities	so   as	  to
constitute the same transaction.  The connecting links, in a
case  could  be provided by (i) the fact that a sale  at  an
anterior  stage	 could	be  viewed  as	the  cause  of	 the
subsequent  sale;  (ii)	 the allegation	 that  each  of	 the
accused	 parted with the article of food when it was  in  an
adulterated  state  and	 (iii)	the  common  object  of	 the
manufacturer,  the distributor and the vendor was  that	 the
article	 should reach the consumer to be used as food.	 The
third and last link is decisive and must tilt the balance in
favour	of  legality  of  a  joint  trial  of  the   parties
concerned. [41-C-D]
(b)A  mens rea as a particular state of mind which could  be
described  as  guilty  or  wrongful  was  not  needed,	and,
therefore, could not provide the connecting link between the
co-accused  in	a  trial for such an  offence  in  order  to
constitute the same transaction. [39D]

S.C. 631, referred
(c)Where  a  joinder of several	 accused  persons  concerned
dealing in different ways with the same adulterated  article
of  food at different stages is likely to jeopardise a	fair
trial,	a  separate trial ought to be ordered.	 It  is	 not
proper	to  acquire or discharge an accused person  on	this
ground	alone.	The order of separate trial in a case  where
prejudice to an accused from a joint trial is apprehended is
enough.	  A  joint trial of such accused persons is  not  ab
initio illegal. [40A]

(2)Neither<a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_9"> S. 7</a> nor<a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_10"> S. 14</a> of the Act bars trial of several
offences by the same accused person, be he a manufacturer, a
distributor or a last seller referred to as "the vendor"  in
S. 14 of the Act.  The definition of "sale" in sub-s. (xiii)
of the Act, is wide enough to include every kind of  seller.
Every seller can be prosecuted for an offence created by <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_11"> s.
7</a> of the Act. The  mere fact that, for purposes of <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_12"> S.	14</a>,
the person who could be thelast	 seller is  described  as
"the  vendor",	could not affect a liability for an  offence
under<a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_13"> s. 7</a> of the Act by a sale of an article of food  which
is found to be adulterated.  A sale of an article of food by
a  " manufacturer, distributor or dealer" is a distinct	 and
separable offence.  <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_14">Section 14</a> was not meant to carve out an
exemption  in favour of a distributor or a manufacturer	 who
sells	articles   of  food,  found   to   be	adulterated,
irrespective of the question whether any warranty was  given
for them. [36C-F]
The spacial provisions contained in Ss.19(2) and 20A do	 not
take  away  or	derogate from the  effect  of  the  ordinary
provisions of the law which enable separate as well as joint
trials of accused persons in accordance with the  provisions
of  the	 old Ss. 233 to 239, Cr.  P. C. On the	other  hand,
there is no logically sound reason why, if a distributor  or
a manufacturer can be subsequently impleaded under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_15"> s. 20A</a> of
the Act, he cannot be joined as a co-accused initially in  a
joint trial if the allegations made justify such a
course.[37B]
(b)The special provisions of<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_16"> S. 20A</a> are only enabling  and
do not give rise toa  mandatory	 duty.	 They  do  not	bar
either	a separate or a joint trial of an accused person  if
other  conditions are satisfied.  Similarly<a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_17"> S.	239(d)</a>,	 Cr.
P.C. is only an enabling section. [41-B]
In the instant case although the charge stated that the ghee
sold  by the vendor was found to be adulterated, it  is	 not
stated	that  it was in that very state when  the  appellant
sold  it to the vendor.	 It is left to be inferred from	 the
charge	that  the  appellant  also  sold  the  ghee  in	  an
adulterated  state.  It is true that defects in	 the  charge
would not invalidate a trial.  Even so, continuation of such
an  old prosecution is likely to handicap the  appellant  in
his defence.  Assuming that the charge implied an allegation
that ghee was adulterated when the appellant sold it to	 the
vendor an enquiry in 1975 into the actual state of the	ghee
sold  by  the'	distributor  in	 1967  would  be   obviously
difficult.    It   would  impose  undue	 hardship   on	 the
distributor  to prove at this distance of time,	 the  actual
state of the small quantity of ghee analysed. [41G-H]
Alagiriswami, J. (concurring in the final result)
The High Court was not correct in saying that the action  of
both  the  accused formed part of the same  transaction	 and
there  was  unity  of  purpose	of  the	 manufacturer,	 the
distributor  and the vendor furnished by the purpose of	 all
of them to sell, and, therefore. it was the same transaction
and ill of them could be tried together. [43E]
(1)If the common purpose of all of them was to sell  ghee,
joint  trial of all of them would not be valid; but,  if  it
was  to sell adulterated ghee it would be valid.  If  it  is
alleged that at every one of the stages ghee was adulterated
then it would be the same transaction and they could all  be
jointly	 tried.	  In the absence of an allegation  that	 the
ghee  distributed  by  the  appellant  to  the	vendor	 was
adulterated both of them could not be tried together. [43G]
(2)At the stage of considering the validity of the charge,
it  is	the allegation that is material ; at  the  stage  of
considering  the guilt of the parties, it is proof  that  is
material. [43H]
In  the	 instant case, although the charge states  that	 the
ghee purchased from the vendor was found to be	adulterated,
there was no allegation that the ghee sold by the  appellant
to the vendor was adulterated.	While the common object	 was
to sell the article of food sold, it is not said that it was
to sell adulterated article of food. [42E]
32
(3)It is now well settled that for establishing an offence
under  the  Act it is not necessary to	establish  mens	 rea
i.e.,	criminal  intention  either  on	 the  part  of	 the
manufacturer  or distributor or vendor.	 Even  knowledge  on
the part of all of them that the food was adulterated is not
necessary.   Ignorance on the part of any one of  them	that
the   food  was	 adulterated  would  not  absolve  them	  of
liability. [42H]

application praying that the warrantor may be discharged  or
acquitted so that Laxmi Narain may examine the warrantor  as
his  defence  witness  to  prove his  own  purchase  of	 the
offending  article  under a warranty.  It may  be  mentioned
that,  as the complaint describes the warrantor	 accused  as
"M/s.	Bhagwan	 Das Jagdish Chander through  an  authorised
person",  appearance  was  put	in  by	Jagdish	 Chander,  a
partner, as the accused person responsible on behalf of	 the

</p><p id="p_7">The  trying  Magistrate	 allowed the  application  of  Laxmi

Laxmi Narain would be deprived of a valuable defence  unless
this  was done and relied upon <a href="/doc/239020/" id="a_28">V. N. Chokra v. The  State</a>(1)
in support of this action.  Of course, an accused person has
a right to appear in defence under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_29">Section 342A</a> of the	Code
of  Criminal Procedure; and, Laxmi Narain, taking  advantage
of  this provision, did depose in his own defence.  But,  it
seems  that  it	 was urged on behalf of	 Laxmi	Narain	that
Jagdish	 Chander  could	 not be compelled  to  appear  as  a
defence	 witness until he had been discharged or  acquitted.
The  Magistrate accepted this ground as good enough for	 the
acquittal  of  Jagdish	Chander.   After,  the	evidence  of
Jagdish Chander and Laxmi Narain, as defence witnesses,	 the
trying Magistrate acquitted Laxmi Narain also on the  ground
that  Laxmi  Narain was protected by a warranty	 covered  by
<a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_30">Section	 19(2)</a> of the Act.  Thus, both the  accused  persons

</blockquote><p id="p_9">Although, we are not concerned in the appeals before us with
the  prosecution  of the manufacturer, M/s.   Gauri  Shanker
Prem  Narain, yet, we find that one of the questions  framed
for  consideration  and	 decided by  the  Delhi	 High  Court
relates to the meaning and scope of <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_35">Section 20A</a> of the	Act.
We  may	 mention that a statement has been made at  the	 Bar
that  the manufacturer has also been acquitted.	 We  do	 not
know  whether  this  acquittal was on the  ground  that	 the
manufacturer  cannot be impleaded under <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_36">section 20A</a>  of	 the
Act after the trial is concluded by the acquittal of the two
accused.   It is clear that <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_37">Section 20A</a> contemplates  action
which  can only be taken during the course of the trial.   A
separate  trial	 would	require a "written  consent  of	 the
Central	 Government  or	 the State  Government	or  a  local
authority  or  of  a person authorised	in  this  behalf  by
general	 or special order by the Central Government  or	 the
State  Government  or  a local authority", unless  it  is  a
complaint  by a purchaser, other than a Food Inspector,	 who
could rely upon <a href="/doc/78464652/" id="a_38">Section 12</a> of the Act.	But, an addition  of
an  accused  under  <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_39">section 20A</a> of the	Act  constitutes  an
expressly  laid	 down  exception to  the  requirement  of  a
sanction under <a href="/doc/172356374/" id="a_40">section 20(1)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_10">In  the	 case  before  us,  the	 prosecutor,  the  Municipal

similar	 cases, were framed and referred for decision  by  a
Full Bench as follows :

</p><p id="p_15">The  High  Court, while maintaining the acquittal  of  Laxmi
Narain,	 set  aside  the acquittal  of	the  appellant	M/s.
Bhagwan Das Jagdish Chander.  It is not clear to us why	 two
appeals to this Court became necessary as the appellant does
not  question  the  correctness of the	acquittal  of  Laxmi
Narain.	 Separate Counsel have, however, appeared and argued
the  case  for the appellant firm and  its  partner  Jagdish
Chander.   We propose to deal with the case as one only	 and
assume	that both the firm and its partner  Jagdish  Chander
question the validity of the trial on a complaint where	 the
only allegation against the appellant firm, arraigned as  an
accused	 through its partner, was that it was a	 distributor
of the adulterated ghee sold.  The charge framed against the
appellant was
	      "That,  on or about the 22nd day of Aug.	1967
	      at  12 noon a sample of ghee was purchased  by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">	      Sh.   V.	P.  Anand F.I. from  accused  No.  1</span>

	      you  to accused No. 1 Laxmi Narain on  21-8-67

	      found  to be adulterated and hereby  committed
	      an  offence punishable under <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_58">sections 7</a>/<a href="/doc/151999671/" id="a_59">16</a>  of

	      1954 and within my cognizance".
</p><p id="p_16">The  material  question	 before us, shorn  of  subtlety	 and
bereft of verbiage, could be said to, be: Should this charge
be  quashed,  after  holding that  the	prosecution  of	 the
appellant,  which  was	duly  sanctioned  by  the  competent
authority,  was	 invalid  merely  because,  initially,	 the
appellant  was sent up for trial jointly with Laxmi  Narain,
or, alternatively, should we quash it on any other ground?
We  are	 not impressed by the argument	that  a	 distributor
could  only  be	 prosecuted for	 selling  without  giving  a
warranty  to  a	 vendor which is a  separate  offence  under
<a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_60">section	 14</a> of the Act.	 It is clear from <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_61">Section 14</a>  itself
that a manufacturer as well as a distributor can sell.	 The
definition of "Sale", given in sub s. (xiii) of the Act,  is
wide  enough to include every kind of seller.  Every  seller
can be prosecuted of an offence created by <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_62">Section 7</a> of	 the
Act  which  prohibits a sale as well as distribution  of  an
adulterated  article of food.  The mere fact that,  for	 the
purposes  of  <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_63">Section 14</a>, the person who could be  the	last
seller,	 in the sense that he sells to the actual  consumer,
is  described as "the vendor", could not affect a  liability
for  an offence under <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_64">section 7</a> of the Act by a sale  of  an
article of food which is found to be adulterated.  A sale of
an  article  of	 food by a  "manufacturer,  distributor,  or
dealer" is a distinct and separable offence.  <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_65">Section 14</a> was
not  meant  to	carve  out  an	exemption  in  favour  of  a
distributor  or a manufacturer who sells articles  of  food,
found  to  be  adulterated,  irrespective  of  the  question
whether any warranty was given for them.It is true that	 the
manufacture of an adulterated article of food forsale	 is
also  an offence under <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_66">section 7</a> of the Act.   But,  neither
Section7 nor <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_67">Section 14</a> of the Act bars trial of  several
offences by the same accused person, be he a manufacturer, a
distributor,  or a last seller, referred to as "the  vendor"
in <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_68">Section 14</a> of the Act.

Inspector,  Palghat  Municipality  v. Setharam	Rice  &amp;	 Oil
Mills(1),  and in P. B. Kurup v. Food Inspector,  Malappuram
Panchayat(2),  that, in every case under the Act, there	 has
to  be initially a prosecution of a particular seller  only,
but  those  who may have passed on or sold  the	 adulterated
article	 of  food to the vendor, who  is  being	 prosecuted,
could  only be brought in subsequently after a warranty	 set
up  under  <a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_70">section 19(2)</a> has been pleaded and  shown  to  be
substantiated.	 Support  was  sought for  such	 a  view  by
referring  to  the  special provisions of  <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_71">Section  20A</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_72">Section 19(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/175685226/" id="a_73">Section 20</a> of the Act.  A reason for	Sec.

as  an	accused under <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_74">Section 20A</a> in the course of  a  trial
does not require a separate sanction <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_75">Section 20A</a> itself lays

<p id="p_19">concerned  with an offence", for which an accused  is  being
tried, the necessary sanction to prosecute will be deemed to
have  been  given.  Another reason seems to be that  such  a
power enables speedy trial of the really guilty parties.  We
are in agreement with the view of the Delhi High Court, that
these  special provisions do not take away or derogate	from
the  effect  of	 the ordinary provisions of  the  law  which
enable	separate as well as joint trials of accused  persons
in accordance with the provisions of the old <a href="/doc/691979/" id="a_76">Sections 233</a> to
<a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_77">239</a>  of Criminal Procedure Code.  On the other	hand,  there
seems  no logically sound reason why, if a distributor or  a
manufacturer  can be subsequently impleaded,  under  <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_78">Section
20A</a>  of	 the  Act,  he cannot  be  joined  as  a  co-accused

such a course.
</p><p id="p_20">This  brings us to the most debated point in the  case:	 Was
the  sale of ghee on 22-8-67 by the last seller	 or  vendor,
Laxmi  Narain,	so connected with the sale  by	the  accused
appellant  Jagdish Chander to Laxmi Narain on 21-8-67  that,
if  the	 ghee was found adulterated in the  hands  of  Laxmi
Narain,	 the appellant Jagdish Chander could  be  prosecuted
jointly with Laxmi Narain as the two sales were part of	 the

Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 corresponding to <a href="/doc/1737687/" id="a_80">Section 223</a>
of the Code of 1973?
</p><p id="p_21">We  do	not propose to attempt, in this case,  the  task  of
defining exhaustively what constitutes the same	 transaction
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_81">Section 239</a> of Criminal Procedure Code
of  1898  corresponding	 to  <a href="/doc/1737687/" id="a_82">Section  223</a>  of  the  Criminal
Procedure  Code	 of 1973.  It is practically  impossible  as
well  as  undesirable  to attempt such	a  definition  of  a
concept which has to be necessarily elastic.  Moreover, this
Court  has,  in the <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_83">State of Andhra Pradesh  v.	 Cheemalpati
Ganeshwara Rao and Anr</a>. (supra), already expressed its views
(at  page 321.), which we respectfully quote and follow,  on
this question :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	      "What  is meant by 'same transaction'  is	 not
	      defined  anywhere	 in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_84"> the	 Code</a>.	 Indeed,  it
	      would always be difficult to define  precisely
	      what   the   expression  means.	 Whether   a
	      transaction can be regarded as the same  would
	      necessarily  depend upon the particular  facts
	      of  each	case  and it seems to  us  to  be  a
	      difficult	 task to undertake a  definition  of
	      that  which the Legislature  has	deliberately
	      left  undefined.	 We have not come  across  a
	      single   decision	 of  any  Court	 which	 has
	      embarked	upon the difficult task of  defining
	      the expression.  But, it is generally  thought
	      that where there is proximity of time or place
	      or  unity of purpose and design or  continuity
	      of  action in respect of a series of acts,  it
	      may  be possible to infer that they form	part
	      of the same transaction.	It is, however,	 not
	      necessary	 that  every one of  these  elements
	      should  co-exist	for  a	transaction  to	  be
	      regarded	as  the same.  But if  several	acts
	      committed by a person show a unity of  purpose
	      or design that would be a strong	circumstance
	      to  indicate that those acts form part of	 the
	      same transaction".
</blockquote><p id="p_22">Learned	 Counsel for the appellant, however. relies  on	 the
immediately following observations (at page 322)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">			     38</span>
	      The connection between a series of acts  seems
	      to us to be an essential ingredient for  those
	      acts  to constitute the same transaction	and,
	      therefore,  the mere absence of the words	 'so
	      connected together as to form in cl. (a),	 (c)
	      and   (d)	  of <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_85"> S.  239</a>  would   make   little
	      difference.  Now, a transaction may consist of
	      an isolated act or may consist of a series  of
	      acts.   The series of acts which constitute  a
	      transaction  must	 of necessity  be  connected
	      with one another and if some of them stand out
	      independently, they would not form part of the
	      same   transaction  but  would  constitute   a
	      different	   transaction	 or    transactions.
</p><p id="p_23">	      Therefore,   even	 if  the  expression   'same
	      transaction' alone had been used in<a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_86"> s.  235(1)</a>
	      it  would have meant a transaction  consisting
	      either  of  a  single act or of  a  series
	      of  connected  acts.   The  expression   'same
	      transaction'  occurring in cls. (a),  (c)	 and
</p><p id="p_24">	      (d) of<a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_87"> s. 239</a> as well as that occurring in  s.
</p><p id="p_25">	      235(1) ought to be given the meaning according
	      to   the	normal	rule  of   construction	  of
	      statutes".
</p><p id="p_26">It  is	contended that it would be dangerous  to  leave	 the
"unity	of  purpose  and design",  which  may  constitute  a
transaction,  so vague as to bring in the  manufacturer	 and
every  conceivable distributor as accused  persons  whenever
any  adulterated food, manufactured and scaled by one  party
and  distributed by another, is finally sold by a vendor  in
the market.  The learned Counsel for the appellant contended
that   we  must,  therefore,  restrict	the  concept  of   a
"transaction",	in a prosecution for sale of an	 adulterated
article of food, to an alleged criminal participation in the
adulteration  of  the actual article of food sold.   It	 was
urged  that some vague and general connection or concern  of
all  the co-accused as manufacturers or distributors of	 the
article	 sold  will  not  do.	It  had,  according  to	 the
contention  on behalf of the appellant, to  be	specifically
alleged that the accused was concerned with the adulteration
or  sale  of  the  particular article  of  food	 sold.	 The
argument  of the learned Counsel for the appellant seems  to
us  to	go  so	far as to suggest  that	 an  allegation	 was
indispensable of a participation in some kind of  conspiracy
to  sell  the actual adulterated article of food  which	 was
sold  in  order to enable a trial in which the	seller,	 the
distributor,  and, the manufacturer could be  jointly  tried
for offences which could be looked upon as parts of a single
transaction.  To accept such an argument would be to  import
into such a case the need to establish a conspiracy  between
the accused manufacturer or distributor, as the case may be,
and  the actual vendor or the last seller to  the  consumer.
We think that such a result would be obviously incorrect.
It  was pointed out by this Court, in <a href="/doc/1743858/" id="a_88">Sarjoo Prasad  v.	 The
State of Uttar Pradesh</a>(1), that mens rea, in the sense of  a
guilty	knowledge of adulteration of the food sold,  is	 not
necessary  to  prove for an offence under <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_89">Section 7</a>  of	 the
Act.   Indeed, <a href="/doc/149817921/" id="a_90">Section 19(1)</a> specifically rules out  such  a
defence	 although <a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_91"> S.  19(2)</a>  makes  it	 available  in	 the
particular case of the accused who has taken the  precaution
of  protecting	himself from what seems otherwise to  be  an
absolute liability without proof of guilty knowledge.	Even
if we were to widen
(2)  A.1-R 1974 SC 2154.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">39</span>
<p id="p_27">the  concept of "mens rea" here to embrace  carelessness  or
indifference   as  the	required  states  of  mind  in	 the
manufacture  or	 distribution  or  sale	 of  an	 adulterated
article	 of food, as an ingredient of a, legally  punishable
offence,  the law obviously and expressly does	not  require
parties	 to, an offence under the Act to have  a  particular
guilty knowledge about the particular item of food found  to
be adulterated.	 We cannot introduce such a requirement into
a  case	 simply because several accused	 persons  are  being
jointly tried.	The law does require proof, for a successful
defence,  of  a degree of care and caution revealed  by	 the
actions	 of the seller, distributor, or manufacturer,  which
will  be  enough to procure  an	 exemption  from  criminal
liability for a sale of adulterated article of food  without
knowledge  of its actual adulteration.	But, we cannot,	 for
this  reason, equate such. an offence with one in which	 the
co-accused  must  necessarily  have a  common  knowledge  or
design	to  sell  an article actually known to	them  to  be
adulterated.   In other words, a particular state  of  mind,
which  could be described as guilty or wrongful, could	not,
even if it could be there individually and separately in  a)
particular case, provide the connecting link between the co-
accused	 in  a	trial  for  such  an  offence  in  order  to
constitute the same transaction.  The link, if any, has	 to
be found elsewhere.
</p><p id="p_28">In our opinion, considering the character of the offence and
the   nature   of  the	activities  of	 manufacturers	 and
distributors,  who  generally  deal  in	 bulk,	and  of	 the
ordinary vendor, who sells particular items to the consumer,
the common link, which could provide the unity of purpose or
design so as to weave their separate acts or omissions	into
one  transaction,  has to be their common intention  that  a
particular  article,  found adulterated,  should  reach	 the
consumer as food.  Ignorance of the fact of adulteration  is
immaterial.   In order to justify a joint trial	 of  accused
their common object or intention to sell the article as food
is enough.  In such a case of a strict liability created  by
statute,   for	safeguarding  public  health,	the   mental
connection   between   the  acts  and	omissions   of	 the
manufacturer, the distributor, and the last vendor would  be
provided  simply by the common design or intention  that  an
article	 of food, found to be adulterated, should reach	 and
be  used as food by the consumer.  Each person dealing	with
such an article has to prove that he has shown due care	 and
caution	 by  taking  prescribed steps  in  order  to  escape
criminal liability.  Otherwise, if one may so put it, a mens
rea  shared by them is presumed from a	common	carelessness
exhibited by them.  Again, a sale at an anterior stage by  a
manufacturer or distributor to a vendor and the sale by	 the
vendor to the actual consumer could be viewed as linked with
each other as cause and effect.
</p><p id="p_29">We  think  that	 the activities	 of  the  manufacturer,	 the
distributor   and   the	 retail	 seller	  are	sufficiently
connected,  in	such a case of sale of an  article  of	food
found  to be adulterated, by a unity of purpose and  design,
and, therefore, of a transaction, so as to make their  joint
trial  possible in a suitable case.  But, at the same  time,
we  think that, where, a joinder of several accused  persons
concerned  with	 dealing  in different ways  with  the	same
adulterated article of
10 SC/75-4
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">40</span>
food  at  different stages is likely to	 jeopardise  a	fair
trial,	a  separate trial ought to be ordered.	 It  is	 not
proper	to  acquit or discharge an accused  person  on	this
ground	alone.	The ordering of a separate trial, in a	case
where  prejudice  to  an  accused  from	 a  joint  trial  is
apprehended, is enough.	 Indeed, we can go even further	 and
say  that,  ordinarily, they ought to be  separately  tried.
But, a joint trial of such accused persons is not  ab-initio
illegal.  It can take place in suitable cases.
We may point out that, in <a href="/doc/1149388/" id="a_92">V. N. Kamdar &amp; Anr., v.  Municipal
Corporation of Delhi</a>(1), this Court held (at p. 161) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      "The normal rule under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_93"> the Criminal  Procedure

	      would   indicate	that  joint  trial  is	 the

	      Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao &amp; Anr</a>., [1964]	 (3)

	      trial  is the normal rule, and joint trial  is
	      an  exception when the accused have
	      committed separate offences.  <a href="/doc/1007660/" id="a_97">Section 5(2)</a>  of

	      time  being in force regulating the manner  or
	      place of investigating, inquiring into, trying
	      or otherwise dealing with such offence."
	      <a href="/doc/93388/" id="a_99">In   Kadiri  Kunhahammad	v.  The	  State	  of
	      Madras</a>(2), this Court said (at p. 663)
	      "<a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_100">Section	239(d)</a> authorises a joint  trial  of
	      persons	accused	  of   different    offences
	      committed	  in   the  course   of	  the	same
	      transaction; and there can be no doubt that in
	      deciding	the  question whether  or  not	more
	      persons  than one can be tried together  under
	      the  said section, the criminal Court  has  to
	      consider the nature of the accusation made  by
	      the prosecution.	It would be unreasonable  to
	      suggest that though the accusation made by the
	      prosecution  would  justify a joint  trial  of
	      more persons than one, the validity of such  a
	      trial  could be effectively challenged if	 the
	      said  accusation is not established  according
	      to  law.	 It  is true that,  in	framing	 the
	      charge  against  more  persons  than  one	 and
	      directing	 their	joint trial,  Courts  should
	      carefully	 examine the nature of	the  accusa-
	      tion;  but  if they are satisfied	 that  prima
	      facie  the accusation made shows that  several
	      persons are charged of different offences	 and
	      that  the said offences prima facie appear  to
	      have been committed in the course of the	same

<p id="p_32">offences,  can be viewed as one transaction.   The  question
whether there should be a joint or separate trial in a	case
should	be  determined	on the facts of that  case  and	 the
requirements of justice there.	As pointed out by this Court
in  <a href="/doc/1149388/" id="a_101">V.	N. Kamdar &amp; Anr. v. Municipal Corporation  of  Delhi</a>
(supra)	 the special provisions of <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_102">Section 20A</a> are only	 en-
abling	and do not give rise to a mandatory duty.   They  do
not bar either a separatea  joint trial of  an	accused
person if other conditions are satisfied.Similarly,  <a href="/doc/897083/" id="a_103">Section

reproduced as <a href="/doc/550798/" id="a_104">Section 223(d)</a> of the Criminal Procedure	Code

shewn  that  the requirements of <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_105">Section  239(d)</a>  have	been
fulfilled whenever this provision is sought to be utilised.
The  result  is that we think that, in a  suitable  case,  a
vendor,	 a  distributor, and a manufacturer could  be  tried
together  provided  the, allegations made before  the  Court
show   that  there  are	 connecting  links   between   their
activities  so as to constitute the same  transaction.	 The
connecting links, in a case such as the one before us, could
be provided by: firstly, the fact that a sale at an anterior
stage  could be viewed as the cause of the subsequent  sale;
secondly,  the	allegation that each of the  accused  parted
with the article of food when it was in an adulterated state
; and, thirdly, by the common object of the manufacturer the
distributor,  and the vendor, that the article should  reach
the  consumer  to  be  used as food.   The  third  and	last
mentioned  link seems decisive and must tilt the balance  in
favour	of  legality  of  a  joint  trial  of  the   parties
concerned.   But,  we are also conscious of  the  fact	that
Courts cannot ignore broader requirements of justice.
In the case before us, all that the complaint states is that
the appellant firm had sold the offending ghee to the vendor
Laxmi Narain a day earlier.  The assertion that it was in an
adulterated state at that time was wanting in the complaint.
Although, the charge framed, set out above, states that	 the
sample of ghee sold by Laxmi Narain, to whom it was sold  by
the appellant, was found in an adulterated state, yet, it is
not  stated  there that it was in that very state  when	 the
appellant  bad	sold it to Laxmi Narain.  It  is  true	that
Laxmi Narain successfully pleaded a warranty under which  he
obtained the ghee from the appellant firm.  It is left to be
infester  from these facts that the appellant also sold	 the
ghee  while  it was in an adulterated state.   It  could  be
urged that this would follow from the successful defence  of
Laxmi	Narain.	  The  defects	in  the	 charge	 would	 not
invalidate the trial.  But, we think that a continuation  of
such  an old prosecution is likely to handicap	the  accused
Jagdish	 Chander in his defence.  Even if we were to  assume
that the charge, as framed, implies the allegation that	 the
ghee  was adulterated also when the distributor sold  it  to
the vendor, an enquiry in 1975 into the actual state of	 the
ghee sold by the distributor to the vendor in 1967 would  be
obviously  difficult.	The  appellant,	 content  with	 the
initial	 acquittal, had probably rested on his oars and	 not
taken  the  trouble  to challenge  the	correctness  of	 the
analyst's  report.   And,  even if  that  report  was  quite
correct	 it may not establish the state in which  the  small
quantity  of  ghee  analysed was when it  was  sold  by	 the
distributor.   It  would  impose  undue	 hardship on   the
distributor  to prove, at this distance of time, the  actual
state
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">			     42</span>
of the small quantity of ghee analysed which must have	been
a part of the consignment supplied by the distributor who is
perhaps	  also	relying	 on  the   manufacturers   warranty.
Although  we hold, in agreement with the Delhi	High  Court,
that the joint trial of the appellant with Laxmi Narain	 was
not  illegal, we think that, on the special facts  ,of	this
case,  the  interests of justice will be  better  served  by
quashing such a stale charge because the appellant's defence
will suffer if he is 'called upon to answer it now.
Consequently,  we allow these appeals to the extent that  we
quash the charge against the appellant and order that he  be
discharged.
</p><p id="p_33">ALAGIRISWAMI, J.-I agree with my learned brothers as regards
the final conclusions arrived at and the order proposed, But
I  think  it is necessary to say a few words  on  the  first
question  which was decided by the Full Bench of  the  Delhi
High Court.  The question is as follows
	      "(i) Whether a joint trial of the vendor,	 the
	      distributor and the manufacturer for  offences
	      under the <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_106">Prevention of Food Adulteration Act</a>,
	      1954 is illegal ?
</p><p id="p_34">It  is unnecessary to set out the facts which are  found  in
the  judgment of my learned brothers.  The Full Bench  found
that  the  joint trial of the vendor Laxmi Narain  with	 the
warrantor  Jagdish  Chander (the appellant  before  us)	 was
permissible as-the actions of both these accused form  parts
of  the same transaction, that there was a unity of  purpose
between the manufacturer, the distributor and the vendor  of
the  adulterated  articles  of food sold  furnished  by	 the
purpose	 of  all of them to sell, that an  indication  of  a
unity of purpose was sufficient to establish the sameness of
a  transaction	as  contemplated by s. 239  of	the  Crminal
Procedure Code.	 The charge framed against the appellant  is
as follows
	      "That you, on or about the 22nd day of  August
	      1967 at 12 noon a sample of ghee was purchased
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">	      by  Shri V. P. Anand F.I. from accused  No.  1</span>
	      Lakshmi  Narain and the said ghee was sold  by
	      you  to accused No. 1 Lakshmi Narain on  21-8-
	      1967  and the said sample of ghee in  analysis
	      was  found to be adulterated and	hereby	com-
	      mitted  an  offence punishable  under  <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_107">section
	      7</a>/<a href="/doc/151999671/" id="a_108">16</a>  of the Prevention of  Food	Adulteration
	      Act of 1954 and within my cognizance."
</p><p id="p_35">It  would be noticed that while the charge states  that	 the
sample of ghee purchased from Lakshmi Narain was found to be
adulterated,  there is no allegation that the ghee  sold  by
the  appellant to Lakshmi Narain was adulterated.  While  it
may  be	 readily conceded that the common object  or  common
intention or unity of purpose between the manufacturer,	 the
distributor  and the vendor was to sell the article of	food
sold,  it  is not said that it was to sell  the	 adulterated
article of food.  It is true that it is now well established
that  for  establishing an offence under the  <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_109">Prevention  of
Food Adulteration Act</a> it is not necessary to establish	mens
rea i.e. criminal intention either on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">43</span>
part  of  the manufacturer or distributor or  vendor.	Even
knowledge  on  the  pan of all of them	that  the  food	 was
adulterated is not necessary.  Ignorance on the part of	 any
one of them that the food was adulterated would not  absolve
them  of  liability.   But  before  the	 manufacturer,	 the
distributor and the vendor could be tried jointly it must be
alleged that the manufactured-food was adulterated when	 the
manufacturer  passed  it on to the distributor and,  it	 was
also  adulterated when the distributor passed it on  to	 the
vendor	and that it was adulterated when the vendor sold  it
to  the	 consumer.  It is not necessary to  prove  that	 the
article of food was adulterated at all the three stages	 for
the  purpose  of deciding the validity of the  charge  being
framed against all the three of them provided the  necessary
allegation  is there.  At that stage :the question of  proof
does  not  come in.  The validity of the charge	 has  to  be
decided	 on the, facts put forward as the prosecution  case.
If  it is not, established against any one of them that	 the
article	 of, food manufactured, distributed or sold  by	 him
was  adulterated that person will be acquitted, not  because
the charge was not valid or was defective but because  there
was  no proof to substantiate the charge.  But without	that
allegation there cannot be said to be a unity of purpose  or
common object or common intention on the part of an of	them
to  manufacture,  distribute or sell the  adulterated  food.
The  manufacture, distribution and sale of adulterated	ghee
would  be  the	same  transaction if  it  was  found  to  be
adulterated  at	 all the three stages.	 Otherwise  it	only
means that they were all same transaction only in the  sense
that the common object of all of them is the selling of	 the
ghee.	Selling	 ghee  by itself is  not  an  offence;	only
selling	 adulterated  ghee is an offence.   The	 Delhi	High
Court is not therefore correct in saying that the action  of
both the accused form part of the same transaction and there
was  unity of purpose of the manufacturer,  the	 distributor
and  the vendor furnished by the purpose of all of  them  to
sell  and therefore it was the same transaction and  all  of
them  could  be tried together.	 It would not  be  the	same
transaction  in	 so  far as  selling  adulterated  ghee	 was
concerned  unless the ghee was in fact adulterate  at  every
one  of these stages. If the common purpose all of them	 was
to sell ghee joint trial ofall of them would not be valid
but if it was to sell adulterated gheeit    would	be
valid,If it is alleged that at every one of the stages, that
is  of	manufacture,distribution  and  sale  the  ghee	 was
adulterated  then it would be the same transaction and	they
could all be jointly tried.  In the absence of an allegation
that  the ghee distributed by the appellant to	the  ,Vendor
Lakshmi Narain was adulterated both of them cannot be  tried
together' The manufacturer could also have been tried  along
with   them  only  if  it  is  alleged	that  the  ghee	  he
manufactured  was  adulterated.	  In  the  absence  of	this
'allegation there cannot be a joint trial.  At the. stage of
considering the validity of the charge it is the  allegation
that is material; at the stage of , considering the guilt of
the  parties' it is proof that is material.  In the  present
case  it may be that the appellant could be  prosecuted	 for
giving a false warranty because he had issued a warranty and
the  food sold by the vendor to whom he issued the  warranty
was found to be adulterated.
