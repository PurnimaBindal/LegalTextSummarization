I.A. No. 7395/2009


</pre><p id="p_1">1.     This order will dispose of a temporary injunction application filed by the plaintiff and a
plea under Section 124 Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereafter called "the Act") by the defendant. The
plaintiff shall hereafter be referred to as "Ashland".
</p>


<p id="p_2">I.A. Nos. 7395/2009 &amp; 10983/2009 in CS (OS) 1031/2009                                       Page 1
</p><p id="p_3"> 2.     The plaintiff claims ownership of the trademark "ALL FLEET" and says that it
is registered in favor of "Ashland Inc," worldwide since 1984. Ashland says that "ALL
FLEET" was first registered in the United States of America (USA) in respect of motor
oil in Class-4. It is stated that "ALL FLEET" has been registered in India since September 1994
as No. 639705. Apparently, the mark was owned by Ashland Inc, and according to the suit
averments, was assigned to the plaintiff in this case in 2005. Simultaneously, Ashland claims to
have entered into a license arrangement with Ashland Inc. whereby the latter was conferred the
right to use the trademark "ALL FLEET". It is also clarified that Ashland Inc. is the present
plaintiff's holding or parent company. Ashland relies upon a Deed of Assignment effective from
29.06.2005. It is also stated that the plaintiff has sought for registration of the assignment in its
favor and has produced a copy of the application made to the Trademark Registry, at pages 195-
196 of the list of documents. Ashland says that in India, products under ALL FLEET are
manufactured, distributed and marked by "Valvoline Cummins Ltd", a joint venture concern in
which the Ashland Inc and Cummins Sales and Services (India) Limited have equal
participation. The copy of the license agreement between Ashland Inc and Valvoline Cummins
Ltd, dated 10.12.1997 and the copy of another agreement dated 19.02.2007 are relied upon for
this purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.     In support of its claim, Ashland says that the parent company has been using ALL
FLEET world-wide since 1973 and asserts that Valvoline Cummins Ltd, has been using the mark
in India since 1995. Copies of the invoices in respect of the sales of various engine oils and such
like products have been produced at pages 138 to 189. These pertain to the period 17.10.1997 to
14.04.2006. It is submitted that the aggregate sales figure for the period 1997-98 to 2008-09 (till
February 2009) in respect of ALL FLEET products is to the tune of ` 4,56,50,09,597/-. The
corresponding quantum of sales, it is stated, works out to 5,84,04,397 litres. Ashland has
produced sales figures in respect of other brands such as "ALL FLEET SPECIAL", "ALL
FLEET COOL", "ALL FLEET GOLD", "ALL FLEET PREMIUM", "ALL FLEET TURBO",
"ALL FLEET MULTI", "ALL FLEET EXTRA", "ALL FLEET FIFTY", "ALL FLEET
FORTY" and "ALL FLEET THIRTY", at pages 141-150 of the list of documents. Ashland has
produced copies of Annual Reports of Ashland Inc, for the period 1998-2003. The




I.A. Nos. 7395/2009 &amp; 10983/2009 in CS (OS) 1031/2009                                         Page 2
 Annual Reports of Valvoline Cummins Ltd. for 1997-98 to 2006-07 also has been produced. In
support of the claim that the plaintiff has rights in respect of word mark "ALL FLEET", the
trademark registration certificate in Class-4 (registration dated 09.09.2004 and valid upto 2014)
has been produced at pages 6-7 of the list of documents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.     Ashland submits that in March 2009, it became aware of the sale of engine oils under the
brand "SAVSOL ALL FLEET" by the defendant (hereafter referred to as "the impugned mark").
The suit has reproduced visual depiction of the mark and the container. Ashland urges that the
defendant company is in the same line of business as its affiliate, as such Valvoline Cummins
Ltd cannot possibly deny knowledge of its (Ashlands) existing ALL FLEET trademark or its
source. It is claimed that the defendant's use of ALL FLEET as part of its label and trademark is
aimed at alluring and diverting the plaintiff's customers and also trading on its goodwill. The
plaintiff submits that being the previous owner and prior user of the mark and also owner of ALL
FLEET, which has been in use in the market since 1995, the continued exploitation of the mark
by the defendant would amount to infringement and passing-off and also dilution of its
distinctiveness. It is urged that the Court should, therefore, grant an ad interim temporary
injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.     The plaintiff relies upon the judgments reported as <a href="/doc/701176/" id="a_1">M/s. Modi Threads Limited v. M/s.
Sam Soot Gola Factory &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 1992 (Del) 44 and <a href="/doc/1509899/" id="a_2">Astrazeneca UK Ltd. and Anr. v. Orchid
Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>., 2006 (32) PTC 733 (Del) to submit that as long as the
trademark owner applies for transfer of registration, he cannot be deprived of the right to sue a
party guilty of infringing the registered trademark. The plaintiff relies upon the judgments
reported as <a href="/doc/160904/" id="a_3">Living Media India Limited v. Jitender</a>. V. Jain, 2002 (25) PTC 61 (Del); Globe
Super Parts v. Blue Super Flame Industries, AIR 1986 (Del) 245; <a href="/doc/920066/" id="a_4">Godfrey Phillips India Limited
v. Girnar Food and Beverages</a>, 2005 (30) PTC 1, to say that even if a trademark partly contains
descriptive words, as long as the plaintiff can establish their secondary usage or acquired
distinctiveness, the Court would extend injunctive protection.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     In response to the defendant's argument that the suit should be stayed under Section 124
since an application for rectification is pending, and that the mark is inherently descriptive and,




I.A. Nos. 7395/2009 &amp; 10983/2009 in CS (OS) 1031/2009                                         Page 3
 therefore, not entitled to be protected, the plaintiff relies upon the decision reported as Health
and Glow Retailing Private Limited v. Dhiren Krishna Paul, 2007 (35) PTC 474 to say that such
objection can be raised only at the pre-registration stage. The plaintiff also relies upon
Lakshmikant. V. Patel v. Chetan. B. Shah, 2002 (3) SCC 65, to submit that rival or competitor in
the mark, who sells his goods or services under a trademark which closely resembles or is
identical with the plaintiffs' does so at the peril of an injunction as the Court will consider the
resulting injury to reputation to its (the plaintiffs') goods by such association. The plaintiff
submits that having regard to the principles enumerated in <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_5">Midas Hygiene Industries v. Sudhir
Bhatia</a>, 2004 (28) PTC 121, the Court should grant the injunction claimed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.       The defendant in the written statement resists the suit and the claim for temporary
injunction, besides urging that the Court should stay the suit as it has preferred an application for
rectification of the Trademark Register. The defendant claims that its use of ALL FLEET does
not amount to infringement or passing-off, so as to attract Section 29 of the Act. In essence, the
defence is that use of ALL FLEET is descriptive of the goods, i.e. mobile, engine oils and that
registration of the mark does not clothe Ashland or any other alleged trademark owner with
exclusive rights. Ashlands' right to maintain the suit is also questioned; the submission in this
respect is that the assignment in the plaintiff's (Ashlands') favor has not been registered and so
long as such event does not occur, a suit for alleged infringement does not lie.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.       The defendant's submission that Ashland Inc and Valvoline Cummins Ltd are different
entities and, therefore, cannot constitute one concern so as to entitle the plaintiff to claim user in
respect of the ALL FLEET trademark. The defendant also denies that the plaintiff has an
established reputation in respect of the ALL FLEET mark. It is pointed-out in addition that in the
Trademark Register of the United States Patent Trademark Office, the ALL FLEET mark of
VALVOLINE, Ashland Oil Inc had included a disclaimer to the effect that "no claim is made to
the exclusive right to use "ALL FLEET" apart from the mark as shown". The defendants,
therefore, urge that "ALL FLEET" is a combination of many words and under no circumstance
can exclusivity be granted, since use of those words as in the present instance, describes the
goods.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.       It is urged that registration of a mark only entitles its owner to urge the prima facie nature


I.A. Nos. 7395/2009 &amp; 10983/2009 in CS (OS) 1031/2009                                           Page 4
 of its validity. As to whether it has acquired distinctiveness in terms of the allegation in a suit is a
matter of evidence that has to be carefully considered by the Court. The defendants rely upon the
decision reported as <a href="/doc/276675/" id="a_6">Lowenbrau AG and Anr. v. Jagpin Breweries Ltd. and Anr., (I.A. No</a>. 11355
in Suit No.1810/2007) decided on 14.01.2009, for the submission that the Court adopts a very
circumspective approach while granting or refusing injunction in respect of goods traded under
descriptive marks. A similar decision in <a href="/doc/99626708/" id="a_7">Clinique Laboratories LLC &amp; Anr. v. Gufic Limited &amp;
Anr</a>., (decided on 09.04.2009 in I.A. No. 15425/2008 (in Suit No. 2607/2008) is relied upon. It is
urged lastly that having regard to the principles underlined in Section 9, the registration claimed
by the plaintiff was erroneously granted and the Court should take note of such fact and stay the
suit under Section 124 of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.     The above discussion discloses that "ALL FLEET" mark was registered in India and has
been used since 1995. The documentary materials on record show that the sales turn-over for
1997-98 was ` 7,42,42,288/- and the corresponding quantity of engine oil sold was 15,08,440
litres. This had increased, in 2008-09 (up to February 2009) to a             turn-over figure of     `
7,64,47,920/- and corresponding sales figure was 78,13,795 litres. The trademark registration
was effective from 09.09.1994 in favor of Ashland Inc. The plaintiff claims to be assignee and in
turn urges that a joint venture concern between Ashland Incorporated, its licensee and Valvoline
Cummins Ltd. has been using the mark.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.     Now, the copies of label containing Ashland's mark are on record. The word-mark ALL
FLEET has been used in conjunction with "VALVOLINE" and the letter "V" has been depicted
prominently. The question is whether the use of the words ALL FLEET by the defendant, who
concededly are not registered users and who also do not claim to be prior users of the mark
amounts to infringement or passing-off. Both the plaintiff and the defendant use the mark in
relation to engine and motor oils, lubricants and allied products. The defendant's mark is
"SAVSOL ALL FLEET TURBO".
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.     The Court will first address to the question as to whether the plaintiff can maintain the
suit since Ashland Inc was the first owner and the present use of the mark is by Valvoline
Cummins Ltd. - a 50:50 joint venture between Ashland Inc, and Cummins Sales and Service




I.A. Nos. 7395/2009 &amp; 10983/2009 in CS (OS) 1031/2009                                            Page 5
 India Ltd. Here, the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1496606/" id="a_8">George V. Records</a>, <a href="/doc/220598/" id="a_9">SARL v. Kiran Jogani and
Anr</a>., 2004 (28) PTC 347 is instructive. The Court had in that case held that for the purpose of
trademark usage, it is open to one corporate entity within a group to rely on the usage by a
company or concern which is part of the same group. The Court relied upon the ruling in Revlon
v. Cripps &amp; Lee, 1980 FSR 85 and Food Distributors v. London Borough of Tower Hamlets,
1976 AHER 462 where it was held that

       "there is evidence of general tendency to ignore the separate legal entities of the
       various companies within a group and to look instead at the economic entity of
       the whole group."
</p><p id="p_14">Here the plaintiff has placed materials on record to show that Ashland Inc, was the original
trademark owner and that it assigned ownership to the present plaintiff. The averments and
materials also point to an arrangement with Cummins Sales and Service Limited for use of the
mark by Valvoline Cummins Ltd. In the circumstances, the plaintiff is prima facie entitled to
maintain and institute the present suit.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.    The next question is whether the suit for claiming infringement or passing-off at the
behest of the plaintiff, assignee of the trademark, is maintainable in the absence of registration of
such transfer. Here too, the Court does not have to revisit the issue, as the Division Bench had
observed in <a href="/doc/1509899/" id="a_10">Astrazeneca UK Ltd. and Anr. v. Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>., 2007
(34) PTC 469 (Del), that so long as an application is pending with the Registrar of Trademarks,
the rights emanating from the assignment cannot be denied to the assignee, who might want to
assert it. The Court went on to hold that registration of such assignment by itself does not confer
title but is merely evidences it. In these circumstances, it is held that the objection as to
maintainability on the ground that the assignment in favor of Ashland, the plaintiff is not
recorded is unmerited; same is, therefore, rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.    The next issue which the Court has to consider is whether use of the expression or
trademark "ALL FLEET" is inherently descriptive so as to disentitle the plaintiff for an
injunction. There is no dispute that the mark has been in existence and use since 1995. The
plaintiff has also demonstrated concurring sales of its brands displaying the same trademark. The
plaintiff has also adverted to the advertisement and publicity expenditure incurred in this respect.
The principles applicable for grant of an injunction in case of a composite suit for infringement

I.A. Nos. 7395/2009 &amp; 10983/2009 in CS (OS) 1031/2009                                         Page 6
 and passing-off have been enumerated in Astrazeneca UK Ltd. and Anr. (supra). Long ago in
<a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_11">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceuticals Laboratories</a> AIR 1965 SC
980, the Supreme Court held that if the use by the defendant of the impugned mark is claimed to
infringe the plaintiff's mark and is shown to be in the course of trade, the Court has to consider
the claim by examination of the two marks and that if the two marks are identical, no further
question would arise. This was restated in <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_12">Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara Engineering
Co</a>., AIR 1970 SC 1649 as

       "In an action for infringement where the defendant's trade mark is identical with
       the plaintiff's mark, the Court will not enquire whether the infringement is such as
       is likely to deceive or cause confusion. But where the alleged infringement
       consists of using not the exact mark on the Register, but something similar to it,
       the test of infringement is the same as in an action for passing off. In other words,
       the test as to likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of marks
       is the same both in infringement and passing off actions."
</p>
<p id="p_17">15.    The defendants here did not argue that the marks are dissimilar. Indeed, the plaintiff's
mark is a word mark and is used as a part of the label under which the subject products are sold.
The defendant too uses the same word mark as part of its label to sell the same class of goods.
The marks are identical; the goods are the same and fall within the same class in the Schedule to
the Trademarks Act. The defendant has also not argued as to what impelled it to use "ALL
FLEET" mark or expression as part of the label. Its written statement is silent as to the point in
time since when it has been using the mark. Beyond denying the suit averments, the defendant
does not set-up a case for prior user or put-up any defence as to the original usage of the words
"ALL FLEET" with the expression "SAVSOL".
</p>
<p id="p_18">16.    In these circumstances, the question that the Court would have to consider is whether the
defendant's further contention that "ALL FLEET" being inherently descriptive, disentitles the
plaintiff to any injunctive relief and that the mark itself is liable to rectification for which an
application is pending before the concerned trademark authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17.    The word mark ALL FLEET is a combination of two common words. Further "ALL
FLEET" can conjure up not one, but several meanings. The world "FLEET" means a group of
ships sailing together or a country's navy or a number of vehicles or aircraft operating together
(Concise Oxford English Dictionary Revised 10th Edition). It also implies, as an adjective -
</p>

<p id="p_20">I.A. Nos. 7395/2009 &amp; 10983/2009 in CS (OS) 1031/2009                                          Page 7
 someone who is fast and nimble; some of its lesser known meanings include "in shallow waters"
or "of small depth" and the idea of flowing or swimming. Used in conjunction with "ALL", the
two words can virtually imply hundreds of ideas. In the context of cars or automobiles, "ALL
FLEET" prima facie would lead to the natural meaning of the entire fleet of vehicles. However,
if it is used in relation to a product, then alone would the reader's mind be focused to the
suitability of such product or service to the entire (i.e. all) fleet. It is thus apparent that while
"ALL FLEET" is undoubtedly a conjunction of two common words, it does not and cannot have
one natural descriptive manner as is ascribed by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_21">18.    In the present case, the Court is not examining whether the registration granted to "ALL
FLEET" requires to be cancelled. What has to be considered is whether the defendant's usage of
"ALL FLEET" infringes the plaintiff's mark or amounts to passing-off. The judgment in Health
and Glow Retailing Private Limited (supra) states that such objections as to registration can be
considered at a pre-registration stage and would not be admissible in the Court. The Madras High
Court observed there as follows -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "the objection that the trademark of the plaintiff was not an invented word and
       hence not entitled to protection could have been raised only at a pre-registration
       stage, but after registration, a person is entitled to raise such an objection only by
       taking recourse to the remedies available under the Act (such as revocation of the
       Register) and not by committing an infringement. Otherwise, the proprietor of a
       registered mark would have no more protection than the proprietor of an
       unregistered mark."
</blockquote><p id="p_22">19.    In view of the above proposition, which this Court is in agreement with, it is held that the
defendant's argument about the Ashland's disentitlement to injunction on the ground that the
mark is descriptive, cannot be countenanced. It is accordingly rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_23">20.    That brings this Court to a consideration of the defendant's submission that the suit
requires to be stayed by virtue of Section 124 of the Trademarks Act. Section 124 reads as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_24">       "XXXXXX                        XXXXXX                         XXXXXX

the Intellectual Properties Appellate Board (IPAB) and that the same is pending. The plaintiff
argues that such an application has to be dealt with in terms of Section 124(i)(a)(ii) since
rectification proceeding was filed after institution of the present suit. This Court is of the
opinion, having regard to the ruling in Clinique Laboratories LLC &amp; Anr. (supra) and the clear
terms of Section 124 (1) that it possesses discretion to accept or reject the defendant's request for
stay only if no proceedings are pending and upon satisfaction that the plea regarding invalidity of
the concerned mark is prima facie tenable. This is emphasized by the fact that the defendant's
plea of existence of a registration can be equally subjected or counter-claimed or can be equally
subjected to a stay under Section 124 (1)(i). In other words, the rigor of a statutory stay would
apply once it is brought to the notice of the Court that a rectification proceeding is pending. The
Court would be within its discretion to consider the tenability of the challenge only if in the
absence of a rectification proceeding, upon the plea raised by either of the parties, under Clause
</p><p id="p_39">(ii) of Section 124 (i)(b). However, in either case, the Court is not precluded from making an
interlocutory order, including granting injunctive relief under Section 124(5).

<p id="p_40">22.      Having regard to the above conclusions, this Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff's
application for ad-interim temporary injunction has to be granted. The defendant, its

FLEET" or any other deceptively similar mark or any other mark identical to it, either singularly

terms.
