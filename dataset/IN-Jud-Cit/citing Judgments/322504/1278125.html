learnt that the respondents have selected the 4th respondent as the 'successful

bidder'. Thereafter, when they contacted the Minister for Ports, it is asserted

<p id="p_18">              9.   When the Writ Petition       came up for consideration on

03.6.2008, the learned single judge had directed the State Government 'to

place on record the report of the High Level Committee and the 3rd respondent

was directed to place on record its evaluation report regarding the petitioner's

bid'. These directions were complied with and the necessary documents were

following aspects:-
</p>
<p id="p_26">1. Original Consortium Agreement is submitted without notary attestation

     for the signatures of Mr. Peter Martin of M/s Peter Frankel and

     Partners and Mr. Minoo Pardiwala of M/s Zoom Developers;

          amendment to RFP for minimum equity stake of the Lead Member

          to be 26% in the SPC instead of 26% in the consortium in the SPC

          was issued in 01.01.2008 while the consortium agreement was

          entered in October 2007.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">    ii. Portia Management Services had signed consortium Agreement on

          behalf of Peel Ports, but Peel ports Ltd is not a member of the

          consortium (Portia Management Services is a subsidiary of Peel

          Ports ltd, but need to be authorized by Peel Ports Ltd).

</blockquote><p id="p_30">4.   Accordingly, we had pointed the above discrepancy to the Bidder

    together with the stipulations in RFP;
</p>
<p id="p_31">5. Towards clarifications to above, the Bidder furnished a Consortium

    Agreement dated 11.03.2008 drawing reference to Consortium

    Agreement dated 04.10.2007 submitted with the original bid documents

    and also superseding the same towards complying with the provisions

    of RFP.
</p>
<p id="p_32">              14. Copy of the minutes of EC on 08.04.2008 is produced as

Exhibit R2(e) and with reference to the bid submitted by the petitioner it is

noted that the responsiveness of its bid needs to be ascertained keeping in view

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WA No.1460/08                            9</span>


of the agreement dated 04.10.2007 and in this circumstance EC thought it

appropriate to obtain the opinion of Law Secretary before opening their

technical bid. It was also decided to open the bids submitted          by the

Consortiums lead by Nagarjuna Construction Co. Ltd, Hydrabad, Videocon

Industries Ltd. Mumbai, India and        Lanco Kondapalli Power Pvt. Ltd.,

Hydrabad, India who submitted the responsive bids and met the stipulated

Qualification Criteria.
</p>
<p id="p_33">               15. The Evaluation Committee, again met on 06.05.2008 and a

copy of the minutes is produced as Exhibit R2(f). In this meeting, Law

Secretary also attended as a special invitee for the purpose of discussing the

responsiveness of the bid submitted by the petitioner. Opinion of the Law

secretary is as follows;
</p>
<p id="p_34"> "2.2.1. Certain defects pointed out (by) the Legal consultants in the original

        consortium agreement with reference to Notary attestation and

        stamping requirements have since been reported to be rectified. The

        same may be confirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_35"> 2.2.2. It is informed that the consortium agreement was entered into between

        the parties in October 2007. The amendments to the RFP has been

        issued only in January 2008 (fixing 26% of the minimum equity stake

        for the lead member in the SPC instead of 26% of the consortium in

        the SPC). Hence it is reported that consortium agreement dated

        04.10.2007 submitted by the bidder has been superseded by a new

        consortium agreement dated 11.03.2008 so as to comply with the

        stipulations in the RFP.
</p>
<p id="p_36"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">WA No.1460/08                              10</span>




</p><p id="p_37">                                     Opinion

       The amendment made in the RFP can be carried out in the original

       consortium agreement executed in October 2007 itself by making

       suitable modifications to the deed through a supplemental agreement

       executed in October 2007 would not be lost. Now the consortium

       agreement dated 04.10.2007 is a non-entity. At the same time

       Consortium Agreement dated 11.03.2008 cannot be taken as submitted

       along with the bid proposal.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
2.2.3. Attention is invited to the consortium agreement dated 04.10.2007

       wherein M/s Portia Management Services has signed as a           party    on

       behalf of M/s Peel Ports Ltd. It is reported that M/s Peel Ports is not a

       member of the consortium. But it is has been clarified that M/s Portia

       Management Services is a subsidiary of Peel Ports Ltd. However, no

       such authorization is found in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
2.2.4. Now in the new consortium agreement executed on 11.03.2008 the party

       to the consortium ie M/s Peel Ports Ltd has disappeared. M/s Portia

       Management Services has come in the picture as a party to the

       consortium agreement. Since such a change has been made after

       submission of the original bid documents as a participating consortium

       in the Bid Process it has     not been explained under whose authority

       such a change in the consortium has been made.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
2.2.5. As per eligibility criteria for the Bidder as specified in the RFP (cl.3.5) it

       has been stated that all members of the shall be jointly and severally

       liable for the execution of the project in accordance with the terms of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">WA No.1460/08                                11</span>


       the License Agreement and a statement to this effect shall be included in

       the Consortium Agreement. But instead of incorporating such a clause

       in the consortium agreement, it has been mentioned therein that the

       members of the consortium shall be jointly and severally responsible at

       every stage of the implementation of the project (cl. 7). It may be noted

       that 'liability' is different from 'responsibility'. "

       In view of this legal opinion of Law Secretary, Evaluation Committee

unanimously concluded that the bid submitted by the petitioners is

non responsive in terms of RFP provision.
</p>
<p id="p_41">               16. Pleadings in the reply affidavit filed by petitioner:

                  In the reply affidavit filed by the petitioner it is averred at the

outset that the 'Law Secretary has been invited as a special invitee by the

respondents in the meeting held on 08.04.2008 and 06.05.2008 and based on

his opinion the evaluation committee which till that time found the petitioner to

be qualified as per the RFP unanimously changed their opinion'.

</p><p id="p_42">               17. In response to para 2.2.2. of Exhibit R2(f), it is averred that

the consortium agreement is permitted to be submitted by the bidders in own

format and the law secretary himself opined that amendment could be carried

out by way of a supplementary deed; that had the 3rd respondent made any

suggestion to the effect of change in percentage of equity, suitable

modifications could have been made earlier; that the 3rd respondent was fully

satisfied with the new consortium agreement as vide Exhibit P15, they asked

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WA No.1460/08                              12</span>


the petitioner to get the new agreement stamped in accordance with law; that it

is factually wrong on the part of law secretary to note that 'in view of the

supersession of the earlier consortium agreement for the new consortium

agreement the consortium agreement dated 04.10.2007 is a non-entity' as he

earlier approved the same as a supplementary agreement that complied with the

provisions of law; that it is specifically admitted by the EC in cl.4.2(a) that all

the bidders furnished the information "as asked for and within time" and thus

they have admitted that all the documents were submitted in time.

</p><p id="p_43">              18. In response to para 2.2.3. of Exhibit R2(f), it is stated that at

no point of time was any authorization sought from petitioner regarding the fact

that M/s Portia Management Services is a subsidiary of Peel ports Ltd; that a

perusal of Exhibits P11 and P12(a) would make it clear that Portia

Management Services is a part of Peel Ports Group and EC dated 25.03.2008

also confirms as per minutes of the meeting that Peel Ports Ltd is not a member

of Consortium; that no clarification is sought from the petitioner with reference

to the relationship between Portia Management Services and Peel ports; that

Exhibit P9 was not taken note of or not considered by the Law Secretary before

forming his opinion.
</p>
<p id="p_44">              19. In response to para 2.2.4. of Exhibit R2(f), it is stated that the

observation to the effect that Portia Management Services has come into

picture as a party to the consortium agreement after the submission of bid

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">WA No.1460/08                               13</span>


documents is not correct; that in the cover letter dated 31.01.2008 submitted by

the petitioner it is specifically stated that Portia Management Services is shown

as a consortium member and in the column (f) which deals with ownership the

answer given is "wholly owned subsidiary of Peel Ports Ltd UK" and similarly

in column 2 regarding brief description of the company it has been stated that

"Portia Management Services is the international arm of Peel Ports"; that the

reference in consortium agreement that 'Portia Management Services on behalf

of Peel Ports Ltd' is only intended that the Portia Management Services is part

of Peel Ports and the certificates annexed would show that the supporting

documents are that of the Portia Management Services; that right from

beginning it was M/s Portia Management Services which was the consortium

member and not Peel Ports.
</p>
<p id="p_45">              20. In response to para 2.2.5. of Exhibit R2(f), it is stated that

the Law Secretary adopted a hyper-technical approach while drawing

distinction between the words "liability" and "responsibility".

</p><p id="p_46">              21.     It is also stated in the reply that the fact that respondents

proceeded with other three bids would show that they are not interested to

consider the bid of petitioner; that the petitioner's case was taken up for

consideration only on 06.05.2008 by which time the EC has already considered

the technical bid of the other three consortium and had issued notice to them

that their financial bid would be opened on 14.05.2008; that as per cl 21.3 of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">WA No.1460/08                             14</span>


Ext. P4 it has been clearly stated that the time and date of opening the financial

proposals shall be informed to the eligible bidders giving minimum 7 days

prior notice and therefore the meeting held on 06.05.2008 was an empty

formality; that the entire bid evaluation process was completed with undue

haste, since the Government wanted to include the awarding of Vizhinjam

Project as their achievement since the 2nd anniversary of LDF government was

on 16.05.2008 and this was highlighted as the Ministry's biggest achievement.

statement and reply essentially supporting the contentions of the Petitioner.

<p id="p_50">                    The learned single judge, as evident from para 14 of the

judgment, considers the correctness or otherwise of the opinion of the law

secretary and proceeded to decide the case. The three points considered by the

law secretary viz; i. Consortium Agreement dated 04.10.2007 was signed by

the M/s Portia Management Services on behalf of M/s Peel Ports Ltd without

any authorization; ii. new Consortium Agreement dated 11.03.2008 was singed

by M/s Peel Ports Ltd and M/s Portia Management Services has disappeared.

This change of member was made after submission of original bid without any

authority and iii. Instead of making the joint and several 'liability' clause in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">WA No.1460/08                              15</span>


Consortium Agreement, only a 'responsibility' clause was included by the

petitioner's consortium.
</p>
<p id="p_51">                24. The court has elaborately considered the jurisprudential

difference between the terminologies 'liability' and 'responsibility' in paragraphs

15 to 26 and approves the opinion of law secretary after finding that petitioner's

consortium is not permitted to make such changes in the agreement against

cl. 3.5 of Section IV of RFP. It is also noted that there is fundamental

difference between the words 'liability' and 'responsibility'. After considering

the judgments in <a href="/doc/55804/" id="a_3">WB State Electricity Board v. Patel Engineering Co</a>,

2001 (2) SCC 451, <a href="/doc/884513/" id="a_4">Tata Cellular v. Union of India</a> AIR 1996 SC 11 and <a href="/doc/722054/" id="a_5">Air

India Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd</a>. 2000 (2) SCC 617, it is found

that judicial interference in this case is not warranted and as such the action of

EC cannot be interfered with. In paragraphs 27 to 29, the Court essentially

considers the aspect relating to the change of parties in the new Agreement

after submission of bid and found that it is not permissible in the context of the

RFP and that the expression 'acting on behalf' does not permit substitution of

parties. Opinion of Law Secretary was approved in this regard and also on

these reasonings, the writ petition was dismissed.

by the Law Secretary, a direction was issued to the Law Secretary by this Court

to explain the circumstance in which he participated in the EC meetings on

08.04.2008 and 06.05.2008 and also to explain as to why an advice was given

in spite of the fact that it was not an inter-departmental reference for legal

advice as contemplated in para 112 of the Kerala Secretariat Office Manual.

the documents are voluminous, a detailed examination of the documents are

required; that upon his opinion, the EC decided to evaluate the Qualification

Criteria of the appellant and opening of their Technical Bid after receiving

opinion; that after receiving documents the file was sent to his subordinates for

scrutiny and the Deputy Secretary (Law) drafted the opinion; that the

Additional Secretary (Law) noted in the file that an 'off the record advice / gist

of points' may be furnished to the Chief Secretary as the request cannot be

taken as an inter-departmental reference for legal advice as contemplated in

para 112 of the Kerala Secretariat Office Manual; that he approved the advice

that since the request of opinion in the instant case was not a routine reference

through file, the advice was not given under signature and seal; that an 'off the

record advice' was given for consideration of the meeting of the Committee;

that as per rules, request for advice from Head of Departments or Government

bodies is to be routed through the concerned Administrative Department; that

nothing in the Secretariat Manual prohibit giving advice even in the absence of

a reference from an Administrative Department; that it is usual for the

Minister / Chief Secretary requests for an advice on a legal point for the

purpose of Committees of this nature; that in response to Annexure 2 letter

dated 05.05.2008, he participated in EC meeting on 06.05.2008 as a Special

invitee and that the Committee after discussions at length ultimately concluded

that the Bid submitted by the Consortium led by the appellant is non responsive

secretary is approved; that non-consideration of the technical and financial

proposal of the appellant is unjustified, arbitrary and illegal; that the appellant

is unjustifiably excluded from the zone of consideration; that the entire exercise

by respondents 1 and 2 was done in a clandestine manner to bestow undue

favour on the fourth respondent; that a strategically and economically

significant multi-crore project is awarded to a bidder whose bid is eight times

less favorable than that of the Appellant at a loss of about Rs. 332 crore to the

public exchequer; that the authorities cited by the learned single judge is not

applicable to the facts of the case and are irrelevant; that opinion of law

secretary is vitiated by mala fides; that at no point of time the advisers or the

EC pointed out that the use of expression 'liability' instead of 'responsibility' is

to be incorporated in the agreement whereas in the case of other bidders, such

suggestions were not made; that right from the beginning of bidding process,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">WA No.1460/08                              31</span>


Portia Management Services was a party to the bid; that it was made very clear

that Portia was the subsidiary of Peel Ports; that the change in new agreement

was made in compliance of Exhibit P9; that the opinion of Law Secretary

vitiated the entire process of decision making by the EC and he ought not to

have been permitted to participate in EC meeting as a Special Invitee; that the

respondent acted in a cunning manner so as to exclude the consideration of

appellant's bid and therefore it is prayed to allow the Writ Appeal.

</p><p id="p_113">              30. Arguments advanced by the learned Advocate General:

</p><p id="p_114">                     The learned Advocate General would submit, that, as per

Clause 3.4 of RFP Vol.I, only the lead member of a consortium can be changed

with prior written consent of the Sponsor. The said clause further elaborated

that applicant is free to select the other members of the consortium and finalise

the shareholders of the consortium before the submission of proposal.       RFP

does not permit change of consortium member after the submission of the

proposal.
</p>
<p id="p_115">               31. It is submitted, that, the appellant along with their proposal

submitted the Consortium Agreement dated 4.10.2007. In the said Consortium

Agreement, Portia Management Services Ltd. signed on behalf of Peel Ports

Ltd.. The phrase, "on behalf of" connotes an agency, which brings about the

relationship of principal and agent. It means that Portia signed the consortium

agreement as an agent of Peel Ports Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_116"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">WA No.1460/08                            32</span>


</p><p id="p_117">                32. It is further submitted that, on 05.1.2008, the RFP was

amended. The amendment to RFP was with regard to minimum equity stake

of the lead member in the Special Purpose Company to be formed. Since the

appellant's consortium agreement was executed prior to the amendment of

RFP, in the Consortium Agreement it was not stated that the lead member shall

hold a minimum equity of 26% in the Special Purpose Company. To meet the

above requirement and the notarization of signatures as also the stamping of

Consortium Agreement, the appellant, vide Ext.P9, was requested to collect

the original consortium agreement. In the fresh consortium agreement dated

11.3.2008, Portia Management Services Ltd. signed the agreement on its own

behalf. In the original consortium agreement, Portia signed on behalf of Peel

Ports Ltd., and was an agent of Peel Ports. In the fresh consortium agreement,

the words "on behalf of Peel Ports Ltd." were deleted and Portia signed the

consortium agreement as a member of the Consortium. Hence there was a

change in the consortium membership, which is impermissible as per Clause

3.4 of RFP Vol.I. This is an incurable fatal defect.
</p>
<p id="p_118">              33. It is further submitted that, in the Statement of Qualification

form, the appellant had shown the financial details of MHDC (taken over by

Peel Ports) and also the financial details of Peel Ports. If Peel Ports were not

the Consortium Member, their financial statements need not have been

submitted along with the bid.
</p>
<p id="p_119"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">WA No.1460/08                               33</span>


</p><p id="p_120">               According to the appellant, Portia is the subsidiary of Peel Ports

and hence the financial details of Peel Ports was submitted. Even assuming

that Portia is a subsidiary of Peel Ports and was the Consortium member as per

the original agreement, this contention is without any basis. A company being

an artificial person having separate legal entity cannot rely on the financials of

its holding company to meet the qualification criteria in a bidding process. But

for the financial statement of Peel Ports, the Consortium led by the appellant

would not have met the financial qualification criteria as on the date of

submission of the bid, i.e. on 31.1.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_121">               It may be relevant in this regard to state that the Balance Sheet

and Profit and Loss Account of the appellant for the year ending 30.9.2007 was

adopted only on 20.3.2008; much after the last date for submission of bid.

According to the appellant, Portia has always been the member of the

Consortium and not the Peel Ports Ltd.             But the supporting documents

produced to meet the qualification criteria were that of Peel Ports Ltd.. Instead

of Peel Ports accounts, if the accounts of the Portia were submitted (if Portia is

Consortium member as claimed by the appellant) along with the bid, the

appellant would not have passed the financial qualification criteria and on that

sole ground itself their bid is liable to be declared as non-responsive.

</p><p id="p_122">               34. It is submitted that, a reading of the original as well as the

fresh consortium agreements would demonstrate beyond any doubt that there

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">WA No.1460/08                           34</span>


has been a change in the membership of the Consortium led by the appellant

after the submission of the bid on 31.1.2008. In view of Clause 3.4 of RFP

Vol.1, change of consortium members after submission of the bid is

impermissible.    There was inconsistency between the proposal and the

supporting documents which is a ground under Clause 22.1(e) of the RFP Vol.I

to declare a bid non-responsive.
</p>
<p id="p_123">              35. It is further submitted that, the appellant has stated that the

words "on behalf of Peel Ports" was deleted as required by the Advisor. The

Advisor has not required the appellant to declare the words "on behalf of Peel

Ports". The Advisor, vide Ext.P9 letter, brought to the notice of the appellant

that Portia Management Services has signed the consortium agreement on

behalf of Peel Ports Ltd. but the Peel Ports Ltd is not a member of the

Consortium.     It was further observed in Ext.P9 letter, that         necessary

documentations from various consortium members authorising the signatories

of different documents have not been submitted along with the bid. It is

therefore clear that the appellant was never directed to delete the words "on

behalf of Peel Ports" in the original consortium agreement. Only defects were

required to be cured. Instead of producing the document from the Peel Ports

Ltd. authorising Portia to sign the consortium agreement, the appellant

produced resolution of Portia itself and to match it with the consortium

agreement, the words "on behalf of Peel Ports" was omitted in the fresh

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">WA No.1460/08                            35</span>


consortium agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_124">             Clause 3.5 of RFP Volume I says that all members of consortium

shall be jointly and severally liable for the execution of the Project in

accordance with the terms of the Licence Agreement and a statement to this

effect shall be included in the Consortium/Shareholder's agreement.

Clause 4.1 (e) provides that the consortium agreement shall be specific to this

proposal and clearly allocate responsibilities and duties between the members

and lead member, including percentage of shareholding.        The said Clause

further provides that notwithstanding this, the consortium members shall be

jointly and severally liable to Licensor for implementation of the Project. The

learned Advocate General invites our attention to clause 13.4 of RFP Vol.I,

which reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           "13.4: In case of consortium, members of the consortium shall

    enter into Consortium agreement for the purpose of submitting the

    Proposal.   The consortium agreement shall contain inter alia, the

    following provisions:-
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_5">   a)     xxx

    b)    Outline of the proposed roles and responsibilities of each

          consortium member at various stages.

    c)    Joint and several liability of the consortium members for

          implementation of the Project.

    d)    xxx

    e)    xxx

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">WA No.1460/08                             36</span>


</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_8">The Consortium agreement entered into among the members of the

Consortium should be specific to this Project and should contain the above

requirements, failing which the proposal shall be treated as non-responsive.</blockquote><p id="p_125">

</p><p id="p_126">              36. It is then submitted that the requirement of incorporating the

joint and several liability clause in the consortium agreement has been stated

with emphasis in various clauses of RFP. This was an essential condition as

per RFP documents. Whether a condition is essential or collateral is to be

ascertained with reference to the consequence of non-compliance thereof. If

non-fulfilment of the requirement results in the rejection of tender, it would be

an essential condition. (2002) 6 SCC 315, Paragraph 6.       The consequence of

non-incorporation of joint and several liability clause was also stated in

Clause 13.4 of RFP Vol.I. Bidders were sufficiently warned that the failure to

incorporate joint and several liability clause in consortium agreement would

result in treating the proposal as non-responsive.     Hence it was an essential

requirement in the consortium agreement. It is not in dispute that the original

as well as the fresh consortium agreements submitted by the appellant did not

contain a statement to the effect that the members of the Consortium shall be

jointly and severally liable to Licensor for the implementation of the Project.

</p><p id="p_127">              37. It is further submitted that, it was the duty of the appellant to

ensure that the documents it had submitted complies with the requirement of

RFP. In three different clauses of RFP Vol.I, it was clearly mentioned that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">WA No.1460/08                             37</span>


consortium agreement should contain a statement to the effect that the

members of the consortium shall jointly and severally liable for the

implementation of the project. Consequence of non-incorporation of such a

statement in the consortium agreement was also stated in clause 13.4 of RFP

Vol.1.
</p>
<p id="p_128">              38. It is further stated that, paragraph 8 of RFP Volume 1,

<a href="/doc/657817/" id="a_8">Section 1</a> warns the bidders that, failure to comply with the requirement of

RFP and submission of proposal shall be at the bidders own risk.                 In

paragraph 9 of the RFP Volume I, <a href="/doc/657817/" id="a_9">Section 1</a>, the bidders were required to

carefully review the contents of RFP; seek necessary clarifications, if any; and

raise questions about ambiguities and concerns.         Clause 14 of RFP Vol.I

Section IV, requests the bidders to examine carefully the contents of all the

documents provided and states that failure to comply with the requirement of

RFP will be at the bidder's own risk Therefore, the responsibility of making the

bid complaint with RFP provisions solely rests with the bidders.

</p><p id="p_129">              The Sponsor, of course, can call for clarification from the

bidders. But neither the Sponsor nor does the Licensor owe any duty or

responsibility to the bidder to point out the vital defects in the documents it had

submitted. In an international tender of this nature, where the bidders have the

assistance of legal experts, they are expected to comply with the essential

requirements of RFP. The degree of care required in such bidding is greater

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">WA No.1460/08                             38</span>


than in ordinary local bids for small works (2001) 2 SCC 451, Para 23, 24 and

</p><p id="p_130">31. The Supreme Court had held in (1990) 2 SCC 488 Para15 that, the party

issuing the tender has the right to punctiliously and rigidly enforce them.

</p><p id="p_131">              39. Learned Advocate General points out that, according to the

appellant, examination of the proposal should have been undertaken by the

Sponsor and not by the Evaluation Committee. This contention, which has no

foundation in the pleadings, is raised referring to Clause 22 of RFP Vol.I,

Section IV.
</p>
<p id="p_132">              40. It is also stated that the licensor is not powerless to evaluate

the proposals submitted by the bidders. The Licensor's power can be traced to

paragraph 5 of RFP Volume 1, Section I.             The Government being the

Licensor, constituted Bid Evaluation Committee to evaluate the proposals.

The Committee was constituted as per a Government Order, on a request from

the Sponsor. The Senior Officers of the Sponsor were members of the Bid

Evaluation Committee. The ultimate authority to take a decision in the matter

of awarding contract to the successful bidder is the Government of Kerala.

The Government can therefore constitute various committees to facilitate the

decision making process.       In a multi tire decision making process, the

Government which has to take the final decision, can constitute any number of

Committees even if the same is not specified in the RFP. It is relevant in this

regard to refer (2006) 10 SCC 1,         Para 14,    24    and 25, wherein    the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">WA No.1460/08                             39</span>


Honourable Supreme Court has negatived a similar approach.

</p><p id="p_133">              41. It is further stated that the Sponsor has invited proposals on

behalf of the Government of Kerala. Government designated the Sponsor as

the Nodal Agency for the implementation of the Project.            Sponsor was

therefore an agent or delegate of the Government. Delegation of power does

not amount to denudation         of the delegator's authority.    Whatever, the

agent/delegate can do, can be done by the Principal/Delegator also. Therefore,

there was nothing wrong in the Bid Evaluation Committee, constituted by the

Government on the request of the Sponsor, examining the proposals.          The

report of the Bid Evaluation Committee was only in the nature of a

recommendation. The same would have been the position had the bids were

evaluated by the Sponsor.            The Government is not bound by the

recommendation.        The Government may fully accept or reject the

recommendation.      The report is an input for taking a final decision by the

Government. The Council of Ministers, which is the highest decision making

body in the executive hierarchy, took the final decision.

</p><p id="p_134">              42. Learned Advocate General further points out that the Project

Advisor got the legal aspects of the documents submitted by the bidders

examined by their legal consultant, M/s.Universal Legal, Bangalore.         The

advice tendered by Universal Legal is quoted at para 2.4 of the minutes of the

Bid Evaluation Committee meeting held on 25.2.2008. After the submission

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">WA No.1460/08                           40</span>


of bids, the appellant submitted fresh consortium agreement dated 11.3.2008

and the consortium led by Nagarjuna submitted a joint venture agreement

dated 7.3.2008.   The original consortium agreement of the appellant was

returned to meet the requirement of 26% equity stake in the Special Purpose

Company and the notarization of signatures as also the stamping of consortium

agreement. In the Memorandum of Understanding submitted by Nagarjuna, it

was stated that the same would have validity till the rejection of the proposal

submitted by the Consortium or entering into a joint venture agreement upon

the Project being awarded to the consortium. So the MoU was returned to

Nagarjuna.
</p>
<p id="p_135">             43. The learned Advocate General would further submit that,

both the appellant and Nagarjuna submitted fresh consortium agreement and

joint venture agreement executed in March, 2008, i.e. after M/s.Universal

Legal tendered their advice on the legal aspects of the documents. No other

bidders had submitted fresh consortium agreements after the submission of the

bid on 31.1.2008.      The fresh consortium agreement        and joint venture

agreement submitted by the appellant and Nagarjuna were given by the Project

Advisors to their legal consultant, M/s.Universal Legal, which on 4.4.2008

gave an opinion.
</p>
<p id="p_136">             44. It is stated that the Project Advisor, IL &amp; FS prepared the

note for Evaluation Committee meeting on 8.4.2008. Along with the note for

the Bid Evaluation Committee meeting on 8.4.2008,. the Advisor annexed the

summary of the points for consideration of the Law Department. For easy

reference, Para 4.4 of the note prepared by the Advisor is reproduced below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                "4.4.   A summary of the clarification required in the

         original   bids   and    clarifications/additional   information

         furnished by Bidders in annexed. Also annexed is a summary

         of points for legal consideration, which have been vetted by a

         legal Consultant"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_137">The first annexure referred above is at Page 497, 498 and 499 of Vol.II of Writ

Appeal Paper Book. The second annexure, which is the legal points for

consideration of the Law Department, is at Page 506 and 507. The second

annexure should have been arranged in continuation of page No.499. In the

Government file, produced before this court, and in the report submitted before

the learned Single Judge, the second annexure was arranged as a continuation

of the first annexure. The change in the pagination was done by the appellant.

</p><p id="p_138">               45. It is further stated that, in the points for legal consideration

of the Law Department, prepared by the Project Advisor, A(5) refers to the

fresh consortium agreement of the appellant dated 11.3.2008 and B(4) refers

the fresh Joint Venture Agreement dated 7.3.2008 submitted by Nagarjuna. In

Clause (C) also, reference to these documents are made.

</p><p id="p_139">                46.   Learned Advocate General further points out that on

receiving the note for the Bid Evaluation meeting on 8.4.2008, the Chief

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">WA No.1460/08                          42</span>


Secretary, who is the Chairman of the Bid Evaluation Committee, requested

the Law Secretary to be present in the Bid Evaluation Committee. The Chief

Secretary informed the Law Secretary that a formal request in this regard

would be made by the Sponsor.        The Law Secretary thereafter received

Annexure I letter produced along with his affidavit. Accordingly, the Law

Secretary attended the meeting on 8.4.2008 as a Special Invitee.

</p><p id="p_140">              47. The learned Advocate General also states that the fresh

consortium agreement dated 11.3.2008 was placed before the Bid Evaluation

Committee for the first time on 8.4.2008 . Even before the discussion with the

Law Secretary in the meeting, the Committee at Para 2.1 (iv)(2) noted that the

Portia signed fresh consortium agreement instead of "on behalf of Peel Ports

Ltd." as mentioned in the original consortium agreement. The Committee

thereafter discussed the JV agreement dated 7.3.2008 submitted by Nagarjuna.

The Committee then noted that the responsiveness of the bid submitted by the

appellant needs to be ascertained keeping in view of the Consortium

Agreement dated 11.3.2008 which prevails over and supercedes the original

consortium agreement dated 4.10.2007 submitted along with the bid. The

Committee after taking note of the opinion of M./s. Universal Legal sought the

views of Law Secretary. Since the documents to be verified were voluminous,

the Law Secretary sought time for a detailed examination to ascertain whether

the documents submitted would comply with the provisions of law and RFP

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">WA No.1460/08                           43</span>


documents.
</p>
<p id="p_141">               As submitted earlier, the Bid Evaluation Committee, was not

discharging any statutory or quasi judicial functions.          The duty of the

Committee was to facilitate an administrative decision making process. It may

not be legally permissible for a statutory or quasi judicial body to invite a

person who is not a member of that body. But a committee of this nature

constituted to assist the government, which is the final authority can invite or

take advice from experts in the respective field to arrive at a correct decision.

</p><p id="p_142">              48. It is further stated that, the bid evaluation committee was

constituted by the Government. The Law Department's participation in the

process of evaluation was taken note of by the Government as evidenced by

Annexure 3 Government Order produced along with the affidavit of the Law

Secretary. Therefore, the Law Secretary's participation in the Bid Evaluation

Committee in any case stands ratified. In support of this contention, the

learned Advocate General relies on the following decisions:

</p><p id="p_143">1. (1989) 3 SCC 132, Para 26, 27, and 28.
</p>
<p id="p_144">2. (2003) 4 SCC 239, para 42.
</p>
<p id="p_145">               49. Learned Advocate General also points out that the entire

process of bid evaluation had culminated in the Government issuing G.O.(Ms)

No.28/08/F &amp; PD dated 24.5.2008 approving the proposal submitted by the

consortium led by the 4th respondent. Copy of the said Government Order was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">WA No.1460/08                            44</span>


handed over by the learned Advocate General to the counsel for the appellant

when the case came up for consideration in the last week of May, 2008. In a

note dated 30.5.2008, filed at the original stage, the learned counsel for the

appellant admitted that he had received a copy of the Government Order. But

the appellant has not amended the writ petition to challenge the final decision

taken by the Government. As submitted earlier, the decision of the Bid

Evaluation Committee was only recommendatory in nature. The final decision

was taken by the Council of Ministers.        The decision of the Council of

Ministers was followed by the Government Order. In the absence of any

challenge against the Government Order, the petitioner cannot seek any relief.

</p><p id="p_146">               50.   Learned Advocate General further points out that the

recording of reasons in an order or decision serves two purposes. One is to

enable the person affected by an order to know the reasons for passing such an

order. The second is to enable the appellate authority or the court exercising

judicial review to ascertain the reasons for passing an order. As per Clause 27

of RFP Vol.I, the Sponsor/GoK is not under any obligation to inform the

affected bidder of the grounds for the Sponsor/GoK's action. Therefore, the

bidder has no right to know the reasons for the rejection.

</p><p id="p_147">              51. It is further submitted that a reading of the entire report of

the Bid Evaluation Committee discloses the reasons for treating the appellant's

bid non responsive. Even if an administrative decision does not ex facie

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">WA No.1460/08                            45</span>


disclose the reasons, the decision can be sustained by explaining the reasons

with the help of records available on file. The same principles may not apply

to statutory or quasi judicial decisions. In aid of this submission, the learned

Advocate General relies on the following decisions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                     1. (1991) 3 SCC 38, para 8, 9 and 10.

</p><p id="p_149">              52. As regards the scope of Judicial Review in Contractual

matters, learned Advocate General submits that, selection of a bidder by

Government for execution of a Project is essentially an administrative action.

Principles relating to the scope of judicial review of administrative decisions

and exercise of contractual powers by government bodies have been

considered in detail in <a href="/doc/884513/" id="a_10">Tata Cellular vs. Union of India</a>. The Honourable

Supreme Court held that judicial review is concerned with the decision making

process. In para 93, it was held that the duty of the Court is to confine itself to

the question of legality.    In para 113 of the said judgment, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has summarised the principles relating to the scope of judicial

review in contractual matters. (AIR 1996 SC 11).

(2000) 2 SCC 617, para 7, the Apex Court, after a review of the various

judgments on the point, held that even when some defect is found in the

decision making process, the Court must exercise its discretionary power under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article 226</a> with great caution and should exercise it only in furtherance of

public interest and not on making out a legal point. The court further observed

that the court should always keep the larger public interest in mind in order to

decide whether its intervention is called for or not. Only when it comes to the

conclusion that overwhelming public interest requires interference, the court

should intervene.     A similar view was expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in AIR 1999 SC 393, Para 11.           In that judgment, the Apex Court

observed that, it is important to bear in mind that by Court intervention, the

proposed project may be considerably delayed and therefore, unless the Court

is satisfied that there is substantial amount of public interest or the transaction

is entered into mala fide, the Court should not intervene under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> in

disputes between two rival tenderers.     In (2005) 6 SCC 138, Para 12, the

Court held that modern trend points to judicial restraint in reviewing

administrative actions. In para 15, it was held even when some defect is found

in the decision making process, Court must exercise its discretionary power

with great caution.

the Apex Court reported in (2006) 11 SCC 548 - Paras 56 &amp; 69; 2001 (2) SCC

451, para 23, 24, and 31:      and (1990) 2 SCC 488, which are stated to be

regarding mala fides is pale and not sufficiently pleaded; that the appellant was

given sufficient opportunity and time to produce documents; that the change of

consortium member after the submission of the bid is not permissible; that the

submission of fresh consortium agreement on 11.03.2008 ie; after the due date

for submission of RFP is not permissible; that joint and several liability clause

in the RFP is very relevant and without agreeing for the 'liability' it is not

permissible for parties in the consortium to proceed with the bid; that the joint

liability clause is an essential clause; that it is the duty of appellant to

incorporate to check the requirements in terms with the RFP documents and at

a later stage they cannot turn around and say that they were not put to notice in

this regard; that the government is free to constitute as many number of

committees as necessary for the       purpose of evaluation of bid; that      the

participation of Law Secretary in the EC meeting cannot be found fault with

and the EC is competent to seek opinion from law secretary; that as per the

clause in RFP, the sponsor is under no obligation to assign reason for rejection

of bid and as such the bidder is having no right to know the reasons for

could be assigned later with the aid of files; that the scope of judicial review in

the instant case is very limited and therefore the Writ Appeal is only liable to

be dismissed.

<p id="p_155">              55. Arguments of learned Senior Counsel for 4th respondent:

</p><p id="p_156">                     Sri.Rajiv Nayyar, learned Senior Counsel for the 4th

respondent would submit that, the         Evaluation Committee was the sole

authority to complete the selection process and finalize the successful bidder.

The sponsor of the Project, under the various provisions of the bid documents,

had the right to accept or reject the proposals which were found to be

non-responsive. The external agency engaged by the Sponsor viz., IL&amp;FS, was

engaged to assist the Sponsor of the Project in the selection process, and the

Sponsor in turn placed all materials before the Bid Evaluation Committee for

finalisation of selection process. The advice of IL&amp;FS was not at all binding

on the Bid Evaluation Committee or the Sponsor. IL&amp;FS had a limited role in

the bid process, which was only to assist the Licensor/Sponsor in selection

process.
</p>
<p id="p_157">              56. It is further submitted, that, in pursuance of the constitution

of the High Empowered Evaluation Committee, at the meeting held on 25th

February, 2008, clarifications/additional information were sought for from the

bidders. This is in tune with Clause 23.1 of the RFP empowering the Sponsors

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">WA No.1460/08                            49</span>


to call for clarification/information from any bidder. From time to time, time

was extended for the eligible bidders to furnish the information and answer the

clarifications sought for an in the case of Zoom, the appellant herein and

Apollo, time was finally extended till April 8th 2008. In so far as other three

bidders are concerned, namely, NCC, Videocon Industries and the 4th

respondent, all information being forthcoming, they were held to be

pre-qualified at the meeting of the Evaluation Committee held on 8th April

2008.    Since Apollo did not furnish the requisite information, no further

consideration of the bid was made but insofar as the Appellant is concerned, its

bid was evaluated on 6th May, 2008 and was found to be non-responsive. It is

also pointed out that the Bid Evaluation Committee for a more transparent

evaluation of the bid of the appellant had also sought the advice of the Law

Department of Kerala.
</p>
<p id="p_158">              57. It is further argued by the learned Senior Counsel Sri.Rajiv

Nayyar, that, the appellant's consortium agreement dated 11th March, 2008 and

10th March, 2008 along with other documents, were examined by the

Evaluation Committee in the light of the advice of the Law Department on 6th

May, 2008 and it was found to be non-responsive on two heads; (i) failure of

the appellant Consortium to provide in the Consortium Agreement, the joint

and several liability of the consortium members for implementation of the

project; (ii)     change in the member of the consortium without the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">WA No.1460/08                              50</span>


consent/approval of the Sponsor.
</p>
<p id="p_159">              58. It is pointed out that, in so far as the first ground for rejection

is concerned, the holistic reading of clauses 3.5 and 4, clause 13.4 and a

reference to the Consortium Agreements dated 4th October, 2007 and 11th

March, 2008 would ex facie make the Appellant non-responsive. In fact, the

RFP at various places makes it incumbent in cases where consortium is found

that each of the members should assume joint and several liability for

implementation of the project. In fact, the Consortium Agreement furnished by

the appellant postulates to the contrary by providing that, "none of the parties

would incur any liability on behalf of the others". The use of the words,

"jointly and severally responsible" in the two consortium agreements was done

so conscious of the restriction/impediment in the consortium agreement

stipulating that none of the parties would incur any liability on behalf of the

others.    To elaborate the first ground of rejection further, the appellant failed

to fulfil the mandatory conditions of the RFP in respect of incorporation of

"joint and several liability of the consortium members to the Sponsors" as

stipulated.
</p>
<p id="p_160">              59.    Learned Senior Counsel further urged, that, the clauses

termed under 'mandatory' denote that, the same shall be strictly adhered with

and no deviation from the same is permitted. When such mandatory clauses are

incorporated in the RFP, the bidders have no choice except to follow the same.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">WA No.1460/08                            51</span>


Further the said mandatory clauses as mentioned above are simple, clear and

without any ambiguity. In case of any ambiguity of the clauses of the RFP,

opportunity is provided to the intending bidders to seek clarifications on the

same and as no clarifications are sought by any of the bidders including the

appellant herein on the above clauses, it is deemed that the same are understood

and accepted by all the bidders and any deviation from the same shall be treated

as non fulfilment of the mandatory clauses by the bidders and as such,

non-responsive. But the appellant, contrary to the mandatory clauses, as stated

above, incorporated the words "jointly and severally responsible" in both the

consortium agreements dated 04.10.2007 and 10.3.2008. On a plain reading of

the consortium agreements submitted by the appellant both on 4th October,

2007 and 11th Mach, 2008, it can be seen that the appellant Consortium was

never intending to bind themselves to be held liable to the Project Sponsor or to

the State of Kerala towards the execution of the Project at hand.

</p><p id="p_161">              60. It is also argued, that, the contention of the appellant that

M/s.Apollo Consortium was given opportunity to include the words jointly and

severally liable in their agreement is absolutely false and misleading as it was

clearly understood that the said consortium submitted the bid including the

words "jointly liable" but omitted to include the word "several".     Hence the

contention of the appellant that a fellow bidder was given leverage to include

the word "liable" is absolutely wrong and incorrect. The learned Single Judge

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">WA No.1460/08                           52</span>


has also verified all the consortium agreements submitted by the other four

bidders and upon verification, was satisfied that other than the appellant, all

others have mentioned the word "liable" in their agreements. So much so, the

appellant cannot now harp on the point saying that they should have been given

an opportunity, when none of the others were given an opportunity to add the

word "liable" into their agreements. The contention of the appellant that the

advisor or the Sponsor or the Bid Evaluation Committee were under the

opinion that the usage of "responsible" instead of the word "liable" was found

to be substantial compliance of the terms of the RFP, is wrong. Neither the

Sponsor nor the State nor the Bid Evaluation committee were ever given the

opinion that the use of the word "responsible" instead of the word "liable"

would be substantial compliance of the RFP conditions. The "liability" of the

members of the Consortium is to the Sponsor and the "responsibility" is only

among the members of the Consortium, as rightly held by the learned Single

Judge. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the Government and the

Project Sponsor and the Bid Evaluation Committee only followed the correct

procedures/rules and regulations and conditions in the RFP, and nothing

arbitrary was done by them.
</p>
<p id="p_162">              61. As regards the second ground for disqualification, the learned

Senior Counsel     pointed out that the Appellant itself     intended that the

Consortium Agreement dated 11th March, 2008 should prevail over the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">WA No.1460/08                            53</span>


October, 2007 Agreement, whereas in the October 2007 Agreement, Portia

signed the Consortium Agreement on behalf of Peel Ports Ltd. and also

submitted the profit and loss accounts and the balance sheet of Peel Ports Ltd.

In the new Consortium Agreement dated 11th March 2008, Portia described

itself to be a member of the Consortium in its own right and submitted its own

financial information in support thereof. This obviously means that Portia

intended itself to be considered as such. This was obviously not in accordance

with the RFP because clause 3.4 puts an embargo on any change in the

members of the Consortium after the submission of the bid. The only restricted

right of change permitted by the RFP is in the change of a lead member among

the Consortium members with prior written consent of the Sponsor, but it is not

permitted to change a member of the consortium even with the consent of the

Sponsor.     To elaborate the second ground or rejection, the appellant has

projected M/s.Peel Ports Ltd. as the consortium member, which is very clear

from the consortium agreement dated 4.10.2007, which clearly states, that,

"Portia Management Services Ltd. on behalf of Peel Ports Ltd". This can only

mean that Portia Management Services acted on behalf of Peel Ports and the

appellant never projected Portia Management Services as the consortium

member. Further this Consortium Agreement could not have been held to be a

valid one due to the reason that, though Portia signed on behalf of Peel Ports

Ltd., they were never authorised to do so.   The appellant did not submit any

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">WA No.1460/08                            54</span>


documentary proof to the Sponsor that Portia is authorised to sign on behalf of

M/s.Peel Ports Ltd. The explanation given by the appellant to say that Portia

was the "International Arm of Peel Ports Ltd." is also not convincing or

relevant in the present context as no document was produced to prove Portia as

the international arm of Peel Ports Ltd.       Merely contending that it is an

international arm of an organisation does not, by itself, mean an authorisation

to sign for and/or on behalf of that organisation. Further, the intention of

Portia to project M/s.Peel Ports is also clear from the fact that the financials of

Peel Ports were produced along with the initial bid proposals. Signing without

authority and producing financial statements without proper authority does not

divulge a genuine intention, and in the best interest of the State, the State and

the Sponsor thought it fit to reject such a bidder at the pre-qualification stage

itself, which was also upheld by the learned Single Judge.

</p><p id="p_163">              62. It is further argued by the learned Senior Counsel Sri.Rajiv

Nayyar that, the contention of the appellant that the third respondent, IL&amp;FS

was satisfied with the contents of the revised consortium agreement, dated

11.3.2008 is incorrect and the IL&amp;FS has also limited role in the process as an

advisor and facilitator to collect required information from the intending

bidders and place such information furnished by the bidders before the Sponsor

who in turn places the same for evaluation before the Bid Evaluation

Committee.      As such the contention of the appellant that the consortium

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">WA No.1460/08                             55</span>


agreement, dated 11.3.2008, was accepted by IL&amp;FS is incorrect.           Further,

IL&amp;FS never asked for any documents to be produced by the appellant as seen

from the contents of Ext.P9.
</p>
<p id="p_164">              63. Learned Senior Counsel further states that, in a contractual

matter, when a tenderer is disqualified by the expert committee, such a decision

cannot be interfered with unless the decision making process is vitiated, which

has been rightly held so, by the learned Single Judge. It is a well settled

proposition that the court will not interfere with the merit of the decision of the

expert body, but will only review the decision making process. The learned

Single Judge was perfectly justified in not interfering with the decision of the

Bid Evaluation Committee and the Sponsor to disqualify the petitioner in the

pre-qualification stage. Further, the learned Single Judge rightly observed that

the financial bid of a tenderer, who is so disqualified in the pre-qualification

stage is not required to be opened in exercise of judicial review, bypassing the

disqualification made by the expert committee.
</p>
<p id="p_165">              64. It is further pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel that

the decision of the Bid Evaluation Committee in the meeting held on 6th May,

2008 holding the appellant to be non-responsive is well founded as would be

borne from the narration of the infirmities in its bid as detailed above. In the

minutes of the meeting of 6th May, 2008, namely Clause 2.3 (at page 514 of

Vol.II - WA), the Evaluation Committee independently came to the conclusion

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">WA No.1460/08                             56</span>


that the bid of the Appellant was not responsive. Of course, due regard was

given to the advice of the law department, which was in consonance with its

own view.
</p>
<p id="p_166">              65. It is further urged that the terms and conditions of the RFP

do not impose any obligation on the Sponsor to inform the bidders about their

decision in treating any bid as non-responsive. Elaborate reasons or any

further justification was to be done by the Evaluation Committee since the

process of finalising the tender at best is only an administrative decision and as

such the decision need not be reasoned.        In support of this contention, the

learned Senior Counsel relies on the following decisions:

</p><p id="p_167">1. <a href="/doc/1261492/" id="a_14">Kumari Srilekha Vidyarthi vs. State of U.P. and Ors</a>.(1991) 1 SCC 212

</p><p id="p_173">               66.  The learned Senior Counsel further submits that it is also

settled that writs should not be issued by the Courts of Law simply as a matter

of course to satisfy an empty formality. To support this contention, the learned

Senior Counsel relies on the following decisions:
</p>
<p id="p_174"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">WA No.1460/08                            57</span>

              Sri.Chithambaresh, learned Senior Counsel for the 3rd respondent

would submit that in the absence of necessary averments in the writ petition

and also proper prayer, that presence of averments confining the relief and

limiting the scope of adjudication, this court while considering the writ appeal

filed by the appellant should not permit the appellant to urge any other ground

other than what was contended in the writ petition and further in the absence of

prayer to quash the decision dated 6.5.2008 of the Bid Evaluation Committee,

it may not be proper for the court, at this stage, to entertain the request of the

appellant.   Failure to amend the writ petition even after production of

documents by the State in the Court, is fatal to the appellant. It is also

M/s Peel Ports is not a member of the consortium. Meanwhile on 03.03.2008,

the 3rd respondent - Adviser to the Project, issued Exhibit P9 letter to the

appellant asking them to furnish some documents / clarifications in additional

to the points sought by EC. In fact the 3rd respondent also participated in the

EC meetings. In response to Exhibit P9, the appellant issued Exhibit P10 reply

essentially pointing out that - "As you are aware our consortium agreement was

executed on 4th October 2007 and thereafter several modifications were made

to the bid document. We are now required to execute a fresh agreement

incorporating these amendments along with supporting documents..."

Subsequently the appellant        submitted the fresh agreement and other

documents. New Consortium Agreement was executed on 11.03.2008.

Consortium submitted the additional documents and two other Consortium(s)

including the appellant sought further time to submit the documents and

accordingly time was granted. Vide Exhibit P15 letter dated 19.03.2008, the 3rd

respondent asked the appellant 'to get the new consortium agreement needs to

be stamped in accordance with law and all pages need to be signed by all

members. In order to obtain signatures of all the members (some of them are

abroad), appellant    vide Exhibit P16 dated 20.03.2008 sought time till

04.04.2008. In reply, Exhibit P17 dated 27.03.2008 was issued by the 3rd

respondent granting a last chance to appellant and cautioned them that in the

event of their failure to submit the documents and / or to fulfill the

requirements in accordance with the requirements of RFP, and in accordance

with law, the Government of Kerala reserves the right to proceed with the bid

evaluation process based on the submissions made by the company.

Subsequently on 02.04.2008, the appellant submitted all the documents. on

04.04.2008, legal advisers of the Project furnished their opinion stating that

"further the consortium lead by Zoom Developers Ltd has submitted a fresh

consortium agreement dated 11.03.2008 drawing reference to and superseding

the Consortium Agreement submitted earlier with the original bid documents,

towards complying with the provisions of RFP. In our view, the

JV / Consortium Agreement submitted as above, by the Bidders, based on the

request for the same pursuant to the decision of the Evaluation committee,

complies with the requirements of RFP and appears to be in accordance with

law. The Evaluation Committee may consider the submissions in the light of

above."
</p>
<p id="p_197">             75.  The 3rd EC meeting held on 08.04.2008 considered the

documents submitted by the appellant along with the above referred legal

opinion and arrived at the conclusion that "Portia Services themselves have

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">WA No.1460/08                             63</span>


signed the 'Consortium Agreement' instead of 'on behalf of Peel Ports Ltd' as

mentioned in the original consortium agreement" and therefore decided to seek

the opinion of Law Secretary on this point. In the said meeting, it was further

decided to open the technical bid of the three qualified bidders. Accordingly

the opinion of law Secretary was sought. Opinion of law secretary is extracted

above and according to it, two major defects were pointed out with regard to

the bid submitted by the appellant: 1. The new consortium agreement dated

11.03.2008 cannot be treated as part of original proposal as it is entered into by

new members (Portia Management Services signed it without the authorisation

of Peel Ports) and 2. There is no provision in the Consortium Agreement to the

effect that there will be joint and several 'liability' for the members in executing

the project and the appellant only used the expression 'responsibility' that is

different.
</p>
<p id="p_198">              76. In the 4th EC meeting held on 06.05.2008, after deliberating

the opinion of Law secretary it was concluded that the bid submitted by the

appellant is 'non-responsive'.
</p>
<p id="p_199">              77. Whether the EC should have taken a decision based on the

opinion of Law Secretary?
</p>
<p id="p_200">              It is necessary to note that decision of EC, especially with regard

to the responsiveness of the bid submitted by the appellant was taken based on

the opinion of the law Secretary. In fact, according to the affidavit filed by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">WA No.1460/08                              64</span>


Law Secretary himself, he participated in the meeting pursuant to a 'telephonic

request' from chief Secretary. It is further admitted that the so called opinion is

only "an unsigned and unsealed, off the record advice / gist of points." Even

according to the law secretary himself, the same is not a valid legal opinion

stricto sensu as it is not sought or furnished in obedience with Paragraph 112 of

the Kerala Secretariat Office Manual or other relevant Rules. As per the

relevant Rules, the opinion of the law department could be sought only in

proper channel ie; the request shall be routed through the concerned

Administrative Department. In the present case, the 2nd respondent could have

sought opinion from the Law department through the department of Ports (the

concerned administrative department) and admittedly the advice of Law

Secretary is not obtained in accordance with this procedure. In para 3,

Chapter IV of the Kerala Law Department Manual it is stated that,              "A

reference to the Law department for their opinion on any legal matter may be

made by any Department of the Secretariat. The Heads of Department should

not directly refer any matter for the opinion of the law department. They should

address the Administrative department concerned and the Administrative

Department after examining the question shall forward their remarks to the

Law Department. If any reference is received direct from the Head of

Department it shall be returned to him for forwarding it to the concerned

Administrative Department". Similarly the other provisions in Ch. IV of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">WA No.1460/08                            65</span>


Manual is also not followed in this case. The law department Manual details

the discipline / procedure to be followed         while seeking advice of law

department. Since it is an advice of the concerned department of the

Government, the same has to follow all the procedural requirements stipulated

in this regard and in obtaining such advice if procedural formalities stipulated

in law is not followed, it cannot be treated as a valid legal advice. The

jurisprudential accuracy of the opinion is not the matter for concern but the

procedure by which the same is obtained. Therefore the so called 'unsigned and

unsealed, off the record advice / gist of points' furnished by the Law Secretary

before the EC cannot be treated as a valid legal advice from the law

department and as such the reliance of the EC on the same is not proper. Such

advice could at the most be treated as an opinion from an expert. Again, the

legal opinion could vary from person to person and even luminaries may differ

in their opinion on the same set of facts or law. In such circumstance, a

competent authority is expected to follow the opinion obtained from the

permissive sources through proper channels.        As revealed from the files,

instead of independently considering the opinion of Law Secretary, the EC

blindly followed the same and arrived at the conclusion that the bid submitted

by the appellant is non responsive in the presence of Law Secretary himself.

</p><p id="p_201">              78. In the instant case, the 3rd EC meeting, discussed the legal

opinion given by the legal advisers of the Project. In the said opinion, it is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">WA No.1460/08                              66</span>


specifically noted that the changes were made in accordance with the advice of

the earlier suggestions / recommendations of EC and the same is in accordance

with law. The opinion given by the legal advisers of the Project was followed

by the EC in the case of other bidders. In this circumstance, taking a decision to

obtain legal opinion except according to the procedure and permitting

themselves to be influenced by such 'unsigned and unsealed, off the record

advice / gist of points' is not permissible. Learned author H.W.R Wade in

Administrative Law, 8th Ed. Ch. 11, pp 315.6 has opined that "...One aspect of

this principle is the rule that the participation of non members in the

deliberations or decisions of a collective body may invalidate its acts...". In

page 318 it is opined that "...The valid exercise of a discretion requires a

genuine application of the mind and a conscious choice by the correct authority

... A public body which blindly rubber stamps its officers' recommendation will

therefore be acting unlawfully...". It is also necessary to note that 'there can be

no objection to a public body obtaining advice and consulting suitable persons,

but it is vital that it should genuinely keep the decision in its own hand' (p 318).

Here a perusal of the minutes of the 4th meeting of EC, it could be revealed that

the EC without deliberating on the opinion of Law Secretary blindly followed it

in his presence and proceeded to conclude that the proposal submitted by the

Appellant is non-responsive and rejected its bid.           In this context, it is

appropriate to note that "...there must always be a difference between seeking

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">WA No.1460/08                              67</span>


advice and then genuinely exercising one's own discretion, on the other hand,

acting obediently or automatically under someone else's advice or directions"

(Wade supra p 327). The effect then is that the discretion conferred by the

Parliament (licensor, in this case) is exercised, at least in part, by wrong

authority, and the resulting decision is ultra vires and void". (See also Anoj

Abraham v. STAT &amp; Anr 2006 (4) KLT 691, <a href="/doc/581270/" id="a_29">Shreyaskumar Accha v. Director

KLT 567).      Therefore the EC ought not to have taken a decision on the

responsiveness of the bid submitted by the appellant based on the 'unsigned

and unsealed . off the record advice / gist of points' furnished by the Law

Secretary and therefore, that the decision making process adopted by the EC in

its 4th meeting cannot be approved being vitiated by irrelevant considerations

(dictation by outsider) and is only liable to be judicially reviewed.

    The said <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_34">Article 21</a> refers to 'right to life'. It includes

    'opportunity'. In our view, as held in latest judgment of the

    Constitution Bench of nine Judges in <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_35">I.R Coelho v. State of T.N</a>

    (2007) 2 SCC 1, Articles 21 / 14 are the heart of the chapter on

    fundamental rights. They cover various aspects of life. 'Level

    playing field' is an important concept while construing <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_36">Article 19

    (1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. It is entitled to invoke the said doctrine

    of 'level playing field'. We may clarify that this doctrine is,

    however subject to public interest. In the world of globalisation,

    competition is an important factor to be kept in mind. The

    doctrine of 'level playing field' is an important doctrine which is

    embodied in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_37">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. this is because

    the said doctrine provides space within which equally placed

    competitors are allowed to bid so as to subserve the larger

    public interest. 'Globalisation', in essence, is liberalisation of

    trade. Today India has dismantled licence raj. The economic

    reforms introduced after 1992 have brought in the concept of

    'globalisation'. Decisions or acts which result in unequal and

    discriminatory treatment, would violate the doctrine of 'level

    playing field' embodied in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_38">Article 19(1)(g).</a> Time has come,

    therefore, to say that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_39">Article 14</a> which refers to principle of

    'equality' should not be read as a stand alone item but it should

    be read in conjunction with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_40">Article 21</a> which embodies several

    aspects of life. There is one more aspect which needs to be

       mentioned in the matter of implementation of the aforesaid

       doctrine of 'level playing field'. According to Lord Goldsmith,

       commitment to the 'rule of law' is the heart of parliamentary

       democracy. One of the important elements of the 'rule of law' is

       legal certainty. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_41">Article 14</a> applies to government policies and if

       the policy or act of the Government, even in contractual matters,

       fails to satisfy the test of 'reasonableness', then such an act or

       decision would be unconstitutional."

at the stage of submission of Proposal need to furnish the names of the lead

mentioned by the appellant in Exhibit P5, that the second member of the

Bidders' in P5, against the column Consortium Member it is again mentioned

'Portia Management Services Ltd' and against the column 'Brief Description of

Company' it is mentioned that - 'Portia Management Services Ltd is the

international arm of Peel Ports Ltd'. Whereas in the Consortium Agreement

(pages 151 to 155 of Paper Book) it is mentioned that M/s Portia Management

Services is signing on behalf of M/s Peel Ports Ltd.   Later, when the Sponsors

/Advisers pointed out this anomaly, the appellant executed a fresh agreement

whereby arraying M/s Portia Management Ltd as a party within the stipulated

time. Apart from pointing out this anomaly, the appellants were never asked to

obtain any authorization from Peel Ports at any point of time. It could also be

concluded that right from beginning it is Portia Management Services Ltd is the

consortium member and not M/s Peel Ports. In fact in response to Exhibit P9

letter issued by the advisers after 1st EC meeting wherein it is stated that "in this

regard you are requested to depute your authorized representative to our office

in Bangalore within five days from the date of this communication to collect

the original power of attorney and consortium agreement for taking necessary

action to meet the above requirements", the appellant issued Exhibit P10

mentioning that they will be executing a 'fresh agreement'. Such fresh

agreement, could only be treated as a response to the anomaly pointed out by

the respondents 1 to 3. The subsequent agreement dated 11.03.2008, in effect is

only a clarification for the doubts expressed by the EC / Advisers. After

obtaining it within the stipulated time, it cannot be said that the same is

furnished in violation of RFP. It is only curing a defect / anomaly and by

obtaining such clarification no other bidder is prejudiced. It will certainly relate

back to the original date of submission. Since it is obtained within the extended

time, the respondents 1 and 2 also cannot be prejudiced. Moreover, the Adviser

approved the revised consortium agreement and even the legal advisers also

endorsed the same. Hence it is not justifiable to exclude the appellant from the

zone of consideration at the 2nd and 3rd stage of bid evaluation on the reason

that a new party was added at a later stage. Therefore the procedures adopted

by the EC in this regard is bad.

"All members of the consortium shall be jointly and severally liable for the

execution of the Project in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement

and a statement to this effect shall be included in the Consortium / Share

Holder's Agreement."     In cl. (c) of paragraph 4:1 it is provided that,    "...the

responsibilities and duties between the members and the lead member,

including the percentage of shareholding. Notwithstanding this, the Consortium

the Project." Similarly in paragraph 13:4, it is provided that      "In case of

consortium, members of the consortium agreement for the purpose of

submitting the proposal,    the consortium agreement shall contain, inter alia,

the following provisions: (a)...        (b). Outline the proposed roles and

A conjoint analysis of the above provision will lead to the conclusion that all

that what the RFP contemplates is a commitment from the part of bidders

(consortium members) to the effect that they will be jointly and severally liable

for the completion of the project, in the event being selected as successful

bidder and such a provision will be there in the License Agreement that will be

entered between the licensor and licensee. The commitment for 'joint and

several liability' can be expressed in "the Consortium Agreement in its own

format." Moreover, it is necessary to note that the JV agreement submitted

along with the proposal at the time of bid evaluation stage will not make any

difference, as the license agreement is yet to be entered between the licensor

and the licensee (successful bidder). At the most the said clause in the JV

consortium members to abide by a 'liability' clause, at the time of entering of

project license agreement, if its bid is ultimately found successful.

</p><p id="p_208">               82. In the 1st EC meeting on 25.02.2008, it is not pointed out that

in the appellant's JV agreement is bad for non inclusion of "several and joint

liability" clause. Whereas a similar anomaly was pointed out by the EC the case

of another bidder - M/s Appolo Consortium. When such a defect was pointed

out to one of the bidders, it is not appropriate to refuse to point out such defect

and later finding fault with the appellant on the same point. Had a clarification

in this regard was sought at the appropriate time, it is submitted by the

appellant on record, that they would have made necessary changes in this

regard. Again, this is a curable defect of minor nature and cannot be treated as

a reason to exclude the appellant from the zone of consideration.

The learned Senior Counsel Sri.Rajiv Nayyar would submit that the

administrative decisions need not be reasoned. The reliance is placed on

Kumari Srilekha Vidyarthi's case (1991) 1 SCC 212, wherein it is observed that

the expression, "at any time" merely means the termination may be made even

during the subsistence of the term of appointment and "without assigning any

cause" means without communicating any cause to the appointee whose

appointment is terminated. However, without assigning any cause is not to be

equated with "without existence of any cause". It merely means that the

reason for which the termination is made need not be assigned or

communicated to the appointee. It was held in <a href="/doc/549062/" id="a_42">Liberty Oil Mills vs. Union of

India</a> that the expression "without assigning any reason" implies that the

decision has to be communicated, but reasons for the decision need not have to

of parties, are required to act judicially and to record reasons. Where an

administrative authority is required to act judicially, it is also under an

obligation to record reasons. But every administrative authority is not under

any legal obligation to record reasons for its decision, although, it is always

desirable to record reasons to avoid any suspicion. Where a statute requires an

authority though acting administratively to record reasons, it is mandatory for

the authority to pass speaking orders and in the absence of reasons the order

would be rendered illegal. But in the absence of any statutory or administrative

requirement to record reasons, the order of the administrative authority is not

rendered illegal for absence of reasons. If any challenge is made to the validity

of an order on the ground of it being arbitrary or mala fide, it is always open to

the authority concerned to place reasons before the court which may have

persuaded it to pass the orders. Such reasons must already exist on records as it

is not permissible to the authority to support the order by reasons not contained

in the records.     Reasons are not necessary to be communicated to the

Therefore, the reasons in the order or found from the record bridges the link

between the maker of the order and the order itself or decision. Therefore, the

<p id="p_218">              89. The recent trend of the Apex Court appears to be different.

It is appropos at this stage to refer to the decisions relied by the learned Senior

Counsel Sri.Damodaran, for the appellant. The fist in the series, is the case of

Nagarjuna Constructions Company Ltd. vs. Govt. of Andhra Pradesh

(Civil Appeal Nos.1438 of 2004 dated 20.10.2008 Para 31, 36 and 39)

              "31. The obligation to act fairly on the part of the

        administrative authorities were evolved to ensure the rule of law

        and to prevent failure of justice. This doctrine is complementary

        to the principles of natural justice which the quasi judicial

        authorities are bound to observe. It is true that the distinction

        between a quasi judicial and the administrative action has

        become thin, as pointed out by this court as far back as 1970 in

        <a href="/doc/639803/" id="a_50">A.K.Kraipak vs. Union of India</a>. Even so the extent of judicial

        scrutiny/judicial review in the case of administrative action

        cannot be larger than in the case of quasi judicial action. If the

        High Court cannot sit as an Appellate Authority over the

        decisions and orders of quasi judicial authorities, it follows

        equally that it cannot do so in the case of administrative

        authorities.    In the matter of administrative action, it is well

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">WA No.1460/08                        78</span>


     known, more than one choice is available to the administrative

     authorities; they have a certain amount of discretion available

     to them. They have a "right to choose between more than one

     possible course of action on which there is room for reasonable

     people to hold differing opinions as to which is to be

     preferred"(as per Lord Diplock in Secy. of the State for

     Education and Science v. Metropolitan Borough Council of

     Tameside, 1976 (3) All.E.R. 665 at pp.695f). The court cannot

     substitute its judgment for the judgment of administrative

     authorities in such cases.     Only when the action of the

     administrative authority is so unfair or unreasonable that no

     reasonable person would have taken that action, can the court

     intervene.
</p>
<p id="p_219">            The Court has further observed:
</p>
<p id="p_220">            36.    The principles of natural justice are those rules

     which have been laid down by the Courts as being the minimum

     protection of the rights of the individual against the arbitrary

     procedure that may be adopted by a judicial, quasi judicial and

     administrative authority while making an order affecting those

     rights. These rules are intended to prevent such authority from

     doing injustice.
</p>
<p id="p_221">            39.    Concept of natural justice has undergone a great

     deal of change in recent years. Rules of natural justice are not

     rules embodied always expressly in a statute or in rules framed

     thereunder. They may be implied from the nature of the duty to

     be performed under a statute. What particular rule of natural

     justice should be implied and what its context should be in a

     given case must depend to a great extent on the fact and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">WA No.1460/08                               79</span>


       circumstances of that case, the framework of the statute under

       which the enquiry is held. The old distinction between a judicial

       act and an administrative act has withered away.          Even an

       administrative order which involves civil consequences must be

       consistent with the rules of natural justice. Expression 'civil

       consequences' emcompasses infraction of not merely property or

       personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations, and

       non-pecuniary damages. In its wide umbrella comes everything

       that affects a citizen in his civil life.".

       1 All.E.R. 1148 (p.1154) observed: "The giving of reasons is

       one of the fundamentals of good administration."                 In

       Alexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree, 1974 ICR 120

       (NIRC), it was observed: "Failure to give reasons amounts to

       denial of justice. Reasons are live links between the mind of

       the decision taker to the controversy in question and the

       decision or conclusion arrived at". Reasons substitute

       subjectivity by objectivity. The emphasis on recording reasons

       is that if the decision reveals the "inscrutable face of the

       sphinx", it can, by its silence, render it virtually impossible for

       the courts to perform their appellate function or exercise the

       power of judicial review in adjudicating the validity of the

       decision. Right to reason is an indispensable part of a sound

       judicial system,   reasons at least sufficient to indicate an

       application of mind to the matter before court.           Another

       rationale is that the affected party can know why the decision

       has gone against him. One of the statutory requirements of

       natural justice is spelling out reasons for the order made, in

       other words, a speaking out. The "inscrutable face of the

       sphinx" is ordinarily incongruous with a judicial or

       quasi-judicial performance.".</blockquote><p id="p_227">

              Secretary to ascertain the admissibility/responsiveness of

              the bid. The Committee, including the Special Invitee,

              unanimously concluded that the bid submitted by the

              Consortium      led     by      Zoom      Developers,      is

              non-responsive/non-admissible, in terms of the RFP

</p><p id="p_230">              94. Can this be called a reasoned order, was our question to the

learned counsel appearing for the parties. The learned Advocate General

would tell us, firstly, since the orders passed by EC is in the nature of

administrative order, the EC need not have to assign any reasons whatsoever in

view of Clause 27 of RFP. Alternatively, the learned Advocate General would

contend, that the reading of the entire report of the EC discloses the reasons for

treating the tender document submitted by the appellant as non-responsive and

even otherwise also, if the administrative decision does not disclose the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">WA No.1460/08                              84</span>


reasons, the same can be sustained by explaining the reasons with the help of

available records.       The learned    Senior Counsel, Sri.Rajiv Nayyar, who

appeared for the contesting respondent in his own indomitable style would tell

us that, it is difficult to answer an inconvenient question, but at the same time,

in view of certain observations made by the Apex Court, there is no necessity

for a body which is only discharging administrative function, to assign detailed

reasons while rejecting the bid submitted by a tenderer. The learned Senior

Counsel would submit that, the Law Secretary was very much present in the

meeting held on 6.5.2008 and after due deliberation and discussion with the

Law Secretary, the EC has opined that the bid submitted by the appellant is

non-responsive and therefore, it is an affirmation of the "opinion" of the Law

Secretary and therefore, no other reasons be assigned by the EC while rejecting

the bid submitted by the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_231">               95. In our view, the answer to this issue would have been little

more difficult, if not for the views expressed by the Apex Court in the recent

decision rendered. In Nagarjuna Construction Company Ltd. case, the Apex

Court has observed that the old distinction between a judicial act and

administrative act has withered away. Even the administrative order which

involve civil consequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice.

Expression "civil consequences" encompasses infraction of not merely

property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">WA No.1460/08                            85</span>


non-pecuniary damages. In its wide umbrella comes everything that affects a

citizen in his civil life. In Alpana Roy's case, the Apex Court has observed

that giving of reasons is one of the fundamentals of good administration. In

our view, these views of the Apex Court is binding on us under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_61">Article 141</a> of

the Constitution of India and therefore, it is well-nigh impossible to accept the

preliminary submission made by the learned Advocate General. Secondly, we

have carefully perused the entire records produced by the learned Advocate

General to find whether the records would disclose any reason for the EC to

reject the tender document submitted by the Appellant unceremoniously. We

only find from the records the various stages where the appellant was asked to

improve, correct and clarify the tender documents submitted by it. These

records would only disclose, if we say so, bluntly, the bureaucratic approach

while deciding an important issue of this nature.         The learned Advocate

General would tell us that in view of the Clause 27 of the RFP, no reason need

be assigned and communicated to the bidder of the grounds of rejection of its

bid document. Firstly, this type of clauses in the RFP could have been

accepted, under a rule in a State which is governed by Monarchy and not in a

country which believes in a democracy and democratic principles. Assuming

for the sake of argument that the administrative authority while deciding issues

of this nature need not communicate the reasons for rejection of the bid of an

participant, the records maintained by the administrative authority should

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">WA No.1460/08                             86</span>


disclose to a forum, the reasons which weighed in its mind, when its action is

questioned before a Superior Forum. If the reasons are not forthcoming after

careful scrutiny of the records, the superior forum would definitely have to

tell the administrative authority, that you can't be above the law and you can't

act the way you desire.     In view of this discussion, our conclusion is, the

decision of the EC is a non-reasoned order and the same cannot be sustained.

</p><p id="p_232">              96 We are not considering the issue, that the decision to treat

the appellant's bid as non-responsive is vitiated by mala fides, since there is no

specific averment is made either in the writ petition or in the writ appeal by

the appellant.

<p id="p_233">              97. We are also not deciding the issue, whether this court can

observed by us in the course of our order.
