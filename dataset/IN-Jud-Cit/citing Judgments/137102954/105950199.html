JAYANT NATH, J. (JUDGMENT)
IA No.4800/2017
1.    This application is filed by the plaintiff to restrain the defendants etc.
from manufacturing, exporting or otherwise dealing with goods including
but not limited to E-rickshaws, bearing the defendant's DMW marks or any
other mark that is either identical or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's
BMW Marks. Other connected reliefs are also sought.
2.    The accompanying suit is filed by the plaintiff seeking a permanent
injunction for the same relief as noted above. Other connected reliefs are
also sought. It is the case of the plaintiff that that it was founded in Munich,
Germany in 1916. It enjoys the distinction of being one of Germany's



CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                         Page 1
 largest industrial companies. It is stated to be one of the most reputed car and
motorcycle manufacturers in the world. It is claimed that the plaintiff
manufactures and sells automobiles under the plaintiff's BMW marks. The
plaintiff has also been manufacturing motorcycles under the said marks since
1923 and motor cars under the mark BMW since the year 1928. It is stated
that these automobiles set the highest standards in terms of aesthetics,
dynamics, technology and quality. For numerous decades the part
"Bayerische Motoren Werke" of the plaintiff's corporate name has been
consistently shortened to "BMW" and the part "Aktiengesellschaft" of the
plaintiff's corporate name (meaning "Joint Stock Company") has been
shortened by the common abbreviation "AG". The plaintiff has been for
many years and continues to be commonly referred to as BMW or BMW
AG.
3.     It is further claimed that the BMW Group's production network
comprises a total of 31 production and assembly plants in 14 countries and
has a global sales network in more than 140 countries. The plaintiff has a
workforce of 1,24,729 employees. The plaintiff has used the plaintiff's
BMW marks on cars, motorcycle, automobile, accessories, lifestyle
including readymade clothing, other goods, in relation to services including
financial services. The revenue figures for the period 2004-16 have been
placed on record. It has been pleaded that in the year 2016 the plaintiff had a
revenue of 94.163 milllion Euros and had sold a total of 20,03,359 vehicles
with the plaintiff's BMW marks around the world. Details of the advertising
and marketing expenditure have also been placed on record. It is pleaded that
in 2016 a sum of Rs.6.030 million euros had been spent on advertising.




CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                         Page 2
 4.    It is further stated that the plaintiff obtained the first trademark
registration for the world famous BMW logo in 1917 in the classes 12,7,8,9
and 11. The logo is as follows:-




5.    It is further pleaded that the plaintiff's BMW mark is a well-known
trademark and has been so accepted in decisions of courts and other judicial
bodies across the world and qualifies as a well-known trademarks under
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1">Article 6bis</a> of the Paris Convention.
6.    In India it is pleaded that the commercial ties of plaintiff began in
1987 when the automobiles bearing the plaintiff's BMW marks were first
sold in India. A copy of the invoice dated 28.12.1987 has been placed on
record. Plaintiff's Indian Affiliate has also in 2007 set up an assembly plant
in Chennai whose primary function is to assemble automobiles and supply
them to various markets. It is reiterated that the plaintiff's BMW marks are
well-known due to extensive and continuous use in India and qualifies as a
well-known trademarks as envisaged in section 2(1)(zg) and section 11(6) of
The Trademarks Act, 1999. Within India the plaintiff owns numerous
registrations of plaintiff's BMW marks covering a broad spectrum of goods
and services including class 7,9,12,25, 28,36,37 and 39. The earliest Indian
registration for the BMW mark dates back to 1956 and covers goods in Class
12. The details of the registrations of different BMW trademarks are spelt
out in para 46 of the plaint.




CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                       Page 3
 7.    Regarding the defendant it is stated that the same is manufacturing,
marketing and selling E-Rickshaws, E-Cart Rickshaw, Electric Cargo and
Electric Loader under the trademark DMW. It is pleaded that the plaintiff got
knowledge of the said mark on 1.7.2016 when E-Rickshaws with trademark
DMW was spotted plying on the road. A cease and desist notice was sent to
defendant on 12.7.2016 to cease the use of the DMW mark in relation to e-
vehicles or any other goods. The defendants in their reply dated 23.7.2016
refused to comply with the submissions put forth by the plaintiff and
justified the use of the mark DMW and the domain name.
8.    It is pleaded that the defendant's mark DMW is deceptively similar to
the plaintiff's BMW marks. It is pleaded that this act of the defendant is in
complete violation of the plaintiff's trademark rights in the plaintiff's BMW
marks. Both BMW and DMW marks consist of three letters of which the
second and the third letters being M and W are identical. All that the
defendant has done is to replace the letter B with the letter D. It is further
stated that the letters B and D are visually and phonetically similar.
Therefore, there is no doubt that DMW is phonetically similar to BMW.
Further, the defendant is using DMW mark in relation to goods such as E-
Rickshaws which are goods somewhat similar to automobiles covered by the
plaintiff's BMW mark. It is pleaded that defendant has committed an act of
passing off. It is reiterated that the defendants' DMW marks are deceptively
similar in appearance, sound and structure to the plaintiff's BMW mark. The
adoption of the said mark by defendant is mala fide. Hence, the present suit
and application.
9.    The defendant has filed his written statement. In the written statement
the following salient pleas are raised/taken on merits:-



CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                       Page 4
 (i)     It is claimed that the suit is not maintainable as the product of the
defendant is different from the product manufactured by the plaintiff. The
nature of the product, class of buyers and trade channels of the product of the
defendant is entirely different from the product of the plaintiff. Further, it is
stated that the product of the defendant is neither identical nor vertically
similar to the product of the plaintiff. There is a difference of colour, font
and size of the trademark of the plaintiff. BMW and DMW Deshwar Motor
Works are not deceptively similar.
(ii)    It is stated that the suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff has admitted
that they are manufacturers of automobiles, motorcycle, cars and not
manufacturing E-Rickshaws etc. Defendant manufactures only E-Rickshaws.
(iii)   It is pleaded that the other companies are selling automobiles like
truck, busses, motorcycle etc. under the trademark AMW PMW etc.
However, no steps have been taken by the plaintiff company against the said
companies.
(iv)    It is further stated that the suit is barred by limitation because the
answering defendant is manufacturing said products since 2013. The
defendant has given advertisement since 2013 in different States. The
company was registered on 19.12.2005 under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a>. It is to the
knowledge of the plaintiff that the manufacturing of E-Rickshaws
commenced in February 2013. The present suit is filed with delay and
latches.
10.     I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned senior counsel
appearing for the plaintiff has stressed as follows:-
(i)     It is stated that it is a matter of fact that the defendant's DMW mark is
similar to the plaintiff's BMW mark in appearance, sound and structure. It is



CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                             Page 5
 pleaded that the only plausible reason for the defendant's adoption of the
said DMW mark is to invoke the plaintiff's BMW mark in the mind of the
consumers. Given the well-known nature of the plaintiff's well-known mark
it is unfathomable that the defendant was unaware of the marks.
(ii)    It is further pleaded that this is a clear case of dilution of the trademark
of the plaintiff attracting section 29(4) of the Trademarks Act. It is pleaded
that dilution may also occur when well-known trademark is used in respect
of the goods or services of an inferior quality. In view of the fact that section
29(4) of the Trademarks Act is attracted the element of having to show the
likelihood of confusion is absent.
(iii)   It is further pleaded that the test is of an average consumer to see as to
whether an average consumer of imperfect recollection would get confused
by the use of the trademark by the defendant. In the present case it is pleaded
that this is a clear case of likelihood of confusion in the mind of an average
consumer.
(iv)    It is further stated that dishonest adoption has now been recognised as
an independent head under passing off. Where the goods in issue have a
well-known mark having worldwide reputation and a subsequent entrant
adopts a mark that comes close to or approximate to the original mark, the
adoption of the mark itself is dishonest and an injunction must follow.
Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_3">Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. vs. Sudhir Bhatia and Others</a>, (2004) 3
SCC 90.
11.     Learned counsel appearing for the defendant pleads as follows:-
(i)     It is pleaded that the mark of the defendant DMW is entirely different,
visually, structurally and phonetically from the mark of the plaintiff



CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                             Page 6
 company. It is admitted fact that the defendant has filed an application to
register the mark DESHWAR Motor Works DMW which itself shows on the
plate which is tagged on the E-Rickshaw.
(ii)    It is pleaded that the nature of the business, class of buyers and
product of parties are totally different. The defendant is not using any logo.
The defendant has also applied for registration of an inverter which is not
manufactured by the plaintiff.
(iii)   The total value of the product of the defendant is about Rs.50,000/-
and that of the plaintiff company is a minimum of Rs.35 lacs. Reliance is
placed on judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_4">Nandhini Deluxe vs.
Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Ltd</a>., (2018) 9 SCC 183
to plead that no confusion is caused.
12.     I may first have a look at the nature of the mark being used by the
parties. The plaintiff uses the mark BMW. It also uses the following logo :-




        On the other hand the defendant has on 4.3.2017 filed an application
to register the mark                                        under the class 12.

The defendant also uses the mark                            . The stress of the
defendant is on the mark DMW.
13.     Principles governing the resolution of disputes relating to identical and
deceptive similarity of the trademark have been succinctly stated by the




CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                          Page 7
 judgment of the High Court of Jammu &amp; Kashmir in <a href="/doc/167030439/" id="a_5">J.K.Oil Industries v.
Ganpati Food Products &amp; Ors</a>., MANU/JK/0453/2017, as follows:
         "12. Principles governing the resolution of disputes relating
         to identity and deceptive similarity of trade marks have been
         laid down by the Supreme Court from time to time. In Corn
         Products Refining Company v Shangrila Food Products
         Limited: AIR 1960SC 142, the registered trade mark
         "Glucovita" of therein appellant was pitted against therein
         respondents' mark "Gluvita", which they had applied for its</pre>
<p id="p_1">         registration. Dealing with the question as to whether there
         was likelihood of confusion between the two marks, which
         was the view taken by Desai, J. of the Bombay High Court
         in that case, the Supreme Court observed as follows:
</p>
              "19. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right.
<p id="p_2">              It is well known that the question whether the two
              marks are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a
              question of first impression. It is for the court to decide
              that question. English cases proceeding on the English
              way of pronouncing an English word by Englishmen,
              which it may be stated is not always the same, may not
              be of much assistance in our country in deciding
              questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot be
              overlooked that the word is an English word which to
              the mass of the Indian people is a foreign word. It is
              well recognised that in deciding a question of similarity
              between two marks, the marks have to be considered as
              a whole. So considered, we are inclined to agree with
              Desai, J., that the marks with which this case is
              concerned are similar. Apart from the syllable 'co' in
              the appellant's mark, the two marks are identical. That
              syllable is not in our opinion such as would enable the




CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                           Page 8
               buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark from
              the other."
</p>
<p id="p_3">          13. In AmritDhara Pharmacy v Satya Deo: AIR 1963 SC
          449, the respondents therein had applied for registration of
          trade name "Lakshmandhara" in respect of a medicinal
          preparations for the alleviation of various ailments. This
          was opposed by therein appellant whose earlier registered
          trade name was "AmritDhara" in respect of a similar
          medicinal preparation. The question, which arose was
          whether the name "Lakshmandhara" was likely to deceive
          the public or cause confusion to the trade. Supreme Court
          in this has observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "It will be noticed that the words used in the sections
              and relevant for our purpose are "likely to deceive or
              cause confusion." The Act does not lay down any
              criteria for determining what is likely to deceive or
              cause confusion. Therefore, every case must depend on
              its own particular facts, and the value of authorities lies
              not so much in the actual decision as in the tests applied
              for determining what is likely to deceive or cause
              confusion. On an application to register, the Registrar
              or an opponent may object that the trade mark is not
              registrable by reason of cl. (a) of s. 8, or sub-s. (1) of s.
              10, as in this case. In such a case the onus is on the
              applicant to satisfy the Registrar that the trade mark
              applied for is not likely to deceive or cause Confusion.</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">              In cases in which the tribunal considers that there is
              doubt as to whether deception is likely, the application
              should be refused. A trade mark is likely to deceive or
              cause confusion by the resemblance to another already
              on the Register if it is likely to do so in the course of its
              legitimate use in a market where the two marks are




CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                             Page 9
               assumed to be in use by traders in that market. In
              considering the matter, all the circumstances of the case
              must be considered. As was observed by Parker, J. in
              Pianotist Co. s Application (1), 'which was also a case
              of the comparison of two words-
</p>
<p id="p_5">              "You must take the two words. You must Judge them,
              both by their look and by their sound. You must
              consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You
              must consider the nature and kind of customer who
              would be likely to buy those goods. In fact you must
              consider all the surrounding circumstances and you
              must further consider what is likely to happen if each of
              those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade
              mark for the goods of the respective owners of the
              marks (1) (1906) 23 R. P. C. 774,777.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              For deceptive resemblance two important questions are:
              (1) who are the persons whom the resemblance must be
              likely to deceive or confuse, and (2) what rules of
              comparison are to be. adopted in judging whether such
              resemblance exists. As to confusion, it is perhaps an
              appropriate description of the state of mind of a
              customer who, on seeing a mark thinks, that it differs
              from the mark on goods which' he has previously
              bought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not
              due to imperfect recollection. (See Kerly on Trade
              Marks, 8th edition, p. 400.)"
</p>
<p id="p_7">       14. In Durga Dutt v Navaratna Laboratories: AIR 1965 SC
       980, Supreme Court has pointed out:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
              doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is
              likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the

               plaintiff's and the defendants mark is so close either
              visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court
              reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no
              further evidence is required to establish that the
              plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way,
              if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff
              have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the
              get- up, packing and other writing or marks on the
              goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for
              sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a
              trade origin different from that of the registered
              proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in
              the case of passing off, the defendant may escape
              liability if he can show that the added matter is
              sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the
              plaintiff."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              16. Supreme Court in Durga Dutt's case has held also
              that 'where the two marks are identical no further
              questions arise; for then the infringement is made out.
              When the two marks are not identical, the plaintiff
              would have to establish that the mark used by the
              defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiffs registered
              trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion in
              relation to goods in respect of which it is registered.</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">              ''The persons who would be deceived are, of course, the
              purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their
              being deceived that is the subject of consideration. The
              resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic
              idea represented by the plaintiffs mark. The purpose of
              the comparison is for determining whether the essential
              features of the plaintiffs trade mark are to be found in
              that used by the defendant. The identification of the
              essential features of the mark is in essence a question of



CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                        Page 11

               the evidence led before it as regards the usage of the
               trade.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      In view of the stated legal position, the issue centers around as to
whether the trademark being used by the defendant is deceptively similar or
nearly resembles the mark of the plaintiff or is likely to deceive or cause
confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_10">15.   A perusal of the aforesaid two trademarks of the parties shows that the
defendant has adopted the essential features of the trademark of the plaintiff.
There is clearly a visual and phonetic resemblance in the marks. The
essential features of the plaintiffs marks are copied in the defendants' mark
and the same are likely to deceive and cause confusion.
</p><p id="p_11">16.   Learned counsel for the defendant has, however, strongly urged that
the products being manufactured by the defendant are entirely different i.e.
E-Rickshaws. The plaintiff does not manufacture such a product. Further, the
cost of E-Rickshaw being under Rs.1 lac the consumers who deal with the E-
Rickshaws would not have any connect with the plaintiff whose entry level
vehicles itself cost about Rs.35 lacs. Reliance was placed on judgment of the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_6">Nandhini Deluxe vs. Karnataka Cooperative Milk
Producers Federation Ltd</a>., (supra).
</p><p id="p_12">17.   The plaintiffs have in response urged that the principle of dilution of a
well-known would apply to the facts of this case inasmuch as section 29(4)
of the Trademarks Act is attracted. Reliance is placed on judgment of a co-
ordinate Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/137102954/" id="a_7">ITC Limited vs. Philip Morris Products SA

defendant i.e. <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_9">Nandhini Deluxe vs. Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers
Federation LTd</a>., (supra). In that case the issue pertained to trademark
NANDINI in respect of the products, namely, milk and milk products which
were being used by the respondent since 1985 as against the appellant who
was in the business of running restaurants and who had adopted the mark
NANDHINI for restaurants since 1989. In those facts the Supreme Court
held as follows:-

             (2d Cir 1960)] by the defendant, affords much assistance, since
             in Ritchie case [Harold F. Ritchie Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond's
             Inc., 281 F 2d 755 (2d Cir 1960)] there was confusion as to the
             identical product and the defendant in Avon case [Avon Shoe
             Co. Inc. v. David Crystal Inc., 279 F 2d 607 (2d Cir 1960)] had
             adopted its mark "without knowledge of the plaintiffs' prior
             use". Where the products are different, the prior owner's
             chance of success is a function of many variables: the strength
             of his mark, the degree of similarity between the two marks,
             the proximity of the products, the likelihood that the prior
             owner will bridge the gap, actual confusion, and the reciprocal
             of the defendant's good faith in adopting its own mark, the

              quality of the defendant's product, and the sophistication of the
             buyers. Even this extensive catalogue does not exhaust the

             729, 730, 731. Here the plaintiff's mark is a strong one and the
             similarity between the two names is great, but the evidence of
             actual confusion, when analysed, is not impressive. The filter
             seems to be the only case where the defendant has sold, but not
             manufactured, a product serving a function similar to any of
             the plaintiff's, and the plaintiff's sales of this item have been
             highly irregular, varying e.g. from $2,300 in 1953 to $303,000

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">    29. This Court in <a href="/doc/1233360/" id="a_10">National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick
    and Bros</a>. <a href="/doc/1233360/" id="a_11">Ltd. [National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick
    and Bros</a>. Ltd., AIR 1953 SC 357] accepted the following principles
    which are to be applied in such cases: (AIR p. 363, para 22)
                 "22. The principles of law applicable to such cases are well
             settled. The burden of proving that the trade mark which a
             person seeks to register is not likely to deceive or to cause
             confusion is upon the applicant. It is for him to satisfy the
             Registrar that his trade mark does not fall within the
             prohibition of Section 8 and therefore it should be registered.
             Moreover, in deciding whether a particular trade mark is likely
             to deceive or cause confusion that duty is not discharged by
             arriving at the result by merely comparing it with the trade
             mark which is already registered and whose proprietor is
             offering opposition to the registration of the mark. The real
             question to decide in such cases is to see as to how a purchaser,
             who must be looked upon as an average man of ordinary
             intelligence, would react to a particular trade mark, what
             association he would form by looking at the trade mark, and in
             what respect he would connect the trade mark with the goods
             which he would be purchasing."</blockquote>

<p id="p_15">       30. Applying the aforesaid principles to the instant case, when we
       find that not only visual appearance of the two marks is different,
       they even relate to different products. Further, the manner in which



CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                      Page 14
        they are traded by the appellant and the respondent respectively,
       highlighted above, it is difficult to imagine that an average man of
       ordinary intelligence would associate the goods of the appellant as
       that of the respondent."
</p>
<p id="p_16">19.   Hence the court held that where the products are different, prior
owner's chance of success is a function of many variables; the strength of
his mark, the degree of similarities between the two marks, the proximity of
the products, the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap, actual
confusion , etc. etc. All variables have to be taken into account. Based on the
above the court on the facts of that case concluded that visual appearance of
the two marks is different and they relate to different products. Further, the
manner in which they are treated by the appellant and the respondent
respectively the court concluded that it was difficult to imagine that an
average man of ordinary intelligence would associate the goods of the
appellant as that of the respondent. Clearly, in the facts of that case the court
came to a conclusion that an average man of ordinary intelligence would not
associate the goods of the appellant as that of the respondent. In my opinion,
the facts of the present case are materially different. The strength of the
trademark of the plaintiff cannot be disputed. The plaintiff is manufacturing
motorcycles under the mark BMW since 1923 and motor cars since 1928,
under the said mark. It has assembly plants in 14 countries and a global sales
network in more than 140 countries. The plaintiff and affiliated companies
have a work force nearly of 1,25,000. In 2016, it had a revenue of 94.163
million Euros. In 2016, 23,67,600 vehicles were sold worldwide by the
plaintiff of which two million vehicles were cars with the brand BMW mark.
In these circumstances, the use of the mark DMW by the defendant prima

 facie appears to be a dishonest act with an intention of trying to take
advantage of the reputation and goodwill of the brand of the plaintiff. It is
likely to mislead an average man of ordinary intelligence.
</p><p id="p_17">20.   Regarding the principle of Dilution as urged by learned senior counsel
for the plaintiff in this context reference may be had to <a href="/doc/984243/" id="a_12">Section 29</a> (4) of <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_13">The
Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 which reads as follows:

      consistently by the court, was summarized by the following

           "You must take the two words. You must judge them,
          both by their look and by their sound. You must consider
          the goods to which they are to be applied. You must
          consider the nature and kind of customer who would be
          likely to buy those goods. In fact you must consider all
          the surrounding circumstances; and you must further
          consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade-
          marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the
          goods of the respective owners of the marks."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       This court is of opinion that the test here (for dilution) is not
       exactly the same. For one, Parliament has consciously
       eschewed the "deceptively" similar standard-which is
       defined by Section 2, in relation to infringement claims
       under Section 29(4). This would mean that the identity or
       similarity standard is a notch higher -- the claimant has to
       prove or establish that the two marks are identical with or
       similar to each other. The question of deception does not
       arise here. There must be a near identification of the two
       marks or they must have the closest similarity. The second
       aspect is that the other elements necessary to establish
       dilution dissimilarity of goods, the claimant mark having a
       reputation in India; the use of the mark without due cause,
       resulting in detriment to it, or the defendant taking undue
       advantage, have to be established. These ingredients are all
       to be established, as the conjunctive "and" is used, in
       Section 29(4)."

<p id="p_19">22.   Similarly, reference may be had to the judgment of another co-
ordinate Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/344613/" id="a_15">Tata Sons Ltd. vs. Manoj Dodia</a>, (supra)
where the court was dealing with the trademark of the plaintiff i.e. TATA.
The defendant was selling weighing scales and spring balances under the
trade mark A-One TATA where the court held as follows:
</p>



<p id="p_20">CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                    Page 17
         "20.Since the trademark TATA is a well known trademark, use
        of the aforesaid mark by the defendant on the products being sold
        by him also constitutes infringement within the meaning of
        Section 29(4) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 since by using the
        trademark TATA, he obviously has tried to take an unfair
        advantage by encashing upon the brand quality and goodwill,
        which the mark TATA enjoys in the market. Since the defendant
        has not come forward to contest the suit, the presumption is that
        use of the mark A-ONE TATA by him is not bona fide, but is
        deliberate, intended to encash the popularity and reputation,
        which TATA brand enjoys. Such use by the defendant is likely to
        be detrimental to the reputation and distinctive character of the
        registered trademark TATA of the plaintiff company because if
        this mark is allowed to be used on the products, which do not
        originate from TATA group of companies, that may diminish the
        ability of the trademark TATA to identify the source of the goods
        in respect of which this trademark is used, besides lowering its
        reputation in case the quality of the goods is not of expected
        standard."
</p><p id="p_21">23.   It is manifest from the facts narrated above that the brand of the
defendant is visually and phonetically similar to the mark of the plaintiff.
Further, the plaintiff's mark is a well known trademark and use of the
aforesaid mark by the defendant on its product constitutes infringement
within the meaning of Section 29(4) of the Trademarks Act. The defendant is
obviously seeking to encash upon the brand quality and goodwill which the
mark BMW enjoys in the market. Such use by the defendant is detrimental to
the reputation of the registered mark BMW of the plaintiff company. The
defendant is prima facie guilty of infringement of the trade mark of the
petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_22">24.   The last plea raised by learned counsel for defendant was that the
defendant has been manufacturing the said E-Rickshaws using the said brand




CS(COMM.)292/2017                                                     Page 18
 DMW since 2013. It is claimed that the plaintiff was aware of this. Hence,
the present suit is barred by delay, laches and limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_23">25.   Factually, the said contention of learned counsel for defendant is
erroneous as in the plaint, the plaintiff states that the defendant got
knowledge of the use of the trademark by the defendant on or around
01.07.2016. Immediately, thereafter, on 12.07.2016 a Cease and Desist
notice was sent to the defendant. The suit has been filed in 2017 itself.
</p>
<p id="p_24">26.   In this context, reference may be had to the judgment of the Supreme
Court in <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_16">Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. vs. Sudhir Bhatia and Others</a>
(2004) 3 SCC 90 where the Supreme Court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      "5. The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of
      infringement either of trade mark or of copyright,
      normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay in
      bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of
      injunction in such cases. The grant of injunction also
      becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the
      adoption of the mark was itself dishonest."</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">      Hence, even if there was delay on the part of the plaintiff in filing of
the present suit as has been claimed by the defendant, the same delay would
not be sufficient to deter grant of injunction in favor of plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_26">27.   The plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case. Balance of
convenience is in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. An ad
interim injunction is passed restraining the defendants, its officers, agents
etc. from manufacturing, exporting, importing or offering for sale,
advertising or in any manner dealing with goods not limited to E-Rickshaws
