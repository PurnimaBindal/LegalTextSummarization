Per Court:
</p>
<p id="p_2">1               This matter was heard for quite some time on 25.02.2019 and

on the request of the parties, was posted today for passing orders.

2               Shri Korhalkar, learned Advocate for Respondent Nos.5 and

6, submits that the Petitioners are not the Plaintiffs in the pending civil

suit, which is referred to in this petition paper book.

3               The learned Advocate for the Petitioners submits that the

Petitioners are agreeable to avail a statutory remedy in view of the

judgment       in     <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_1">Gurudassing    Nawoosing      Panjwani       vs.     State      of

      would prefer their second revision within four weeks from today.

</p><pre id="pre_2">      4              Shri Korhalkar opposes the said request.

      5              In view of the above, this Writ Petition stands disposed off

</pre><p id="p_3">      with liberty to the Petitioners to avail of a statutory remedy of filing a

      second revision. In the event, such a revision is filed within four weeks

      from today, the time spent by the Petitioners in this Court from

      24.01.2018 until four weeks from today, would be considered as a good

      ground for condonation of delay. The ad-interim protection granted by

      this Court on 11.04.2018 would be continued for a period of six weeks

      from today.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      6              Needless to state, if the Petitioners pray for an ad-interim

      protection or interim protection, the competent authority would decide

      such an application on it's own merits without being influenced by the ad-

      interim protection granted by this Court on 11.04.2018. All contentions of

      the litigating sides are kept open.
