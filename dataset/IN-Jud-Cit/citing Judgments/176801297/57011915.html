                           attention of the Court to judgment dated 22nd November, 2022 passed in I.A.
                          No. 14991/2022 in CS(COMM) 328/2022,1 relevant portion whereof reads
                          as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                  &quot;55. I may herein note that the trade mark &#x27;ZEST&#x27; of the defendant has
                                  been registered since the year 1983. It is further the assertion of the
                                  defendant, which has also not been denied by the plaintiff, that this mark
                                  was cited by the defendant in opposition to the applications filed by the
                                  plaintiff seeking the registration of its marks &#x27;EXEZEST&#x27; and
                                  &#x27;TRIOLMEZEST&#x27;. The plaintiff, at that stage, did not choose to
                                  challenge the registration granted in favour of the defendant for the mark
                                  &#x27;ZEST&#x27;. At least, this has not been pleaded by the plaintiff in the Suit or in
                                  this application. There was, therefore, clearly a case of acquiescence in
                                  such registration.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                  56. In fact, the plaintiff has itself sought and obtained registrations and
                                  relied upon a mark of which the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; forms a part. Having itself
                                  applied for and obtained registration in a &#x27;ZEST&#x27; formative trade mark, it
                                  does not lie in the mouth of the plaintiff to state that the word &#x27;ZEST&#x27; is a
                                  publici juris expression or is otherwise generic. Reference in this regard
                                  may be made to the judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/1221147/" id="a_3">Automatic Electric Limited

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                  57.    In view of the above, I find no merit in the present application. The
                                  same is dismissed.&quot;
