</p><p id="p_6">1.     This appeal is directed against an order of the learned single




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                 Page 1
 Judge, dated 9th October 2012, in C.S. (OS) 1445 of 2003, which
directed dismissal of the plaintiff/appellant's suit under Order XII,
Rule 6 of the Civil Procedure Code ("CPC").
</p><p id="p_7">2.     The facts that give rise to the appeal are that the Appellant, a
multinational pharmaceutical company, (hereafter "Allergan" or
"plaintiff") holds the registered trademarks for BOTOX and BTX-A
in India. The mark "BOTOX" has been used in India continuously
since 1992. An application to register the trademark "BTX-A" was
made by the Appellant in June 2002.
</p><p id="p_8">3.     A month before Allergan applied to register BTX-A, the
Defendant (hereafter called "Intas" or "the defendant"), pursuant to an
agreement with a Korean company, secured permission from the Drug
Controller of India, to import articles and products under the brand
name "BTXA" into India. In January 2003, Allergan sent a "cease-
and-desist" notice to Intas, asking it to desist from using "BOTOX",
"BTXA" or any other mark deceptively similar to BTX-A. After
correspondence between the parties, Intas refused to do so, and in July
2003, it began to distribute products under the mark "BTXA" in India.
</p><p id="p_9">4.      In response Allergan filed a suit, and an application for grant of
ex parte ad-interim injunction under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of
the CPC (I.A. No. 7526 of 2003). The Single Judge granted an ex
parte ad-interim injunction, restraining Intas from using the marks
BOTOX/BTXA, or any other marks deceptively similar to the
Appellant's BOTOX and BTX-A.
</p><p id="p_10">5.     Intas then filed an application under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 CPC
urging the court to vacate the ex parte ad-interim injunction (I.A. No.




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                    Page 2
 9179 of 2003). Among other things, it argued that it had adopted the
BTXA mark before Allergan, that BTXA in no way impinged upon
the BOTOX trademark, and that Allergan had failed to show any sales
in India. The Single Judge agreed with Intas' contentions, and vacated
the order, and dismissed I.A. No. 7526 of 2003. Allergan filed a
review petition, and then an appeal, against the Single Judge's order.
In 2005, a Division Bench of the High Court partially allowed the
appeal with respect to the use of "BOTOX", and also allowed
Allergan to withdraw the rest of the appeal with liberty to pursue the
pending review petition.
</p><p id="p_11">6.     In the meantime, in February 2005, Allergan's 2002 application
to register the trademark BTX-A proceeded for registration. In light of
this, the Appellant filed an application under Order VI, Rule 17 of the
CPC, to amend the plaint in order to bring this new development on
record. The Appellant also filed a fresh application under Order
XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, for an interim injunction (I.A. No. 2439 of
2005). As a result of this, the review petition was disposed off with
the observation that, in light of the changed circumstances, there
would now be a fresh adjudication of the interlocutory relief.
</p><p id="p_12">7.      Later, in 2011, Allergan filed an application for arguments on
I.A. No. 2439 of 2005, and for the framing of issues on the basis of
which the trial could proceed. The learned Single Judge, however, by
the impugned order, dismissed the suit under Order XII, Rule 6 of the
CPC.
</p><p id="p_13">8.      Aggrieved by this order, Allergan is before this court, in
appeal. It argues that the Single Judge's order is contrary to the




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                  Page 3
 decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_1">Milmet Oftho Industries vs Allergan
Inc</a>., 2004 (28) PTC 585 (SC), recognizing the principle of "trans-
border reputation". It further argues that the record shows it to be the
prior user of both the marks BOTOX and BTX-A, and that the
respondent's mark BTXA is deceptively similar to both. It, therefore,
argues that this Court should set aside the order of the Single Judge,
and restore the suit and application for interim injunction (I.A. No.
2439 of 2005). It also asks this Court to restrain Intas from using the
marks "BOTOX" or "BTXA" or any other marks similar to the
Appellant's registered marks, BOTOX and BTX-A.
</p><p id="p_14">9.     It is argued by Mr. Lall, learned counsel for Allergan, that the
impact of the learned Single Judge's observations would be that
without recourse to rectification or cancellation proceedings, a
registered mark is virtually given a short shrift and the proprietor is
denied the right to claim judicial remedies based on allegations of
infringement. It was argued that whilst originally the suit was filed
before Allergan's application for registration of BTX-A was accepted,
the subsequent development, i.e the registration which took place on
10.02.2005 was disclosed in the pending suit; amendment was
allowed by the court, of the pleadings, on 28-09-2005. It was
submitted that an attempt to have the suit summarily rejected on the
ground of the court's lack of territorial jurisdiction was unsuccessful;
that application was dismissed on 28.04.2006. It is submitted that
Intas does not challenge the validity of the registration in respect of
BTX-A; it similarly never sought cancellation of that registered mark.
Therefore, the learned Single Judge's decision, premised as it is on the




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 4
 narrow ground of no established use, is based on an imperfect
appreciation of the materials and pleadings in the suit.
</p><p id="p_15">10.    It was argued that the learned Single Judge fell into error in
relying on Fedders Lloyd Corporation v Fedders Lloyd Corporation
119 (2005) DLT 410, because that case arose in the context of a claim
for cancellation of trademark. It was urged that the Single Judge erred
in observing that sales is a sine qua non to establish a case of passing
off, which, counsel argued, is established on use. The term "use" is
not restricted to sale of goods, but also extends to advertisement and
publicity of the mark. It was argued by Allergan that BOTOX and
BTX-A are used to refer to its products in medical journals,
publications etc; and owing to such extensive usage, both the marks
are associated with it and none else. This fact was ignored by the
Single Judge. It was argued, lastly that Allergan never gave up the
claim that Intas had passed off its mark; the claim in the suit was for
both infringement and passing off. In these circumstances, the learned
Single Judge could not have inferred an admission, and summarily
dismissed the suit under Order XII, Rule 6, CPC. Counsel underlined
that for a suit to be validly rejected or decreed in a summary fashion
under that provision, the admission relied on by the court must be
unambiguous and categorical. There were, argued counsel for
Allergan, no such pleas which could be construed as unambiguous
admissions, to warrant invocation of the provision enabling the court
to draw a decree.
</p><p id="p_16">11.    Mr. Biswajit Bhattacharya, learned senior counsel for Intas,
argued that Allergan has admitted non-use of the trademark BTX-A in




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 5
 India from 2002 till date. It is argued that in its plaint, Allergan has
not invoked the principle of trans-border reputation, and, therefore, it
cannot be permitted to lead evidence in that regard. Consequently, the
conclusions of the learned Single Judge are unexceptionable. It was
also pointed out that Intas itself sought registration of the BTX-A
trademark for its product, sold in India. The learned counsel reiterated
that mere registration of a mark did not ipso facto establish that it had
a reputation for the goods which it stood for. To claim injunction, an
equitable relief, the plaintiff- in this case Allergan - had to prima facie
show that such a reputation existed in India apart from its injury. All
the materials pointed to the plaintiff resting its claim for relief only on
the basis of registration of BTX-A and its alleged infringement.
Emphasizing that a trademark does not exist in vacuo and is meant to
be used, learned senior counsel relied on <a href="/doc/1945028/" id="a_2">Veerumal Praveen Kumar vs
M/S. Needle Industries (India</a>) 93 (2001) DLT 600. It was held in that
decision that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "if there is non-user for a long period of time then by
         mere registration of the mark continuing the respondents
         would not be entitled to any injunction. this view is
         further reinforced by the judgment in Imperial Group's
         case (supra) wherein it was held that where there is no
         trading to give rise to a goodwill there is no interest to be
         protected by a trademark and such a trademark cannot
         exist in vacuum."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">12.    Mr. Bhattacharya also relied on the Supreme Court's judgment
reported as <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_3">Corn Products Refining Co. vs. Shangrila Food Products
Ltd</a>. AIR 1960 SC 142 to the effect that:-
</p>



<p id="p_18">RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                         Page 6
          "Now of course, the presence of a mark in the
         register does not prove its user at all. It is possible
         that the mark may have been registered but not used.
         It is not permissible to draw any inference as to their
         user from the presence of the marks on the register."
</p>
<p id="p_19">13.    It was pointed out that this Court had approved a decision of the
Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1396867/" id="a_4">Cluett Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. vs. Arrow Apparels</a>
1998 PTC (18) 156 where the issue of delay as a defense when the
mark had been copied was considered. The Court agreed with the
defendant that in a suit for trademark infringement priority in use
could not be dishonest. It was highlighted that the Bombay High Court
observed that the right of exclusive use is acquired by user or by
registration or by assignment but the essential feature for constituting
the proprietary in trademark is that it should be used by the proprietor
in his business or in connection with his vendible commodity. The
court was of the view that though the delay by itself was not a defense
but non-user of the mark loses its distinctiveness. A trademark which
drops out of the use dies for non-user. Where there are no goods
offered for sale, there is no use of trademark. Intas also reiterated its
submissions, and relied on Fedders Lloyd Corporation (supra).
Analysis and Conclusions
</p><p id="p_20">14.    Before considering the order of the Single Judge, the position of
law with respect to Order XII, Rule 6 of the CPC may briefly be
recapitulated. Under Order XII, Rule 6 of the CPC,
       "where admissions of fact have been made either in the
      pleading or otherwise, whether orally or in writing, the court
      may at any stage of the suit, either on the application of an
      party or of its own motion and without waiting for the




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                       Page 7
       determination of any other question between the parties,
      make such Order or give such judgment as it may think fit,
      having regard to such admissions."
</p>
<p id="p_21">15.    A bare reading of the Rule reveals that the Court's
order/judgment should be limited to addressing the specific
consequences that follow from whatever admissions have been made,
and should not affect unresolved questions of fact and law between the
parties, that are contentious notwithstanding the admissions. The
object of Order XII, Rule 6 was clarified by the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/1421752/" id="a_5">Uttam Singh Dugal &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Union Bank of India and Ors</a>., AIR
2000 SC 2740:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "12.................In the objects and reasons set out while
      amending the said rule, it is stated that "where a claim
      is admitted, the Court has jurisdiction to enter a
      judgment for the plaintiff and to pass a decree on
      admitted claim." The object of the Rule is to enable the
      party to obtain a speedy judgment at least to the extent
      of the relief to which according to the admission of the
      defendant, the plaintiff is entitled... Where other party
      has made a plain admission entitling the former to
      succeed, it should apply and also wherever there is a
      clear admission of facts in the face of which, it is
      impossible for the party making such admission to
      succeed.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">16.    Thus, the judgment of the Supreme Court is that Order XII,
Rule 6 CPC applies when, and to the extent that, an admission by a
party automatically entitles the opposing party to succeed in some or
all aspects of the case.
</p><p id="p_23">17.    This, indeed, was the ratio of this Court in Express Towers P.
</p>



<p id="p_24">RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 8
 <a href="/doc/1856778/" id="a_6">Ltd. and Anr. vs Mohan Singh and Ors</a>. , (2007) 97 DRJ 687 (DB):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "Under Order XII, Rule 6 of the Code, a decree can be
      passed or a suit can be dismissed when admissions are
      clear and unambiguous and no other interpretation is
      possible. The Court also is vested with a right to ask for
      independent corroboration of facts, even when denial in
      the pleadings is not specific. Right to pass a judgment or
      order under Order XII, Rule 6 of the Code is
      discretionary and not mandatory. It may not be safe and
      correct to pass a judgment under Order XII, Rule 6 of
      the Code when a case involves disputed questions of fact
      and law which require adjudication and decision. Even
      when a party has made an admission, the Court need
      not dismiss or allow the suit. Judgment on the basis of
      admissions is not a matter of right but a matter of
      discretion for the Court."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">18.    The proposition that a suit should not be dismissed under Order
XII, Rule 6 CPC as long as there remain contested issues of law and
fact (unrelated to the admission in question), was affirmed, in the
specific context of trademark and passing off law, by the High Court
of Delhi in Britannia Industries vs Cremica Agro Foods, ILR (2009) 1
Del 575. Simultaneously examining the plaintiff's plea for an interim
injunction, and the defendant's plea for dismissal under Order XII,
Rule 6 of the CPC, the Court found that resolving the issue would
require a detailed investigation of the facts of the case, and a reasoned
application of law to the facts. Consequently, the Court held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         "At this stage, the court does not engage itself in a
         detailed scrutiny; the trial would doubtless unravel
         the plaintiff's detailed evidence about distinctiveness
         of the mark, claimed by it, and the secondary meaning
         it attributes to "Greetings". For purposes of deciding
         these applications, the materials are insufficient to




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                      Page 9
          entitle it to ad-interim injunctive relief. For these
         reasons, I.A 11786/2006 (under Order XXXIX Rules 1
         &amp; 2CPC) has to fail. The reasoning indicated above
         also in the opinion of the Court would be dispositive
         of I.A 298/2008, a composite application by the
         defendant under Order XII Rule 6 CPC read with
         Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC. As far as the claim for a
         decree on admissions is concerned, the court finds
         that the pleadings of the plaintiff do not amount to an
         unambiguous admission of the kind entitling the
         defendant to a decree for dismissal of the suit."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">19.    In Karam Kapahi &amp; Ors. Vs. Lal Chand Public Charitable
Trust &amp; Anr (2010) 4 SCC 753 the Supreme Court held that
      "....... The provision under Order 12 Rule 6 of the Code
      is enabling, discretionary and permissive and is neither
      mandatory nor is it peremptory since the word "may"
      has been used."
</p>
<p id="p_27">20.    <a href="/doc/120688355/" id="a_7">Jeevan Diesels and Electricals Limited vs. Jasbir Singh Chadha
(HUF) &amp; Anr</a> (2010) 6 SCC 601 is an authority for the proposition
that admissions should not be inferred readily and are fact dependent
("a question of fact") in each case, where judicial precedent plays a
marginal role: "The question, namely, whether there is a clear
admission or not cannot be decided on the basis of a judicial
precedent. Therefore, even though the principles in Karam Kapahi
(supra) may be unexceptionable they cannot be applied in the instant
case in view of totally different fact situation."
</p><p id="p_28">21.    In dismissing Allergan's suit under Order XII, Rule 6 CPC, the
Single Judge held that the "admission" in question was the
plaintiff/appellant's concession that since the registration of the




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 10
 trademark BTX-A, it had not sold BTX-A at all. The Single Judge
invoked the judgments of the Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/330682/" id="a_8">Fedders Lloyd
Corporation Ltd. vs Fedders Corporation</a>, 119 (2005) DLT 410 and
<a href="/doc/1945028/" id="a_9">M/s. Veerumal Praveen Kumar vs M/s. Needle Industries (India) Ltd.
and Anr</a>., 2001 (93) DLT 600, to hold that without any sale of goods,
the question of trademark infringement or passing off wouldn't even
arise.
</p><p id="p_29">22.      Neither Fedders Lloyd Corporation (supra), and nor Veerumal
Praveen Kumar (supra) were cases on admission, decreeing the suit,
under Order XII, Rule 6 CPC cases. Veerumal Praveen Kumar (supra)
was a suit claiming permanent injunction for trademark infringement
and passing off. The learned Single Judge in the present case relied
upon paragraphs 24, 25, 26 and 29 of the Veerumal Praveen Kumar
(supra) judgment, wherein the Delhi High Court, relying upon the
Bombay High Court's judgment in <a href="/doc/1396867/" id="a_10">Cluett Peabody v. Arrow Apparels</a>
1998 PTC (18) 156, held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "We are in agreement with the view of the learned Single
      Judge of the Bombay High Court that if there is non-
      user for a long period of time then by mere registration
      of the mark continuing the respondents would not be
      entitled to any injunction. This view is further reinforced
      by the judgment in Imperial Group's case
      (supra) wherein it was held that where there is no
      trading to give rise to a goodwill there is no interest to
      be protected by a trademark and such a trademark
      cannot exist in vacuum."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">23.      The Single Judge, however, omitted to notice paragraphs 22 and
23 of Veerumal Praveen Kumar (supra), that form the necessary




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                    Page 11
 backdrop to understanding the subsequent analysis that he relied upon.
In Paragraph 22, the High Court noted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "Taking into consideration the submissions advanced on
      behalf of the appellant and the respondents the
      following aspects would require adjudication in the
      present appeal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      1) The effect of the respondents being the registered
      owner of the trademark '555', taking into consideration
      the allegations of non-use by the appellant.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      2) Whether the respondents were able to establish prima
      facie any world-wide reputation and sales under the
      trademark"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">24.    Immediately afterwards, in paragraph 23, the Court held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "The counsel for the parties have taken us though the
      documents to show their sales. These are in the form of
      invoices and other materials. We find force in the
      submission of learned counsel for the appellant that the
      material placed on record shows sales only for a short
      period of time from 1977 to 1979. It is an admitted
      position that the inter - se license agreement between the
      two respondents did not survive after 1981, which prima
      facie show that there has been no sales by the
      respondent after 1981. Though the aspect of global
      reputation has been mentioned above, as the second
      issue, it would be pertinent to state at this stage that no
      material has been placed on record to substantiate this
      claim of global reputation. The invoices are for a limited
      period of time and some of the invoices relate to Hong
      Kong. There is also nothing on record to show any
      reputation of the goods of the respondents in India in
      1960s and 1970s, as observed by the learned Single
      Judge.."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">25.    Therefore, in paragraphs 24 to 29, the Court's exhaustive




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                    Page 12
 analysis of whether or not there were sales in India was predicated
upon the assumption that there was no global worldwide reputation
that the claimant could fall back upon. Presumably, if the claimants
had been able to demonstrate worldwide reputation, then the absence
of sales in India might not have been fatal to their claims.
Furthermore and perhaps importantly, in Veerumal Praveen Kumar
(supra) the Court was considering a claim for ad-interim injunction,
during the pendency of the suit and it was not a case for rejection of
the plaint. This is clearly evident from the observation in Para 35 (of
the judgment in that case) that: "There is another aspect to this matter.
We are dealing with the matter at the interlocutory stage. The rights
have yet to be finally decided in the suit."
</p><p id="p_33">26.    This logic (of global reputation of a trademark being relevant in
an infringement claim) is expressly endorsed by the Supreme Court, in
<a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_11">N.R. Dongre vs Whirlpool Corporation</a>, AIR 1995 Del 300, where the
Supreme Court held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "In today's world it cannot be said a product and the
      trade mark under which it is sold abroad, does not have
      a reputation or goodwill in countries where it is not
      available. The knowledge and awareness of it and its
      critical evaluation and appraisal travels beyond the
      confines of the geographical area in which it is old."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">27.    This is known as the doctrine of trans-border reputation. It has
acquired special currency in the field of pharmaceutical products, as is
evidenced in the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_12">Milmet Oftho
Industries vs Allergan</a>, (2004) 12 SCC 624, and cited by Allergan. In
that case, the Court held:

<p id="p_35">RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 13
        "... the Courts must also keep in mind the fact that
       nowadays the field of medicine is of an international
       character. The Court has to keep in mind the possibility
       that with the passage of time, some conflict may occur
       between the use of the mark by the Applicant in India
       and the user by the overseas company. The Court must
       ensure that public interest is in no way imperiled.
       Doctors particularly eminent doctors, medical
       practitioners and persons or Companies connected with
       medical field keep abreast of latest developments in
       medicine and preparations worldwide. Medical
       literature is freely available in this country. Doctors,
       medical practitioners and persons connected with the
       medical field regularly attend medical conferences,
       symposiums, lectures etc. It must also be remembered
       that nowadays goods are widely advertised in
       newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other media
       which is available in the country. This results in a
       product acquiring a worldwide reputation. Thus, if a
       mark in respect of a drug is associated with the
       Respondents worldwide it would lead to an anomalous
       situation if an identical mark in respect of a similar drug
       is allowed to be sold in India."
</p>
<p id="p_36">28.     In paragraph 11 of the impugned judgment, the Single Judge
rejected reliance upon Milmet Oftho Industries (supra) by observing
that
         "the Supreme Court has been quite categorical in
       observing that multinational corporations having no
       intention of coming into India or introducing their
       products in India should not be allowed to throttle an
       Indian company by not permitting it to sell a product in
       India."
</p>
<p id="p_37">29.     These observations are taken from paragraph 8 of the Supreme
Court's judgment, which we may here excerpt:
</p>



<p id="p_38">RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                     Page 14
       "Multinational corporations, who have no intention of
      coming to India or introducing their product in India
      should not be allowed to throttle an Indian Company by
      not permitting it to sell a product in India, if the Indian
      Company has genuinely adopted the mark and
      developed the product and is first in the market. Thus
      the ultimate test should be who is first in the market."
</p>
<p id="p_39">30.    In paragraph 9, however, the Court went on to hold that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      "The mere fact that the Respondents have not been using
      the mark in India would be irrelevant if they were first in
      the world market. The Division Bench had relied upon
      material which prima-facie shows that the Respondents
      product was advertised before the Appellants entered the
      field. On the basis of that material the Division Bench
      has concluded that the Respondents were first to adopt
      the mark. If that be so then no fault can be found with
      the conclusion drawn by the Division Bench."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">31.    Therefore, the ratio of the Supreme Court in Milmet Oftho
Industries (supra) is that claims for non-user must be examined in the
light of the principles of trans-border reputation, the intention of the
applicant to enter into the Indian market, as well as its priority in the
international market. This enquiry, therefore, is bound to raise a
number of several mixed questions of law and fact.
</p>

<p id="p_41">32.    The impugned judgment also held that Milmet Oftho (supra)
was irrelevant because the plaintiff/appellant made no claim of that
manner in its plaint, and therefore, could not possibly lead evidence to
that purpose in a trial. It is a settled position of law that a pleading not
raised in a plaint cannot be substantiated by way of evidence. Cases




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                     Page 15
 relying upon this proposition invoke the dictum of Lord Dunedin,
writing for the Privy Council, in Siddik Mohamed Shah vs Mt Saran,
AIR 1930 PC 57. In that case, it was argued by the appellant that
certain land belonged to him because it was given to him in the form
of a gift; this claim had not, however, been made before the lower
courts. Consequently, Lord Dunedin held that "[since] that claim was
never made in the defence presented and the learned Judicial
Commissioners therefore, very truly find that no amount of evidence
can be looked into upon a plea which was never put forward."
</p><p id="p_42">33.    However, it has also been held by the Courts that as long a
particular claim is "sufficiently pleaded" in the plaint, the plaintiff
should be allowed to adduce evidence in support of his claim.
(<a href="/doc/866841/" id="a_13">Mahadeo Shriniwas Naik vs Ratanchand Anandram Doshi</a>, (2004) 4
Bom CR 415); in addition, the Supreme Court held, in <a href="/doc/1094547/" id="a_14">Hiralal
Moolchand Doshi vs Barot Raman Lal Rancchoddas</a>, (1993) 2 SCC
458, that certain claims made by a defendant can "impliedly admit"
the existence of a particular claim on the part of the plaintiff, even if
the plaintiff himself does not specifically make it. In that case, the
High Court had set aside a decree for eviction on the ground the
landlord had not pleaded bona fide personal requirement. Reversing,
the Supreme Court held that a plea for accommodation of time made
by a tenant was held to impliedly admit the requirement of bona fide
personal use by the landlord. These holdings are supported by Order
VI, Rule 2 of the CPC, which requires the pleading to contain "the
material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or
defence". Notably, it does not require the parties to list every specific




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 16
 argument, in terms, that could be used to connect the material facts to
the prayer.
</p><p id="p_43">34.    A perusal of the pleadings of Allergan throughout the course of
the proceedings, reveals an arguable case for both exceptions to the
specific pleading rule discussed above. It repeatedly argued that even
though it did not engage in any sales in India, it had registered the
trademark in many countries abroad, and that it had been discussed in
journals and magazines. Allergan has annexed a substantial number of
documents to demonstrate the same. In substance, this is nothing other
than a claim for injunctions on the basis of a trans-border reputation.
And secondly, Intas itself has engaged with the argument repeatedly.
For instance, in paragraph 26 its reply to Allergan's original request
for an injunction, it has argued that because it has never launched
BTX-A in India, therefore the question of goodwill or reputation
doesn't arise. This is, in effect, a denial of trans-border reputation,
impliedly admitting the existence of the claim. While a Court may
eventually find, on a detailed scrutiny of the pleadings, that neither the
plaint nor the respondent's pleadings make out a case for an exception
to the rule, and disallow the appellant from leading evidence, that is
not a conclusion the Court can come to on the basis of an Order XII,
Rule 6 CPC prima facie enquiry.
</p><p id="p_44">35.      In paragraph 16 of its original application for injunction under
Orders XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 (I.A. No. 7596 of 2003), the plaintiff
specified that its trademark, BTX-A, has been registered and/or is
pending registration in "several countries around the world", and
subsequently argued that




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 17
         "the adoption of the trademark BTXA and/or BOTOX
      by the Defendant is a deliberate attempt to ride upon the
      goodwill and reputation of [the Plaintiff No. 1]... [and]
      likely to cause irreparable harm and injury to the
      Plaintiff No. 1 as manufacturers and merchants of high
      quality goods." (paragraph 26 of I.A. No. 7596 of
      2003).
</p>
<p id="p_45">36.    In the documents appended to its original plaint, the plaintiff
also attached the registration certificates of BTX-A in various
countries, as well as an article about it in the Trademarks Law Journal.
These averments were repeated in the application to amend the plaint
(on the basis of the registration of BTX-A in India), as well as in its
application for injunction (I.A. No. 2439 of 2005) that was based upon
the changed circumstances. In its amended plaint (Suit No. 1445 of
2003), it averred that it is a
       "global speciality pharmaceutical company [that]
      markets its products in 100 countries worldwide",

      and in this context, reiterating the claim that the
       "usage of the trademark BTXA is likely to dilute the
      distinctive character of Plaintiff No. 1's trademarks
      BOTOX and BTX-A as the same are likely to be debased
      and eroded. It also reiterates the claim that "millions of
      people around the world are using the Plaintiff's
      medicines for curing Glabellar Frown Lines."
</p>
<p id="p_46">37.    Furthermore, of course, whether there actually exists trans-
border reputation in this case, and whether the nature and amount of
publicity abroad was enough, following the dictum of the Supreme
Court, for Allergan to succeed in a trademark infringement or passing




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 18
 off claim, is a factual question for a Court to decide, during the course
of a trial.
</p><p id="p_47">38.    The Single Judge also relied upon Fedders Lloyd Corporation
(supra). Not only was Fedders (supra) not a case of decree on
admissions under Order XII, Rule 6 CPC, it was not even an
injunction case. Fedders (supra) was about an application to cancel a
registered trademark, which is not the issue in the present matter. In
any event, the Single Judge relied upon paragraph 23 of the judgment,
in which the Court held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      "Though the object of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_15">Trade Marks Act</a> is to protect
      the proprietary rights of a registered trademark holder,
      at the same time the object is not to facilitate any
      monopoly of such registered trade mark holder, despite
      non use of the trademark by him as contemplated by the
      Act. A trademark has no meaning, even if it is registered,
      unless it is used in relation to goods and/or services. A
      Trademark which drops out of the use, dies when there
      are no goods offered for sale as there is no use of the
      trademark. The mark can lose its distinctiveness by non
      use, where non use is on the part of registered trade
      mark holder but not on account of external factors
      beyond the control of such registered trade mark
      holder."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">39.    As the end of the quoted paragraph suggests, however, the mere
fact of non-use is insufficient to void the trademark. This is borne out
by the Court's observations in paragraph 31:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      "The intention of the proprietor not to use the trade
      mark at the time of registration and also the actual non-</blockquote>
<p id="p_49">      use of the trade mark subsequent thereto is also to be
      established... A person who intends to manufacture
      goods or has made preparations for the manufacture of




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 19
       goods but the manufacture has not commenced and,
      therefore, goods have not been marketed is nonetheless
      entitled to get the trade mark which he proposes to use
      in relation to those goods registered. In the present day
      world of commerce and industry, a manufacturing
      industry can neither be commenced nor established
      overnight."
</p>
<p id="p_50">40.    And again, in paragraph 32:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      "Thus, what is to be considered is : whether there is no
      evidence of the intention of the respondent no.1
      regarding his trade mark 'Fedders' to use the same."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">41.    It is, therefore, clear that the fact of non-use is only the point of
departure for a detailed factual and legal enquiry about the applicant's
intentions, the surrounding market circumstances, and the objective of
preventing stagnant monopolies.
</p><p id="p_52">42.    The above discussion reveals that the issues in this case are not
restricted to that of trans-border reputation, but are also related to
Allergan's intention to enter the market, as well as the issue of market
structure too. Therefore, even if one were to accept Intas's argument -
as the Single Judge did - that because the plea of trans-border
reputation was not specifically made in the plaint, and, therefore,
cannot now be argued, there remain enough contested issues in the
case, which render an Order XII, Rule 6 dismissal unjustified.
</p><p id="p_53">43.    Another important detail which courts have to keep in mind is
that the Registrar of Trademarks is duty bound under provisions of the
Act to enquire into various aspects before granting registrations. The
enquiry is in respect of all matters outlined in <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_16">Section 9</a> of the Act.
</p>



<p id="p_54">RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                     Page 20
 Other conditions and mandatory requirements which have to be kept
in mind by the Registrar are spelt out in <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_17">Section 11</a>. By <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_18">Section 11</a> (1),
registration is prevented if the mark, because of its identity with an
existing mark in relation to similar goods or services can create a
likelihood of confusion on part of the public; By <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_19">Section 11</a> (2) the
proposed mark cannot be registered if it can be identified with another
mark but for dissimilar services or goods, if the earlier mark is a well-
known mark. (A well-known mark, under <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_20">Section 2</a> (zg) is one, "in
relation to any goods or services, means a mark which has become so
to the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or
receives such services that the use of such mark in relation to other
goods or services would be likely to be taken as indicating a
connection in the course of trade or rendering of services between
those goods or services and a person using the mark in relation to the
first- mentioned goods or services."). <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_21">Section 11</a> (6) spells out the
considerations for registration of a "well known" mark. Likewise, by
virtue of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_22">Section 11</a> (9), the Registrar cannot take into account
whether such mark has been used in India, or even if it is well known
elsewhere or has been registered elsewhere. <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_23">Section 46</a> (1) clarifies
that "No application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of
any goods or services shall be refused nor shall permission for such
registration be withheld, on the ground only that it appears that the
applicant does not use or propose to use the trade mark" if the
registrar is satisfied that conditions spelt out in that provision are
fulfilled. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_24">The Act</a> itself, therefore, recognizes that use is not premised
on actual use; it can be intended use. This aspect is rendered irrelevant




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                   Page 21
 if the mark is a "well known" mark. Under <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_25">Section 11</a> (9), the
Registrar shall not require, as a condition, whether a well known mark
has been used in India, or even if it is well known elsewhere or has
been registered elsewhere. Thus, the concept of trans-border
reputation (in the context of use) is recognized by the Indian statute.
</p><p id="p_55">44.    The statutory remedy for removal of a trademark from the
register is in <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_26">Section 47</a>, which outlines the grounds for
cancellation/removal:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "47. Removal from register and imposition of limitations
      on ground of non-use.-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      (1) A register trade mark may be taken off the register in
      respect of the goods or services in respect of which it is

      provisions of <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_27">section 46</a> apply, by the company
      concerned or the registered user, as the case may be,
      and that there has, in fact, been no bona f-de use of the
      trade mark in relation to those goods or services by any
      proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date three
      months before the date of the application, or

      register or longer had elapsed during which the trade
      mark was registered and during which there was no
      bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods or
      services by any proprietor thereof for the time being.</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">      Provided that except where the applicant has been

       permitted under <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_28">section 12</a> to register an identical or
      nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods or
      services in question or where the tribunal is of opinion
      that the might properly be permitted so to register such
      a trade mark, the tribunal may refuse an application
      under clause (a) or clause (b) in relation to any goods
      or services, if it is shown that there has been, before the
      relevant date or during the relevant period, as the case
      may be, bonafide use of the trade mark by any

</p><p id="p_58">      (ii) goods or services associated with those goods or
      services of that description being goods or services, as
      the case may be, in respect of which the trade mark is
      registered."
</p><p id="p_59">45.    The above provisions clarify that non-use can be a ground for
cancellation by the Registrar or the Intellectual Property Appellate
Board, through separate proceedings. The Court, in a suit for
enforcement of the rights of a trademark proprietor, has jurisdiction to
grant or refuse the reliefs claimed, such as decree for injunction,
accounts, damages etc. However, its orders cannot result in ouster of
jurisdiction of statutory bodies and Tribunals. The effect of the learned
Single Judge's judgment is a virtual declaration of non-use of a
registered trademark, without the benefit of a trial or following the
procedure under the Trademarks Act. This was clearly unwarranted.
</p>
<p id="p_60">46.    During the course of oral arguments, a contention was also
made with respect to the trafficking of trademarks, and the case of
<a href="/doc/103561/" id="a_29">American Home Products vs Mac Laboratories Pvt Ltd</a>, 1985 Sup (3)
SCR 264. That case bears no relevance to the present matter, however,
because the issue of trafficking was raised with respect to a situation




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                    Page 23
 where a trademark holder registers his trademark without any
intention of using it, and then authorizes a separate third party to make
use of the trademark. In any event, the question of trafficking - as is
amply demonstrated by the reasoning in American Home Products
(supra), involves complex questions of fact and law, and is not a fit
issue for the Court to go into in an Order XII, Rule 6 inquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_61">47.    Thus, in conclusion: as the discussion of the Supreme Court and
this Court's rulings under Order XII, Rule 6 reveal, a decree of
dismissal under that Rule is justified only if the admission in question
puts to rest the legal and factual contentions that arise in the suit,
relating to its subject matter. The discussion above makes it clear that
an admission of non-use, in the context of trademark infringement and
passing off, settled nothing at all. Rather, the Court must then
investigate, and subject to detailed scrutiny, a whole host of
contentious issues, such as trans-border reputation, intention to enter
the market, and so on, as well as interpret past Supreme Court and
High Court precedents. All these issues, as noted above and on the
facts of the case, are relevant in the present matter, and are left
unresolved by the Appellants' admission.
</p>
<p id="p_62">48..    In view of the above discussion, the Single Judge's order
cannot be sustained. The first part of Allergan's appeal, therefore,
succeeds. As the appeal is from an Order XII, Rule 6 dismissal, it is
clarified that this is not a judgment on the merits of the case; all rights
and contentions of the parties are kept open, and are reserved.
Allergan, therefore, has to establish its claim during the trial of the




RFA (OS) 54/2013                                                    Page 24
 suit.
</p>
<p id="p_63">49.     For the above reasons, the appeal is partially allowed. The
order of the Single Judge, dated October 9, 2012, in C.S. (OS) No.
1445 of 2003 is accordingly set aside. The suit is restored to the file.
The said suit, and application for interim injunction (I.A. No. 2439 of
2005), are directed to be listed before the learned Single Judge
according to roster, on 25.09.2014 who shall frame issues for trial, in
accordance with law and proceed thereafter, to adjudicate the merits of
the suit.
