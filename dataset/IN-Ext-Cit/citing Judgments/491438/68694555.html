<p id="p_1">1.            Shiva @ Uan (A-1), Kallu @ Veeru (since expired) and

Vicky (A-2) were sent for trial in case FIR No. 121/2009 PS Pahar Ganj

on the allegations that on 10.05.2009 at 10.15 P.M. at Sadar Thana Road
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                  Page 1 of 13</span>
 near corner of Street No.8, Muttani Dhanda, Pahar Ganj, they in

furtherance of common intention caused injuries to Vicky and Monu in an

attempt to murder them. Kallu @ Veeru expired during pendency of tiral

and proceedings against him were dropped. A-1 and A-2 were held guilty

for committing offence punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_1">Section 307</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">34</a> IPC by a

judgment dated 22.12.2011 in Sessions Case No. 119/2009. By an order

dated 23.12.2011, they were sentenced to undergo RI for seven years with

fine ` 25,000/- each.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.            Daily Diary (DD) No. 2A (Ex.PW-9/A) was recorded at PS

Pahar Ganj at 12.55 A.M. by PW-11 (HC Suresh Kumar) on getting

information that Monu and Vicky were admitted in Lady Harding Medical

College (LHMC) by Suraj. The investigation was assigned to HC Sailesh

who with Const.Lalit went to the spot. The Investigating Officer lodged

First Information Report after recording Vicky's statement (Ex.PW-9/B).

During the course of investigation, the accused persons were arrested and

interrogated. The exhibits were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL)

for examination. Statements of the witnesses conversant with the facts

were recorded. On completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was

submitted against the three assailants. They were duly charged and

brought to trial. The prosecution examined fifteen witnesses. In their 313
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                               Page 2 of 13</span>
 statements the appellants pleaded false implication. Smt.Urmila appeared

in their defence as DW-1.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.             Appellants' counsel urged that the Trial Court did not

appreciate the evidence in its true and proper perspective. PW-4 (Suraj)

resiled from his previous statement and did not implicate the appellants.

The prosecution did not examine the complainant/ victim - Vicky and

adverse inference is to drawn against it. Vital discrepancies emerging in

the statement of the prosecution witnesses were ignored without valid

reasons. Learned APP urged that PW-5 (Monu)'s testimony is sufficient

to establish the appellants' guilt and there are no sound reasons to discard

his version.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.             Injuries on the bodies of Monu and Vicky are not under

challenge. Ram Naresh, Duty Constable, LHMC, lodged DD No. 2A

(Ex.PW-9/A) stating that one Suraj had admitted Monu and Vicky in the

hospital. PW-12 (Dr.Divish Saxena) medically examined both Monu and

Vicky vide MLCs Ex.PW-12/A and Ex.PW-12/B. The nature of injuries

sustained by Monu were opined 'grievous' caused by a sharp weapon.

Vicky sustained injuries 'simple' in nature caused by sharp object. His

testimony remained unchallenged.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                 Page 3 of 13</span>
</p><p id="p_6"> 5.            PW-9 (HC Shailesh Kumar), the Investigating Officer

recorded Vicky's statement (Ex.PW-9/B) in the hospital and sent rukka

(Ex.PW-9/C) promptly at 02.10 A.M. for lodging First Information

Report. Contents of the FIR reveal that all the three accused persons were

named as assailants. Vicky gave graphic details as to how and under what

circumstances the three assailants had inflicted injuries with knives on

their bodies. Star witness to establish the complicity of the appellants in

the crime is PW-5 (Monu), the victim. In his Court statement he deposed

that on 10.05.2009, he lived with his brother-in-law Vicky. At about 08.00

P.M., he and his jija Vicky went to Aggarwal Sweets, Pahar Ganj to

purchase cake and sweets to celebrate the birthday of his nephew. When

they were crossing corner of street No.8, Sadar Thana Road, A-1, A-2 and

Kallu met and threatened to see them. They all had knives. A-1 hit victim

Vicky with knife on his leg. When he attempted to save his jija, A-1 fled

the spot. A-2 and Kallu hit him with knife on his stomach with an

intention to kill him. Vicky's brother Suraj who was standing nearby took

them to LHMC. In the cross-examination, he explained that the incident

continued for about one hour. He volunteered to add that it started at about

09.30 or 10.00 P.M. He denied the suggestion that the accused persons

were not author of the injuries caused to him. Apparently, the appellants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                 Page 4 of 13</span>
 could not elicit any material discrepancies in the cross-examination to

disbelieve his version or to impeach his testimony. Material and relevant

facts proved by him remained unchallenged. No ulterior motive was

assigned to him for falsely implicating the accused persons in the incident.

He was fair enough to attribute specific role qua each accused and the part

played by them individually in causing injuries to them. His statement is

in consonance with the version narrated to the police at the first instance

by injured Vicky and there are no material variations. There are no good

reasons to disbelieve the injured witness whose testimony stands on a

higher pedestal. Mere contradictions/improvements on trivial matters

cannot render an injured witness's deposition untrustworthy. The law on

this aspect has been detailed in the judgment „<a href="/doc/197643/" id="a_3">State of Uttar Pradesh vs.

Naresh and ors</a>.‟, (2011) 4 SCC 324 as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "27. The evidence of an injured witness must be given due
       weightage being a stamped witness, thus, his presence cannot
       be doubted. His statement is generally considered to be very
       reliable and it is unlikely that he has spared the actual
       assailant in order to falsely implicate someone else. The
       testimony of an injured witness has its own relevancy and
       efficacy as he has sustained injuries at the time and place of
       occurrence and this lends support to his testimony that he was
       present during the occurrence. Thus, the testimony of an
       injured witness is accorded a special status in law. The witness
       would not like or want to let his actual assailant go
       unpunished merely to implicate a third person falsely for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                 Page 5 of 13</span>
        commission of the offence. Thus, the evidence of the injured
       witness should be relied upon unless there are grounds for the
       rejection of his evidence on the basis of major contradictions
       and discrepancies therein. (Vide Jarnail Singh v. State of
       Punjab, <a href="/doc/213150/" id="a_4">Balraje v. State of Maharashtra</a> and <a href="/doc/126399/" id="a_5">Abdul Sayeed v.
       State of M.P</a>.)"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">6.            Similarly in another case '<a href="/doc/126399/" id="a_6">Abdul Sayed vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh</a>‟, (2010) 10 SCC 259, Supreme Court observed that :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       "28. The question of the weight to be attached to the evidence
       of a witness that was himself injured in the course of the
       occurrence has been extensively discussed by this Court.
       Where a witness to the occurrence has himself been injured in
       the incident, the testimony of such a witness is generally
       considered to be very reliable, as he is a witness that comes
       with a built-in guarantee of his presence at the scene of the
       crime and is unlikely to spare his actual assailant(s) in order
       to falsely implicate someone. "Convincing evidence is required
       to discredit an injured witness." [Vide Ramlagan Singh v.
       State of Bihar, Malkhan Singh v. State of U.P., Machhi Singh
       v. State of Punjab, Appabhai v. State of Gujarat, <a href="/doc/491438/" id="a_7">Bonkya v.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       29. While deciding this issue, a similar view was taken in
       <a href="/doc/1946408/" id="a_11">Jarnail Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, where this Court reiterated
       the special evidentiary status accorded to the testimony of an
       injured accused and relying on its earlier judgments held as
       under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            "28. Darshan Singh (PW 4) was an injured witness.
            He had been examined by the doctor. His testimony
            could not be brushed aside lightly. He had given full
            details of the incident as he was present at the time
            when the assailants reached the tubewell. <a href="/doc/651601/" id="a_12">In
            Shivalingappa Kallayanappa v. State of Karnataka</a>
            this Court has held that the deposition of the injured

             witness should be relied upon unless there are
            strong grounds for rejection of his evidence on the
            basis of major contradictions and discrepancies, for
            the reason that his presence on the scene stands
            established in case it is proved that he suffered the
            injury during the said incident.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            29. <a href="/doc/333507/" id="a_13">In State of U.P. v. Kishan Chand</a> a similar view
            has been reiterated observing that the testimony of a
            stamped witness has its own relevance and efficacy.
            The fact that the witness sustained injuries at the
            time and place of occurrence, lends support to his
            testimony that he was present during the
            occurrence. In case the injured witness is subjected
            to lengthy cross-examination and nothing can be
            elicited to discard his testimony, it should be relied
            upon (vide <a href="/doc/304052/" id="a_14">Krishan v. State of Haryana</a>). Thus, we
            are of the considered opinion that evidence of
            Darshan Singh (PW 4) has rightly been relied upon
            by the courts below."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       30. The law on the point can be summarised to the effect that
       the testimony of the injured witness is accorded a special
       status in law. This is as a consequence of the fact that the
       injury to the witness is an inbuilt guarantee of his presence at
       the scene of the crime and because the witness will not want to
       let his actual assailant go unpunished merely to falsely
       implicate a third party for the commission of the offence. Thus,
       the deposition of the injured witness should be relied upon
       unless there are strong grounds for rejection of his evidence on
       the basis of major contradictions and discrepancies therein."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">7.            It is true that PW-4 (Suraj) did not prefer to support the

prosecution and completely turned hostile. It appears that PW-4 (Suraj)

for some reasons has not presented true facts and has opted to exonerate

the assailants, though he was close relative of injured Vicky. His name

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                  Page 7 of 13</span>
 finds mentioned in DD No. 2A (Ex.PW-9/A); statement of the informant/

complainant (Ex.PW-9/B); MLCs (Ex.PW-12/A and Ex.PW-12/B). The

genuineness of these documents have not been denied. Though PW-4 did

not implicate the accused, nevertheless he corroborated Monu's version

that he sustained injuries on his stomach. It is a settled legal preposition

that the evidence of a witness cannot be rejected in toto merely because

the prosecution chose to treat him as hostile and cross-examined him. The

evidence of such witnesses cannot be treated as effaced or washed of the

record altogether but the same can be accepted to the extent their version

is found to be dependable on a careful scrutiny thereof.

</p><p id="p_9">8.            I find no substance to draw adverse inference against

prosecution for their failure to examine and produce injured Vicky.

Efforts were made to procure his presence in the Court. However, the

process issued was retuned unexecuted and he was untraceable. Non-

examination of Vicky does not dilute the prosecution version proved by

Monu. <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_15">Section 134</a> Evidence Act clearly shows that no specific number of

witnesses is required to prove a fact. It is not the number of witnesses that

matters but it is the substance. In 'Prithipal Singh etc. vs. State of Punjab

and Anr.', 2012 (1) SCC 10, the Supreme Court held :
</p>
<p id="p_10">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                  Page 8 of 13</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        "26. This Court has consistently held that as a general rule
       the Court can and may act on the testimony of a single witness
       provided he is wholly reliable. There is no legal impediment
       in convicting a person on the sole testimony of a single
       witness. That is the logic of <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_16">Section 134</a> of the Evidence Act.
       But if there are doubts about the testimony, the court will
       insist on corroboration. In fact, it is not the number or the
       quantity, but the quality that is material. The time- honoured
       principle is that evidence has to be weighed and not counted.
       The test is whether the evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent,
       credible and trustworthy or otherwise. The legal system has
       laid emphasis on value, weight and quality of evidence, rather
       than on quantity, multiplicity or plurality of witnesses. It is,
       therefore, open to a competent court to fully and completely
       rely on a solitary witness and record conviction. Conversely,
       it may acquit the accused in spite of testimony of several
       witnesses if it is not satisfied about the quality of evidence."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">9.            There is no variance between the ocular and medical

evidence. In their 313 statements, the appellants did not give plausible

explanation to the incriminating circumstances proved against them.

Minor contradictions and discrepancies highlighted by counsel are not of

such magnitude to discard the prosecution case in its entirety. The

prosecution was able to establish that the appellants were the authors of

injuries to Monu and Vicky. I am not convinced that the appellants and

Kallu had attempted to murder Monu and Vicky. There was no previous

enmity or dispute between the parties. In the cross-examination PW-5

(Monu) admitted that the accused persons had no prior dispute with them.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                  Page 9 of 13</span>
 The prosecution could not establish the appellants' motive to inflict

injuries to the victims. The appellants had never extended threat to the

victims to kill them. The victims never apprehended threat to life at their

hands. On the day of incident, the victims had gone to purchase sweets to

celebrate birthday. The appellants did not anticipate their arrival at the

spot. Suraj (Vicky's brother) whose presence nearby was spoken by PW-5

did not intervene in the incident which occurred suddenly at the spur of

the moment. No weapon of offence was recovered from the appellants or

at their instance. Though the injuries were opined to have been caused by

'sharp' object but it cannot be inferred with certainty that these were

caused by knives or with 'deadly' weapons. Vicky in his statement

(Ex.PW-9/B) did not assign specific role to each accused in inflicting

injuries to them. He gave general statement that all accused had attacked

them with knives. PW-5 (Monu) was specific that injuries to him were

caused by Vicky and Kallu on his stomach and Vicky was injured with

knife by A-1 on his leg. PW-5 (Monu) was not specific as to who i.e.

Vicky or Kallu or both caused injuries with knife on his stomach. No

repeated blows with knife were struck on the body of the victims. They

were conscious and oriented when taken to hospital. They were fit to

make statement and were not admitted in the hospital for treatment. It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                Page 10 of 13</span>
 appears that they were discharged from the hospital soon after their

medical examination. The medical evidence did not show that the injury

was dangerous being situated on a vital part or was sufficient in the

ordinary course of nature to cause death. I am conscious that to justify

conviction under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_17">Section 307</a> IPC, it is not essential that bodily injury

capable of causing death should have been inflicted. What the Court has

to see is whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the

intention or knowledge or under circumstances mentioned in <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_18">Section 307</a>

IPC. It is sufficient by law, if there is present an intent coupled with some

overt act in execution thereof. It depends upon the facts and circumstances

of each case whether accused had the intention to cause death or knew in

the circumstances that his act was going to cause death. The nature of

weapon used, the intention expressed by the accused at the time of the act,

the motive for commission of the offence, the nature and the size of the

injuries, the parts of the body of the victim selected for causing the

injuries and the severity of the blow or blows are important factors to be

taken into consideration in arriving findings under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_19">Section 307</a> IPC.

Taking into consideration all these facts and circumstances, in my view,

conviction under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_20">Section 307</a> IPC cannot be sustained and it cannot be

concluded that the appellants had attempted to murder Vicky and Monu. It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CRL.A.Nos. 524/2012 &amp; 1355/2012                                  Page 11 of 13</span>
 was a case of quarrel in which injuries were caused by the accused

persons voluntarily to Monu and Vicky. The prosecution, thus, has

established commission of offence under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_21">Section 324</a> IPC by accused (A-
