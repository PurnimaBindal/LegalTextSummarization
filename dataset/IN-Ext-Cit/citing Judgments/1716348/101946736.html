      amending the plaint. Reading the affidavit in support of the chamber

      to respondent nos.1 to 6 by the petitioners and it is only when the said

      respondent nos.1 to 6 thought of making their stand clear by seeking

      amendment of the plaint. Learned Special Judge has rightly observed





      in the order dated 18.3.2010 that the chamber summons No.2 of 2005

      was taken out to replicate the averments made by the petitioner in their

      any assertion made by the respondent nos.1 to 6 that came to know
