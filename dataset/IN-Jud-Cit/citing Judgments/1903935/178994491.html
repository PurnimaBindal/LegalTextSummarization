<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        3. Mr. Mihir Joshi and Mr. Mihir
        Thakore,   Senior   Advocates,   learned
        counsel for the petitioners invited the
        attention of the court to the judgment
        and order dated 2.2.2006 passed by a
        learned Single Judge in Special Civil
        Application No.12603 of 2005 and allied
        matters wherein the court had taken the
        view that the license fee is regulatory
        in character and, therefore, stricto
        senso the element of quid pro quo does
        not apply in the case. The court
        observed that the Municipal Corporation
        regulates the said activity by providing
        for   certain   standards.   All   these
        activities    would   require    certain
        regulatory control to be exercised on
        the part of the Corporation and for this
        purpose the Corporation would require
        maintenance of staff for processing of
        applications, for granting license also,
        to periodically carry out inspection to
        ensure that the hoardings do not breach
        any of the legal provisions or other

        requirements    laid    down    by    the
        Corporation. The court held that for
        this purpose if the Corporation levies
        license fee, the true character of fee
        has to be determined as a regulatory
        license fee and license fee cannot be
        characterized as compensatory in nature.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">        4. The attention of the court was
        invited to the letter dated 17.11.2018
        of the Municipal Commissioner addressed
        to the Municipal Secretary wherein it
        has inter alia been stated that upon
        perusal of the details of the tender
        invited for the advertisement on the
        roads/streets      of      the      Municipal
        Corporation    properties,     much    higher
        rates   were    obtained     earlier.    Upon
        looking at the same, as the license fees
        for private properties are much less
        compared to the rates obtained for
        tender sites, agencies are encouraged
        not to participate in the tender process
        and   to   advertise     on    the    private
        properties situated near the tender
        sites. It was submitted that this letter
        clearly shows that the purpose for
        increase    in    license     fees    is   an
        extraneous    purpose.    The    reason   for
        increasing the license fee is not for
        any regulatory purpose but because the
        present rates impact the tender process
        and make it commercially unviable. It
        was   contended     that    therefore,    the
        justification given cannot be a basis
        for arbitrary increase in the license
        fees.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">        5. Next it was submitted that sub-
        section (2) of section 386 of the GPMC
        Act   suffers  from   two  infirmities;
        firstly,   it  does  not  specify   any

        procedure or limits subject to which
        such levy or collection can be made; and
        secondly,   it  does   not  provide   any
        guidelines as to which factors should be
        taken into account for the purpose of
        determining the rates of license fees.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        6. The attention of the court was
        further invited to the provisions of
        <a href="/doc/831339/" id="a_2">Article 243X</a> of the Constitution and
        more particularly, to clause (a) thereof

        and   fees    in    accordance    with   such
        procedure and subject to such limits as
        may be specified in the law. It was
        submitted that in the present case, sub-
        section (2) of section 386 of the GPMC
        Act does not specify any limits and,
        therefore, the same is ultra vires the
        provisions    of    <a href="/doc/831339/" id="a_3">Article  243X</a>    of   the

        and   uncanalised   discretion    in   the

386(2) of the GPMC Act provides for charging

Municipal           Corporation            of   the        City           of
Ahmedabad and others, reported in AIR (1967)
SC     1801       and   more    particularly          Para         no.27
thereof which reads as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">        &quot;27. It therefore appears to us that Rule
        7(2) of the Rules framed under the
        Bombay Act of 1949 was beyond the
        legislative competence of the State. The
        rule also suffers from another defect,
        namely, that it does not lay down any
        principle on which machinery is to be
        specified   by   public  notice   by  the
        Commissioner to be deemed to form part
        of such building for the purpose of
        fixing the rateable value. To this, Mr.
        Setalvad argued that if the building was
        equipped with machinery for the purpose
        of running a textile mill, whatever
        machinery was there for the purpose
        would be valued. According to him, the
        question would be which of the machinery
        would help in the enjoyment of the
        property and thereby add to its rateable
        value. Unfortunately, the specification
        of the classes is done from time to time
        by the Commissioner with the approval of
        the Corporation irrespective of the
        question as to where they are to be
        found. It therefore depends on the
        arbitrary will of the Commissioner as to
        what machinery he would specify and what
        he would not. Moreover, he is the only
        person who can examine this question.
        There is no right of appeal from any
        specification made under sub-rule (3) of
        Rule 7 except that the Commissioner is
        to act under the directions of the

        Standing Committee. Rule 7(2) shows that
        all plant and machinery may not be taken
        into   account   for   the   purpose  of
        valuation   and   any   such   plant  or
        machinery which is not included in the
        classification may escape rateability
        however much they may be prized by the
        tenant who takes the premises on rent.
        It seems to us, therefore, that r. 7(2)
        is beyond the legislative competence of
        the State Legislature and sub-rule (3)
        of Rule 7 is also invalid on account of
        excessive delegation of powers by the
        Legislature.&quot;

gives unguided power to the Commissioner to
determine the fees and the only requirement
is the sanction of the Corporation, which is
held       as     not     enough        in      above      referred            two

<p id="p_50">(vi) It was also submitted that the GPMC Act
is of the year 1949 and therefore, after the
Constitution coming into effect in the year
1950,         the    pre-constitution                   laws       must          be

        counsel for the petitioners that if the
        aforesaid    Article     is    scanned   and
        scrutinized in proper perspective, it is
        absolutely vivid that the Legislature of
        the State has been authorised by the
        Constitution    only    to   authorise   the
        Municipalities for the purpose of levy,
        collection and appropriation of certain
        taxes but there is no other power
        bestowed   on   the    Legislature.      The
        Legislation has to be in accordance with
        concept    of    institution      of   self-
        governance    but    the    Legislature   by
        ordaining the procedure has transgressed

        endow   the    Municipalities    with   such
        powers. Thus the source of power rests
        within the State Legislature.       True it
        is, there is some concept of self-
        governance but the Constitution has not
        empowered the Municipalities to impose
        taxes on its own as if it has the power
        to impose taxes by itself as that would
        have defeated and destroyed many a
        provision of the Constitution.       <a href="/doc/831339/" id="a_22">Article
        243-X</a>    also     postulates     that    the
        Legislature of a State may, by law,
        authorise a Municipality to collect and
        appropriate such taxes, duties, tolls
        and   fees   in    accordance    with   such
        procedure and subject to such limits.
        The aforesaid provision is plain as day
        to indicate that the Legislature has the
        authority and it may authorise the
        Municipality to collect such taxes in
        accordance    with    such   procedure   and
        subject    to     such     limits.       The
        significance of the term &#x27;such&#x27; used at
        three   places    under    <a href="/doc/414642/" id="a_23">Article   243X(a)</a>
        cannot be allowed to be marginalised.
        Thus the submission that the Legislature
        should have left it to the total
        discretion    of    the    Municipality   or
        Municipal Corporation is absolutely sans

        &quot;is a compulsory exaction of money by
        public authority for public purposes
        enforceable by law and is not payment
        for services rendered&quot;. This definition

        essential characteristics of a tax as
        distinguished   from   other  forms   of
        imposition which, in a general sense,
        are included within it. It is said that
        the essence of taxation is compulsion,
        that is to say, it is imposed under
        statutory power without the taxpayer&#x27;s
        consent and the payment is enforced by
        law. The second characteristic of tax is
        that it is an imposition made for public
        purpose without reference to any special
        benefit to be conferred on the payer of
        the tax. This is expressed by saying
        that the levy of tax is for the purposes
        of general revenue, which when collected
        revenues of the State. As the object of
        a tax is not to confer any special
        benefit upon any particular individual,
        there is, as it is said, no element of
        quid pro quo between the taxpayer and
        the public authority. Another feature of
        taxation it; that as it is a part of the
        common burden, the quantum of imposition
        upon the taxpayer depends generally upon
        his capacity to pay.

        generally defined to be a charge for a
        special service rendered to individuals
        by some governmental agency. The amount
        of fee levied is supposed to be based on
        the expenses incurred by the Government
        in rendering the service, though in many
        cases     the    costs    are   arbitrarily
        assessed.     Ordinarily,   the  fees   are
        uniform and no account is taken of the
        vary abilities of different recipients
        to pay. These are undoubtedly some of
        the general characteristics, but as
        there may be various kinds of fees, it
        is    not    possible    to   formulate   a
        definition that would be applicable to
        all cases.

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">        47. As regards the distinction between a
        tax and a fee, it, is argued in the
        first place on behalf of the respondent
        that a fee is something voluntary which
        a person has got to pay if he -wants
        certain&#x27; services from the Government;
        but there is no obligation on his part
        to seek such services and if he does not
        want the services, I he can avoid the
        obligation. The example given is of a
        license fee. If a man wants a license
        that is entirely his own choice and then
        only he has to pay the fees, but not
        otherwise. We think that a careful
        examination will reveal that the element
        of compulsion or coerciveness is present
        in all kinds of imposition though in
        different degrees and that it is not
        totally absent in fees. This, therefore,
        cannot be made the sole or even a
        material criterion for distinguishing a
        tax from fees. It is difficult, we
        think, to conceive of a tax except it be
        something like a poll tax, the incidence
        of which falls on all persons within a
        State. The house tax has to be paid only
        by those who own houses, the land tax by
        those who possess lands, municipal taxes
        or rates will fall on those who have
        properties   within    a    municipality.
        Persons who do not have houses, land or
        Properties within municipalities, would
        not have to pay these taxes, but
        nevertheless   these   impositions   come
        within the category of taxes and nobody
        can say that it is a choice of these
        people to own lands or houses or
        specified kinds of properties so that
        there is no compulsion on them to pay
        taxes at all. Compulsion lies in the
        fact that payment is enforceable by law
        against   a   man   in   spite   of   his

        unwillingness or want of consent; and
        this element is present in taxes as well
        as in fees. Of course, in some cases
        whether a man would come within the
        category Of a service receiver may- be a
        matter of his choice, but that by itself
        would not constitute a major test which
        can be taken as the criterion of this
        species of imposition. The distinction
        between a tax and a fee lies primarily
        in the fact that a tax is levied he a
        part of a common burden, while a fee is
        a payment for a special benefit or
        privilege.   Fees    confer    a   special
        capacity,     although     the     special
        advantage, as for example in the case of
        registration   fees   for   documents   or
        marriage licenses, is secondary to the
        primary motive of regulation in the
        public interest. Public interest seems
        to be at the basis of all impositions
        but in a fee it is some special benefit
        which   the   individual    receives.   As
        Seligman says it is the, special benefit
        accruing to the individual which is the
        reason for payment in the case of fees;
        in the case of a tax, the particular
        advantage if it; exists at all is an
        incidental result of State action.

<blockquote id="blockquote_46">        48. If, as we hold, a fee is regarded as
        a sort of return or consideration for
        services rendered, it is absolutely
        necessary that the levy of fees should,
        on   the   face   of   the   legislative
        provision, be co-related to the expenses
        incurred by Government in rendering the
        services. As indicated in <a href="/doc/72095/" id="a_30">Article 110</a> of
        the Constitution ordinarily there are
        two classes of cases where Government
        imposes fees upon persons. In the first
        class of cases, Government simply grants
        a permission or privilege to a person to

        do   something,  which   otherwise  that
        person would not be competent to do and
        extracts fees either heavy or moderate
        from that person in return for the
        privilege that is conferred.; A most
        common illustration of this type of
        cases is furnished by the license fees
        for motor vehicles. Here the costs
        incurred    by    the    Government   in
        maintaining an office or bureau for the
        granting of licenses may be very small
        and the amount of imposition that is
        levied is based really not upon the
        costs incurred by the Government but
        upon the benefit that the individual
        receives. In such cases, according to
        all the writers on public finance, the
        tax element is predominant, and if the
        money paid by license holders goes for
        the upkeep of roads and other matters of
        general public utility, the license fee
        cannot but be regarded as a tax.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_47">        49. In the other class of cases, the
        Government does some positive work for
        the benefit of persons and the money is
        taken as the return for the work done or
        services rendered. If the money thus
        paid is set apart and appropriated
        specifically for the performance of such
        work and is not merged in the public
        revenues for the benefit of the general
        public, it could be counted as fees and
        not a tax. There is really no generic
        difference between the tax and fees and
        as said by Seligman, the taxing power of
        a State may manifest itself in three
        different forms known respectively as
        special assessments, fees and taxes.

        between a tax and a fee and while there
        are various entries in the legislative
        lists with regard to various forms of
        taxes there is an entry at the end of
        each one of the three lists as regards
        fees which could be levied in respect of
        any of the matters that is included in
        it. The implication seems to be that
        fees    have   special    reference   to
        governmental    action   undertaken   in
        respect to any of these matters.

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">        51. Section 76 of the Madras Act speaks
        definitely of the contribution being
        levied   in   respect   rendered  by   the
        Government; so far it has the appearance
        of fees. It is true that religious
        institutions do not want these services
        to be rendered to them and it may be
        that they do not consider the State
        interference to be a benefit at all. We
        agree,    however,    with   the   learned
        Attorney-General that, in the present
        day concept of a State, it cannot be
        said that services could be rendered by
        the State only at the request of those
        who require these services. If in the
        larger interest of the public, a State
        considers it desirable that some special
        service should be done for certain
        people, the people must accept these
        services, whether willing or not. It may
        be    noticed,     however,    that    the
        contribution that has been levied under
        <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_31">section 76</a> of the Act has been made to
        depend upon the capacity of the payer
        and not upon the quantum of benefit that
        is supposed to be conferred on any
        particular      religious     institution.
        Further the institutions, which come
        under the lower income group and have
        income less than Rs. 1,000 annually, are
        excluded from the liability to pay the

        additional charges under clause (2) of
        the section. These are undoubtedly some
        of the characteristics of a &#x27;tax&#x27; and
        the imposition bears a close analogy to
        income-tax. But the material fact which
        negatives the theory of fees in the
        present case is that the money raised by
        levy of the contribution is not ear-
        marked or specified for defraying the
        expenses that the Government has to
        incur in performing the services. All
        the collections go to the consolidated
        fund of the State and all the expenses
        have to be met not out of these
        collections but out of the general
        revenues    by   a  proper    method   of
        appropriation as is done in case of
        other   Government  expenses.   That   in
        itself might not be conclusive, but in
        this case there is total absences of any
        co-relation    between    the    expenses
        incurred by the Government and the
        amount raised by contribution under the
        provision of <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_32">Section 76</a> and in these
        circumstances the theory of a return or
        counter-payment or quid pro quo cannot
        have any possible application to this
        case. In our opinion, therefore, the
        High Court was right in holding that the
        contribution levied under <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_33">section 76</a> is
        a tax and not a fee and consequently it

        <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_37">section 183(5)</a>, fees are payable for
        mutation as may be prescribed under the
        regulations, still as stated above, the
        primary object of such a charge is to
        augment the revenue and the levy of such
        a charge cannot be treated to be a part
        of the regulatory measure. Further,
        under the Regulations, the corporation
        while prescribing fees has levied fees
        on ad valorem basis which is one more
        circumstance to show that the impugned
        levy is in the nature of tax and not in
        the nature of a fee. Further, the
        quantum of levy indicates that it is a
        tax and not a fee. The analysis of the
        various provisions of the Act and the
        impugned   regulations   show   that   the
        impugned levy is in exercise of power of
        taxation under the said Act to augment
        the revenues primarily and not as a part
        of regulatory measure. As stated above,
        the purpose of mutation is to register
        the transfer in the records of the
        corporation which in turn would help the
        corporation to recover taxes from the
        existing   tax   payers.   Therefore,   no
        special    benefit    results    to    the
        transferee   who   is   made   statutorily
        liable to inform the corporation of the
        change, if any, in the name of the
        person primarily liable to pay the tax.

</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_53">        &quot;9. It is, by now, well settled that a
        license fee may be either regulatory or
        compensatory. When a fee is charged for
        rendering specific services a certain
        element of quid pro quo must be there
        between the service rendered and the fee
        charged so that the license fee is
        commensurate with the cost of rendering
        the service although exact arithmetical
        equivalence is not expected. However,
        this is not the only kind of fee which
        can be charged. License fees can also be
        regulatory when the activities for which
        a license is given require to be
        regulated or controlled. The fee which
        is charged for regulation for such
        activity would be validly classifiable
        as a fee and not a tax although no
        service is rendered. An element of quid
        pro quo for the levy of such fees is not
        required although such fees cannot be
        excessive.

        number of other decisions were also
        cited in this connection. The position

                  Justice, &quot;is a compulsory exaction

                  imposition   which,   in   a   general
                  sense, are included within it. It is
                  said that the essence of taxation is

                  imposed    under    statutory     power

                  that it is an imposition made for
                  public purpose without reference to
                  any special benefit to be conferred
                  on the payer of the tax. This is
                  expressed by saying that the levy of
                  tax is for the purposes of general
                  revenue, which when collected form
                  part of the public revenues of the
                  State. As the object of a tax is not
                  to confer any special benefit upon
                  any particular individual, there is,
                  as it is said, no element of quid
                  pro quo between the taxpayer and the
                  public   authority    (See    Findlay

                  Finance&quot;, Vol. p. 203.). Another
                  feature of taxation is that as it is
                  a part of the common burden, the
                  quantum   of  imposition   upon   the
                  taxpayer depends generally upon his
                  capacity to pay.

                  generally defined to be a charge for
                  a   special    service   rendered to
                  individuals by some governmental
                  agency. The amount of fee levied is
                  supposed to be based on the expenses
                  incurred    by   the   Government in
                  rendering the service, though in
                  many cases the costs are arbitrarily
                  assessed. Ordinarily, the fees are
                  uniform and no account is taken of
                  the varying abilities of different
                  recipients to pay (Vide Lutz on
                  &quot;Public Finance&quot; p. 215.). These are
                  undoubtedly some of the general
                  characteristics, but as there may be
                  various kinds of fees, it is not
                  possible to formulate a definition

<blockquote id="blockquote_65">                  &quot;45...   The distinction between a
                  tax and a fee lies primarily in the
                  fact that a tax is levied as a part
                  of a common burden, while a fee is a
                  payment for a special benefit or
                  privilege. Fees confer a special
                  capacity,   although    the    special
                  advantage, as for example in the
                  case   of   registration    fees   for
                  documents or marriage licenses, is
                  secondary to the primary motive of
                  regulation in the public interest
                  (Vide Findlay Shirras on &quot;Science of
                  Public Finance&quot; Vol. I, p. 202.).
                  Public interest seems to be at the
                  basis of all impositions, but in a
                  fee it is some special benefit which
                  the individual receives. As Seligman
                  says, it is the special benefit
                  accruing to the individual which is
                  the reason for payment in the case
                  of fees; in the case of a tax, the
                  particular advantage if it exists at
                  all is an incidental result of State
                  action (Vide Seligman&#x27;s Essays on
                  Taxation, p. 408.).

                  licenses may be very small and the
                  amount of imposition that is levied
                  is based really not upon the costs
                  incurred by the Government but upon
                  the benefit that the individual
                  receives. In such cases, according

        of local self-government or village

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_71">        400. This Court has held that between a
        tax and a fee there is no generic
        difference because in a sense both are
        compulsory executions of money by public
        authority but in a tax imposed for
        public purpose, no service need be
        rendered in return of such tax. A fee is
        however levied essentially for services
        rendered and as such there is an element
        of quid pro quo between the person
        paying the fee and the public authority
        imposing the same. It has been further
        indicated that whenever there is any
        compulsory exaction of any money from a
        citizen,  there   must  be   a   specific
        provision for imposition of such tax
        and/ or fee. There is no room for any
        intendment for imposition of compulsory
        payment.    Whenever   there    is    any
        compulsory exaction of money from a
        citizen, nothing is to be read and
        nothing is to be implied. One should

        held that since there is no express
        provision for imposition of fee and the
        State Government has not delegated any
        such power to the Development Authority
        to impose fees for development, the

        of fees and the demands made therefor

        7. After       giving    our      anxious
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_72">        consideration to the contentions raised
        by Mr. Goswami, it appears to us that in
        a fiscal matter it will not be proper to
        hold that even in the absence of express
        provision, a delegated authority can
        impose tax or fee. In our view, such
        power of imposition of tax and/or fee by
        delegated   authority   must   be    very
        specific and there is no scope of
        implied authority for imposition of such
        tax or fee. It appears to us that the
        delegated authority must act strictly
        within the parameters of the authority
        delegated to it under the Act and it
        will not be proper to bring the theory
        of implied intent or the concept of
        incidental and ancillary power in the
        matter of exercise of fiscal power. The
        facts and circumstances in the case of
        District Council of Jowai, (AIR 1986 SC
        1930)   are   entirely  different.    The
        exercise of powers by the Autonomous
        Jantia Hills Districts are controlled by
        the constitutional provisions and in the
        special facts of the case, this Court
        has indicated that the realisation of

        autonomous District was justified and
        such   power   was   implied.   The said
        decision cannot be made applicable to
        the facts of this case or the same
        should not be held to have laid down any
        legal proposition that in matters of
        imposition of tax or fees, the question
        of necessary intendment may be looked
        into when there is no express provision
        for imposition of fee or tax. The other
        decision in Khargram Panchayat Samiti&#x27;s
        case, (1987 (3) SCC 82) also deals with
        the    exercise    of    incidental  and
        consequential power in the field of
        administrative law and the same does not
        deal with the power of imposing tax and
        fee.

        Delhi Municipal Corporation&#x27;s case (AIR
        1983 SC 617) (supra). It has been
        consistently held by this Court that
        whenever there is compulsory exaction of
        any money, there should be specific
        provision for the same and there is no
        room for intendment. Nothing is to be

                  making the mutation entry remains
                  the same.     Similarly, whatever may
                  be the cause of mutation, whether it
                  is a case of transfer or devolution,
                  the activity of mutation remains
                  constant in all the cases.           The
                  expenses incurred in all the cases
                  also cannot vary, whatever be the
                  value of the property or the cause
                  of mutation.     In the circumstances,
                  there   is    no   reason    given   for
                  charging different rates depending
                  on the value of the property and the
                  cause of transfer. By doing so, the
                  incidence     of    the    levy    falls
                  differently on persons similarly
                  situated resulting in violation of
                  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_53">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of
                  India.     Moreover, the quantum of
                  fees is disproportionate to the so-
                  called &quot;services&quot; which is one more
                  circumstance showing arbitrariness
                  in the levy of such imposition. So
                  far as <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_54">Article 14</a> is concerned, the
                  Courts in India have always examined
                  whether the classification was based
                  on   intelligible     differentia    and
                  whether    the    differntia     had   a
                  reasonable nexus with the object of
                  legislation.      (See Om Kumar Vs.

to examine whether such challenge is raised

or any long time-gap exists as between the
date of the enactment and the date when the
challenge is made and that even if the writ

raised requires to be considered, then again
it       will        have           to        be         examined,            while
entertaining               the           challenge             raised              for
consideration whether it calls for prevention

Rules framed by the State Government under
the said law and that, therefore, it was held
that       the      Legislature               cannot     delegate              the
powers to the executive to frame Rules and
compel the Local Authorities to impose tax in
accordance with the Rules framed by it and by
such an Act, the Legislature has abdicated
its          essential             legislative                 functions.
However, ultimately, the M. P. High Court did
not accept the said challenge and upheld the
validity           of     the     taxing           provisions              under
challenge.           On the basis of the said judgment
of the M. P. High Court, the petitioners,
inter alia, contended that the Corporation
merely wears the hat of the Government and it
is      the       Government           which         may      allow            the
corporation             to    levy        the      license           fee         in
question.               In    response          to      this,         it       was
submitted that there cannot be any quarrel
with the said contention, but the aforesaid
judgment of the M.P. High Court is not at all
relevant to the facts of the present case.

the        license        fee    in      the        present            case         is
neither compensatory nor regulatory, but the

petitioners, in compensatory fee, there must

used for regulating the activity for which
fee is charged and that the same should not
be excessive.               In the present case, it has

sought to be recovered is not for the purpose

is for augmenting revenue and hence, the same

aspects            have       already           been       considered              and
decided by this Court in the said judgment
dated 02.02.2006 and upheld by the Division
Bench        in        appeal.        In        the     said       judgments,
after considering all the aspects of the very
license fee in question i.e. license fee for
advertisement hoarding in private properties,
it has been categorically held by this Court
that       the         same    is      not       a     tax,        but        is       a
regulatory fee.

&#x27;tax&#x27; and it is a regulatory-cum-compensatory
fee.              It    is    not      even          the     case         of       the

expressed by the Apex Court in 1954 Judgment,

shows        a     broad      and       reasonable               relationship

as tax.

what is lost sight of by the petitioners is
an important fact that the Apex Court in its

no change in the judicial thinking.                              This was
sought to be done by the Apex Court to come
to the conclusion in its 2018 judgment that
&#x27;the transit fee&#x27; in question in the said
case was a regulatory fee wherein the State
was not to prove quid pro quo for levy of the
said fee.         It was submitted that &#x27;sea-change
in the judicial thinking&#x27; as referred to by
the Apex Court in its subsequent decisions
was, in fact, in respect of the observations

the       petitioners&#x27;          reliance           on      the         above

        their profits. Such companies would pay
        hefty rentals only if they find that
        their advertisements are likely to be
        seen by large number of commuters. If
        this     purpose    is     not     fulfilled,
        advertisers would have no interest in
        putting up their advertisements.

        roads with proper facilities is thus
        absolutely necessary for such activity
        to flourish. It can hardly be disputed
        that two of the prime roads of the city
        viz. Ashram Road and c. G. Road have
        flourished mainly on account of good and
        well maintained roads. On such roads
        maximum   commercial    activities    would
        flourish. On these roads, one would find
        shops, shopping malls, plazas, eating
        joints,    fancy    stylish    restaurants,
        corporate    offices   and    multinational
        banks. All these activities in turn
        would augment the earning potential of
        the sites of the property owners on
        either side of such roads. Without these
        roads   being     well    designed,    well
        maintained and well looked after, there
        would be no commercial potential for
        such   property    owners.    These   roads
        provide    for    growth    catalyst    for
        commercial activities to flourish. It is
        only when such roads are developed that
        maximum number of persons would be
        visiting such sites either for shopping
        or for visiting different offices, banks
        or restaurants. It is only then that the
        private owners would be in a position to
        extract maximum possible revenue out of
        renting their sites for the purpose of
        exhibiting advertisements. Existence of
        good roads which are well maintained and
        well looked after cannot be separated
        from the potential of the property

        owners to earn maximum revenue from the
        proposed sites for advertisements. One
        does   not     need    much    thinking    to
        appreciate that on roads such as Ashram
        Road and C. G. Road, all advertisers
        would    be     paying    highest     rentals
        prevailing in the city. Whereas in
        remote    suburban     areas    where    such
        development has not yet reached, the
        prevailing    rates    for    advertisements
        would be substantially lower. Why should
        Ashram Road and C. G. Road receive such
        preferential       attention       by     the
        Corporation is the question this Court
        cannot go into. Fact remains that these
        roads house some of the prime properties
        in the city and it is only on account of
        such    commercial      development,     that
        existing    property    owners    can   claim
        highest rent by permitting companies to
        exhibit their advertisements. Therefore,
        money spent by the Corporation for
        building these roads, for maintaining
        these roads in the prime condition and
        for maintaining other facilities such as
        proper parking and drainage on these
        roads, ultimately benefits owners of the
        properties and in turn the petitioners
        as agents and other similarly situated
        persons. It is therefore, not possible
        to   accept    the   contention     that   by
        spending such money on maintenance of
        the    roads     and     other     incidental
        facilities     around     the    area,    the
        petitioners     receive    no    direct    or
        indirect benefit from the Corporation.

        cleanliness,   if  debris   or  dirt   is
        allowed to collect around these roads,
        if heaps of filth give constant stench,
        automatically, the glitter of the roads
        would vanish. The property owners would
        no longer enjoy same potential, would
        not enjoy the same earning from getting
        maximum rental out of their properties.
        It is therefore, not possible for such
        property   owners    and   the    present
        petitioners to argue that from the
        collection of license fees funds cannot
        be spent on improvement and maintenance
        of the road. ...&quot; (Emphasis supplied)

        cannot be lost sight of is that the
        rates   of  license    fee   had   remained
        stagnant since 1997. Nearly nine years
        have   passed   since    then.   Commercial
        activities in and around Ahmedabad have
        gone up. The city has been expanding,
        Population is increasing. Money has also
        devaluated. Business have gone up and
        earnings have increased. Property prices
        have shot up over past few years. The
        rates which were prevailing in the year
        1997 cannot be hold good in the year
        2006.   Therefore,    rate   revision   was
        imminent. What should have been the
        revised rate is the only question. This
        Court would not interfere with exercise
        of    discretionary      power    of    the
        Corporation    when     the    powers   are
        exercised in a reasonable manner. Unless
        it is pointed out that rates so revised
        are highly excessive, this Court would
        not interfere with the policy decision

        nature of policy matter. Corporation

<blockquote id="blockquote_146">        33.   As noted above, different areas of
        city   of   Ahmedabad      carry    different
        potential. Property owners of properties
        would obviously get different rents for
        advertisements     exhibited      in    their
        properties. For the purpose of deciding
        rate of the license fee, the Corporation
        has   adopted    the    structure    of   the
        potential value of the rent of the
        advertisement     on    the    property    in
        question, I do not find any illegality
        in the same. This concept was accepted
        by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case
        of b. <a href="/doc/749233/" id="a_131">S. E. Brokers&#x27; Forum, Bombay and
        others v. Securities and Exchange Board
        of India</a> (supra). To ascertain the true
        potential, the Corporation adopted the
        basis of rate offered by the tenderer
        for the Corporation sites in the near
        vicinity.    One     must    remember    that
        tenderer offered certain rate to the
        Corporation which he would be in a
        position   to   afford.     On   such   rate,
        tenderer would have to add his own
        administrative expenses and also add his
        own reasonable profit. It is the sum
        total of these figures, which would be
        the true market rate for advertisements
        on such sites. It is at that rate that
        potential advertiser would have to pay

        to   the    tenderer    to    exhibit    his
        advertisement.       The        Corporation
        therefore,    committed    no    error    in
        adopting   the   rate    offered    by   the
        tenderer to the corporation for tender
        sites as a base figure upon which the
        license fee is calculated. 16% of the
        said rate for those properties which are
        within 80 meters and 8% for those
        properties which are outside 80 meters
        of a road junction, cannot be termed as
        excessive. No facts and figures are
        placed before this Court to examine the
        true impact of such increase on the
        earning potential of the petitioners.
        Even otherwise, as noted above, it is
        the base rate which the tenderer offered
        to pay to the corporation, which has
        been   accepted   as    yard   stick.    The
        tenderer has to keep sufficient margin
        for administrative expenses, interest
        loss on advance payments as also his net
        profit. It is only after these additions
        are made, that market value of site in
        question would be determined. On this
        count also I do not see that increase in
        the rate is excessive. It may be that in
        certain areas on account of higher
        commercial development, the rates have
        undergone   greater   increase     than   in
        certain    other    areas    with     lesser
        development. This however, would not
        change the nature of levy and I see no
        illegality committed by the Corporation.

        behalf   of  the   petitioners     that   in
        certain areas of the city there are
        certain properties which are far away
        from any tender site. To compare such
        properties with tender sites situated at
        faraway places would be unreasonable.
        For want of material on record in this
        regard,   I  refrain    from   making    any

        however appear that if the petitioners
        are correct in their factual averments,
        I see a valid point being made out. If
        the private property is situated far
        away from the tender site, with which it
        is compared for the charging of licence
        fees, the same would not stand the test
        of     reasonableness.       With      these

justified and deserves to be upheld.

<p id="p_155">7.      It was further submitted that as far as
the      judgments relied upon by the petitioners
are concerned, the same are not applicable to
the facts of the present case, inasmuch as,
either the same are with respect to levy of
tax or where there was no express provision
under the Act which imposed fees and hence
the      reliance          placed       on      such        judgments               is

from       the     affidavit-in-reply,                    which            clearly
states that the fees are regulatory.                                         It was
reiterated              that       for       fees        and          tax         both

unbridled power to the Commissioner to charge
fees at such rate as shall from time to time

submitted that               being a Constitutional Bench
judgment, it is binding till it is overruled
by a Larger Bench.                  Therefore, it still holds

be treated as mere &#x27;obiter&#x27;                          AIR 1954 SC 282
regarding taxes and fees is not overruled and
there is no paradigm shift in the judicial
thinking subsequent to that judgment as the
said judgment is relied in(2017) 12 SCC 1
which is a decision of a bench of 9 Judges
and on pages 172, 297 and 603, AIR 1954 SC
282      is       referred     and       relied      upon       as      locus
classicus and also in (2018) 14 SCC 537 in
Para nos. 152 to 186, the decision of AIR
1954 282 is accepted as locus classicus for
&#x27;Fees&#x27; and &#x27;Tax&#x27;.                   In Para 153, AIR 1954 SC

<p id="p_193">12. Considering the chronology of events of this

petitioners              have       consistently             paid    the       license
fees on the advertisement hoardings in a private
property as per the provision of Section 386(2)
of the GPMC Act prior to 1992 onwards and at no
point of time the petitioners have challenged the
power        to      levy        the       license            fees     under            the
provisions of Section 386(2) of the GPMC Act.                                             It
is also pertinent to note that in the year 2012,
the petitioners agreed for levy of the license
fees     by       enhancing          the     rate        by    10%     every          year
after       initial           embargo       of     5     years.          Thus,          the
petitioners can be said to have waived the right

(supra)       that      while       examining         the          vires           in

        should also be noted as to whether the
        grounds of challenge based on the facts
        pleaded and the implication of the pro-
        vision really has any nexus apart from
        the grounds of challenge made. With ref-
        erence to those relevant provisions, the
        Court should be conscious of the posi-
        tion as to the extent of public interest
        involved when the provision operates the
        field as against the prevention of such
        operation. The Court should also examine
        the extent of financial implications by
        virtue of the operation of the provision
        vis-à-vis the State and alleged extent
        of sufferance by the person who seeks to
        challenge based on the alleged invalid-
        ity of the provision with particular
        reference to the vires made. Even if the
        writ court is of the view that the chal-

        then again it will have to be examined,
        while entertaining the challenge raised

        prevention of the operation of the pro-
        vision in the larger interest of the
        public. We have only attempted to set

<p id="p_202">       The afore-quoted decision of Supreme Court is a
guiding factor for squaring off akin litigations that
have and/or may pop up.                      It underlines observance of
certain precautions whenever vires of provision of
law is raised before the Court by way of a writ
petition.              On      many     occasions,           a     challenge               to     a
provision         of      law,     as      to    its       constitutionality                    is
raised aiming at to thwarting the applicability and
rigour of those provisions as an escape route from
applicability of those provisions of law and thereby
creating         an       impediment            for        the     authorities                and
institutions              concerned.               Such          challenges              always
result in prolongation of litigation enabling such
unscrupulous              elements         to      take          advantage            of      the
pendency of such litigation preferred by them and
thereby gain unlawful advantage, to the detrimental
disadvantageous position of the others.                                        In effect,
such     attempts           made      by     invoking            the      extraordinary
jurisdiction              of      the      writ       courts           of      many         such
challenges,              mostly       result          in     rejection              of      such
challenges.                 However,        concurrently,                 while          taking
advantage         of        the    long         time-gap          involved            in      the
pending proceedings, such unscrupulous litigants even
while suffering the rejection of their stand at the
end as to the vires of the provisions, always try to
wriggle out of their liabilities.                                 It is, therefore,
imperative and worthwhile to examine at the threshold

as to whether such challenges made are bona fide and
do require a consideration at all by the writ courts
by applying the principle of &quot;lifting the veil&quot; and
as     to     whether         there       is      any      hidden         agenda           in
perpetrating such litigation.                            With that view, some
of the criteria should be kept in mind whenever a
challenge to a provision of law is made before the
court.         The Court should, in the first instance,
examine whether there is a prima facie strong ground
made out in order to examine the vires of provisions
raised in writ petition.                     The Court should also note
whether such challenge is made at the earliest point
of time when the Statute came to be introduced or any
provision was brought into the statute book or any
long time-gap exists as between the date of enactment
and the date when the challenge is thrown thereto.
It should also be noted as to whether the grounds of
challenge          based       on     the        facts         pleaded        and        the
implication of the provision really has any nexus
apart       from     the      grounds       of     challenge          made.            With
reference         to      those      relevant           provisions,        the       Court
should be conscious of the position as to the extent
of     public       interest          involved           when    the       provisions
operate the field as against the prevention of such
operation.             Even if the writ court is of the view
that the challenge raised requires to be considered,
then     again           it   will    have        to      be    examined,            while
entertaining the challenge raised for consideration,
whether it calls for prevention of the operation of
the provisions in the larger interests of the public.

court    and    the        same   is   not      exhaustive.              In     other

State of Tamilnadu reported in (2009) 5 SCC 625

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_166">            &quot;28. It is well settled that to save a
            statutory provision from the vice of
            unconstitutionality     sometimes      a
            restricted or extended interpretation of
            the statute has to be given. This is
            because it is a well-settled principle
            of interpretation that the Court should
            make every effort to save a statute from
            becoming unconstitutional. If on giving
            one interpretation the statute becomes
            unconstitutional    and    on    another
            interpretation      it      will      be
            constitutional, then the Court should
            prefer the latter on the ground that the
            Legislature is presumed not to have
            intended    to    have   exceeded    its
            jurisdiction.

        considering the validity of the Hindu
        Women&#x27;s Right to <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_161">Property Act</a>, 1937. In
        order   to    uphold   the    constitutional
        validity of the Act, the Federal Court
        held the Act intra vires by construing

        restricted interpretation of the word
        `Property&#x27; had to be given otherwise the

               the   State   Government   is   right   in

               The powers and functions of the Urban

               ground of delay because at such a

                      &quot;7. When a statute is impugned
                      under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_189">Article 14</a> what the court
                      has to decide is whether the
                      statute   is   so    arbitrary   or
                      unreasonable that it must be
                      struck down. At best, a statute
                      upon a similar subject which
                      derives    its    authority    from
                      another source can be referred

                      held to be reasonable or have
                      stood the test of time, only for
                      the purpose of indicating what
                      may be said to be reasonable in
                      the   context.    We   proceed   to

                  the totality of the decision. The
                  use of the word &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; in para

                  the very paragraph in its entirety
                  discloses. The provisions of the
                  <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_190">Tamil Nadu Act</a> were contrasted with
                  the    provisions     of   the    <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_191">Land
                  Acquisition Act</a> and ultimately it
                  was found that <a href="/doc/392816/" id="a_192">Section 11</a> insofar as
                  it    provided    for    payment    of
                  compensation   in   instalments    was
                  invalid. The ground of invalidation
                  is clearly one of discrimination. It
                  must be remembered that an Act which
                  is discriminatory is liable to be
                  labelled as arbitrary. It is in this
                  sense     that     the      expression
                  &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; was used in para 7.&quot;

               pugned provision has been in existence
               for over twenty three years and its
               validity has once been upheld by the

               nounce upon its validity at this late
               stage. There are two answers to this pro
               position. First, the very fact that
               nearly twenty three years are over from
               the date of the enactment of the im-
               pugned provision and the discrimination
               is allowed to be continued unjustifiably
               for such a long time is a ground of at-
               tack in these cases. As already ob-
               served, the landlords of the buildings
               constructed subsequent to August 26,
               1957 are given undue preference over the
               landlords of buildings constructed prior
               to that date in that the former are free
               from the shackles of the Act while the
               latter are subjected to the restrictions
               imposed by it. What should have been
               just an incentive has become a permanent
               bonanza in favour of those who construc-
               ted buildings subsequent to August 26,
               1957. There being no justification for
               the continuance of the benefit to a

            basis whatsoever, the evil effects flow-
            ing from the impugned exemption have
            caused more harm to the society than one
            could anticipate. What was justifiable
            during a short period has turned out to
            be a case of hostile discrimination by
            lapse of nearly a quarter of century.
            The second answer to the above conten-
            tion is that mere lapse of time does not
            lend constitutionality to a provision
            which is otherwise bad. &quot;Time does not
            run in favour of legislation. If it is
            ultra vires, it cannot again legal
            strength from long failure on the part
            of lawyers to perceives and set up its
            invalidity. Albeit, lateness in an at-
            tack upon the constitutionality of a
            statute is but a reason for exercising
            special caution in examining the argu-
            ments by which the attack is supported.&quot;

        there is a limit prescribed to levy the
        tax on the residential building and

        therefore, abundantly clear. That such
        Institution must have certain freedom,
        autonomy and independence is also appar-
        ent. However, her arguments overlook the
        fact that it is the State which has to
        make the necessary law. Even in terms of
        this Constitutional Scheme the law mak-
        ing power of the State is untouched. The

<blockquote id="blockquote_219">        38. Therefore, what we have held above
        gets further reinforced and supported by
        <a href="/doc/831339/" id="a_219">Article 243X</a> of the Constitution of
        India. It is the Legislature of the
        State and which makes the law by which
        Municipalities are authorized to levy,
        assess, collect and appropriate such
        taxes,    dues,    tolls    and    fees   in
        accordance    with   such    procedure   and
        subject to such limits. There could be
        assignment      of     duties      to    the
        Municipalities. The State Government may
        assign to a Municipality such taxes,
        duties,   tolls    and   fees    levied  and
        collected by the State Government for
        such   purposes    and   subject    to  such

        endow the Municipalities and by law with
        powers and authority so as to enable
        them to function as institutions of self
        Government     effectively,     then,   that
        position is in no way affected merely
        because the law authorizes the State to
        impose the taxes. Merely because the
        State has such powers in terms of the

              law of Legislature does not mean that by
              itself such law or any provision therein
              would fall foul of the constitutional
              mandate. By enactment of <a href="/doc/937398/" id="a_220">Section 127</a> of
              the said Act alone the independence of
              the   Municipalities    is   in   no   way
              affected. Chapter-XI of the said Act
              deals with &quot;Municipal Taxation&quot;. The law
              itself states that the Corporation shall
              impose the tax, namely, property tax,
              tax on vehicles, boats and animals.

              of   the    Municipality    of   taxation.
              Eventually,   the   Municipality   derives
              it&#x27;s power and authority to impose the

        substance. It is the case on behalf of
        the petitioner that section 141B(3) of
        the GPMC Act provides that rate of Tax
        determined under sub-section (1) read
        with sub-section (2) which can be less
        than   and/or     more   than    the    amount
        mentioned in the said sub-section i.e.
        same cannot be less than Rs. 20 per sq.
        meter of carpet area and more than Rs.
        80 per sq. meter of the carpet area in
        case    of      buildings,      other     than
        residential are concerned, and in the
        case of Mobile Tower of the petitioner
        same would be Rs. 302 per sq. meter
        after applying the factors mentioned in
        the Taxation Rules, and therefore, as
        the same shall be more than maximum
        limit prescribed under Section 141B(3)
        of the GPMC Act and therefore, the same
        shall    be     bad    in    law,      illegal
        and/or ultra     vires to <a href="/doc/831339/" id="a_223">Article      243X</a> of
        the Constitution of India. The aforesaid
        submission seems to be directive but has
        no substance. Section 141B of the GPMC
        Act is required to be read as a whole
        and   the    same    cannot    be   read    in
        piecemeal. Sub-section (3) of section
        141B of the GPMC Act is required to be
        read along with sub-section (4) of
        <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_224">section 141B</a>. Sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_225">section

        permits the Corporation to increase or

        factors to be taken into consideration
        while increasing or decreasing the rate
        of Tax determined under sub-section (1)
        read with sub-sections (2) and (3) of
        the GPMC Act are provided under Section
        141B(4)(a) of the GPMC Act. Therefore,
        the words which are used under sub-
        section (4) of section 141B of the GPMC
        Act   are   that    &quot;the   Corporation   may
        increase    or    decrease, rate    of   Tax
        determined under sub-section (1) read
        with sub-sections (2) and (3) of the
        GPMC Act. Therefore, under the Statute
        itself it authorizes the Corporation to
        increase or decrease the rate of Tax
        determined under sub-section (1) read
        with sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section
        141B of the GPMC Act. Therefore, rate of
        Tax    which     are     determined    under
        subsection (3) of Section 141B of the
        GPMC Act also can be increased or
        decreased by the Corporation, however
        subject to the Rules. In the present
        case the Taxation Rules are framed by
        the Corporation in exercise of powers
        under Section 454 of the GPMC Act. Under
        the circumstances, when the Statute
        itself    permits    the    Corporation   to
        increase or decrease the rate of Tax
        determined under sub-section (1) read
        with sub-sections (2) and (3), the
        determination of the Tax in the present
        case cannot be said to be either illegal
        and/or contrary to the provisions of the
        Statute and/or the same cannot be said
        to be ultra vires to <a href="/doc/831339/" id="a_226">Article 243X</a> of
        the   Constitution    of    India.  If   the

        is accepted, in that case the powers
        conferred   under  sub-section     (4)   of
        Section 141 of the GPMC Act would become
        nugatory and/or otiose. As per the
        cardinal    principle     of     law     of
        interpretation    of     Statute      while
        considering a particular provision of
        Statute, the Court is required to see
        that another provision of the Statute
        may not become nugatory and/or otiose.
        Under the circumstances it cannot be
        said that the determination of the
        property Tax on IBS/Booster sites of the
        petitioner is in anyway illegal and/or

        and (k) of Sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/263837/" id="a_241">Section
        131</a> of the Act, 1950 are relevant for
        adjudication of the present lis. <a href="/doc/263837/" id="a_242">Section
        131</a> of the Act, 1950 empowers the
        Municipality to impose taxes. It also
        states that the Municipality may, from
        time to time, at a meeting convened
        expressly for the purpose of which due
        notice shall have to be given subject to
        the provisions of the Act, 1950 impose,
        within the limits of the Municipal area,
        the taxes and fees or any of them
        enumerated   in    the   said   Section.
        According to Mr. Mohapatra, the power of
        Municipality    to     levy    tax    on
        advertisements is traceable to <a href="/doc/263837/" id="a_243">Section
        131(1)(g)</a> and (k). <a href="/doc/263837/" id="a_244">Section 131(g)</a> speaks
        of a tax on profession, art and callings
        as may be prescribed. Levy of tax on
        advertisements is certainly not covered
        under <a href="/doc/263837/" id="a_245">Section 131(g)</a>. <a href="/doc/263837/" id="a_246">Section 131(k)</a>
        empowers the Municipality to impose any
        other tax which the Municipality is
        empowered to impose under any law for
        the time being in force. There is no
        other law as required under <a href="/doc/263837/" id="a_247">Section
        131(k)</a> of the Act, 1950 by which the
        Municipality is empowered to levy tax on
        advertisements.

        to specified activity on entry of goods
        into the local area i.e. for use,
        consumption or sale therein, which is
        clearly indicative of the fact that

        terminates within the local area for the
        purpose of utilisation of such goods
        within that local area by way of use,

               Apparently, this nexus is related to

               the activity of entry of goods within

               sale therein is either to be levied and

               concerned or to be levied and collected
               by the State Government itself and

of     <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_259">Section           386</a>     provides        that       except          as       may
otherwise be provided by or under this Act, for
every such license written permission and fees
may be charged at such rate as shall from time to
time fixed by the Commissioner with the sanction
of the Corporation.                    Thus, on bare perusal of
Sub-section-2 of Section-386 of the GPMC Act, it
cannot         be        said     that       the          Commissioner               has
excessive delegation because license fees which
may be charged by the Commissioner shall come
into      effect          only     after       the        sanction          of       the
Corporation and not otherwise.                             Thus, in effect
sub-section-2 provides for procedure and limits
in form of checks and balances to control the
power conferred upon the Commissioner to levy the
fees for the licenses to be issued as per Sub-
section-1 of <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_260">Section 386</a>.

section-2 starts with the words &quot;except as may
otherwise be provided by and under this Act&quot;,

from other provisions of the Act providing for
any fees of license which may be issued under

time which may be fixed but such power is subject
to the sanction of the Corporation.                                Therefore,
in other words, the fees to be charged as per the
provisions of Sub-section-2 of <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_262">Section 386</a> cannot
be    said      to      be    having    unbridled          or      unfettered
power.       It is also evident from the materials on
record that the levy of fees to be charged for
advertisement            hoardings           in     private        properties
does not become effective immediately when the
Commissioner proposes unless and until the same
is approved by the Standing Committee which in
turn is required to be approved and sanction by
the Corporation as provided under Sub-section-2
of Section-386 of the GPMC Act.

        merely topics or fields of legislation,
        they must receive a liberal construction
        inspired by a broad and generous spirit
        and not in a narrow pedantic sense. The
        words and expressions employed in draft-
        ing the entries must be given the
        widest-possible interpretation. This is
        because, to quote V. Ramaswami, J., the
        allocation of the subjects to the lists
        is not by way of scientific or logical
        definition but by way of a mere simplex
        enumeratio of broad categories. A power
        to legislate as to the principal matter
        specifically mentioned in the entry
        shall also include within its expanse
        the legislations touching incidental and
        ancillary matters.

        the legislature of any State is ques-
        tioned on the ground that it encroaches
        upon the legislative competence of Par-
        liament to enact a law, the question one
        has to ask is whether the legislation
        relates to any of the entries in List I
        or III. If it does, no further question
        need be asked and Parliament&#x27;s legislat-
        ive competence must be upheld. Where
        there are three lists containing a large
        number of entries, there is bound to be
        some overlapping among them. In such a
        situation the doctrine of pith and sub-

        to which entry does a given piece of le-
        gislation relate. Once it is so determ-

        field reserved to the other legislature
        is of no consequence. The court has to
        look at the substance of the matter. The

        the true character of legislation. The
        name given by the legislature to the le-
        gislation is immaterial. Regard must be
        had to the enactment as a whole, to its
        main objects and to the scope and effect
        of its provisions. Incidental and super-
        ficial encroachments are to be disreg-
        arded.

        plies only when there is a clash between
        the Union and the State Lists within an
        area common to both. There the doctrine
        of pith and substance is to be applied
        and if the impugned legislation substan-
        tially falls within the power expressly
        conferred upon the legislature which en-
        acted it, an incidental encroaching in
        the field assigned to another legis-

        the three lists, List I has priority
        over Lists III and II and List III has
        priority over List II. However, still,
        the predominance of the Union List would
        not prevent the State Legislature from
        dealing with any matter within List II

        to an institution of Local Government to
        feed it by incorporating provisions con-
        ferring power of generating funds for
        meeting the expenses of governance. The
        SADA Act intends to achieve a level of
        local governance which the usual models
        of Local Government such as boards and
        municipalities are not considered cap-
        able of achieving and that is why there
        is a special development area and a Spe-
        cial Area Development Authority. The
        fund established under the Act meets ex-
        penses of administration needed to be
        incurred by the authority. The funds
        cannot be utilised for any purpose other
        than the administration of the Act.
        There are pieces of land which though
        containing a mine yet fall within the
        territory of special development area.
        It was pointed out by the respondents
        before the High Court that in spite of
        the Act having been enacted in the year
        1986, the successive State Governments,
        which had preceded it, did not take care
        of the legislation and it was only the
        then Government which became conscious
        of its obligations under the SADA Act
        and commenced identifying special areas
        requiring development such as Sonbhadra.
        The imposition of cess envisaged through
        the SADA Act and the Rules was a step
        towards developing the special area. It
        is a matter of common knowledge, and
        does not need any evidence to demon-
        strate, that mining activity carried on
        the land within the special area in-
        volves extraction, removal, loading-un-
        loading and transportation of the miner-
        als accompanied by its natural con-
        sequences entailed on the environment
        and the infrastructure such as roads,
        water and power supply etc. within the
        special area. The impugned cess can,

        rendering such services as would improve
        the infrastructure and general develop-
        ment of the area, the benefits whereof
        would be availed even by the stonecrush-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_253">        143. As a tax the impugned levy of cess
        is clearly covered by Entry 5 of List II
        (as the High Court has held, and we add)
        read with Entries 49 and 50 of List II.
        There is no challenge to the declaration
        of the area as a special development
        area and the constitution of Special
        Area Development Authority for the ad-
        ministration thereof. In other words,
        the constitutional validity of the en-
        actment as a whole and the rules framed
        thereunder is not put in issue. What is
        under challenge is only the levy of
        cess. There is nothing wrong in the
        State legislation levying cess by way of
        tax so as to generate its funds. Al-
        though it is termed as a &quot;cess on miner-
        al right&quot;, the impact thereof falls on
        the land delivering the minerals. Thus,
        the levy of cess also falls within the
        scope of Entry 49 of List II. Inasmuch
        as the levy on mineral rights does not
        contravene any of the limitations im-
        posed by Parliament by law relating to
        mineral development, it is also covered
        by Entry 50 of List II. The power to
        levy any tax or fee lying within the le-

        coverage to the impugned levy of cess.
        True it is that the method of quantify-
        ing the cess is by reference to the
        quantum of mineral produced. This would
        not alter the character of the levy.
        There are myriad methods of calculating
        the value of the land for the purpose of

        has already been made by us in the other
        part of this judgment. Validity of cess
        upon the land quantified by reference to
        the quantity of its produce was held to
        be a levy on the land and hence consti-
        tutional in Ralla Ram13, Moopil Nair18

        become excise duty on manufacture and
        production of goods merely on account of
        having relation with the quantity of
        product yielded of the land. Rather it
        is a safe, sound and scientific method
        of determining the value of the land to
        which the product relates. The levy of
        cess considered as a tax is constitu-
        tionally valid.

        to connote a tax with a purpose or a tax
        allocated   to   a   particular   thing.
        However, it also means an assessment or

        given cases and must provide a standard
        to guide the officials or the body in

        be any, then this by itself would be a
        guiding factor to be exercised by the
        delegatee. In other words, then it
        cannot be held that such a power is
        unbridled or uncanalised. The exercise
        of power of such delegatee is controlled
        through   such   policy.   In  the   fast
        changing scenario of economic, social
        order with scientific development spawns
        innumerable situations which Legislature
        possibly could not foresee, so delegatee
        is entrusted with power to meet such
        exigencies within the in built check or
        guidance and in the present case to be
        within the declared policy. So delegatee
        has to exercise its powers within this
        controlled path to subserve the policy
        and to achieve the objectives of the
        Act. A situation may arise, in some
        cases where strict adherence to any
        provision of the statute or rules may
        result in great hardship, in a given
        situation, where exercise of such power
        of exemption is to remove this hardship
        without materially effecting the policy
        of the Act, viz., development in the
        present case then such exercise of power
        would be covered under it. All situation
        cannot be culled out which has to be
        judiciously judged and exercised, to
        meet any such great hardship of any
        individual or institution or conversely
        in the interest of society at large.
        Such power is meant rarely to be used.

            v. Chicory Marketing Board12. &quot;A tax&quot;,
            according to the learned Chief Justice,
            &quot;is a compulsory exaction of money by
            public authority for public purposes en-
            forceable by law and is not payment for
            services   rendered&quot;.   This   definition
            brings out, in our opinion, the essen-
            tial characteristics of a tax as distin-
            guished from other forms of imposition
            which, in a general sense, are included
            within it. It is said that the essence
            of taxation is compulsion, that is to
            say, it is imposed under statutory power
            without the taxpayer&#x27;s consent and the
            payment is enforced by law13. The second
            characteristic of tax is that it is an
            imposition   made  for   public   purpose
            without reference to any special benefit
            to be conferred on the payer of the tax.
            This is expressed by saying that the
            levy of tax is for the purposes of gen-
            eral revenue, which when collected forms
            part of the public revenues of the
            State. As the object of a tax is not to

        ticular individual, there is, as it is
        said, no element of quid pro quo between
        the taxpayer and the public authority14.
        Another feature of the taxation is that
        as it is a part of the common burden,
        the quantum of imposition upon the tax-
        payer depends generally upon his capa-
        city to pay.

        erally defined to be a charge for a spe-
        cial service rendered to individuals by
        some governmental agency. The amount of
        fee levied is supposed to be based on
        the expenses incurred by the Government
        in rendering the service, though in many
        cases the costs are arbitrarily as-
        sessed. Ordinarily, the fees are uniform
        and no account is taken of the varying
        abilities of different recipients to
        pay15. These are undoubtedly some of the
        general characteristics, but as there
        may be various kinds of fees, it is not
        possible to formulate a definition that
        would be applicable to all cases.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_277">        47. As regards the distinction between a
        tax and a fee, it is argued in the first
        place on behalf of the respondent that a
        fee is something voluntary which a per-
        son has got to pay if he wants certain
        services from the Government; but there
        is no obligation on his part to seek
        such services and if he does not want
        the services, he can avoid the obliga-
        tion. The example given is of a licence
        fee. If a man wants a licence that is
        entirely his own choice and then only he
        has to pay the fees, but not otherwise.
        We think that a careful examination will
        reveal that the element of compulsion or
        coerciveness is present in all kinds of
        imposition, though in different degrees
        and that it is not totally absent in

        fees. This, therefore, cannot be made
        the sole or even a material criterion
        for distinguishing a tax from fees. It
        is difficult, we think, to conceive of a
        tax except, it be something like a poll
        tax, the incidence of which falls on all
        persons within a State. The house tax
        has to be paid only by those who own
        houses, the land tax by those who pos-
        sess lands, municipal taxes or rates
        will fall on those who have properties
        within a municipality. Persons, who do
        not have houses, lands or properties
        within municipalities, would not have to
        pay these taxes, but nevertheless these
        impositions come within the category of
        taxes and nobody can say that it is the
        choice of these people to own lands or
        houses or specified kinds of properties,
        so that there is no compulsion on them
        to pay taxes at all. Compulsion lies in
        the fact that payment is enforceable by
        law against a man in spite of his un-
        willingness or want of consent; and this
        element is present in taxes as well as
        in fees. Of course, in some cases wheth-
        er a man would come within the category
        of a service receiver may be a matter of
        his choice, but that by itself would not
        constitute a major test which can be
        taken as the criterion of this species
        of imposition. The distinction between a
        tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact
        that a tax is levied as a part of a com-
        mon burden, while a fee is a payment for
        a special benefit or privilege. Fees
        confer a special capacity, although the
        special advantage, as for example in the
        case of registration fees for documents
        or marriage licences, is secondary to
        the primary motive of regulation in the
        public interest16. Public interest seems
        to be at the basis of all impositions,

        but in a fee it is some special benefit
        which the individual receives. As Selig-
        man says, it is the special benefit ac-
        cruing to the individual which is the
        reason for payment in the case of fees;
        in the case of a tax, the particular ad-
        vantage if it exists at all is an incid-
        ental result of State action17.

<blockquote id="blockquote_278">        48. If, as we hold, a fee is regarded as
        a sort of return or consideration for
        services rendered, it is absolutely ne-
        cessary that the levy of fees should, on
        the face of the legislative provision,
        be co-related to the expenses incurred
        by the Government in rendering the ser-
        vices. As indicated in <a href="/doc/72095/" id="a_321">Article 110</a> of
        the Constitution, ordinarily there are
        two classes of cases where the Govern-
        ment imposes &quot;fees&quot; upon persons. In the
        first class of cases, the Government
        simply grants a permission or privilege
        to a person to do something, which oth-
        erwise that person would not be compet-
        ent to do and extracts fees either heavy
        or moderate from that person in return
        for the privilege that is conferred. A
        most common illustration of this type of
        cases is furnished by the licence fees
        for motor vehicles. Here the costs in-
        curred by the Government in maintaining
        an office or bureau for the granting of
        licences may be very small and the
        amount of imposition that is levied is
        based really not upon the costs incurred
        by the Government but upon the benefit
        that the individual receives. In such
        cases, according to all the writers on
        public finance, the tax element is pre-
        dominant18, and if the money paid by li-

        be regarded as a tax.

        Government does some positive work for
        the benefit of persons and the money is
        taken as the return for the work done or
        services rendered. If the money thus
        paid is set apart and appropriated spe-
        cifically for the performance of such
        work and is not merged in the public
        revenues for the benefit of the general
        public, it could be counted as fees and
        not a tax. There is really no generic
        difference between the tax and fees and
        as said by Seligman, the taxing power of
        a State may manifest itself in three
        different forms known respectively as
        special assessments, fees and taxes19.

        rendered by the State only at the re-
        quest of those who require these ser-
        vices. If in the larger interest of the
        public, a State considers it desirable
        that some special service should be done
        for certain people, the people must ac-
        cept these services, whether willing or
        not20. It may be noticed, however, that
        the contribution that has been levied
        under <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_322">Section 76</a> of the Act has been
        made to depend upon the capacity of the
        payer and not upon the quantum of bene-
        fit that is supposed to be conferred on
        any particular religious institution.
        Further the institutions which come un-
        der the lower income group and have in-
        come less than Rs 1000 annually, are ex-
        cluded from the liability to pay the ad-
        ditional charges under clause (2) of the
        section. These are undoubtedly some of
        the characteristics of a &quot;tax&quot; and the
        imposition bears a close analogy to in-
        come tax. But the material fact which
        negatives the theory of fees in the
        present case is that the money raised by
        levy of the contribution is not ear-
        marked or specified for defraying the
        expenses that the Government has to in-
        cur in performing the services. All the
        collections go to the consolidated fund
        of the State and all the expenses have
        to be met not out of these collections
        but out of the general revenues by a
        proper method of appropriation as is
        done in case of other Government ex-
        penses. That in itself might not be con-
        clusive, but in this case there is total
        absence of any co-relation between the
        expenses incurred by the Government and
        the amount raised by contribution under

        a tax and not a fee and consequently it
        was beyond the power of the State Legis-

<p id="p_230">        The above principles laid down by the 7
Judges Bench of the Supreme Court are in the
context            of    the        facts           of   the      said         case,
wherein the Apex Court was called upon to
decide            the   constitutional                   validity          of       the
Madras Hindu Religious &amp; Charitable Endowment

19(1), 25, 26 and 27 of the Constitution of
India.            In this context, the Apex Court after
analyzing the object of the State legislation
examined the Constitutional validity of the
provisions              thereof.               The       Apex     Court           also
considered              the       Constitutional                validity              of

State interference to be a benefit at all.
The      Apex       Court        further           held    that          in      the
present day concept of a State, it cannot be
said that services could be rendered by the
State        only         at    the       request         of     those           who
require these services and if in the larger
interest of the public, a State considers it
desirable that some special service should be
done       for      certain           people,       the        people          must
accept            these    services,              whether       willing            or

the expenses were to be met not out of these
collections but out of the general revenues

Such facts, the Apex Court held that, there

categorically               held     by     the      Apex        Court          that
when       the         Government         grants           permission               or
privilege to a person to do something which
otherwise that person would not be competent
to     do,        it    extracts          fees       either          heavy          or
moderate on that person in return for the
privilege               conferred but if the amount of
imposition             i.e.    levy       is     based          clearly           not
upon the cost incurred by the Government but

      upon the benefit that individual receives and
      if     the         license        fees       collected,          the         same
      cannot be but regarded as tax. The Apex Court
      therefore, has rendered the above decision as
      per the language of Section-76 of the Madras
      Act         which          was      having           some          of          the
      characteristic              of     the         tax   and       imposition
      bears an analogy to income tax. Whereas in
      the facts of the present case, section 386(2)
      of the GPMC Act provides for levy of license
      fees        for       license           to      place        advertising
      hoardings in private properties for license
      to be issued as per provisions of the GPMC
      Act       and       hence         the      same      can        never            be
      considered as tax because the person who is
      granted license will have privilege to place
      advertising hoarding in private property and
      for granting such privilege fees is levied.

that the view expressed therein has undergone a

provision under challenge is not in nature of tax
or any characteristic of tax as held by the Apex
Court in the year 1954.                        Therefore, there is a
consistent view of the Apex Court right from 1954
till       2018          with    regard         to        the       concept              of
imposition of tax and levy of fees. We are of the
view      upon           careful      consideration               of       all         the
decisions relied upon by the respondents that it
is not correct to submit that there has been a
sea change in the approach of the Apex Court. The
dictum         of        law     as     laid         in     the           case           of
Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments (Supra)
is not at all diluted but on the contrary the
same is reiterated and each case has been decided
on the basis of its own facts.

<p id="p_232">45.      As we are of the opinion that the license
fee     levied           for    granting         license           for        placing
advertising              hoardings       in      private           property              is
&quot;fee&quot; and not &quot;tax&quot; as the facts of the case of
the petitioner are different than that of the
facts before the Apex Court, the decision of the
learned         Single         Judge    of      this       Court         dated           2nd
February 2006 in SCA no.12603 of 2005 rendered in
the facts of case of the petitioner itself cannot
be said to be per incuram only on the ground that
the     judgment           of    the     Apex        Court         in       case         of
Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments(Supra)is

<p id="p_233">46. With regard to the submissions made by both
the    sides         in    relation        to      the      fixation          of      the
license fees being arbitrary and excessive, it is
pertinent to note that the rival claims made by
both      the        sides       cannot       be       looked       into         while
exercising writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_328">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India.                             The sufficiency of
levy of fees falls within the powers prescribed
under Sub-section-2 of Section 386 of the GPMC
Act subject to control of the State Government as
provided under Section 451 of the GPMC Act.                                             We
therefore,                refrain         from             considering                the
submissions with regard to the alleged arbitrary
and      excessive             license          fees         fixed         by         the
respondents-Corporation.                              The    petitioner                 if
aggrieved by such fixation of license fees may
take appropriate recourse in accordance with law
by     challenging               the     same          before        the         State
Government under the provisions of the GPMC Act.
