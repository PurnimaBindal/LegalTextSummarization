    JUDGMENT (PER DR. D.Y. CHANDRACHUD, J.) :
</pre>




<p id="p_1">                 The issue whether an appeal can lie under clause 15 of 

    the Letters Patent against a decision of a Single Judge rendered in 





    a Petition invoking Articles 226 and/or 227 of the Constitution  has 

    defied   conclusive   judicial   pronouncement.     In   a   sense,   this   is 

    reflective   as   much   of   the   ingenuity   of   the   Bar   as   it   is   of   the 

    expansive   constitutional   philosophy   of   vesting   jurisdiction   in   the

    this   Full   Bench   is   called   upon   to   render,   is   guided   by

    as   Full   Benches   of   this   Court.     That   the   question   of   the 




                                                            
    maintainability of an appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent 

    in such cases continues to arise with such persistence provides a 




                                                
    sobering reflection of the limits of the law in providing black letter 
                                
    solutions.   We must recognise that the broad and wide categories 

    that   the   founding   fathers   of   the   Constitution   created   while 
                               
    conferring jurisdiction on constitutional courts were crafted with a 

    sense   of   vision   and   purpose.   Conceptual   openness   is   a  powerful 
            


    weapon   against   injustice.   The   width   and   amplitude   of 
         



    constitutional   provisions   ought   not   then   to   be   constricted   into 





    narrow fragments. A provision which is intended to reach out to 

    injustice must be construed in the same liberal spirit with which it 

    was engrafted into   the Constitution.  We begin  this judgment, on 





    a reference to the Full Bench, with the prefatory note that as in 

    other cases involving legal interpretation, strait-jackets are unwise.

    must, to the  robust sense of justice of the Judges who occupy this 




                                                                                            
    Court   to   consider   each   case   upon   its   facts   while   determining 




                                                                    
    questions of maintainability.   The quest for certainty in the law is 

    one, but only one of the ideals of a system founded on the rule of 




                                                                   
    law.  Yet the law without justice is like the grain bereft of its fibre. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">    For   it   is   justice   which   like   the   fibre   of   the   grain     provides   the 




                                                      
    texture that nourishes and sustains.   Constitutional interpretation 
                                    
    must   likewise   nourish   and   sustain   even   as   it   seeks   to   remedy 

    injustice.   As a matter of first principle, a constitutional provision 
                                   
    which is a powerful instrument to combat injustice ought not to be 

    constricted to artificial categories.   The Founding Fathers did not 
            


    do so.  Generations of judges did not dilute  the broad expanse of 
         



    those provisions.  Nor should we.

    the   employer   for   misconduct   was   terminated   from   service   upon 

    enquiry. The Labour Court on an application under Section  78 of 




                                                                 
    the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946, came to the conclusion 

    that the punishment of dismissal was shockingly disproportionate 




                                                    
    to   the   misconduct   proved   and   ordered   reinstatement   with 
                                   
    continuity   of   service   and   full   back   wages.     In   an   appeal   by   the 

    employer,  the Industrial Court  set aside  the order of the Labour 
                                  
    Court.  In a challenge by the workman to the order of the Industrial 

    Court,   in   a   petition   which   invoked   Articles   226   and   227   of   the 
            


    Constitution,   a   Learned   Single   Judge   of   this   Court   delivered 
         



    judgment which was questioned in a Letters Patent Appeal.   The 





    Division   Bench   dismissed   the   appeal     on   the   ground   of 

    maintainability and held that "the mere mention of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> will 

    not make an appeal maintainable under clause 15, if in pith and 





    substance what was sought to be exercised as jurisdiction of this

    this Court".  Having said this, the Division Bench observed thus:

    judicial orders passed by the High Courts in or in relation to the

    proceedings pending before them.                 That question was answered in
            

    the negative.       Chief Justice P.B.Gajendragadkar, during the course
         



    of   his   judgment   rendered   for   five   of  the   Judges  constituting   the

    (supra)   and   specifically   to   the   observation   of   Justice   Mukherjea 

    that the writ of certiorari may lie and  is generally granted when a 

    Court  acted without or in excess of jurisdiction.     That principle 





    was not overturned in the judgment of the Learned Chief Justice.

    prohibiting publication of a part of the proceedings could not be

    held that the rationale was as follows:

                under Art 32, logically, it would be difficult to make a

    record was held not to be amenable to correction under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_44">Article 32</a> 

    of the Constitution.  Justice Sarkar rejected the argument that High 




                                                 
    Courts   were   inferior   Courts   as   appeals   lie   from   them   to   the 
                                 
    Supreme Court.   The Learned Judge noted that there were many 

    Tribunals from which no appeals lie to the High Court upon which 
                                
    the   Constitution   has   conferred   the   powers   to   issue   a   writ   of 

    certiorari.   If appealability was a test, then the High Court would 
            


    not be able to issue a writ of certiorari to such Tribunals as they 
         



    would not be then inferior Courts.  The Learned Judge held that it 





    would be strange if this consequence were to follow     when the 

    Constitution   contemplated   that   the   High   Courts   would   have   the 

    power to issue writs of certiorari.  Hence, a conspectus of the law 





    on the subject clearly indicates that a writ of certiorari does indeed 

    lie under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Article 226</a> of the Constitution against the decision of a 

    Court   which   is   (i)   without   jurisdiction;   or   (ii)   in   excess   of 

    jurisdiction; or (iii) as a result of a failure to exercise jurisdiction.

    have been evolved over the years to channelise the proper exercise 

    of the power.     The High Court, for instance, would refrain from 
                                
    entering into a field of investigation which is more appropriate for 

    a Civil Court in a properly constituted suit to do than for a Court

    customary for lawyers to label their petitions as falling under both

    Patent was maintainable, the Supreme Court held as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                "Basic   averments   for   invoking   such   jurisdiction   were 
                                 
                already   pleaded   in   the  Writ   Petition   for  High   Court's 
                consideration.  It is true, as submitted by learned counsel 
                for   the   appellant,   that   the   order   of   the   learned   single 
                judge nowhere stated that the Court was considering the 
            


                Writ   Petition   under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_146">Article   226</a>   of   the   Constitution   of 
                India.   It is equally true that the Learned Single Judge 
         



                dismissed the Writ Petition by observing that the Courts 
                below had appreciated the contentions and rejected the 
                complaint.  But the said observation of the learned single 





                Judge did not necessarily mean that the learned Judge 
                was   not   inclined   to   interfere   under   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_147">Article   227</a>   of   the 
                Constitution of India only.  The said observation equally 
                supports the conclusion that the learned Judge was not 
                inclined to interfere under Articles 226 and 227.  As seen 





                earlier,   that   he   was   considering   the   aforesaid   Writ 
                Petition moved under Articles 226 as well as 227 of the 
                Constitution  of  India.    Under these circumstances,  it  is 
                not   possible   to   agree   with   the   contention   of   learned 
                counsel for the appellant that the learned Single Judge 
                had   refused   to   interfere   only   under   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_148">Article   227</a>   of   the 
                Constitution   of   India     when   he   dismissed   the   Writ

    nomenclature  given  in the Petition  which invoked <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_168">Article  227</a> of 




                                                                                          
    the Constitution.  A Division Bench of the High Court had held that 




                                                                  
    the order of the Single Judge was passed in exercise of the power 

    of   superintendence   under   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_169">Article   227</a>   against   which   a   Letters 




                                                                 
    Patent Appeal was not maintainable.    While reversing that view, 

    the Supreme Court observed that "the High Court did not consider 




                                                    
    the nature of the controversy and the prayers involved  in the

<p id="p_64">    18.         The   principles   which   emerge   can   be   elucidated   as 

    follows: (i) The fundamental principle which must be applied in 
            


    determining the maintainability of an appeal under Clause 15 of 
         



    the Letters Patent, is whether the facts justify a party in filing an 





    application   either   under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_170">Article   226</a>   or   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_171">Article   227</a>   of   the 

    Constitution.     Where   in   such   a   case,   a   party   chooses   to   file   an 

    application under both the Articles, it should not be deprived of a 





    right of appeal.  The Court must treat the application as one under 

    <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_172">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  If the Single Judge in the course of 

    the final order has issued an ancillary direction which pertains to 

    <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_173">Article   227</a>,   this   would   not   deprive   a  party   of   a  right   of   appeal

<p id="p_65">    (iv) Where the contention that is raised, the grounds taken and the 

    reliefs sought in the petition justify the invocation of both Articles 
            


    226 and 227 of the Constitution, an appeal under Clause 15 of the 
         



    Letters Patent against a judgment of the Single Judge would   be 





    maintainable;     (v)   The   mere   fact   that   while   dismissing   such   a 

    petition, the Learned Single Judge has observed that no ground for 

    interference   under   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_176">Article   227</a>   has   been   made   out,   would   not

    where   in   exercise   of   its   jurisdiction   the   Court   acts   illegally   or
