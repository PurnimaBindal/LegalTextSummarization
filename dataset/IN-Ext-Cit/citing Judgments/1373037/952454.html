     having   regard   to   the   parameters   of   interference   laid   down   in

     between   a   landlord   and   tenant   which   is   a   dispute   between

     was under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_12">Article 227</a> of the Constitution, is also noted. Division 

     Bench in order of reference, expresses that while the judgment in 

     M.M.T.C.   Limited  (supra)  arises   out   of   a   prayer   to   quash   an 





     order passed by the Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax and 

     is not strictly a dispute between the private parties, the Supreme

     the   parties   to   the   writ   petition.   It   pointed   out   that   in

     law   laid  down   in  <a href="/doc/1016548/" id="a_13">Surya  Dev   Rai  .vs.  Ram   Chander  Rai   and

     between the parties in a civil suit under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2

     the parties. Decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue noted in 
   



     M.M.T.C.   Limited  are   also   pointed   out.     It   appeared   to   later

     whether facts justified invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Art. 226</a> and it was properly

     him, view of earlier Division Bench in facts before it does not call 
                      
     for any change. Learned GP Shri Sambre has also addressed on

     curiae)   and   Adv.   Ghare     who   assisted   us   voluntarily,   the 
   



     judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in Shalini Shetty does not alter 





     the   legal   position   settled   well   over   number   of   years.   He   also 

     urged that  in  Surya  Dev  Rai,  the  scope  of writ  jurisdiction   is 

     further widened. Adv. Khedkar assisted the Court by showing the 





     nature and scope of powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Art. 226.</a> All Counsel did not

     of prerogative writs as understood in England, but the scope of 
                       
     those writs also is widened by the use of the expression "nature", 

     which expression does not equate the writs that can be issued in

<p id="p_65">     While exercising jurisdiction to issue a  writ of certiorari  the High  

     Court may annul or set aside  the act, order or proceedings of the  




                                                      
     subordinate courts  but cannot substitute its own decision in place  

     thereof. In exercise of supervisory jurisdiction the High Court may 




                                         
     not   only   give   suitable   directions   so   as   to   guide   the   subordinate  
                        
     Court as to the manner in which it would act or proceed thereafter  

     or afresh, the High Court may in appropriate cases itself make an  
                       
     order in supersession or substitution of the order of the subordinate

     of the case.

<p id="p_66">     39.  Though   we   have   tried   to   lay   down   broad   principles   and  





     working rules the fact remains that the parameters for exercise of

     tied down in a straitjacket formula or rigid  rules.  Not less than  





     often the High Court would be faced with dilemma. If it intervenes  

     in pending proceedings there is bound to be delay in termination of 

     proceedings. If it does not intervene, the error of the moment may

     given case may make it more appropriate for the High Court to  




                                                       
     exercise   self-restraint   and   not   to   intervene   because   the   error   of  

     jurisdiction though committed is yet capable of being taken care of  




                                                      
     and corrected at a later stage and the wrong done, if any, would be

     cases where a stitch in time would save nine'. At the end, we may  

     sum   up   by   saying   that   the   power   is   there   but   the   exercise   is  
                       
     discretionary   which   will   be   governed   solely   by   the   dictates   of

     case  of  <a href="/doc/156503/" id="a_86">Shri  Sohan Lal vs. Union of India and Another</a>,  AIR  
                         
     1957 SC 529 -  held that a writ of mandamus or an order in the  

     nature   of   mandamus   is   not   to   be   made   against   a   private

     is issued asking a person to do a particular thing which is in the  
      


     nature   of   his   public   duty.   In   Sohan   Lal   (supra)   rival   claims   of

     that   the   writ   Court   should   refrain   themselves   from   entering   the 

     said   field.   Since   in   view   of   the   Court   such   an   exercise   calls   for  

     "entering into a field of investigation which is more appropriate for

     inferior Courts of civil jurisdiction." (See paragraph 63 page 18 of  

     the   Report).   The   learned   Judges   in   saying   so   followed   the   law

<p id="p_75">     21. The learned Judges in Surya Dev Rai (supra), however, opined

<p id="p_76">     But this observation in Surya Dev Rai (supra) appears to have been 

     made  without properly considering the concurring and a separate  





     opinion given by Justice Sarkar in Mirajkar (supra) wherein his  

     Lordship clearly held "As certiorari is a technical word of English  

     law and had its origin in that law, for determining its scope and

     obviously it could not, overrule the ratio in Mirajkar (supra), a  




                                                      
     Constitution Bench decision of a nine-Judge Bench. But the learned

     alia on the ground that law relating to Certiorari changed both in

     ratio   in   Mirajkar   (supra)   is   based,   has   been   changed   and   in

     public authority or any other body of persons before the High Court

     quashed, or to quash such decisions. The order of prohibition is an  
                        
     order   issuing   out   of   the   High   Court   and   directed   to   an   inferior

</p>
<p id="p_81">     24. The aforesaid paragraphs are based on general principles which  





     are older than the time when Mirajkar (supra) was decided are still 

     good.  Those   principles   nowhere   indicate   that   judgments   of   an  

     inferior   civil   Court   of   plenary   jurisdiction   are   amenable   to 





     correction by a writ of certiorari. In any event, change of law in 

     England cannot dilute the binding nature of the ratio in Mirjakar  

     (supra) and which has not been overruled and is holding the field

     for decades. It is clear from the law laid down in Mirajkar (supra)  




                                                                                
     in paragraph 63 that a distinction has been made between judicial  




                                                        
     orders of inferior Courts of civil jurisdiction and orders of inferior 

     tribunals  or   Court  which  are  not  civil  Courts  and  which  cannot  




                                                       
     pass judicial orders. Therefore, judicial orders passed by civil Courts  

     of plenary jurisdiction stand on a different footing in view of the 




                                          
     law pronounced in para 63 in Mirajkar (supra). The passage in the  
                        
     subsequent   edition   of   Halsbury   (4th   Edition)   which   has   been  

     quoted in Surya Dev Rai (supra) does not at all show that there  
                       
     has   been   any   change   in   law   on   the   points   in   issue   pointed   out  

     above.

<p id="p_106">     Discussion by the Hon'ble Apex Court thereafter in paragraphs 





     67 to 71   shows that a writ can not be issued against a private

     entertaining a writ petition for certiorari in purely private civil

     developed this principle in relaxation of the rule of stare decisis.

     judgment   as   a   precedent,   the   relevant   laws   and   earlier 

     judgments should be brought to the notice of the court and they 




                                                      
     should   be   correctly   applied.   Mere   observations   in   a   previous 

     judgment may not be binding on a subsequent Bench if they are 




                                         
     not   truly   applicable   to   the   facts   and   controversies   in   a 
                        
     subsequent case as per settled principle of "ratio decidendi". The 

     rule of precedent, thus,is held to place an obligation upon the 
                       
     Bench considering such judgments that the Court should discuss 

     the   facts   and   the   law   of   both   the   cases   and   then   come   to   a 
      


     conclusion   whether   the   principle   enunciated   in   the   previous 
   



     judgment   is   actually   applicable   on   facts   and   law   to   the 





     subsequent case. This principle equally applies when the Courts 

     have   to   consider   which   of   the   two   views   expressed   by   earlier 

     equi or other Benches is applicable to the subsequent case. The 





     rule of precedent is found to be not without exceptions. It has its 

     own limitations.  Besides this, there are exceptions to the rule of 

     precedent. There are judiciously accepted exceptions to the rule

     Ltd</a>.,   2007   (5)   SCC   371,   the   Supreme   Court   stated   the   law 
                       
     relating to precedents and held that a decision, as is well known, 

     is an authority for what it decides and not what can logically be 
                      
     deduced therefrom. The ratio of a decision must be culled out 

     from the facts involved in a given case. It is settled principle that 
      


     it is not every thing said by a Judge,while giving judgment, that 
   



     constitutes   a   precedent.   The   only   thing   in   a   Judge's   decision 





     which   bind   parties   is   the   principle   upon   which   the   case   is 

     decided and for this reason it is important to analyse the decision 

     and isolate "ratio decidendi" from it. Its three essential features 





     are   (i)   findings   of   material   facts,   direct   and   inferential.   An 

     inferential   finding   of   facts   is   the   inference   which   the   Judge 

     draws from the direct or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the

     District Judge alleging it to be perverse and not in accordance

     it   was   held   by   Division   Bench   that   though   the   Hon'ble   Apex

     Bench observes that the Apex Court held that to a proceeding 

     under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_230">Article 227</a> of the Constitution, only Appellate Side Rules 




                                                   
     apply   but   to   a   proceeding   under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_231">Article   226</a>,   both   namely 

     Original as well as Appellate Side Rules apply depending on situs 




                                       
     of the cause of action and that the proceeding under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_232">Article 227</a> 
                       
     of the Constitution is never an original proceeding. Consequently, 

     Division Bench noted that in para 32, the Hon'ble Apex Court 
                      
     concluded  the nature of the proceedings as under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_233">Article 227</a> of 

     the   Constitution.   Then   comments   of   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   on

     next   paragraph   its   judgment   in  Radheshyam   vs.   Chabbinath 





     (supra)   finds   consideration.   It   then   proceeds   to   note   that   the 

     principles   laid   down   regarding   scope   of   interference   under 

     <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_235">Article 227</a> have been found to be consistent and the apex court 





     then in para 62 of the said judgment formulated the parameters 

     after deducing from various earlier judgments including the case

     the part of the District Judge in appeal appears. Then the the 

     ratio in the decision in Shalini Shetty, in a case of pure dispute 




                                                     
     between landlord and tenant, is found to be  that a writ petition 

     under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_238">Article   226</a>   is   not   maintainable   but   an   application   (not 




                                        
     writ   petition)   under   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_239">Article   227</a>   of   the   Constitution   would   be 
                       
     maintainable,   that   too   in   the   light   of     para   62   of   the   said 

     judgment. Then parameters (a) to (o) are reproduced and then 
                      
     in   paragraph   12,   the   Division   Bench   proceeds   to   reject   the 

     submission made on behalf of appellant with reference to para 
      


     79 of the said judgment and  records that there is no question of 
   



     infraction of statute when a landlord or a tenant seeks remedy 





     under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_240">Rent Act</a> and the infraction of statute 

     referred to in para 79 is about the infraction while performing

     powers of superintendence under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_252">Art. 227</a> are to be exercised, 





     such tribunal or authority is not a necessary party.   The reason 

     for the same as noted by the Hon'ble  Apex Court  is  that if in 

     certiorari proceeding, such tribunal is not party, the adjudication 





     can not bind it and it can avoid contempt of court.

     either  expressly  note  or then  change  the  legal position  settled

     (only) respondent or then in absence of court/tribunal/authority
