                          CM APPL. 9509/2023
                                 This is an application filed by the appellants under Order XLI Rule
                          27 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 („CPC‟, for short) seeking to bring
                          on record the examination report of the Trade Marks Registry dated April
                          28, 2010 and reply dated June 23, 2011.         The reasons given in the
                          application are that it has now come to the knowledge of the appellants
                          through the website of the Trade Marks Registry that the registrant itself
                          has disclaimed any exclusive rights of the impugned Trade Mark through its
                          reply dated June 23, 2011, in response to the examination report dated April
                          28, 2010.    It is stated in the application that the proceedings and the
                          materials before the Trade Marks Registry for registration of the impugned
                          mark would be material and relevant for the adjudication of the present
                          appeal. That apart, it is stated that the documents being part of public
                          record are undisputable and unimpeachable and it was incumbent upon the
                          respondents to bring on record the same, which they have failed to do.
</p><p id="p_2">                                 The respondents would contest the application by stating that the
                          application is not maintainable under the parameters of Order XLI Rule 27
                          of CPC inasmuch as the said documents were publicly available on the
                          website of the Trade Marks Registry. The appellants cannot contend that
                          they were unaware of the said documents, more so, when certain other
                          communications with the Trade Marks Registry were placed on record in
                          the suit.

                          was only a proposed assignee of the said mark from the Registrant, i.e.,
                          SONA BLW Präzisionsschmiede GmbH, in breach of Section 17 and
                          Section 45 (4) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as
                          „<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks Act</a>‟). It is also their case that in the reply dated June 23,
                          2011 of SONA BLW Präzisionsschmiede GmbH to letter dated May 13,
                          2010 of the Trade Mark Registry, wherein, for seeking registration on the
                          said mark „SONA BLW‟, the original Registrant had claimed that other
                          registrants of the word „SONA‟ were peacefully co-existing and thus
                          registration could be possible. The said correspondence between SONA
                          BLW Präzisionsschmiede GmbH and the Trade Marks Registry has now
                          been brought on record.

                          considered the adoption of the word „SONA‟ by the appellants as mala fide
                          when the respondents themselves had given up any right to the said word in
                          public register. Without there being any legal and exclusive rights to use
                          the word „SONA‟ by the respondents, the adoption could not have been
                          considered mala fide.

                          the suit was liable to be dismissed on account of suppression of material
                          facts in the plaint. The Trade Mark wherein the Registration No. 1707890
                          has been granted by the Trade Marks Registry was with a „disclaimer‟
                          stating &quot;THE APPLICANT HAS NO EXCLUSIVE RIGHT FOR THE
                          WORD SONA, SEPARATELY&quot;.              According to them, the respondents

                          the Trade Marks Registry, sought to mislead this Court by stating as if they

                          respondents had intentionally suppressed the disclaimer on the Registration
                          Certificate of the Trade Mark bearing Registration No. 1707890, which
                          shows that the device mark registration in favour of the respondent No.2
                          was conditional and did not allow the respondents to claim any exclusive
                          rights in the word „SONA‟. It is their case that the learned Single Judge
                          should have dismissed the suit and disentitled the respondents to any relief
                          based on the concealment of this fact itself.
</p><p id="p_22">                          6.    According to Dr. Singhvi, the very purpose of a disclaimer is to
                          minimise the possibility of extravagant and unauthorised claims being made
                          on the basis of registration of the Trade Mark (s). Since the Registration
                          Certificate of the instant Trade Mark bears the disclaimer, the respondents
                          cannot claim exclusive rights to the use of the said word. In support of his
                          submissions, he has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
                          case of <a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_3">Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok Chand Rakhit</a>, AIR 1955 SC

                          between the respondents and the Trade Marks Registry with regard to the
                          Trade Mark bearing Registration No.1707890, to submit that the respondent
                          No.2 is seeking registration of its device mark and stated that „Driving

                          intentionally concealed by the respondents while filing the suit, thereby
                          disentitling the respondents to any relief.
</p><p id="p_24">                          8.    Dr. Singhvi stated that the change of the corporate name of the
                          appellant No. 1 to Sona Mandhira Private Limited took place in view of a
                          shareholders‟ resolution passed in the Extraordinary General Meeting of the
                          appellant no.1 company held on June 06, 2020. For the passing of the said
                          resolution, two shareholders namely Ms. Mandira Koirala and Ms. Rani
                          Kapur were present. The resolution provides that Ms. Rani Kapur seconded
                          the change of name of the appellant No.1. It is stated that Ms. Rani Kapur is
                          the mother of Ms. Mandira Koirala and Mr. Sunjay Kapur and is also the
                          Managing Director of Sona Management Services Limited, i.e., respondent
                          No.2. According to him, the mischief on the part of the respondents lies in
                          the fact that Mr. Sunjay Kapur is trying to oppress his sister Ms. Mandira
                          Koirala to the filing of the present suit without the knowledge of Ms. Rani
                          Kapur, who had in fact allowed the change of the corporate name of the
                          appellant No.1. He also stated that the dispute in the suit is primarily a
                          family dispute between the Chairman of the respondent No.1 and the
                          appellant No.2, them being brother and sister. Dr. Surinder Kapur, the
                          father of the Chairman of respondent No.2, was also a Director of the
                          appellant No.1 in 2011.      In fact, he had allowed and even urged the
                          appellants to use the word „SONA‟.
</p><p id="p_25">                          9.    Additionally, Dr. Singhvi submitted that the word „SONA‟ is a
                          generic and common word in trade and has attained the status of publici
                          juris. It is not an invented word but a generic word and as such no one can
                          claim exclusive proprietary rights over the name „SONA‟.

</p><p id="p_27">                          10.     Yet another contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is
                          that the suit was liable to be dismissed on account of delay and laches as
                          also acquiescence of the respondents in the use of the mark „SONA‟ by the
                          appellants. The appellant No.1, for the last ten years was trading / carrying
                          out works for the respondents and was using the said mark / logo on its
                          product when the respondents and appellants were working together.
</p><p id="p_28">                          11.     That apart, the learned senior counsel for the appellants submitted
                          that no case for passing off has been made out by the respondents,
                          inasmuch as the products of the appellants and the respondents cater to
                          different segments of the market, and the purchasers of the goods and the
                          entire supply chain is different. While the respondent No.1 supplies only to
                          Original Equipment Manufacturers („OEM‟ for short), the appellant No.1
                          has its market post the sale of a vehicle.       The device / logo of the
                          respondents and the appellants is also different inasmuch as the colour
                          combination, trade dress and even the taglines are not similar.
</p><p id="p_29">                          12.     Dr. Singhvi, referring to the decision in <a href="/doc/93036610/" id="a_6">Cadburry UK v. Lotte India</a>,
                          (2014) 207 DLT 500, stated that it is settled law that there are two essential
                          ingredients to be fulfilled to claim passing off.      Firstly, a party must
                          represent its goods to be that of another party, and secondly there must be a
                          confusion or a likelihood of confusion. According to him, for the above
                          stated ingredients to be satisfied in the present case, the mark of the
                          respondents need to be at least similar to that of the appellants. There is no
                          likelihood of confusion as the two marks are not similar, and as such the
                          basic ingredients of passing off of a Trade Mark do not apply to the instant
                          case.

                          assignable in terms of <a href="/doc/813701/" id="a_7">Section 36</a> of the Trade Marks Act. In the present
                          case, only the Trade Mark containing the words „SONA BLW‟ is registered
                          in the name of SONA BLW Präzisionsschmiede GmbH. There is no
                          registration for the Trade Mark „SONA‟ separately. The case of the
                          respondents is that the mark has been assigned by SONA BLW
                          Präzisionsschmiede GmbH in favour of the respondent No.1. According to
                          the learned senior counsel for the appellants, the assignment is limited to
                          „SONA BLW‟ and not the mark &#x27;SONA&#x27; separately.              &#x27;SONA&#x27; is not
                          registered as it has no distinctive feature even as per the Trade Marks
                          Registry and as such can be used by any person and cannot be monopolised
                          by the respondents. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment of the
                          Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1236969/" id="a_8">Thukral Mechanical Works v. PM Deseals

</p><p id="p_32">                          14.   The fact that the respondents have suppressed material facts in the
                          suit has been found out by the learned Single Judge, as is apparent from
                          paragraph 42 of the impugned judgment, which reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                      &quot;42. As far as the suppression of disclaimer is concerned, I

                                      senior counsel for the defendants that the disclaimer attached
                                      to the registration granted in favour of the plaintiffs under the
                                      Application No. 1707890 was a vital and material fact to be
                                      disclosed upfront by the plaintiffs in the Plaint, especially
                                      where they are claiming exclusive rights in the word

</p><p id="p_50">                          20.   Mr. Nayar, relying upon the communication between the attorneys of
                          SONA BLW Präzisionsschmiede GmbH and the Trade Marks Registry
                          dated June 23, 2011, regarding the objections raised by the Trade Marks
                          Registry, has vehemently contended that there is a clear submission that
                          other Trade Marks with the name &#x27;SONA&#x27; are peacefully coexisting
                          without incidence of any confusion or deception. Having taken such a
                          stand, the respondents cannot now contend that they have any exclusive
                          right to the said word. That apart, even this communication has been
                          suppressed/concealed by the respondents, and on this ground as well, the
                          respondents deserve no discretionary relief from this Court.

                          that the word „SONA‟ has been used as part of the corporate name of the
                          respondent No.1 group name and as a Trade Mark even through its
                          predecessors since 1984. They asserted that the respondent No.1 is a leader
                          in production of precision forged gears and differential assemblies and
                          other applications for automotive industries and has a major presence
                          worldwide. It has been using &#x27;SONA&#x27; formative marks for manufacturing
                          as also sale in drive-line and electrical divisions. It also asserted that there
                          are other entities which are part of the Sona Group having the word
                          „SONA‟ in their name such as Sona Autocamp Holding Private Limited and

                          business since the year 2011 under the name Mandira Marketing Private
                          Limited and changed it to Sona Mandhira Private Limited only on June 22,
                          2020. According to the respondents, the appellants are also engaged in a
                          similar trade as that of the respondent No.1, which establishes that the
                          appellants were in fact aware of the registration in favour of the
                          respondents, as well as the long uninterrupted use of the Trade Mark /
                          corporate name „SONA‟ and have deliberately and dishonestly adopted the
                          said mark as part of its corporate name so as to pass off its goods as that of
                          respondents. The appellant No.2 Ms. Mandira Koirala being the sister of
                          Mr. Sunjay Kapur, who is the Chairman of respondent No.1 and Director in
                          respondent No.2 company, and the appellants also being in a similar line of
                          business as that of the respondent No.1, there is no doubt of the appellants
                          being well aware of the enormous goodwill and reputation of the
                          respondent No.1 amongst its customers and in the market. The appellants
                          have adopted the mark „SONA‟ as part of its corporate name to deceive the
                          unsuspecting public at large into believing that there exists an association
                          between the respondent No.1 and them.       Their case was that such illegal

</p><p id="p_59">                          24.       Mr. Akhil Sibal and Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, learned senior counsel
                          appearing on behalf of the respondents, at the outset, have contested the
                          stand of the appellants that the learned Single Judge has erred in granting
                          the injunction. According to them, the scope of an appeal against a
                          discretionary interim order is limited inasmuch as the appellate court will
                          not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and
                          apply its own discretion, except when such discretion of the court of first
                          instance has been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, capriciously or
                          perversely, or when the settled principles of law have been ignored. In this
                          regard, they have relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case
                          of Wander Limited and Anr. v. Antox India P. Limited, 1990 (Supp) SCC

                          disclaimer, was filed along with the plaint, and the appellants were served
                          with an advance copy of the suit four days before the matter was listed
                          before the Court, the learned Single Judge found the that the respondents
                          had not disclosed the factum of the disclaimer in the main body of the
                          plaint, and saddled the respondents with exemplary costs, which have been
                          duly deposited. According to Mr. Sibal, the finding of the learned Single
                          Judge that every instance of non-disclosure does not ipso jure require that
                          the matter not be considered on merits, and the interim relief be declined,
                          and the suit be dismissed at the threshold, cannot be faulted. He stated that

                          any judicial pronouncement which establishes the contrary. In fact, the
                          judgments relied upon by the learned senior counsel recognise that while
                          the Court possesses the power in an appropriate case to decline relief on the
                          ground of a fraud played upon the court, each case has to be considered on
                          its own facts, and the discretion of the Court be exercised accordingly. In
                          fact, in the cases relied upon by the appellants, the Court additionally
                          considers the merits of the matter, thus negating the very proposition for
                          which reliance was placed on those cases.
</p><p id="p_61">                          26.       According to Mr. Sibal, the exercise of discretion by the learned
                          Single Judge is sound, as he had considered the following as mitigating
                          factors against refusal to consider the merits of the matter and decline relief
                          on the alleged non-disclosure alone.

                                    alia, no ad-interim injunction was granted and therefore the
                                    respondents have already suffered the consequence of non-disclosure.

                          „common to trade‟, by stating that in order to make out a defence of
                          „common to trade‟, actual, substantial and widespread use of the mark must
                          be shown. There is a distinction between „common to trade‟ and „common
                          to register‟, both in respect of corporate names reflected in the records of
                          the Registrar of Companies, and also Trade Marks reflected in the records
                          of the Trade Marks Registry. In the instant case, no actual, substantial or
                          widespread use whatsoever, by any of the cited companies has been pleaded
                          or even established as regards automotive parts. That apart, in any event

                          inasmuch as the appellants are trying to market/sell their products as that of
                          the respondents‟. This is demonstrated by the following:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                                (i)     The „SONA‟ mark adopted as far back as 1984 was a
                                predominant part of the names of at least 14 corporate entities set up
                                both domestically and internationally from time to time as part of the
                                Sona Group and was always treated as a valuable corporate asset.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                (ii)    The registrations were always in the name of corporate entities
                                and never in the names of individuals, reflecting the ownership with
                                the companies rather than as family property to be used and licensed
                                as desired by family members.

                                response, the late Dr. Kapur expressly commented that, &quot;I suggest
                                you use SONA Logo, for Sona Group products. To create your own

                                clear that appellant No. 1 was consciously incorporated without a

                                with a clear understanding that the &#x27;SONA&#x27; logo would only be used
                                by the appellant No.1for Sona Group products and not as its own
                                brand.
</p><p id="p_78">                          33.   In furtherance of the above understanding as captured in the
                          correspondence between Dr. Surinder Kapur and Mr. Himanshu Koirala, a
                          sales agreement dated April 09, 2012 was entered into between the
                          respondent No.1 and the appellant No.1, whereby the appellant No.1 was
                          permitted to sell the products of the respondents. As a corollary to the said
                          agreement, the Trade Mark &#x27;SONA&#x27; was used by the appellants. At no
                          point of time did the appellants use the mark &#x27;SONA&#x27; independently, until
                          the impugned adoption. In fact, the appellant No.1, before the impugned
                          adoption was using its own independent registered logo &#x27;M&#x27; including on
                          its website, invoices, brochures, etc. The appellant No.1 had also adopted
                          another independent mark &#x27;ADLCC&#x27; for which it has sought registration.
                          From the year 2011 - 2020 i.e., until the impugned adoption the appellant
                          No.1 was using these two independent Trade Marks for its products and
                          only used the Trade Mark &#x27;SONA Driving Tommorow&#x27;, i.e., the mark of
                          the respondent in their role as the licensee/seller of the products of the

                          justified in holding that notwithstanding the disclaimer, the Court would
                          give due regard to the whole of the mark including the disclaimed mark,
                          while deciding the question of infringement, and that the disclaimer in the

                          automotive parts. According to them, as such, &#x27;SONA&#x27; for automotive parts
                          is an arbitrary association deserving the highest degree of protection.

                          as the appellants are using a different logo and cater to a different segment
                          of the market as both the respondents and the appellants deal with
                          automotive parts, even purchasers of such part could be deceived into
                          believing that an association exists between the respondents and the

                          MANDHIRA by the appellants is exclusively after filing of the suit and
                          therefore, no equity can arise in their favour. Any goods manufactured and
                          sold using the device logo/mark SONA MANDHIRA would have been
                          manufactured and sold after filing of the suit. It is well settled that a
                          defendant cannot derive any equities from infringing use, especially after
                          being expressly put to notice. Reference in this regard is made to the
                          decision in <a href="/doc/1752560/" id="a_31">M/s Hindustan Pencils Private Limited v. M/s India Stationary
                          Products Co. &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 1990 Delhi 19. They have also relied upon the
                          judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_32">Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Limited
                          &amp; Another v. Sudhir Bhatia &amp; Others</a>, (2004) 3 SCC 90, to contend that in
                          case of infringement, either of a Trade Mark or of a copyright, an injunction
                          must follow. The grant of injunction becomes necessary if it prima facie
                          appears that the adoption of the mark itself was dishonest.

                          FINDINGS
</p><p id="p_90">                          41.   Having heard the learned senior counsel for the parties and perused
                          the record, the challenge in the appeal is primarily to the order dated
                          February 22, 2023 whereby the learned Single Judge has allowed the
                          application filed by the respondent Nos.1 and 2 under Order XXXIX Rules
                          1 and 2 of CPC and restrained the appellants herein from using the mark
                          &#x27;SONA&#x27; as part of its corporate name, while dismissing two applications
                          filed by the appellants for rejection of the plaint and dismissal of the suit.
</p><p id="p_91">                          42.   At the outset, we may highlight the position of law with respect to the
                          powers of an appellate Court dealing with an appeal against a discretionary
                          order. It is well settled that the appellate Court will not reassess the material
                          on which the Court of first instance has decided to grant or refuse an
                          interim protection. The locus classicus in this regard, is the judgment in
                          Wander Limited (supra), wherein a three-judge Bench of the Supreme
                          Court has held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                                       &quot;14. The appeals before the Division Bench were against the
                                       exercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the
                                       appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion
                                       of the court of first instance and substitute its own discretion
                                       except where the discretion has been shown to have been
                                       exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where
                                       the court had ignored the settled principles of law regulating
                                       grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against
                                       exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle.</blockquote>
<p id="p_92">                                       Appellate court will not reassess the material and seek to reach
                                       a conclusion different from the one reached by the court below
                                       if the one reached by that court was reasonably possible on the
                                       material. The appellate court would normally not be justified
                                       in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal
                                       solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the
                                       trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the

                                      discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and

                          that concealment made by the plaintiff in every case would not result in an
                          automatic dismissal of the plaint and/or application seeking interim relief.

                          granted not only to protect the proprietary rights of the plaintiff, but also to
                          protect an ordinary unwary consumer who may be deceived due to adoption
                          of a similar mark for similar goods by the defendant. On the aspect of

                          &#x27;SONA BLW&#x27; is devoid of any distinctive character and that there are
                          similar marks already on the Register. They would submit that there is a

                          material for adjudication, has been made with respect to the

                          dated November 21, 2008. However, even with regard to the
                          correspondence dated June 23, 2011, we find ourselves in agreement with
                          the conclusion arrived at by the learned Single Judge. This we say so, as the
                          correspondence on which the reliance has been placed by the appellants is
                          exchanged between the German company SONA BLW Präzisionsschmiede

                          emanating from the respondent No.1and as such the said letter cannot act as

                          entitled to use it for schools. This Court vacated the interim injunction not
                          only on the basis of the concealment by the plaintiffs of their stand taken
                          before the Trade Marks Registry, but also on finding prima facie that
                          multiple schools were already using the impugned Trade Mark, even prior
                          to the adoption of the mark by the plaintiffs. As such, this Court held that
                          the plaintiffs would have to establish at trial that the impugned mark is
                          exclusively associated with the schools of the plaintiffs. It is in that factual
                          situation that this Court held that the interim injunction therein was liable to
                          be vacated.

                          also not be of aid to the appellants inasmuch as in that case, the Trade
                          Marks Registry had in its examination report cited the Trade Mark of the
                          defendants, in response to which, the plaintiff expressly stated that its marks
                          are different from that of the cited marks, including that of the defendants,
                          and therefore there is no likelihood of confusion. Subsequently, the plaintiff
                          filed a suit contending to the contrary and alleging likelihood of confusion
                          on account of the defendant‟s use of its Trade Mark. It was in this situation
                          that this Court while stating that there is no dispute with the proposition laid
                          down in Telecare Network (supra) that there can be no estoppel against a
                          statute, held that the said proposition would not be applicable in the facts of

                                  &quot;44. I am not impressed with the above submissions. As noted
                                  herein above, the disclaimer of the exclusive right in the word
                                  &quot;SONA&quot; was a vital fact to be disclosed by the plaintiffs in the
                                  Plaint. It may or may not eventually influence the outcome of the
                                  Suit/application seeking interim injunction one way or the other,
                                  however, has to be disclosed. The Court has to be informed of all
                                  relevant facts for it to take a decision.
</p><p id="p_103">                                  45. The Court is also not expected to scan through voluminous
                                  documents filed by the plaintiffs with the Plaint in order to find
                                  for itself such an important and vital fact. In fact, the plea that the
                                  disclosure could not be made as the Plaint was filed during
                                  Covid-19 lockdown, is defeated by the fact that the plaintiffs had
                                  this document in their custody and filed the same with the Plaint,
                                  however, did not mention its effect in the Plaint. The non-
                                  disclosure, therefore, has nothing to do with Covid-19 lockdown.
                                  However, to a limited extent that the suit was filed in urgency and
                                  during the Covid-19 pandemic, the same can act as a mitigating
                                  circumstance.
</p><p id="p_104">                                  46. Equally, only because the plaintiffs were unable to obtain an
                                  exparte ad interim order because of the presence of the
                                  defendants, who pointed out the above concealment on the first
                                  date of hearing, cannot absolve the plaintiffs from the
                                  repercussions of such concealment. Concealment remains
                                  unpardonable even where the plaintiff does not succeed in
                                  misleading the Court thereby, or where the defendant appears
                                  and is able to highlight such concealment on the first date of
                                  hearing, thereby preventing an adverse order being passed
                                  against it. However, having suffered the consequence of non-
                                  disclosure, the plaintiff cannot be condemned indefinitely.
</p><p id="p_105">                                  47. The fact that the plaintiffs also failed to plead another
                                  registration which may be supportive of its case in the Suit, also
                                  cannot absolve the plaintiffs of their misconduct, but may act as a
                                  mitigating circumstance.
</p><p id="p_106">                                  48. Having said the above, however, in my view, the concealment
                                  made by the plaintiffs in every case would not result in an
                                  automatic dismissal of the Plaint and/or of the applications filed
                                  by the plaintiffs seeking interim relief. In law, an injunction
                                  against infringement and passing off is granted not only to

                                    adoption of a similar mark for similar goods by the defendant.
                                    There is, therefore, an element of public interest also to be
                                    protected. Facts of each case would, therefore, have to be
                                    considered to determine the effect of concealment/misstatement

<p id="p_107">                          52.   The aforesaid would reveal that the learned Single Judge did come to
                          a conclusion that the concealment of disclaimer on the exclusive rights in
                          the word &#x27;SONA&#x27; was a vital fact to be disclosed by the respondents in the
                          plaint, though it may not eventually influence the outcome of the
                          suit/application seeking interim injunction.
</p><p id="p_108">                          53.   We find that the learned Single Judge, by stating so, was also of the
                          view that the concealment made by the plaintiff in every case would not
                          result in automatic dismissal of the plaint or the application filed by the
                          plaintiff seeking interim relief, as there is an element of public interest also
                          to be protected.
</p><p id="p_109">                          54.   On a detailed perusal of the impugned order, we find that the learned
                          Single Judge while holding that there is concealment of material facts by
                          the respondents, has also considered certain mitigating circumstances as
                          mentioned in paragraphs 45 to 50, which we have already reproduced
                          above. The learned Single Judge in exercise of his judicial discretion
                          concluded that for the acts of concealment, the respondents can be visited
                          with exemplary costs rather than dismissing the suit/application.

                          No.1, the respondents were successful in demonstrating a prima facie case
                          for grant of an interim injunction in their favour. The appellants have failed
                          to demonstrate that the exercise of discretion by the learned Single Judge is

                          the stand taken by the respondents that &#x27;SONA&#x27; is the predominant feature
                          of the mark of the respondents and using a part of a registered Trade
                          Mark/prominent feature of the mark leads to infringement, is contrary to its

                          dealt with learned Single Judge in paragraphs 65, 66 and 67 which we

                                    registration in a composite mark containing various parts would
                                    confer on the proprietor an exclusive right to use of the trade
                                    mark taken as a whole and not to only a part thereof. However, in
                                    my opinion, this would not defeat the right of the
                                    plaintiff/proprietor to claim injunction on the basis of passing off.
                                    For the test of passing off, the marks are to be tested on the
                                    standard of a person of average intelligence with imperfect
                                    recollection. It is the overall impression of the mark created on
                                    the consumer that would be the governing factor to determine
                                    likelihood of confusion or deception. In such determination,
                                    therefore, the Court may also identify elements or features of the
                                    mark that are more or less important for purpose of making the
                                    comparison between the competing marks.</blockquote>

                                           Conflicting composite marks are to be
                                           compared by looking at them as a whole,
                                           rather than breaking the marks up into their
                                           component parts for comparison. This is the
                                           &quot;anti dissection&quot; rule. The rationale for the
                                           rule is that the commercial impression of a
                                           composite trademark on an ordinary
                                           prospective buyer is created by the mark as a
                                           whole, not by its component parts. However,
                                           it is not a violation of the anti-dissection rule
                                           to view the component parts of conflicting
                                           composite marks as a preliminary step on the
                                           way to an ultimate determination of probable
                                           customer reaction to the conflicting
                                           composites as a whole. Thus, conflicting
                                           marks must be compared in their entireties. A
                                           mark should not be dissected or split up into
                                           its component parts and each part then
                                           compared with corresponding parts of the
                                           conflicting mark to determine the likelihood
                                           of confusion. It is the impression that the
                                           mark as a whole creates on the average
                                           reasonably prudent buyer and not the parts
                                           thereof, that is important. As the Supreme
                                           Court observed:
</p><p id="p_114">                                           &quot;The commercial impression of a trademark

                                           elements separated and considered in detail.
                                           For this reason it should be considered in its
                                           entirety.&quot; The anti- dissection rule is based
                                           upon a common sense observation of
                                           customer behavior: the typical shopper does
                                           not retain all of the individual details of a
                                           composite mark in his or her mind, but
                                           retains only an overall, general impression
                                           created by the composite as a whole. It is the
                                           overall impression created by the mark from
                                           the ordinary shopper‟s cursory observation

                                           in the marketplace that will or will not lead to
                                           a likelihood of confusion, not the impression
                                           created from a meticulous comparison as
                                           expressed in carefully weighed analysis in
                                           legal briefs. In litigation over the alleged
                                           similarity of marks, the owner will emphasize
                                           the similarities and the alleged infringer will
                                           emphasize the differences. The point is that
                                           the two marks should not be examined with a
                                           microscope to find the differences, for this is

                                           marks. To the average buyer, the points of
                                           similarity are more important that minor
                                           points of difference. A court should not
                                           engage in &quot;technical gymnastics&quot; in an
                                           attempt to find some minor differences
                                           between conflicting marks.

                                           there must be weighed against one another to
                                           see which predominate.

                                           mark, but rather the mental impression of the
                                           mark creates in its totality. It has been held to
                                           be a violation of the anti-dissection rule to
                                           focus upon the &quot;prominent&quot; feature of a mark
                                           and decide likely confusion solely upon that
                                           feature, ignoring all other elements of the
                                           mark. Similarly, it is improper to find that one
                                           portion of a composite mark has no
                                           trademark significance, leading to a direct
                                           comparison between only that which

                                    383/2022, titled <a href="/doc/69194077/" id="a_39">Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd. v. Sonae EV
                                    Private Limited</a>, has held that &quot;SONA&quot; forms a dominant part of
                                    the plaintiffs‟ Trade Mark, thus is entitled to protection. It is also
                                    of import that the word &quot;SONA&quot; otherwise cannot be said to be
                                    descriptive or even suggestive of the goods in which the plaintiff
                                    deals in. Further, the reason given by the defendants for adoption
                                    of the word „SONA‟ in its corporate name does not impress me,

<p id="p_123">                          57.   We find ourselves in complete agreement with the conclusion of the
                          learned Single Judge on the above issue as well.
</p><p id="p_124">                          58.   Yet another submission of Dr. Singhvi is that in view of Section 16
                          of the Commercial Courts Act which amended Order VI Rule 15A of CPC,
                          on finding that there is a concealment made by the respondents, the learned
                          Single Judge should have dismissed the suit. Order VI Rule 15A
                          contemplates that every pleading in a commercial dispute shall be verified
                          by an affidavit in a prescribed format, and a party shall not be permitted to
                          rely on a pleading which is not verified in the manner provided, as evidence
                          or any of the matters set out therein. He stated that the said provision
                          establishes the mandatory nature of the pleadings to be verified by way of
                          an affidavit, and that any concealment shall result in the dismissal of the
                          suit. Though, the submission looks appealing on a first blush, on a closer
                          consideration, it is noted that Order VI Rule 15A does not prescribe any
                          effect in the eventuality there is a concealment by a party. It appears that
                          the same is for the reason, discretion lies with the Court, to deal with such
                          concealment in the facts of a particular case and pass appropriate orders. In
                          the present case, as noted from the impugned order, the learned Single

                          Judge while concluding that prima facie there is mala fide on the part of the
                          appellant No. 1 in changing its corporate name, and also that the
                          respondents are guilty of suppression/concealment, and also by observing
                          that concealment made by the plaintiff in every case would not
                          automatically result in the dismissal of the application, has balanced the
                          equities by imposing cost on the respondents. As we have already held that
                          the learned Single Judge was justified in exercising the discretion, this plea
                          of Dr. Singhvi is liable to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_125">                          59.   Another plea is that the adoption of &#x27;SONA&#x27; by the appellant was in
                          view of the consent given by Ms. Rani Kapoor, who was the Managing
                          Director of the respondent No.2 company, and hence, the principle of
                          estoppel / acquiescence would come into play and the respondents could not
                          have raised any objection to the adoption to which she had given her
                          consent. The reasoning given by the learned Single Judge while rejecting
                          this plea is in paragraph 76 of the impugned order, which we reproduce as
                          under, as we are also in agreement with the same.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">                                       &quot;76. As far as the claim of permission for the change of the
                                       corporate name from Mrs.Rani Kapur is concerned, the
                                       documents relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the
                                       defendants appear to be executed by Mrs.Rani Kapur as a
                                       shareholder of defendant no.1 and in her individual capacity.
                                       The registrations of the trade marks stand in the name of the
                                       plaintiff no.2, which is a corporate entity. They already stand
                                       assigned in favour of the plaintiff no. 1. Mrs.Rani Kapur in her
                                       individual capacity, therefore, cannot claim any right over the
                                       said mark, which can be assigned or licensed by her to a third

                          Director of the respondent No.2 company. In any case, even as the
                          Managing Director of respondent No.2 company, she could not have
                          granted any consent for use/adoption of the impugned Trade Mark, without
                          a specific authorisation/approval in that regard. Nothing has been brought to
                          our notice to demonstrate that she had any such authorisation. Suffice it to

                          for the learned Single Judge not to dislodge the respondents on the ground
                          that there has been a concealment/suppression of facts by the respondents.
                          We are also of the view that the learned Single Judge has exercised his
                          discretion judiciously, in concluding that in the facts of the case, equities lie
                          in favour of the respondents, and that the respondents have been able to
                          make out a good prima facie case for the grant of interim protection, and in
                          granting the ad-interim injunction in their favour and against the appellants.
                          There being no perversity, arbitrariness or illegality in the exercise of
                          discretion by the learned Single Judge, the impugned order warrants no
                          interference. The other judgments on which reliance was placed by the
                          learned senior counsel for the appellants are not required to be gone into as
                          they were all considered by the learned Single Judge, and also in view of
                          our above conclusion.

                                PAN and GST registrations are done under the said company name.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">                                (ii)    The appellants are manufacturers and procurers, and the

</p><p id="p_135">                          68.   The submissions made by Mr. Gaggar are not appealing. Surely the
                          effect of the respondents‟ application having been allowed by the learned
                          Single Judge is that the appellants are required to change the corporate
                          name of the appellant No.1. If the name of the appellant No.1 is required to
                          be changed on the strength of the order passed by the learned Single Judge,
                          the appellant can inform the concerned PAN / GST authorities in that
                          regard. Surely no such authority shall compel the appellants to continue
                          filing returns under the old name in violation of the order of the learned
                          Single Judge, which we have now upheld.

                          No.1 is required to be carried out. The plea that supply and distribution
                          chain shall be adversely affected is also not appealing, for the reason that
                          the learned Single Judge has come to a prima facie finding that the
                          appellant with mala fide intentions, changed its corporate name from
                          Mandira Marketing Private Limited to Sona Mandhira Private Limited, with
                          which finding we agree. In this given background, the plea of equity as
                          sought to be urged by Mr. Gaggar cannot be accepted. Similar would be the
                          position with regard to the change of domain name and email address of the

                          also a factor which weighs with us for not granting the prayer as made in
                          the application. The judgments relied upon by Mr. Gaggar would not come
                          to the aid of the applicants, in view of our above conclusion, and
                          additionally as they are distinguishable for the reasons below:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">                                    (i)      In Alkem Laboratories (supra), the applications under
                                    Order XXXIX Rules 1, 2 and 4 of CPC were still pending
                                    consideration and even the goods in that case were pain relievers
                                    and Schedule H drugs. As such, this Court found it appropriate
                                    that public interest would be subserved if the product was
                                    allowed to be sold.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">                                    (ii)     In Lupin Limited (supra), the application under Order
                                    XXXIX Rule 4 was pending, and the plaintiff therein had
                                    conceded to the liquidation of the existing stock by the
                                    defendants.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                                    (iii)    In Sun Pharma Laboratories (supra), the defendant
                                    was also a registered Trade Mark holder, and had a
                                    manufacturing license for the impugned product.
