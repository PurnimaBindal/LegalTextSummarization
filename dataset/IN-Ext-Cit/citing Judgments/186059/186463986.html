a young boy, namely, Viney Aggarwal, on probe by the Investigating

Agency put a needle of indictment         against the accused - appellants

Charanjeev Singh @ Sunny and Jatinder Bhatia @ Rinku (herein referred as

<p id="p_5">            Both the accused filed two different appeals i.e. CRA No.495-

DB of 2001 and CRA No.541-DB of 2001.            However, accused Jatinder

Bhatia died during the pendency of the appeal, therefore, vide order separate

has been ordered to be abated.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Besides studying, the deceased Viney Aggarwal (herein referred

as `the deceased') was working as an insurance agent and was staying along

with his father in House No.3407, Sector-32-D, Chandigarh.          Both the

accused had been supplying him the insurance work and in lieu of that they

were fetching commission. However, a dispute had arisen between the

accused and the deceased over the commission amount, therefore,           the

accused persons had nursed a grudge on that account.

</p><p id="p_7">            On 8.7.1997 at about 3.00 PM, when the deceased was present

at his house in Sector-32, Chandigarh, then both the accused came and took

him along with his Maruti Car bearing Reg.No.CH01M-0056, as witnessed

by Sushil Kumar - complainant (friend of the deceased).             Since the

deceased did not turn up on that day, Subhash Chander Aggarwal, his father

lodged a missing report Ex.PDDD/1 on 9.7.1997 at 10.40 AM with the

police while mentioning that the deceased had gone in his maruti car

bearing Reg.No.CH01M-0056 at about 3.00 PM on 8.7.1997, but had not

returned. Thereafter, on 11.7.1997, Sushil Kumar returned to Chandigarh

and he came to know that the deceased was missing, whereas, the accused

(who had taken him away) had also arrived at Chandigarh. Therefore,

suspecting them to be the culprits, he lodged the First Information Report

            friend. I had to go out-side Chandigarh for my personal work

            on 8.7.97.     Same day, about 3.00 PM, I went to Viney

            Aggarwal's house in Sector-32 to see him, but noticed that

            Charanjeev Galhotra @ Sunny had caught Viney on back seat

            of his car No.CH01M-0056 Maruti Blue colour and another

            friend of Viney namely Jatinder @ Rinku who lives in House

            of car and the car was in standing position. On asking Sunny

            told me that Viney was not feeling well and they were going for

            bringing medicine for him.       They had left in the car in my

            presence. Same day, I went to Amritsar and Ludhiana for my

            personal work. Today, I came back to Chandigarh and went to

            his house to enquire about health of Viney.                 The family

            member of Viney told me that Viney was missing from very

            day. Then, I went to find out Viney's friend Rinku in Sector-47

            and came to know that Rinku and Charanjeev had come back to

            Chandigarh, but not Viney. I am sure that Viney has been

Store, Mohali. They had also purchased a string from the shop of Jai Dayal

(PW19) situated at Manimajra and after that they had taken the deceased

towards Morni Hills. The Investigating Agency also recorded the statement

of Pardeep Kumar, who had disclosed that on 8.7.1997, he had seen the

accused going with the deceased in the aforesaid car and at that time, the

accused along with the deceased had come out of the car.       The deceased

appeared to be under the influence of some intoxicant.

statement that he had concealed the body of the deceased in the area of

village Mandana and he could also tell the shop from where the string was

<p id="p_23">              When examined under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_8">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, 1973, the accused denied all the incriminating circumstances

appearing against them and pleaded their false implication in the case. In

defence, they examined Amar Singh (DW1), Manjit Singh (DW2) and

Ms.Jassy Anand, Finger and Document expert (DW3).           However, the

            Mr.R.S.Cheema, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the

accused, in an endeavour to prove the innocence of the accused, has

strenuously contended that in the absence of any medical opinion that it was

a homicidal death, it would be difficult to connect the accused with the

crime and this is the material missing link, which the prosecution has failed

to plug; secondly his argument is that the witnesses are interested in the

success of the case;       motive to implicate the accused has not been

established and they would be last persons to kill the deceased on account

of the petty motive regarding the payment of commission, which is too

feeble to commit such a heinous crime; <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_9">Section 106</a> of the Indian Evidence

Act, 1872 is not attracted to the facts of the present case. While stressing

further that the circumstances, as brought on record by the prosecution in

order to connect the accused with the crime, if taken cumulatively, do not

unerringly point towards the guilt of the accused, therefore, they should be

acquitted of the charge.
</p>
<p id="p_26">            To the contrary, while referring to the background of the case

that both the accused were friendly with the deceased and they were

supplying the insurance work to the deceased; the deceased was last seen

with these accused; recovery of the string, the golden ring and chain taken

away from the accused and pawned with Bishan Lal (PW9); the testimonies

of the last seen witnesses and the testimony of Pardeep Kumar (PW22), who

had seen the accused along with the deceased in the car and the accused had

purchased two bottles of coke from him; recovery of the beer bottles at the

instance of the accused; motive and the corroborative testimony of Sushil

Kumar lend one to conclude that it was none-else, but the accused, who had
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                       [10]



committed the crime.    He further states that once it is established that the

accused were last seen in the company of the accused, then the burden shifts

upon the accused to explain as to how-else Viney Aggarwal died.

</p><p id="p_27">            Having pondered over the rival contentions, we do not find

ourselves persuaded from the arguments as raised by the senior counsel for

the accused. The chain of circumstances leading to the homicidal death of

Viney Kumar Aggarwal as springing out during the investigation appears to

be so natural that do not suggest anything except to draw an inference of the

guilt against the accused. Undisputedly, there is no direct evidence in the

case and the case is wholly dependent on circumstantial evidence. Unlike

the direct evidence, the circumstances, if proved by unimpeachable

evidence pointing unerringly towards the guilt of the accused, then the same

could be placed reliance. The Apex Court in a recent case <a href="/doc/186059/" id="a_10">Ujjagar Singh

vs.   State of Punjab</a>, 2008(1) RCR(Criminal) 305 set down following

guide-lines for the courts to examine the circumstances before placing

reliance upon them:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            "(1) that the circumstances from which the inference of guilt

            is to be drawn have been fully established by unimpeachable

            evidence beyond a shadow of doubt;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">            (2)that the circumstances are of a determinative tendency

               unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; and

            (3)that the circumstances, taken collectively, are incapable of

               explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the

               guilt sought to be proved against him;</blockquote><p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">            (4)that the circumstances concerned `must or should' and not
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                         [11]



               'may be; established. There is not only a grammatical but a

               legal distinction between `may be proved' and "must be or

               should be proved"
</p>
<p id="p_30">             (5)the facts so established should be consistent only with the

               hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they

               should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except

               that the accused is guilty,

             (6)the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and

               tendency,

             (7)they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the

               one to be proved, and

             (8)there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to

               leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent

               with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all

               human probabilities the act must have been done by the

               accused;
</p>
<p id="p_31">             (9)whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the

               facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no

               universal yardstick should ever be attempted."
</p>
<p id="p_32">             Here, we may not be failing to mention that the Supreme Court

in Ujjagar Singh's case (supra) further expected some explanation from

the accused, though, it was the duty of the prosecution to prove the case

beyond doubt. Here, it would be apt to record the observations, which were

as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_33">             "19. We have considered the submission of the State counsel
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                        [12]



            very carefully. It is true that it is generally for the prosecution

            to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the

            present one, some explanation is also due from an accused in

            order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime."



            Now, while examining the present case on the parameters as set

down by the Apex Court, we need to bring forth some circumstances

proving the motive, last seen theory, recovery of the articles removed from

the body of the deceased, which do not suggest any other hypothesis

inconsistent with the guilt of the accused. As regards motive :- Besides the

testimonies of Subhash Chander Aggarwal (PW34), we have with us the

testimony of Jaspal Singh (PW26) and Madhu Sudan Sharma (PW28), who

have confirmed that the deceased was an insurance agent and the accused

were supplying him the customers and there was a dispute between them

regarding the commission.       Madhu Sudan Sharma (PW28), who is a

Development Officer in Oriental Insurance Company,           has gone to the

extent that accused Jatinder Bhatia also wanted to be an insurance agent and

had moved an application Ex.PLL/1 along with photograph Ex.PLL/2 as

also the form for depositing the license fee with him, but since he was

under-age, therefore, his application was rejected by Mrs.Savita Khanna, the

Branch Manager. He also deposed that the deceased used to request him to

release the commission amount at the earliest, because both the accused had

a share in the commission for supplying insurance work to him.         Gurdas

Singh (PW29) has also corroborated the prosecution version while deposing

that the deceased was working as a motor vehicle insurance agent and he
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                        [13]



had also got insured his scooter through him.        Thus, un-shattered and

impartial testimonies of the aforesaid witnesses leave no iota of doubt in our

mind to hold that the deceased was working as Insurance Agent and the

accused persons had a direct nexus with him and sharing commission. In

any case, motive, howsoever small may be treated as sufficient for the

commission of the crime. We cannot speculate as to what was there in the

minds of the accused. The murders are committed even without motive.

The motive is such a feature which lies in the mind of the accused and is

difficult to explore, therefore, motive itself could not be treated as a

circumstance to acquit the accused.       Thus, it would be too weak an

argument to say that the motive in the instant case is not adequate for

committing the crime.
</p>
<p id="p_34">            Last Seen Evidence :- The second circumstance against the

accused in the instant case is the leaving of the house by the deceased along

with them in car No.CH01M-0056, Subhash Chander Aggarwal (PW34)

without mincing the words had disclosed in the Daily Diary Report that

Viney Aggarwal had left the house at 3.00 PM in the aforesaid car.

Thereafter, we have the evidence of Sushil Kumar (PW32), who being the

friend of the deceased had come to his house to see him when the accused

were seen taking him in the aforesaid car. The time of taking the accused as

narrated by Subhash Chander Aggarwal synchronizes with the time as given

by Sushil Kumar. Sushil Kumar did not intervene obviously for the reason

that the accused persons were friendly with the deceased and they were in

the same business. The deceased was told to be not well and the witness

was to got for his work at Amritsar and Ludhiana.            Further, he has
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                       [14]



specifically stated that both the accused along with the deceased left in the

car within his sight.   Purchase of cold-drinks on the way: There is another

circumstance regarding purchase of the cold drinks on the way to Morni

Hills by the accused. Pardeep Kumar (PW22), who is the vice-chairman of

the Block Simiti, Morni has proved this fact. No bias or prejudice has been

levelled against him for deposing against the accused. His deposition is that

on 8.7.1997 at 4.00 PM, the accused came in a Maruti car and stopped in

front of his shop, summoned him and demanded two bottles of cold drinks.

At this, he brought two cokes from his shop. When, he tried to open those

bottles, accused Jatinder Bhatia asked him not to open the same and when

they wished to take the bottles on payment of price, the accused Jatinder

Bhatia paid Rs.28/- as price of the cold drinks. He also identified Jatinder

Bhatia, who had come and contacted him. He further deposed that he had

seen two other occupants on the rear seat of the car; one of them was

catching hold of the other. He identified Charanjeev - accused in the court

amongst one of the occupants.        He says that when they returned and

stopped to return the bottles, the third person was not with them. This

witness was cross-examined at length, but nothing such could be elicited

from his testimony, which could discredit him.
</p>
<p id="p_35">             Another witness, Pardeep Kumar Sharma (PW30) disclosed

that at about 4.30 PM, he had seen a car coming from the Chandigarh side,

which was occupied by three persons. He identified the accused being the

occupants of that car and also deposed that the deceased appeared to be

under influence of some intoxicant.       His testimony also could not be

impeached on any ground.

             Purchase of string :- There is another evidence of purchase of

string from the shop of Jai Dayal (PW19) by the accused, which indicates

that the accused had gone to the side of Morni Hills with the deceased.

Recovery of beer bottles :- The recovery of the beer bottles at the instance

of the accused from under the Nadha bridge (which is on the way to Morni

Hills) also proves that the accused had gone along with the deceased nearby

the place, where the dead body was recovered. Recovery of gold chain and

ring from Bishan Dass at the instance of the accused             :- The other

circumstance is the recovery of the golden ring and golden chain at the

instance of the accused, which was pawned by them and the pawn-deed was

also executed.
</p>
<p id="p_37">             After recovering the dead body on 11.7.1997, DNA tests were

conducted and the blood samples of Subhash Chander Aggarwal and his

wife (parents of the deceased) tallied with that of the recovered dead body.

</p><p id="p_38">             It would also be significant to mention here that the accused

had no explanation to make as to how-else the deceased ended his life.

They in their statements have stated nothing except pleading false

implication in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_39">             As regards the argument advanced by Sh.Cheema that the

doctors conducting the autopsy could not form an opinion about the cause

of death, therefore, the accused could not be convicted for the homicidal

death, having given out thoughtful considerations to this submission, we are

of the view that when the dead body was found in a putrefied condition

recovered in the rainy season after four days, it was difficult to carve out the

cause of death. The body was recovered in decomposed condition. The
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                        [16]



post mortem examination was conducted on 14.7.1997 i.e, after seven days

of the death. The doctor opined that the death was within seven days, which

synchronizes with the testimonies of the other witnesses that the deceased

had left the house with the accused on 8.7.1997.      The mere fact that the

cause of death could not be disclosed, does not relieve the accused of the

onus to explain as to how-else the accused died. The doctor has no-where

stated that it was a suicidal death. No suggestion has been given to the

doctor that he had committed suicide or he died in other circumstances not

attributable to the accused.   The accused was not suffering from any such

disease which may become the cause of his death. No such suggestion was

given to the doctor. The traces of kerosene found on his body and the

removal of the ornaments (golden chain and ring) and subsequent recovery

thereof, along with the recovery of the car also indicate that it was

homicidal death and he died other than in natural and normal circumstances.

It may further be observed that when once sufficient circumstantial evidence

is found to connect the accused with the crime, then without any plausible

explanation as to how the accused came in possession of the articles

belonging to the deceased, no presumption could be raised that the accused

did not commit the crime. Similar observations were made by the Apex

Court in case <a href="/doc/205463/" id="a_11">Ezhil     vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, 2002(3) RCR(Crl.) 775,

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             "8.   The case rests purely on circumstantial evidence and the

            could be no reasonable or plausible explanation by any of the

            is appropriate to notice the principles governing the same,

            before undertaking any consideration of the justification to

            apply them to the facts of the case. The entire case law on the

            subject has been extensively reviewed by this Court in a

            decision reported in Sanjay alias <a href="/doc/1027979/" id="a_14">Kaka vs. State (NCT of

            must be seen to find, among other things the important time

            factor. Though, no standard time limits can must be fixed to

            determine whether the possession is recent or otherwise, each

            case must be judged on its own facts and in a case where there

            is no plausible explanation by the accused for lawful

            possession of the articles belonging to the deceased,

            immediately after the murder, the courts cannot be held to be in

            error in considering that murder and robbery were integral parts

            of the same transaction giving rise to the presumption that the

            appellants not only committed the murder of the deceased but

            also committed robbery of articles found in the possession of

            the deceased. As observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/575647/" id="a_18">State of West

            Bengal vs. Mir Mohammed Omar and others</a>, 2000(8) SCC

            382 : 2000(4) RCR(Criminal) 147(SC), the pristine rule that

            the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of

            the accused should not be taken as a fossilized doctrine,

            admitting no process of an intelligent reasoning even when the

<p id="p_40">There is no rule of law that the recovery of the corpus delicti is a sine qua

<a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_22">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act places a serious obligation upon the

State of Bihar</a>, 2001(4) RCR(Crl.) 347 as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "23. There can be no dispute with the proposition of law set

            out above. As is set out in the various authorities (referred to

            above), it is not at all necessary for a conviction for murder that

            the corpus delicti be found. Undoubtedly, in the absence of

            the corpus delicti there must be direct or circumstantial

            evidence leading to the inescapable conclusion that the person

            has died and that the accused are the persons who had

            committed the murder. Both the courts below have come to the

            conclusion, based upon the evidence of PWs 3 and 4 (who were

            eye witnesses) that Appellant No.9 had killed the accused

            before the body was taken away by all the Appellants. We have

            read the evidence of all the witnesses. We have given a careful

            consideration to the material on record. We see no reason to

            take a different view. The evidence in this case is direct and

            there is no reason to disbelieve this evidence.       We see no

            substance in the submission of Mr.Mishra that these two ladies

            could not have seen the boy being killed and could not have in

            any case come to a conclusion that he had died. Their presence

            at the place of incident could not be doubted. Their evidence

            clearly indicates that the incident took place before their eyes.

            We cannot accept the submission of Mr.Mishra that their

            evidence discloses that the incident took place outside the

            courtyard and on the road, Mr.Mishra has relied on stray

            sentences. The evidence has to be read as a whole. Read as a

            whole both the ladies have given positive evidence that the

            murder took place in the courtyard. We also see no substance

            in the submission that PW3 and PW4 could not positively say

            that Krishnanand Chaudhary had been killed. The evidence is

            that Bijay Chaudhary stated that "he is still alive and should be

            killed". On this statement, Appellant 9 gave a chhura blow on

            the chest. The evidence is that Krishnanand Chaudhary, who

            was till then struggling twitched and thereafter his body

            became still. From this it could be concluded that death had

            taken place.   It must be mentioned that even PW1 whose

            evidence Mr.Mishra relied upon, has deposed that Krishnanand

            Chaudhary had died.</blockquote><p id="p_41">

</p><p id="p_42">            24.   Even otherwise, in our view, this is a case where <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_24">Section

            106</a> of the Evidence Act would apply. Krishnanand Chaudhary

            was brutally assaulted and then a chhura blow was given on the

            chest. Thus, chhura blow was given after Bijoy Chaudhary had

            said "he is still alive and should be killed". The appellants then

            carried away the body.          What happened thereafter to

            Krishnanand Chaudhary is especially within the knowledge of

            the Appellants. The Appellants have given no explanation as to

            what they did after they took away the body. Krishnanand
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                       [21]



             Chaudhary has not been since seen alive. In the absence of an

             explanation, and considering the fact that the Appellants were

             suspecting the boy to have kidnaped and killed the child of the

             family of the Appellants, it was for the Appellants to have

             explained what they did with him after they took him away.

             When the abductors withheld that information from the Court

             there is every justification for drawing the inference that they

             had murdered the boy.        Even though <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_25">Section 106</a> of the

             Evidence Act may not be intended to relieve the prosecution of

             its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable

             doubt, but the section would apply to cases like the present,

             where the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts from

             which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding death.

             The Appellants by virtue of their special knowledge must offer

             an explanation which might lead the Court to draw a different

             inference. We, therefore, see no substance in this submission

             of Mr.Mishra."
</p>
<p id="p_43">Again, the Apex Court in case <a href="/doc/575647/" id="a_26">State of West Bengal vs. Mir Mohammad

Omar</a>, 2004(4) RCR(Crl.) 147 : 2000 AIR (SC) 2988 has evaluated the

provisions of <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_27">Section 106</a>. When once the factum of abduction is proved at

the hands of the accused and the kidnapped person was found murdered

shortly thereafter, then the circumstance of abduction would be sufficient to

draw the presumption that the accused had committed the murder, unless,

the accused explains otherwise. The relevant para 34 of the judgment reads

as under:-
</p><p id="p_44"> Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                      [22]



            "34. When it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that

            Mahesh was abducted by the accused and they took him out of

            that area, the accused alone knew what happened to him until

            he was with them. If he was found murdered within short time

            after the abduction the permitted reasoning process would

            enable the court to draw the presumption that the accused have

            murdered him. Such inference can be disrupted if accused

            would tell the court what else happened to Mahesh at least until

            he was in their custody."
</p>
<p id="p_45">

            In the instant case also, it is proved from the testimony of

Subhash Chander Aggarwal (PW25) that the accused had left the house and

the testimony of Sushil Kumar (PW32) proves that these were the accused,

who had taken the deceased in the car, which vehicle was recovered from

Haridwar (UP). The deceased was also seen in the company of the accused

by Pardeep Kumar Sharma (PW30) and the accused did not inform the

family of the deceased if he left their company during the said period. The

dead body of Viney Aggarwal was recovered from the area where they were

last seen with him. It has also come in evidence that the accused had

earlier also threatened the deceased for not making the payment of the

commission. Thus, when considered in the light of the proximity of time

within which the deceased was killed and consistency of time between the

death and the post mortem examination, the same are found enough to draw

the inference that these were the accused and none-else who had committed

the crime. Any other inference by deviating from the above course would
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                       [23]



have been correct if the accused would have explained and convinced the

court with any other plausible version acceptable to a prudent mind. Since

they refused to state any such facts, therefore, inference would stand

undisturbed.
</p>
<p id="p_46">               No finger has been raised so as to challenge the quality and

competency of the witnesses to corroborate the facts as set out by the

prosecution. The defence as set out by the accused is not reliable. The

statement of the draftsman (Amar Singh DW1), who prepared the site plan

is meaningless as it has been prepared at the instance of Manjit Singh

(DW2), who admitted that he was not present at the spot at the time of

recovery of the dead body. Manjit Singh (DW2) has stated that on 1.4.2001,

he had gone to Morni Resorts from Sector 21 Chandigarh along with Amar

Singh (DW1) on a motor cycle and it took them two hours to reach there.

The testimony of this witness is of no consequence because to our mind,

time factor depends on the speed with which a motor cycle or another

vehicle is driven.    Moreover Pardeep Kumar Sharma (PW30) was coming

on the different route and the question of comparison with the speed and

distance of DW2, who was coming from Chandigarh does not arise. So far

as the evidence of DW3, Mrs.Jassy Anand, who is a expert witness, is

concerned, she has tried to prove that the photographs of the dead body

were taken in the day time and not during the night. However, this witness

has stated that the place of recovery of the dead body was pointed out to her

by one Chaman Lal, who has not stepped into the witness box and there is

nothing on the record to tell as to how the place of recovery of the dead

body came to the knowledge of Chaman Lal.            Qua the difference in
 Criminal Appeal No.495-DB of 2001 (O&amp;M)                      [24]



photographs taken by her and the police photographer, she has specifically

stated in her statement that she was not aware of the distance from which

the police photographer had taken the photographs and also the points from

which the photographs were taken. She was not aware as to whether the

police photographer had taken the photographs of the dead body while

standing, kneeling or sitting. She is also not aware about the nature of the

search lights used by the police photographer. Further more during cross-

examination, she has admitted that she is not a trained photographer. Thus,

the defence, which the accused have tried to set up, comes to the ground,

with no legs to stand.
</p>
<p id="p_47">            Thus, on scrutiny of the entire evidence, this Court is fully

convinced with the circumstances as brought forth by the prosecution

forming a complete chain to draw an irresistible conclusion that these were

the accused and none-else who had committed the murder of             Viney

Aggarwal on account of a dispute over the non-payment of their share in the

commission.
