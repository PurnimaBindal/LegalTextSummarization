<p id="p_2"> 1                By this petition, the petitioner has challenged the order
 passed by the Divisional Commissioner, Aurangabad dated 7 October
 2018. By the impugned order, the Divisional Commissioner has allowed
 the review filed by the respondents dismissing original revision
 application filed by the petitioner and has confirmed the Mutation Entry
 No.1924.
</p><p id="p_3"> 2                The preliminary objection is taken by the respondents relying
 on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_1">Gurudassing Nawoosing

                                          2                                  WP_12574_2018



 Mh.L.J. 915, that the petitioner has a statutory remedy of revision to the
 State Government under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue
 Code, 1966.
</p><p id="p_4"> 3                Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that though the
 petitioner could have approached the State Government in revision from
 the original order, revision is maintainable against the impugned order
 which is passed in review under Section 258 of the Maharashtra Land
 Revenue Code, 1966.
</p><p id="p_5"> 4                A perusal of the record shows that a power is conferred on
 the State Government or the revenue authority to review the order on the
 ground of clerical mistake or some material error on the basis of the
 record or any other sufficient reason. Sub clause (5) of Section 258 relied
 upon by the petitioner does not indicate that the order passed in review is
 final as the said sub clause states that the order passed in review shall not
 be reviewed. If the argument of the petitioner that there is no remedy of
 further revision under Section 257 available against the order passed in
 review under Section 258, is accepted, it will create an anomalous
 situation. It would be meant that if revision is dismissed there is a further
 revision, but if the revision is allowed and order is passed in original
 revision then there is no further revision.              Such an anomalous
 interpretation, which takes away a right of a revision cannot be accepted.

 5                In the circumstances, since the petitioner has remedy of
</pre><p id="p_6"> further revision against the impugned order, it is not necessary to
 interfere with the impugned order in writ jurisdiction. Keeping all
 contentions of the parties open, this writ petition is disposed of.
