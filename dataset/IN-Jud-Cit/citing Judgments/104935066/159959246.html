communications        regarding      the   non-payment      of    dues   by     the

respondent, a meeting was held at the office of the petitioner on 17th

September, 2001 where the President of the respondent company

lamented about his poor financial condition.             The petitioner made a

proposal to the respondent during the meeting which the President of

the respondent company agreed to discuss with his associates and

revert by 21st September, 2001. However the President of the

respondent       intimated     the      President   of    the    Petitioner,     by

communication dated 19th September, 2001, about the problems

confronting the respondent on account of non-availability of the

support of Banks and Financial Institutions and requested the

petitioner to restructure the payment schedule and proposed to review

the situation on 2nd October, 2001.           Since the petitioner had already

extended several relaxations and could not suffer any further loss on

account of the respondent, by an e-mail dated 21st September, 2001,

the petitioner reminded the President of the respondent that he was to

revert by 21st September, 2001 on the proposal made by the petitioner

and warned that they may have to suspend its services to the

respondent in case no response is received from the respondent by

5.00 pm on 21st September, 2001.

September, 2001 agreed that a monthly payment of US$ 58333 would

be made starting from the month of October 2001 till the month of

December 2001 which would be revised to US$ 100000 per month

thereafter.     It was stated by the petitioner that the respondent again

sent an e-mail dated 23rd January, 2002 acknowledging the payment

scheduled agreed between them on 17th September, 2001. However in

the said e-mail the respondent also expressed its inability to make

payment of US$ 100000 per month with effect from January 2002. It

is asserted by the petitioner that the President of the respondent had

intimated to the Chief Financial Officer of the petitioner by

communication dated 9th July, 2002 that the petitioner was rightly

interested in recovery of all its outstanding dues and referring to the

last visit of the President of the respondent, it was reiterated that the

respondent would start clearing the dues on regular basis and would

also reduce its transponder utilization by going digital and efforts

would be made to increase the utilization of its teleport by up-linking

more THAICOM-3 customers and will use the proceeds to clear

backlog of petitionerâ€Ÿs payment.

petitioner by a letter dated 11th July, 2002 communicated to the

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 all the three agreements aggregated to US$ 571215.75 and that if the

same was not paid by 12.00 clock (Bangkok time) on Friday, 12th

July, 2002 the petitioner would be left with no alternative but to

suspend the services of the respondent. Since the payment was not

made within the stipulated time, the petitioner by a letter dated 17th

July, 2002 terminated all the three agreements entered with the

respondents and intimated that the outstanding dues on account of

all the three services amounted to US$ 729,870.25 on the said date.



</p><p id="p_20">12.    Petitioner has alleged that despite the termination of all the

agreements the respondent illegally continued up-linking its signal to

the petitionerâ€Ÿs satellite forcing the petitioner to file a petition under

<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_5">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 being OMP

NO.102/2003        seeking     restraint   against   the   respondent   from

transmitting any signal to any transponder of THAICOM-3 Satellite.

During the course of hearing of the said petition, the learned counsel

for the respondent made a statement on instructions from the General

Manager (Commercial) of the respondent that the respondent is no

longer using the transponders of the petitioner and shall not use the

same in future. In view of the above-said statement of the learned

counsel for the respondent, the petition was disposed of.

pay the amounts, which had become due from respondent, despite

several notices being sent by the petitioner to the respondent. In the

circumstances, the petitioner has also claimed late payment charges

on the outstanding dues from 17th July, 2002 @ 1.5% per month as

per clause 3 of all the three agreements. The petitioner has also

claimed that the respondent is also liable to pay 50% of the unpaid

service fees as per clause 14.2 of the TS Agreement-II. It is further

asserted by the petitioner that as per the terms of the three

agreements, since there is a breach on the part of the respondent, the

respondent is also liable to pay other damages incurred by the

petitioner.

his precarious financial position by their letter dated 2nd February,

2005 and showed unwillingness to attend the arbitration proceedings

in Singapore. It is further averred that during the preliminary meeting

on 5th February, 2005 the Tribunal had asked the petitioner to bear

1, 26,369.66, being half of the amount of Rs. 2, 52,739.33, which is

the total expenses incurred by the petitioner in arranging the

said amount.

demand for arbitration vide letter dated 9th September, 2004 and

intimated the respondent about its intention to nominate the former

Judge, Bombay High Court and the former Chief Justice, Karnataka

High Court Mr. Justice M.L. Pendse as their arbitrator, the respondent

has refused to appoint an arbitrator. It is submitted that since the

respondent failed to appoint its arbitrator, the petitioner filed an

Arbitration Application No. 1/2005 in the Honâ€Ÿble Supreme Court of

India under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_7">Section 11(6)</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_8">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996

January, 2006.

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 agreements to pay the outstanding dues. The petitioner has further

contended that he has a claim of US$ 351831.77 under the IS

Agreement; US$1378141.40 under the TS Agreement-I and US$

243676.56 under the TS Agreement-II till 28th February, 2005 and

that the respondent is also liable to pay 18% interest per annum on

the outstanding bills from 1st March, 2005.         The petitioner has

asserted that they seriously apprehend that the respondent in order to

defeat and defraud the petitioner will sell, transfer, dispose of or

create third-party rights in respect of its properties situated at New

Delhi or elsewhere in India thereby making the arbitration awards

which will be passed in favor of petitioner non-executable and they

will become paper decrees. The petitioner also contended that there

are serious disputes between the respondent and the other creditors

and in the circumstances the respondent may even go in liquidation.



</p><p id="p_33">20.      In the circumstances, the petitioner has prayed for appointment

of court receiver since the respondentâ€Ÿs financial position is precarious

and the respondent is likely to sell, dispose of its properties.      The

petitioner has also prayed that the respondent be restrained from

selling, assigning and entering, transferring possession, letting out,

creating third-party rights or creating charge or dealing in any manner

with movable and immovable properties in New Delhi or elsewhere in

India.

to deposit US$ 351831.77 in OMP No. 182 of 2005; US$1378141.40

in OMP No. 183 of 2005 and US$ 243676.56 in OMP No. 184 of 2005

along with interest @ 18% per annum from 1st March, 2005 till the

date of realization or to furnish security to the satisfaction of the

Court for the above said amounts. In the circumstances, petitioner

has also prayed that grave and irreparable loss, harm and injury will

be caused to the petitioner in case the reliefs as prayed by the

petitioner are not granted and the loss which will be caused to the

petitioner cannot be compensated in terms of money and therefore, it

is averred that the balance of convenience is in favor of petitioner.



</p><p id="p_36">22.    The petitions are contested by the respondent contending, inter

alia, that the grant of an order of injunction, attachment or

appointment of a receiver is not justified on the basis of averments

made in the petition. Relying on <a href="/doc/738672/" id="a_9">Section 2</a> (2) of the Arbitration and

<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_10">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996, it was contended that the Courts at Delhi has

no jurisdiction to entertain the petitions - OMP No. 182 of 2005 and

OMP No. 184 of 2005, as the place of arbitration in the above

mentioned cases is at London and Singapore respectively and an

application under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_11">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_12">Conciliation Act</a> can

be made only if the place of arbitration is in India. The respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                Page 13 of 53</span>

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 also pleaded that principle governing the grant of any interim

protection under the English Law has to be resorted to as the parties

agreed in the contract that the arbitration will be subject to English

Laws and, therefore, Indian Law has no applicability to the present

dispute. In OMP No. 183 of 2005 the respondent contended that the

arbitration clause contained in TS Agreement I is invalid as it ousts

the jurisdiction of Indian Courts to the challenge of any award. The

petitioner has not exhausted his remedy under <a href="/doc/318136/" id="a_13">Section 17</a> of the Act

and has wrongly and maliciously chosen to file the present petitions.

The respondent also contended that the disputes referred for

arbitration are without any merit and the respondent has filed a

counter claim and is hopeful of succeeding in its counter claim.

the respondent for the second time as earlier also OMP No.102/2003

fresh circumstances warranting any petition under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_14">Section 9</a> of the

been able to make out a prima facie case against respondent and the

alleged apprehension shown by the petitioner about the respondentâ€Ÿs

selling or disposing of all properties are baseless and irresponsible. It

was stated that the allegation made by the petitioner are factually

incorrect and no basis for the allegations have been disclosed. In the

circumstances the respondent stated that the balance of convenience

is in favor of respondent. It was also contended that the respondent

has not used the service as envisaged under TS Agreement-II and that

the petitioner had failed to deliver the commercially acceptable quality

of service as promised under the IS Agreement and TS Agreement-I

and that the petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence to

substantiate their claims under the said agreements. It is also

contended that the petitioner has claimed US$ 343676 as outstanding

dues under the TS Agreement-II in the arbitral proceedings in

Singapore, whereas, in OMP No.184 of 2005 the amount claimed is

US$ 243676 and that the inconsistency reflects lack of bona fide on

agreements, the place for arbitration in respect of disputes arising out

of IS Agreement is London; in respect of TS Agreement-I, it is New

Delhi and in respect of TS Agreement-II it is Singapore. The

respondent has pleaded that it has all along been requesting the

petitioner to have all the disputes arising out of the three agreements

to be settled by the same set of arbitrators in India, as the three

agreements relate to identical transactions with no major difference as

far as dispute resolution is concerned. In the circumstances it is

alleged that due to the unreasonable attitude adopted by the

petitioner, the same arbitrators and their lawyers travel to Singapore

and come back and then again travel to London and this involves

enormous expenditure which is avoidable and unnecessary. It is

contended that        this unreasonable attitude of the petitioner is a

relevant consideration for refusing any assistance in the form of

injunction to the petitioner.

present on account of properties of the respondent within the

at page 123 in para 32, the Apex Court held that provisions of Part I

would apply to all arbitrations and to all proceedings relating thereto

and that in the case of international commercial arbitrations held out

of India, provisions of Part I would apply unless the parties by

agreement, express or implied exclude all or any of its provisions. The

said paragraph 32 is as below:-

              the provisions of Part I would compulsorily apply and
              parties are free to deviate only to the extent permitted by

learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, asserted that the failure to

disclose the particulars of payments received in the petition was an

attempt to project that no payments at all had been made by the

respondent and this action on the part of the petitioner disentitles him

to benefit of injunction. According to him, the petitioner first time

admitted that some payments were made only in its affidavit dated 2nd

              of an interim prohibitory injunction or an interim
              mandatory injunction are governed by well-known rules

</p><p id="p_76">37.    For appointment of a receiver, a person seeking appointment is

to make out a case of waste or damage to the property. A receiver

cannot be appointed merely because it is expedient or convenient to

one of the parties to do so or because it will do no harm to do so.

Though the appointment of receiver is discretionary, exercise of such a

discretion is to be based on sound judicial principles. A receiver can

be appointed in case no other adequate remedy or means of

accomplishing the desired object of the judicial proceeding is

available. It is to be based on a very good prima facie case of plaintiff

succeeding in the legal proceeding. In order to have a receiver

appointed plaintiff not only has to show a conflicting claim to the

property but must also show some emergency or damage or loss

demanding immediate action. It is also no more res integra that

normally receiver is not to be appointed where it has an effect of

depriving a defendant of a de facto possession which may cause

irreparable loss to the defendant. The conduct of the parties is also

bona fide and the proposition of law is arguable, it is not advisable for

the Court to appoint a receiver to take possession of immovable

property from the defendants unless and until the Court is of the

opinion that there is well founded fear that the property in question

will be dissipated or that other irreparable mischief may be done

unless the Court gives a protection. It is only if more than a prima

facie case is made out by the plaintiff of the likelihood of the suit being

decreed and if there is no tangible defense raised by the defendants

and if it will lead to manifest injustice, then in exceptional

circumstances the Court would be justified in appointing a receiver

              the case, exercised for the purpose of permitting the ends

               and of his own right he must be reasonably clear and free
              from doubt. The element of danger is an important
              consideration. A Court will not act on possible danger
              only, the danger must be great and imminent demanding
              immediate relief. It has been truly said that a Court will
              never appoint a receiver merely on the ground that it will
              do no harm.
</p>
<p id="p_79">              (4) An order appointing a receiver will not be made when
              it has the effect of depriving a defendant of a â€žde factoâ€Ÿ
              possession since that might cause irreparable wrong. If
              the dispute is as to title only, the Court very reluctantly
              disturbs possession by receiver, but if the property is
              exposed to danger and loss and the person in possession
              has obtained it through fraud or force the Court will
              interpose by receiver for the security of the property. It
              would be different where the property is shown to be â€žin
              medioâ€Ÿ that is to say, in the enjoyment of no one, as the
              Court can hardly do wrong in taking possession: it will
              then be the common interest of all the parties that the
              Court should prevent a scramble as no one seems to be in
              actual lawful enjoyment of the property and no harm can
              be done to anyone by taking it and preserving it for the
              benefit of the legitimate who may prove successful.
              Therefore, even if there is no allegation of waste and
              mismanagement the fact that the property is more or less
              â€žin medioâ€Ÿ is sufficient to vest a Court with jurisdiction to
              appoint a receiver. Otherwise a receiver should not be
              appointed in supersession of a bona fide possessor of
              property in controversy and bona fides have to be
              presumed until the contrary is established or can be
              indubitably inferred.
</p>
<p id="p_80">              (5) The Court, on the application of a receiver, looks to the
              conduct of the party who makes the application and will
              usually refuse to interfere unless his conduct has been
              free from blame. He must come to the Court with clean
              hands and should not have disentitled himself to the
              equitable relief by laches, delay, acquiescence, etc."

held that it must be determined not only on the facts of a particular

case but also in the context of a social situation. A Division Bench of

this Court in <a href="/doc/380191/" id="a_123">Ravi Kumar v. Misha Vadhera &amp; Ors</a>. AIR 1995 Delhi

175 had held that the discretion to appoint a receiver is not arbitrary

or unregulated but has to be exercised cautiously, judicially and

according to the legal principles after consideration of the whole of the

circumstances of the case. A receiver cannot be appointed merely

because it is expedient or convenient to one of the parties to do so or

because it will do no harm. A bonafide possessor of property should

not be dispossessed pending suit unless there is substantial reason

such as, well founded fear that the property in question being

dissipated or that some other irreparable mischief may occur unless

the Court gives its protection. Before appointing a receiver the matter

should be considered judicially in all aspects including prima facie

case that is either a good title to the property or special equity in his

favor requiring immediate dispossession of the defendant or that the

property in the hands of the defendant is in the danger of being

wasted.

that there was no logic behind such a change as appointment of a

receiver on a running business is a serious matter. The apex Court

held that High Court erred in appointment of a receiver as the retail

liquor trade has its own intricate parameters and is a tricky trade and

could not be entrusted to a third party.

that the respondent has not paid the amount despite agreeing to do so

impression which one gets is that no amount had been paid by the

respondent under the three agreements executed between the

petitioner and the respondent. From the details of invoices whose

balance price is claimed, it is not apparent as to how much amount

had been received by the petitioner. The petitioner has very deftly

avoided to disclose as to how much amount had already been paid

under agreements. This information was material to infer the conduct

respondent contending that about US$ 13 lakhs has already been

paid, it was admitted by the petitioner that it had received the said

amount. The details of the amount received and its appropriation was,

however, not given. The justification given by the petitioner for non

disclosure of the amounts received by the petitioner in the petitions is

that they related to other bills. Thereafter, petitioner filed details of the

amounts adjusted, however, again the petitioner has not disclosed

about the security deposit of US $ 1.75 lakh which was given by the

respondent. In case the petitioner is entitled for the amounts as

claimed and the respondent has paid a security deposit of US$ 1.75

lakh, the petitioner ought to have disclosed as to how much amounts

the petitioner would be entitled for from the security deposit and after

adjusting the amount of the security deposit, what would be the

balance amount due from the respondent.           Another relevant fact is

that on behalf of respondent, Dr.J.K. Jain had agreed to the

conditions and the payment schedule which was to be put in effect

from January 2002 onwards and the disagreement, as per letter dated

19th September, 2001 was limited to the period from September 2001

to the year 2002. The petitioner wanted that the respondent should

pay US$ 53000 per month and US$ 100,000 from January, 2002 and

the respondent was not agreeable for the same. It is not that the

respondent did not pay any amount.           Perusal of the statement of

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 payments made by the respondent reveals that the payments were

made from September, 2001 till 9th July, 2002. In most of the months

payments were made on more than one occasion except in April and

May, 2002. After July, 2002 no payments have been made and the

petitioner also terminated all the agreements with the respondent. The

petitioner has also not disclosed whether the petitioner is liable to pay

interest to the respondent on the security deposit.

given under <a href="/doc/1883142/" id="a_127">Section 434</a> of the Companies Act, the amounts claimed

in the petitions and the amounts claimed before the arbitrator are also

different. The explanation given is that the difference in the amounts

is on account of the amounts becoming due at different points of time

and on account crystallizing of other amounts in the meantime to

which the petitioner became entitled. The amounts claimed include

the penal interest and the damages. Merely on the basis of the alleged

agreements between the parties and the pleas raised by the petitioner,

the amounts which the petitioner is entitled for cannot be decided

conclusively. From the consideration of the pleas of the respondent it

is apparent that some of the amounts as claimed by the petitioner

may not be due to him. What exact balance amount the petitioner is

entitled to in respect of three agreements is to be decided by the

Learned arbitrators. Exact liability of the respondent in the facts and

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 circumstances is a substantive issue which is to be decided in the

Arbitration proceedings. The respondent has also taken the plea that

the petitioner failed to deliver the commercial acceptable quality of

service as had been promised under the agreements. The respondent

has also filed a counter claim which is also pending adjudication

before the Learned Arbitrators.

<p id="p_94">

securing the alleged amount in dispute, the power under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_128">section 9</a>

should not be exercised to enable the petitioner to recover the sums

on account of damages in advance of the hearing even if a part of the

liability is undisputed and monetary award for some amount may be

made. The learned senior counsel, Mr.Bhatt has relied on, The Law

and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England, Second Edition by

Sir Michael J.Mustill and Stewart C.Boyd regarding securing the sum

in dispute. It has been held that the expression `Amount in disputeâ€Ÿ is

not equivalent to the claim in arbitration as the expression ` amount

in disputeâ€Ÿ has a totally different connotation. Relevant para (iv)

regarding securing the sum in dispute at page 332 is as under:-

              otherwise secured. The forms of security most likely to be
              ordered are the provision of a bank guarantee or the
              payment of the fund into a bank account in the joint
              names of the parties or their advisers. It is probable that

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
               the Court alone, and not the arbitrator, has power to
              make such an order.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                     It will be noted that this power does not enable a

              of the hearing, even if liability is undisputed and it is clear
              that some monetary award will be made. The power exists
              only where an identified fund is in dispute-as where, for
              example, it is alleged that the respondent is trustee for
              the claimant in respect of a specific sum of money."

<p id="p_96">48.    This also cannot be disputed by the petitioner that a notice

under <a href="/doc/1883142/" id="a_129">Section 434</a> of the Companies Act was given on 7th June, 2004

calling upon the respondent to pay US $ 213,182.30 under IS

debtor company does not pay the amount within the stipulated time

that it is unable to pay its debits unless company is able to show

some bonafide disputes. No proceedings have been initiated against

the respondent for its winding up. In the circumstances it would be

unreasonable to draw any inference prima facie that the respondent

company is unable to pay its debts or the defense raised by the

respondent is such that it can be ignored           and does not require

consideration. The respondent has also filed a counter claim and the

plea of the petitioner is that the counter claim is not sustainable.

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 However, prima facie nothing has been shown that the counter claim

of the respondent is not sustainable or that the entire claim of the

petitioner prima facie has excellent chance of succeeding despite

counter claim of         the respondent.   Applying the principles for

appointment of receiver as enunciated by this Court also known as

â€žPanch Sadacharâ€Ÿ it is apparent that the Court does not act on

possible danger only. Rather the danger must be great and imminent

demanding immediate relief. The petitioner has alleged the case of

imminent danger mainly on account of respondent not paying the

amounts as had been agreed, non-payment of the statutory dues,

dues of other creditors and non-payment of arbitration fees and

expenses. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner, Mr.Jain had

laid great emphasis on the fact that the arbitration fees was not paid

and the petitioner is unable to pay its due to other creditors and has

not been able to meet its statutory demands. According to the

respondent its TDS liability as on 20th December, 2004 was

Rs.16,07,887/- as per Income Tax Department demand note. Later

this demand had been met and the liability was cleared. The

respondent has also produced the payment challans to show that the

payments were made by the respondent. It is also contended that

whatever is left unpaid could be paid before 30th September, 2005.

According to the respondent after adjusting the amount which is liable

to be refunded, its liability is only Rs.8,21,224/-.   The plea of the

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 respondent that since all the three arbitration are between the same

parties and therefore, in order to minimize the expenses they be held

at one place and on that ground not paying the arbitration fee in the

first instance, cannot be termed malafide or such an act which will

entail appointment of a receiver of running business of the

respondent. In any case it is contended that the part of the expenses

have since been paid. Therefore on this ground the petitioner shall not

be entitled for appointment of a receiver of the business of the

respondent. The pleas as raised by the petitioner do not show such

damage or loss to him which will entail appointment of receiver. It is

stated that respondent is a widely held public listed company with

over 10000 shareholders, listed in 7 stock exchanges including the

National and Bombay Stock Exchanges and it has over 150 employees

and a dealer network of over 1000 entrepreneurs. It is also stated that

its sales are over 44 crores whereas the current liabilities of the

company are merely 9 crores and the company had declared operating

profits as on 31st March, 2005 of 1.26 crore and holds investments of

around 3.6 crore. The market capitalization of the respondent

company is alleged to be Rs.32.35 crores as on 5th August, 2005. The

respondent also disclosed its networth at Rs.36.40 crores as on 31st

March, 2007 and its assets as per the audited balance sheet of

Rs.63.72 crores on the said date. The respondent also disclosed that it

is listed on National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                             Page 45 of 53</span>

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 and five other stock exchanges in India and its market capitalization

as on 9th October, 2007 was Rs.30.28 crores. The respondent also

disclosed its profit for financial year ended on 2006-07 as Rs. 2.61

crores before tax and net profit of Rs.2.1 crores. In Rajeshwar Nath

Gupta (supra) the Court had held that it is only if more than prima

facie case is made out, then in exceptional circumstances the Court

will be justified in appointing a receiver. The business of the

respondent is a running business is apparent from these facts as

detailed hereinabove. It has been held that a Court should not appoint

a receiver on the ground that it will not do any harm. It has also been

held that an order appointing a receiver is not to be made when it has

an effect of depriving a defendant of â€žde factoâ€Ÿ possession. From the

facts alleged by the petitioner it cannot be inferred that the properties

in the hands of the respondent is in danger of being wasted,

dissipated or frittered away. The properties of the respondent are also

not the subject matter of arbitration. In the circumstances for the

foregoing reasons there are no such facts and pleas disclosed by the

petitioner which will entitle him for appointment of a receiver of the

running business of the respondent. Therefore the prayer of the

petitioner to appoint a Court receiver in respect of all the properties,

moveable and immoveable of the respondent in New Delhi or

elsewhere in India is declined.

deposit with the Courts all such sums received by him from its

business and attachment of all the amounts. The petitioner has

claimed different amounts, in notices, in petitions before this Court

and in Arbitration proceedings which are pending. The amounts

claimed by the petitioner are yet to be adjudicated. Though the

respondent in September, 2001 had admitted a part of the amount to

be paid in installment, but later on even those amounts have been

denied. Rather a counter claim for the substantial amount has been

filed. The apprehension of the petitioner is only that the respondent

shall dispose of its properties. However, no instances have been given

where the immovable properties or substantial movable properties

have been disposed of or transferred by the respondent in order to

defeat the alleged amounts which the petitioner may be entitled to

recover. Merely on account of an arbitration clause between the

parties and merely because the respondent refused to pay the

arbitration fees and expenses in the first instance, as the respondent

wanted that all the arbitration proceedings be conducted at one place

in order to minimize the expenses, it cannot be inferred that the

respondent is unable to pay its debts and is striving to dispose of its

properties. Before the principles of Rule 5 of order 38 of the Code of

Civil Procedure can be invoked it must inter alia, be shown by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                             Page 47 of 53</span>

 petitioner that respondent has acted or is about to act with intent to

obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed

against him. The Court must be satisfied that all the ingredients of the

rule exist. Mere fact that no harm would be caused to defendant or

that defendant would not be prejudiced by such an order could be no

ground to pass order under Order 38 Rule 5 of the Code for

attachment before judgment. It must be shown by the petitioner that

the respondent is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his

property or is about to remove the whole or any part of his property

from the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. It is only on the

satisfaction of all these conditions that the petitioner can be said to be

entitled to an order of attachment before judgment in terms of Order

XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code. From the allegations made by the

petitioner it cannot be inferred that the respondent is trying to dispose

of its properties and is unable to pay the alleged amounts due from

him or that the plea raised by the respondent are not bona fide. Any

disposal of the moveable properties in the usual course of business

cannot be termed as defrauding the petitioner and other creditors. The

plea of the petitioner that the three agreements are similar and are

between the same parties and in the circumstances Arbitration

proceedings be conducted at one place, cannot be termed ex-facie not

bonafide or such a plea that on account of it petitioner should be

granted attachment of the properties of the respondent on the

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 principles of Order 38 rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The other

pleas raised by the petitioner are also not sufficient to grant

attachment to the petitioner in the facts and circumstances. In the

circumstances, it will not be appropriate to attach the properties of

the respondent on the principles of Order 38 Rule 5 of the Code of

Civil Procedure nor the petitioner is entitled for a direction to the

respondent to deposit with the Court all such sums which are received

by the respondent from the business. Consequently the prayer of the

petitioner to attach the properties of the respondent is declined.



</p><p id="p_99">50.    It has already been held that the petitioner is not entitled for

appointment of receiver of the business and properties of the

respondent nor for attachment of its properties. It has been held that

for appointment of receiver something more than the prima facie case

is required and there should have been substantive reasons as well as

well-founded fear that the properties are being dissipated or some

other irreparable mischief may occur. Nevertheless, it cannot be held

that there is no case in favor of the petitioner and the petitioner does

not require any protection. This cannot be disputed that on behalf of

respondent, Dr.J.K. Jain had agreed to the conditions and the

payment schedule which was to be put in effect from January 2002

onwards and the disagreement, as per letter dated 19th September,

2001 was limited to the period from September 2001 to the new year.

 The petitioner wanted that the respondent should pay US$ 53000 per

month and US$ 100,000 from January, 2002 and the respondent was

not agreeable for the same. It is not that the respondent did not pay

any amount.        Perusal of the statement of payments made by the

respondent reveals that the payments were made from September,

2001 till 9th July, 2002. In most of the months payments were made

on more than one occasions except in April and May, 2002. After July,

2002 no payments have been made and the petitioner also terminated

all the agreements with the respondent. In these circumstances it was

contended     by     communication        dated   9th     July,    2002   that    the

respondent is clearing the dues regularly and that the respondent has

been able to implement its decisions of going digital.



</p><p id="p_100">51.    Learned senior counsel for the respondent has painstakingly

compared Annexure P with the petition and the Annexure A to the

affidavit dated 2nd January, 2008 filed by the respondent and the

discrepancies      between     the      two.   However,     despite   the      alleged

discrepancies between the two statements, it cannot be denied that as

per the payment statement filed by the respondent along with the

affidavit dated 11th December, 2007, the last payment was made on

9th   July,   2002    of   Rs.3,00,930/-        and   a    total   sum    of    about

Rs.6,25,83,092.47 has been paid by the respondent to the petitioner.

In the circumstances, it is apparent that after the determination of the

OMP No. 182/2005, 183/2005 &amp; 184/2005
 agreements by communication dated 17th July, 2002 no payments

have been made by the respondent though till July 2002 the

payments were made by the respondent which may not be in

accordance with the representations made on behalf of the respondent

in September, 2001. In the circumstances, it cannot be held that there

is no case in favor of the petitioner. The petitioner also has grievance

about non-payment of his dues. The petitioner is also entitled for

some protection in the present facts and circumstances and for the

reasons above noted. This is also noticed from the various documents

filed on record that the respondent has a running business. By an ex

parte interim order dated 23rd May, 2005, the respondent was

restrained from selling, alienating or parting with the possession of

movable     as    well   as    immovable   properties   belonging     to    the

respondents. Since the respondent has a running business, it will not

be appropriate to continue the order of restrain against the movable

properties of the respondent in the present facts and circumstances

and for the above noted reasons. Learned counsel for the petitioner

has also made a grievance about the fact that on the appointment of

the Local Commissioner at the first instance he was not allowed to

prepare the inventories. From the record of the petitions it is apparent

that there are no details of the immovable properties of the

respondent. In case the respondent does not make available the

details of his immovable properties and some or any of the properties

 are disposed of by the respondent, it may cause irreparable loss to the

petitioner as amounts admittedly are due to the petitioner and after

sale or transfer of properties, the petitioner may not be able to recover

the amounts awarded to him. In the circumstances, considering the

prima face case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss, it will be

just and appropriate to direct the respondent to give complete details

of its immovable properties and to restrain the respondents from

selling, alienating or encumbering his immovable properties without

the prior permission of the court or of the learned Arbitrators before

whom the arbitration proceedings in respect of the three agreements

are pending. However, the order regarding the restrain from selling,

alienating or parting with the possession of the movable properties of

the respondent is vacated as the respondent is carrying on its

business and such a restrain may hamper its business activities

which will be detrimental to the interest of the respondent and in a

way be also detrimental to the interest of the petitioner who has

allegedly to recover substantial amounts from the respondent

according to his own allegations.

immovable properties to the petitioner within four weeks and is also

restrained from selling, alienating or encumbering its immovable

properties without the prior permission of this court or the learned

Arbitrators before whom the Arbitration proceedings are pending

pertaining to three agreements.         The order dated 23rd May, 2005

regarding restrain from selling, alienating or parting with possession

with the movable properties of the respondent is, however, vacated.

The respondent shall be entitled to deal with his moveable properties

course of his business. With these directions the ex-parte order dated
