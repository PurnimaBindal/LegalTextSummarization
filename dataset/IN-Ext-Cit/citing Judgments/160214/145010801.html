Ahmedabad belonged to one Chunilal Chhaganlal Bhatt who was
predecessor in title of the petitioners and after his demise, the
said lands were inherited by his legal heirs.

<p id="p_6">[3.3] That, the aforesaid land of survey nos.217 and 448 was
acquired by respondent No.2 Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
(For short &quot;AMC&quot;) by passing resolution no.63 of 1957 dated
20.11.1957. Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_1">section 4</a> of the Land Acquisition

title of the petitioners challenged the acquisition proceedings by
filing writ petition being Special Civil Application No.1014/1964

<p id="p_7">[3.4] It appears that during the pendency of the aforesaid
petition, the AMC declared its intention to frame the Town

sanctioned Draft Town Planning Scheme, the land admeasuring
18870 sq. mtrs. of Survey No.217 was allotted Original Plot No.20

allotted to appropriate authority for Post and Telegraph and
Slum Clearance. The TPO issued notice on 01.09.1975 under
Rules 3 and 4 of the Bombay Town Planning Rules and on
16.09.1975, objections/suggestions of the landowners were
heard. The Town Planning Committee of AMC passed a resolution
dated 30.08.1977 to change the purpose of use of 4000 sq. yards
of Final Plot No. 64/4 for telephone exchange and staff quarters
with a condition to develop the same in three years. Entry

TPO by letter dated 07.02.1987 informed that since final TP

State Government. The State Government by notification dated
12.01.1993 sanctioned the varied TP Scheme.

Scheme, F.P. No.64/4, 7289 sq. mtrs is carved out and allotted to
appropriate authority for public purpose of Post and Telegraph
and Slum Clearance housing. It also appears that the Chief Post
Master General, Gujarat by communication dated 28.07.1994
informed the authority that it was not possible for the
department          to    purchase    the      lands      for    construction             of
departmental buildings due to limited funds. It appears that the
Gujarat    Slum          Clearance   Board          by   communication             dated
05.07.1976 has made it clear that it was not possible to

20(2) of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act,
1976 (For short &quot;the Act 1976&quot;) was served by the landowners to
all the authorities with regard to their stand on non use of land
of plot no. 64/4. BSNL as well as postal department also
intimated to the father of the petitioners that there is no

Special Civil Application No.6537/2012 with a prayer to restrain
AMC from disturbing the possession and for declaration about
the reservation having lapsed of the said land for Final Plot

authority should have directed to dereserve the plot/land. He
would submit that the Authority is acting contrary to various

communications and decisions passed by the respondent No.2
pursuant to the orders passed by this Court. He would submit
that father of the petitioner Nos.1 and 2 had made
representation as regards the same land which was considered as
per the orders passed by this Court way back in the year 2014.
The decision of the representation which was decided in the year
2014 was never challenged by the father of the petitioner Nos.1
and 2, however made representations one after another which
were also rejected. He would submit that the aforesaid petition
was filed mainly on the ground that the Authorities for which
plots were reserved and the T.P. Scheme which was sanctioned
on 12.01.1993 did not use the plots for the purpose for which it
was reserved. He would submit that as laid down by catena of
decisions, once a land becomes part of the T.P. Scheme and it
vests with the Authority free from all encumbrances. He would
further submit that even the Authority for which it was reserved
does not want to utilize the same and therefore, such land can be
used for any other public purposes. He would submit that after
rejection of the representation in the year 2014, the possession
of the property / plot has already been taken over by the
respondent No.2 in the year 2017. He has also taken us through
the reasoning part of the impugned CAV judgment. He would
submit that the learned Single Judge has relied upon several
decisions in detail and even reproduced in the impugned
judgment. He, therefore, would submit that the present appeal
be dismissed.

as well as Slum Clearance Board but that was reserved in the year
1993. But, subsequently, the same was not utilized for the said

made at the instance of the father of the petitioner Nos.1 and 2
was considered way back in the year 2014 and was rejected,

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       &quot;29. Having heard the learned advocates for the respective
       parties and having gone through the materials on record, it
       emerges that the land in question belonging to the father of
       the petitioners was sought to be acquired in the year 1957
       under the land acquisition Act by initiating land acquisition
       proceedings for the purpose of slum clearance housing board

 and road. However, thereafter, TP Scheme was proposed by
 the AMC in the year 1966. At that point of time when the
 State Government sanctioned the Draft Town Planning
 Scheme in the year 1966, there was no question of any
 reservation of the land for the purpose of slum clearance and
 housing board and road as the land acquisition proceedings
 were already initiated which were under challenge before this
 Court. When this Court quashed and set aside the land
 acquisition proceedings in the year 1969 by allowing Special
 Civil Application N.1014/1964, AMC thought it fit to vary the
 Town Planning Scheme so as to include the land which was
 proposed to be acquired under reservation for public purpose
 and accordingly Final Plot no. 64 was divided into four parts
 being F.P. Nos. 64/1, 64/2 and 64/3 which were allotted to
 the joint land owners and Final Plot No. 64/4 was carved out
 admeasuring 7316 sq. mtrs as reserved plot for public
 purpose.
</blockquote><p id="p_40"> 30. It also emerges from the record that the State
 Government sanctioned the varied Draft TP scheme by
 notification dated 31.3.1975 published in the gazette on
 10.4.1975. Thus the varied Draft TP Scheme was sanctioned
 prior to coming into force of the Act, 1976. In such
 circumstances, the contention raised on behalf of the
 petitioners that there is a deduction of more than 50% of the
 land is not tenable, as such land was reserved for public
 purpose for post and telegraph department and slum
 clearance housing at the relevant time. It is well settled legal
 position and it is a trite law with regard to the legality and
 effect of sanctioned Town Planning Scheme under the
 Bombay Town Planning Act as well as Gujarat Town Planning
 Act and this Court as well as Supreme Court has time and
 again held that once the Draft Scheme is sanctioned by the
 State Government it partakes the character of statute.
 Following decisions of this Court as well as Supreme Court
 are referred to for such settled legal position :

        with <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_18">section 67</a> of the Act, 1976 and once the

        his conduct has waived his right to equitable remedy
        as it would operate as estoppel against him with
        respect to asserting a right over a portion of the
        acquired land in a situation where the Scheme in
        question has attained finality as a result of the

        the land in question would vest in the authority
        after the draft scheme has been approved by the
        State Government. It was held that doctrine of
        proportionality requires that the balance has to be
        stuck between the individual claim and the right of
        the society and accordingly when the land is
        reserved for public purpose, the petitioner cannot
        claim any compensation from the respondent
        authority.

        that the petitioners have no locus to raise the
        objection to purchase the land after sanctioning of
        the Town Planning Scheme. Admittedly, in facts of
        the case, father of the petitioners purchased the
        land after the sanctioning of the Town Planning

 Rules,1976 showing redistribution and valuation statement
 available on record produced along with the affidavit in reply
 filed on behalf of the respondent corporation and it is clear
 that the petitioners have been allotted land in the varied final
 town planning scheme no.24(Manipur-Distribution-varied)
 and land admeasuring 7289 sq. mtrs of Final Plot No. 64/4 is
 provided for post and telegraph and slum clearance housing.
 The scheme has thus become final and therefore, no
 interference can be made as the same has become part of the
 statute. More particularly, when in the earlier round of
 litigation, this Court has not entertained the petition on
 merits by directing the petitioners to approach the
 respondent authorities to make representations which
 ultimately were rejected in view of the sanctioned Final TP
 scheme by the State Government. The prayers made by the
 petitioners for quashing and setting aside the TP Scheme so
 far as it relates to Plot No. 64/4, cannot be accepted in view
 of the fact emerging from the was sanctioned by the State
 Government in the year 1993 and thereafter, the predecessor
 of the petitioners have already been allotted Final Plot No.
 64/1, 64/2 and 64/3 which have never been objected by them.
 In such circumstances, the petitioners cannot continue to
 possess the land of Final Plot No. 64/4 which is earmarked as
 reserved plot for public purpose in the varied TP Scheme
 which is already sanctioned. In such circumstances, as held by
 this Court as well as Supreme Court in the following
 decisions, no relief can be granted to the petitioners by
 setting aside the sanctioned Final Scheme only qua final plot

        admeasuring 7356 sq. mtrs of Final Plot No. 64/4 is
        reserved for post and telegraph and slum clearance
        housing, then it cannot be said that land in question
        is not utilised for the said purpose and can be
        restored or for that purpose any compensation is

</p><p id="p_48"> 32. With regard to the contention raised by the petitioners of
 deduction of land more than 50% is concerned, in the facts of
 the case, the petitioners and the predecessor in title were
 admeasuring 14591 sq. mtrs which was sought to vary by the
 Varied Town Planning Scheme which is already sanctioned
 and out of that plot no. 64, four plots were partitioned and
 plot no. 64/4 admeasuring 7316 sq. mtrs was reserved for
 post and telegraph and slum clearance. The entire exercise
 was completed and the varied town planning scheme was
 sanctioned way back on 31.3.1975 by the State Government

 question was sought to be taken, it was resisted by the
 original owners in the year 2008 and thereafter by the father

 the representation made by them, the petitioners continued

 ultimately taken over by the Municipal Corporation in the

 petitioners cannot be granted any benefit of either
 compensation or restoration of land in question vis-a-vis the
 use of land to be made for the public purpose by the
 respondent corporation. It is also not in dispute that the land
 has continued to be vested for the public purpose as per
 Form-F which is part of the sanctioned varied TP Scheme no.
