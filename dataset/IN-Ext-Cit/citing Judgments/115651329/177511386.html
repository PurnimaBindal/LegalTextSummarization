metes and bounds of <a href="/doc/91933/" id="a_8">Section 320</a> Code of Criminal Procedure
Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude
ought to be exercised carefully in the context of quashing
criminal proceedings, bearing in mind: (i) Nature and effect of
the offence on the conscious of the society; (ii) Seriousness of
the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise
between the Accused and the victim; &amp; (iv) Conduct of the
Accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of the
purported offence and/or other relevant considerations.
Having appraised the afore-stated para-meters and weighing
upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of the two appeals
before us, we are inclined to invoke powers Under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_9">Article 142</a>
and quash the criminal proceedings and consequently set
aside the conviction in both the appeals. We say so for the
reasons that:
</p><p id="p_13">  Firstly, the occurrence(s) involved in these appeals can be
  categorized as purely personal or having overtones of
  criminal proceedings of private nature;
  Secondly, the nature of injuries incurred, for which
  the Appellants have been convicted, do not appear
  to exhibit their mental depravity or commission of
  an offence of such a serious nature that quashing of
  which would override public interest;
  Thirdly, given the nature of the offence and injuries, it is
  immaterial that the trial against the Appellants had been
  concluded or their appeal(s) against conviction stand
  dismissed;
</p><p id="p_14">  Fourthly, the parties on their own volition, without
  any    coercion      or      compulsion,           willingly    and
  voluntarily have buried their differences and wish
  to accord a quietus to their dispute(s);
  Fifthly, the occurrence(s) in both the cases took place
  way back in the years 2000 and 1995, respectively. There
  is nothing on record to evince that either before or after
  the purported compromise, any untoward incident
  transpired between the parties;
</p><p id="p_15">  Sixthly, since the Appellants and the complainant(s)
  are residents of the same village(s) and/or work in
  close vicinity, the quashing of criminal proceedings
  will   advance     peace,       harmony,          and     fellowship

      amongst the parties who have decided to forget
      and forgive any ill-will and have no vengeance
      against each other; and
      Seventhly, the cause of administration of criminal
      justice    system     would        remain        un-effected   on
      acceptance of the amicable settlement between the

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          &quot;LEGAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE IN REGARD TO AN
    APPLICATION SEEKING DISCHARGE
    This is an area covered by a large body of case law. We refer
    to a recent judgment which has referred to the earlier
    decisions, viz., <a href="/doc/1938674/" id="a_10">P. Vijayan v. State of Kerala and Anr</a>. (2010) 2
    SCC 398 and discern the following principles:
      i. If two views are possible and one of them gives rise to
      suspicion only as distinguished from grave suspicion, the
      Trial Judge would be empowered to discharge the
      Accused.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      ii. The Trial Judge is not a mere Post Office to frame the
      charge at the instance of the prosecution.
      iii. The Judge has merely to sift the evidence in order to
      find out whether or not there is sufficient ground for
      proceeding. Evidence would consist of the statements
      recorded by the Police or the documents produced before
      the Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      iv. If the evidence, which the Prosecutor proposes to
      adduce to prove the guilt of the Accused, even if fully
      accepted before it is challenged in cross examination or
      rebutted by the defence evidence, if any, &quot;cannot show
      that the Accused committed offence, then, there will be
      no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial&quot;.
      v. It is open to the Accused to explain away the materials
      giving rise to the grave suspicion.

      vi. The court has to consider the broad probabilities, the
      total effect of the evidence and the documents produced
      before the court, any basic infirmities appearing in the
      case and so on. This, however, would not entitle the court
      to make a roving inquiry into the pros and cons.
      vii. At the time of framing of the charges, the probative
      value of the material on record cannot be gone into, and
      the material brought on record by the prosecution, has to
      be accepted as true.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      viii. There must exist some materials for entertaining the
      strong suspicion which can form the basis for drawing up
      a charge and refusing to discharge the Accused.
    The defence of the Accused is not to be looked into at the
    stage when the Accused seeks to be discharged Under <a href="/doc/1056165/" id="a_11">Section
    227</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (<a href="/doc/262986/" id="a_12">See State of J &amp; K v.

    the Code of Criminal Procedure, is to be understood as the
    documents   and    the    articles,     if   any,    produced    by   the
    prosecution. The Code does not give any right to the Accused
    to produce any document at the stage of framing of the
    charge. At the stage of framing of the charge, the submission
    of the Accused is to be confined to the material produced by
    the Police (<a href="/doc/7496/" id="a_14">See State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi</a> MANU/

  such   intention      may      also    be     deduced        from     other
  circumstances,      and     may       even,      in   some    cases,     be
  ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds.
  The Section makes a distinction between an act of the
  Accused and its result, if any. Such an act may not be
  attended by any result so far as the person
  assaulted is concerned, but still there may be cases
  in which the culprit would be liable under this
  section. It is not necessary that the injury actually
  caused to the victim of the assault should be sufficient
  under ordinary circumstances to cause the death of the
  person assaulted. What the Court has to see is
  whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done
  with   the    intention          or    knowledge             and    under
  circumstances mentioned in this section. An attempt
  in order to be criminal need not be the penultimate act. It
  is sufficient in law, if there is present an intent coupled
  with some overt act in execution thereof.
This position in law was followed by subsequent benches of
this Court. <a href="/doc/440197/" id="a_17">In State of M.P. v. Saleem</a> (2005) 5 SCC 554, this
Court held thus:
</p><p id="p_19">  13. It is sufficient to justify a conviction Under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_18">Section
  307</a> if there is present an intent coupled with some overt
  act in execution thereof. It is not essential that bodily
  injury capable of causing death should have been
  inflicted. The Section makes a distinction between
  the act of the Accused and its result, if any. The
  court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result,
  was done with the intention or knowledge and under
  circumstances mentioned in the section. Therefore, an
  Accused charged Under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_19">Section 307</a> Indian Penal Code
  cannot be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted
  on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt.
<a href="/doc/115651329/" id="a_20">In Jage Ram v. State of Haryana</a> (2015) 11 SCC 366, this
Court held that to establish the commission of an offence

      Accused. The burden is on the prosecution that the
      Accused had attempted to commit the murder of the
      prosecution    witness.      Whether        the     Accused       person
      intended to commit murder of another person would
      depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
      To justify a conviction Under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_23">Section 307</a> Indian Penal
      Code, it is not essential that fatal injury capable of
      causing death should have been caused. Although the
      nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in
      coming to a finding as to the intention of the Accused,
      such   intention    may      also    be     adduced        from     other
      circumstances. The intention of the Accused is to be
      gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the
      weapon used, words used by the Accused at the time of
      the incident, motive of the Accused, parts of the body
      where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and
      severity of the blows given, etc.
    The above judgments of this Court lead us to the conclusion
    that proof of grievous or life-threatening hurt is not a sine qua
    non for the offence Under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_24">Section 307</a> of the Penal Code. The
    intention of the Accused can be ascertained from the actual
    injury, if any, as well as from surrounding circumstances.
    Among other things, the nature of the weapon used and the
    severity of the blows inflicted can be considered to infer intent.

                                             death should have been caused. Although the nature
                                             of injury actually caused may be of assistance in
                                             coming to a finding as to the intention of the
                                             accused, such intention may also be adduced from
                                             other circumstances. The intention of the accused is
                                             to be gathered from the circumstances like the
                                             nature of the weapon used, words used by the
                                             accused at the time of the incident, motive of the
                                             accused, parts of the body where the injury was
                                             caused and the nature of injury and severity of the
                                             blows given etc.&quot;
