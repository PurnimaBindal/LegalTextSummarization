	Final Order No. 50002/2017





Per: B. Ravichandran:
</p>


<p id="p_4">      The appellant is aggrieved by the order dated 28.01.2011 of Commissioner (Appeals-II) Delhi.  The appellant is engaged in the manufacture of excisable goods  moulded plastic photo frame.  They were availing small scale exemption and were not registered with the Central Excise department.  Certain investigations were carried out in July 2009 in their various premises.  On completion of the investigation, proceedings were initiated to demand Central Excise duty from the appellant on the ground that they were not eligible for small scale exemption in respect of goods manufactured with brand name of another person.  Proceedings concluded with the original order confirming Central Excise duty liability of Rs.46,88,800/-.  Seized branded goods were also confiscated but released with an option to redeem the same on payment of fine.  Equal amount of penalty was imposed under <a href="/doc/92590795/" id="a_1">Section 11AC</a> of the Central Excise Act, 1944.  On appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals), vide the impugned order, upheld the original order.
</p>
      

<p id="p_5">2.	The dispute is with reference to use of brand name Archies Ld. Counsel for the appellant submitted that  they have applied for registration of brand name Archies.    During the material time, the said  brand name was not registered with another person and application of M/s Archies Greetings and Gift Limited was also pending with the authorities.  He submitted that during the investigation though the officers found photo frame with Archies brand name they have only sold 182 nos. of photo frames with such brand name.  He further submitted that it is clear from the invoices issued by the appellant that they have cleared photo frames mostly without any brand name or with their own brand name SMILE.  As such, denial of small scale exemption and confirmation of demand on their clearances during the  material period is legally not sustainable.
</p>


<p id="p_6">3.	Ld. AR strongly contested the submission of the appellant.  He drew out attention to the details collected during the search operation and follow up investigation by the Officers.  The inventory  made by the Officers indicated that there were 3,948 pieces of photo frames with Archies brand name.  Further, large quantity of packing material with the said brand name was also found.  The fact that the appellants were selling photo frames with Archies brand name has been categorically admitted by the Prop. of the appellant unit.  Ld. AR explained background of civil suit with reference to the dispute between s M/s Archies Greetings and Gifts Limited and the appellant to reiterate that the appellant have been using another persons brand name in clearing  the photo frames, as such the duty liability has been correctly confirmed.
</p>


<p id="p_7">4.	We have heard both the sides and perused the appeal records.  First of all, we note that, admittedly, the appellants did manufacture and clear photo frames with Archies brand name which does not belong to them.  When they applied for the registration of the said brand name, the Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai objected to the application as the brand name Archies is registered with another person.  The said  brand name was registered for various items.  The application filed  by M/s Archies Greetings and Gift Limited  for registration of the said brand for photo frame was also pending.  We also note that the Honble Delhi High Court vide order dated 14.07.2003 restrained the appellant from the use of brand name Archies.  However, by appellants own  admission they have manufactured and cleared photo frames with Archies  brand name after the said order.   Further, the seizure of large quantity of photo frames and packing materials during the search conducted by the Officers clearly reveal that the claim of the appellant that wherever they have cleared photo frames with brand name the same is mentioned in the invoice is not acceptable.  We find such assertion is neither supported by the document nor reliable in the face of the above facts.  We note that the Honble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/910213/" id="a_2">CCE, Trichy vs. Ruckmani Pakkwell Traders</a>  2004 (165) ELT 481 (SC) held that even if the goods are different so long as the brand name of some other company is used the benefit of notification would not be available..   <a href="/doc/292181/" id="a_3">In Meghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd. vs. CCE, U.P</a>.  2007 (210) ELT 161 (SC) the Supreme Court held that the burden is on the assessee to satisfy the adjudicating authority that there was no intention of indicating  a connection of goods of assessee with another person. We also note that the Honble Delhi High Court vide order dated  15.02.2012  the noted settlement arrived between the appellant and M/s Archies Greetings and Gift Limited and  disposed of the suit case.  As per the agreement, it is seen that the appellant was allowed to manufacture and market photo frames under the Trade Mark Garg Archij and the appellant undertook not to manufacture or sell any product using trade name Archies.
</p>


<p id="p_8">5.	Considering the above factual position  and findings recorded by the lower authorities, we note that the appellant did not support their plea in the appeal to the effect that they have not manufactured and cleared goods with the brand name of another person.  Overwhelming evidence as recorded by the lower authorities has not been rebutted effectively by the appellant.  As such, we find no reason to interfere with the findings of the lower authorities.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
