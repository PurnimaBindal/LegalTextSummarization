ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)
 

 
 


 

</p><p id="p_2">1.	Every
once in a rare while, field  of law throws up an issue  around which
reams and reams worth   pages of literature - judicial
pronouncements as also commentary of  learned authors - is
available, but  a decision that will fit your case perfectly eludes 
you. One such issue, which has generated  considerable public
interest  has arisen in this litigation.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">2.	
By this judgment, we propose to dispose of two writ petitions and
connected Civil Applications.  Special Civil Application No.12632 of
2011 has been filed by the  State seeking a writ  in the nature  of
quo warranto  or any other appropriate writ  or direction in the
matter of appointment of respondent No.1 as Lokayukta pursuant to the
impugned warrant dated 25.8.2011 issued by Her Excellency the
Governor of Gujarat.  Special Civil Application No.13499 of 2011 has
been filed by one Shri V.K.Saxena, President of the National Council
for Civil Liberties.  This petition is styled in the nature of public
 interest litigation.  The petitioner therein  also prays for a writ
of quo warranto or a writ in the  nature of quo warranto or any other
appropriate   order or direction  to quash and set aside the
appointment of Shri R.A.Mehta, Retired Judge of the Gujarat High
Court as Lokayukta.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">2.1	Several
Civil Applications  have been filed seeking impleadment  of parties
in the petition of the State. At the outset, we have made it clear 
that we would not be  granting such requests to be joined as
additional respondents, but we assured the learned counsel for the 
applicants   that they would be  allowed to raise all  contentions
and such contentions will also be taken into account.   They had
accepted such a formula and accordingly, we have heard the counsel
for such applicants also in addition to the Counsel for the State,
Counsel for the private petitioner as well as the  counsel for the 
Secretary to the Chief Justice.  Respondent No.1  has, in tune with
his dignity, not participated  in these proceedings.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_5">3.		Facts
in brief may be noted  at the outset as stated in the writ petition
filed by the State.   As  noted, what is under challenge is the
appointment of Shri R.A.Mehta, Retired Judge of the Gujarat High
Court as Lokayukta made  by the Governor of Gujarat.  We would be
taking note of minute details of  the relevant events as emerging
from the documents  supplied to us by the State, Secretary to the
Hon'ble Chief Justice as well as presented before  us on behalf of
the Governor.  At this stage, suffice it to notice that the State has
four main objections to the manner in which Shri R.A.Mehta was
appointed as Lokayukta by the Governor by issuing notification  dated
25th August 2011. The said objections are :
</p> 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_6">That
	the consultation for selecting the name of a retired Judge  of the
	High Court was  still going on between the Hon'ble Chief Justice and
	the Hon'ble Chief Minister. When  such consultation was yet not
	over, it was not  open for the Governor to unilaterally make
	appointment of  the Lokayukta;
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_7">That
	the State may even, in a given case, reject the recommendation made
	by the Chief Justice;
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_8">That
	the procedure adopted by the Governor for initiation of consultation
	 and thereafter making appointment disregarding the rules of
	business was wholly irregular; and 
	
	 


	  

That
	in any event, the Governor cannot act without the aid and advice  of
	the Council of Ministers  which was done in the present case;
</p>	 



 

<p id="p_9">4.		To
appreciate  these objections, it would be  necessary to look minutely
at  the  events  leading to the issuance of impugned  notification
dated 25th August 2011.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_10">5.	In
the State of Gujarat, Legislature has enacted   the Gujarat Lokayukta
Act, 1986 (hereinafter to be referred to as 'the Act'). Section 3 of
the Act pertains to appointment of Lokayukta.  Previously, a retired 
Judge of the Gujarat High Court Shri S.M.Soni  was appointed as
Lokayukta. He relinquished the office on 24th November
2003. Since then the post of Lokayukta is lying vacant. From the file
supplied to us, we do not have  any information as to what steps, if
any, were taken to fill up the said post between 23rd 
November 2003 to  August 2006 when the Chief Minister of the State
wrote to the Chief Justice stating as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_11">"Hon.
</p><p id="p_12">Justice (Retired) Shri S.M.Soni relinquished the office of
Hon.Lokayukta on 24th November 2003 after. The question of
finding a successor of Shri Soni as Lokayukta, Gujarat State is
engaging the attention of the Government.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_13">xxxx
 


 


 


I
propose to send the name of Hon. Justice (Retired) Shri Kshitij 
R.Vyas for consideration of His Excellence the Governor of Gujarat
for appointment as Lokayukta, Gujarat State.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">I
shall be grateful, if you could kindly inform me whether you have 
any objection to the name of Hon.Justice (Retired) Shri Kshitij
R.Vyas  for appointment as Lokayukta, Gujarat State.  Incidentally,
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that as per the
provisions of section 3 of the Act the consultation in this regard 
is with the Chief Justice of the High Court and not with the High
Court of Gujarat."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_15">In
response to the said communication, the then Acting Chief Justice
Shri Y.R.Meena replied on 7th August 2006 stating as
under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_16">"I
have no objection in appointment  of Hon'ble Justice Kshitij R. Vyas,
Former Chief Justice,  Bombay High Court as Lokayukta, Gujarat
State."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_17">5.1		The
then Governor of Gujarat, however, had certain reservations   about 
appointment of Shri K.R.Vyas, Former Chief Justice of the Bombay High
Court as Lokayukta in view of the fact that he was  appointed as
Chairman of Human Rights Commission of the State of Maharashtra.  The
Governor, therefore, on February 6, 2009 conveyed to the State as
under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_18">"While
expert legal opinion in this regard is awaited, it has come to my
attention that Hon'ble Justice (Retired) Shri Kshitij R. Vyas  has
already been appointed as the Chairman of the  Human Rights 
Commission of the Maharashtra State and he has taken over the charge
of the post since long. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_19">In
view of this development, it appears  that the present proposal for
his appointment as Lokayukta, Gujarat can not now be processed
further particularly in light of the provision made under Sub-section
 3 of the section24 of the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_1">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, 1993 which
reads as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_20"><a href="/doc/1560876/" id="a_2">Section
24</a> (3)	On ceasing to hold office, a Chairperson or a 

 


			Member
 shall be ineligible for further employ-
</p> 


<p id="p_21">			ment
 under the Government of a State or
 


			under
 the Government of India.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_22">In
view of the above provision of law, it appears to me that Hon'ble 
Justice (Retired) Shri Kshitij R. Vyas is no longer available for
appointment as Lokayukta, Gujarat State since even after  his ceasing
to hold the office of the Chairman, Human Rights Commission of the
Maharashtra State, he is not eligible for further employment.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_23">It
is therefore  appropriate  that the present proposal is treated as
closed and the State Government is informed to make a fresh  proposal
in due compliance with the requirements laid down by law."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_24">5.2		Government
of Gujarat was, however,  of the opinion that the appointment of Shri
K.R.Vyas  as the Chairman,  Human Rights Commission would not make
him ineligible for appointment as Lokayukta.  A request was therefore
made to the Governor to reconsider the issue.  On behalf of the
Governor on 10th September 2009, in response to the
State's request for reconsideration of the previous decision, it was
conveyed as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_25">"I
have considered the Government's proposal for the appointment of
Hon'ble  Justice (Retd.) Shir Kshitij R. Vyas, former Chief Justice,
Mumbai High Court as the Lokayukta, Gujarat State.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_26">I
have also gone through the provisions of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act,
1986 and the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_3">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, 1993.  I have also got
the matter examined through several legal experts in the field.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_27">Based
on the feed back that I have received, I am of the view that while it
is true that Sub-section (ii) of Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta
Act, 1986 prescribes that "a person shall not be qualified  for
appointment as Lokayukta unless  he is or has been a Judge of a High
Court", in view  of sub-section (iii) of <a href="/doc/374793/" id="a_4">section 6</a> of the
Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 since Shri  Kshitij R.Vyas,
Hon'ble former Chief Justice of the Mumbai High Court has held office
of the Chairman of the  Human Rights Commission of the Maharashtra
State constituted  under the provisions of the  <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_5">Protection of Human
Rights Act</a>, 1993,  the Government's proposal for the appointment of
Shri Vyas  as the Lokayukta, Gujarat State cannot be agreed to."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_28">5.3		On
September 10, 2009,  on behalf of the Governor the Chief Minister was
requested to send a fresh proposal for appointment of Lokayukta 
after consultation with the Chief Justice of the State and the Leader
of Opposition.  It was stated thus:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_29">"I
have come to know that the post of Lokayukta has been lying vacant in
Gujarat since 25.11.2003.  Government's proposal for appointment  of
Shri Kshitij, R. Vys Hon'ble former Chief Justice of Mumbai High
Court and at present  Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of the
Maharashtra State cannot be agreed to in view of the clear cut
provisions of the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_6">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, 1993.  In this
context,  I would like you to send a fresh proposal of the Government
for appointment  of the Lokayukta after due consultation with the
Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court and the Leader of
Opposition in the State  Legislative Assembly as per the provisions
of Section 3(1) of the Gujarat Lokayukta At, 1986.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_30">An
early action in this regard would highly be appreciated as the post
has been lying vacant since long."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_31">5.4		After
the said communication, the Chief Minister, conveyed to the Chief
Justice  under his communication dated February 8, 2010 as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_32">"The
matter regarding appointment of Lokayukta was under consideration for
quite some time.  Government,  after completing the process of
consultation with the Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly and
the Hon'ble Chief Justice of the  Gujarat State,  had recommended the
name of Hon'ble  Justice (Retired) Shri Kshitij R. Vyas  for
appointment as Lokayukta, Gujarat State. However,  H.E. The Governor,
who is the appointing authority in the case of Lokayukta, has finally
disapproved  the proposal for appointment of Shri Kshitij R. Vyas as
Lokayukta, Gujarat State, in view of sub-section (iii) of <a href="/doc/374793/" id="a_7">section 6</a>
of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, since Shri Kshitij R.
Vyas has held the office of the Chairman of the Human Rights 
Commission of Maharashtra.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_33">The
question of filling up the vacant office of the Lokayukta, Gujarat 
State is now required to be considered afresh as per section 3 of the
Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986. I shall be grateful if you could kindly
suggest a panel of three Judge (retired) of the High Court of Gujarat
 for consideration for appointment as Lokayukta, Gujarat State.  On
receipt of these names, the formal procedure for appointment of
Lokayukta, Gujarat State as stipulated in section 3(1) of the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act, 1986, will be undertaken afresh."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_34">5.5		On
24th February 2010, the Chief Justice of the State, 
recommended  a panel of four names for appointment to the post of
Lokayukta.  He mentioned that such names are not shown on the  basis
of preference and any one of them  may be appointed.   He stated :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_35">"May
I draw your attention to the correspondence regarding appointment  to
the post of Lokayukta, which has been lying vacant since last few
years.  According to me,  the following persons are fit to be
appointed  to the post of Lokayukta in the State of Gujarat:
</p> 


 


 
	  

<p id="p_36">Mr.
</p><p id="p_37">	Justice Pravinsingh Motisinh Chauhan
	  

Mr.
</p><p id="p_38">	Justice Babulal Chandulal Patel
	  

Mr.
</p><p id="p_39">	Justice Ramesh Prabhudas Dholakia
	  

Mr.
</p><p id="p_40">	Justice Jayprakash Ramakant Vora.
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_41">I
	may mention that the aforesaid names are not shown  on the basis of
	preference and any one of them can be appointed."
</p>	 



 

 


 

<p id="p_42">5.6		On
2nd March 2010, the Chief Minister wrote to the Leader of
Opposition to participate in the process of consultation for
appointment of Lokayukta for which a meeting  would be held on 4th
March 2010. On 3rd March,  the Leader of Opposition wrote
back to the Chief Minister  objecting to the Chief Minister 
initiating the process of consultation.  He  was of the opinion that
such initiation was contrary to the express provisions of the Act. 
He, in short, declined to participate in any such consultative
process. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_43">5.7		The
meeting for consultation of the Leader of Opposition was conducted in
his absence. Minutes of the meeting held  on 22nd March
2010 were drawn. It was recorded that the Chief Minister found the
name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retired) J.R.Vora  as most suitable   
for appointment as Lokayukta in the State of Gujarat. It was also
noted that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_44">"Hon.
</p><p id="p_45">CM expressed the view that in the process of consultation,  the views
of Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Gujarat  High Court must be given
supremacy and with a solemn object to respect the names suggested by
Hon'ble  the Chief Justice, the Government should not restart the
process of consultation and should confine the question of  selection
to the four names suggested by Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the
Gujarat High Court."
</p> 


 


 

 


 

<p id="p_46">The
Chief Minister directed that the name of  Justice J.R.Vora  be placed
before the Council of Ministers to obtain approval.  The Council of
Ministers also approved the name, as is  apparent in the note dated
1.4.2010.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_47">5.8.	On
 3rd May 2010, the Governor wrote to the Chief Justice
indicating that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_48">"According
to the expert opinion, it has become clear that  the Chief Justice 
is the most suitable person to know about the suitability  of the
person to be appointed as the Lokayukta.  This  is  so in order to
maintain the independence of the judiciary and to avoid any
possibility  of a sitting or retired Judge depending on the
Executives for such an important  appointment.  Once the name is 
given by the Hon'ble Chief  Justice, it is binding to the Government
and the Council of Ministers has to forward  the same to the Governor
for appointment.  It has also been held that sending  a panel of four
names by the Chief Justice  in this case is not in accordance with
the law declared by the Apex Court as laid down in the judgment in
<a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_8">Kannadasan  v. Ajoy Khose</a> (2009) 7 SCC 1."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_49">	The
Governor consequently, requested the Chief Justice to recommend only
one suitable name for appointment of the Lokayukta.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_50">5.9		It
appears that the Governor of Gujarat,  however, had some reservation 
about the manner  in which the name of Shri J.R.Vora was approved. 
She, therefore,  sent a note dated 5.5.2010 to the Chief Minister 
indicating, inter alia,  that as per the decision of the Apex Court
in the case of <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_9">N.Kannaasan  v. Ajoy Khose</a> (2009) 7 SCC 1,
recommendation of panel of four persons by the Chief Justice would
not be in accordance with law.  She stated that she had taken  the
opinion of the learned Attorney General of India. She had accordingly
referred the matter back to the Chief Justice to re-examine the
matter and recommend only one name  for appointment    as Lokayukta. 
She further added  that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_51">"In
view of the above,  I am returning the present file.  It should be
submitted  to me formally for consideration once the State Government
receives  a formal proposal from the Hon'ble Chief  Justice, Gujarat
High Court."
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_52">5.10		In
response to the request  of the Governor to recommend only one name 
instead of a panel of names, the  Chief Justice conveyed to her on
31st December 2010 as under: 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_53">"It
has already been noticed that
the State Government have some reservation with regard to some of the
names recommended by me earlier for appointment to the  post of
Lokayukta. Hon'ble
Justice(Retd.) Shri J.R. Vora, whose name has been proposed for this
post, has already been appointed by me as Director, Gujarat State
Judicial Academy, in the interest of judiciary. Therefore, he need
not be considered for appointment to the post of Lokayukta, for the
present. I now recommend the name of Hon'ble Justice (Redt.) Shri
Suhrud Deoprasad Dave, for the appointment to the post of Lokayukta.
According to me, Hon'ble
Justice(Retd.) Shri Suhrud Deoparasad Dave would be suitable
for appointment to the post of Lokayukta, which carries more
responsibilities.
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_54">I
hope the matter will be sorted out shortly."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_55">	The
Governor, in turn,  under her communication  dated 6th
January 2011 to the Chief Minster requested to process the matter
expeditiously in connection with the recommendation of the Chief
Justice  recommending the name of Shir S.D.Dave.  It was stated that
the same may be done at the earliest  since keeping such an important
 post vacant any longer would not be in the interest of  good
governance.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_56">5.11		On
21.2.2011, the Chief Minister, addressed a letter   to the Chief
Justice, reiterating the State's request for consulting Shri J.R.Vora
on his willingness for being considered  for appointment as
Lokayukta.  It was stated thus:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_57">"In
view of the above, I would earnestly request you to consult
Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retired) J.R. Vora on his willingness or
otherwise for being considered for appointment as Lokayukta, Gujarat
State. In the event of Mr. J.R. Vora being willing to assume the
responsibility as Lokayukta, Gujarat State, you may kindly recommend
his name once again so that the delay in filling up the vacancy of
Lokayukta, Gujarat State could be avoided."
</p> 

		
 

<p id="p_58">He
was of the opinion that since the entire procedure for appointment of
 Shri J.R.Vora had already  been gone through, it will be in public
interest   that he joins the said post so that the entire process may
not have to be gone through afresh.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_59">5.12		Since
 Shri  J.R.Vora was already appointed as Director of the  Gujarat
State Judicial Academy the  Chief Justice on 22nd March
2011, wrote a letter to the Chief Minister stating that :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_60">"Taking
into consideration the fact that by that time Hon'ble Mr.
Justice(Retd.) J.R. Vora has already been appointed as Director,
Gujarat State Judicial Academy, in the interest of judiciary, by my
letter dated 29th December, 2010, I requested Her
Excellency not to consider the name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice(Retd.) J.R
Vora for appointment to the post of Lokayukta and to consider the
name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice(Retd.) S.D. Dave for appointment to the
said post which carries more responsibility. Similar information was
given to you by my letter dated 31st December 2010.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_61">From
the aforesaid letters it would be evident that name of  Hon'ble Mr.
Justice(Retd.) J.R. Vora was recalled by me for the reasons mentioned
in my letters dated 29th December 2010 and 31st
December, 2010. Thereafter no consultation has been made with regard
to name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice(Retd.) S.D. Dave for appointment to
the post of Lokayukta in light of Section 3(1) of the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act, 1896. There is also nothing on record to suggest that
the Leader of Opposition has also been consulted in the matter.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_62">This
apart, under the law the Chief Justice of a High Court may give his
option about any Sitting and Retired Honourable Judge of the High
Court for appointment to the post of Lokayukta, but it is not the
duty of a Chief Justice of a State to call for any consent for any of
the person, if selected for  appointment, which may be obtained by
the appropriate authority.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_63">In
view of the aforesaid developments, I again request you to consider
the name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice(Retd.) S.D. Dave for appointment to
the post of Lokayukta, Gujarat State and take up the matter with Her
Excellency the Governor of Gujarat State and the Opposition leader."

<p id="p_64">5.13		On
4th May 2011, the Chief Minister wrote to the Chief
Justice indicating that though the name of Shri S.D.Dave was
recommended by the Chief Justice, on being consulted, he informed
that he has already sent a fax to the Governor requesting  to recall
his  nomination due to personal circumstances. The Chief Minister,
once again, repeated the request for recommending  the name of Shri
J.R.Vora  stating that he had confirmed that Shri Vora  would resign 
from the post of Director of State Judicial Academy.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_65">5.14		On
7th June 2011, the Chief Justice  wrote to the Chief
Minister  stating that he had already mentioned in his earlier
correspondence that as Hon'ble Mr.Justice J.R.Vora has already been
appointed as Director of State Judicial Academy, in the interest of
judiciary, his name may not be considered for appointment  to the
post of Lokayukta.  He further stated that in view of the 
development that Shri S.D.Dave  would not like to be considered, he
had  considered Hon'ble Mr. Justice R.A.Mehta  suitable for
appointment  to the post.  In the said letter, the Chief Justice
stated as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_66">"By
the said letter dated 4th
May 2011, you have reiterated your earlier request to consider the
name of Hon'ble Mr. justice (Retd.) J.R.
</p><p id="p_67">Vora for this post. As regards nomination of Hon'ble Mr.
Justice(Retd.) J.R. Vora is concerned, I have already mentioned in my
earlier correspondence that as Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vora has already
been appointed as the Director, Gujarat State Judicial Academy, in
the interest of judiciary, his name may not be considered for
appointment to the post of Lokayukta.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_68">In
view of the present development that Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) S.D.
Dave would not like to be considered for appointment as Lokayukta, I
now consider Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) Ramesh Amritlal Mehta
suitable for appointment to this post. I accordingly, recommend the
name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) Ramesh Amritlal Mehta, for
appointment to the post of Lokayukta, Gujarat State, which carries
more responsibilities."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_69">	Simultaneously,
 on 7th June 2011, the Chief Justice also wrote to the 
Governor, stating  that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_70">"In

</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_71">5.15		On
7th June 2011, the Governor also wrote to the Chief
Minister  stating that she had received   a proposal from the Chief
Justice recommending the name of Shri R.A.Mehta  for appointment to
the post of Lokayukta.  She, therefore, requested  that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_72">"May
I request you to kindly get the matter processed expeditiously at the
Government level in accordance with the provisions of the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act, 1986? The same may be submitted to me formally for
consideration at the earliest possible."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_73">5.16		On
16th June 2011, the Chief Minister wrote to the Chief
Justice and raised certain concerns about the recommendation of Shri 
R.A.Mehta.  In this respect, he stated that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_74">"I
have perused the bio-data of Hon'ble Justice (Retired) R.A. Mehta. He
was born on 4th
may, 1936 and retired from Judgeship of the Gujarat High Court on 4th
May 1998. Thus, as on date he has crossed the age of 75 years.
Looking to the arduous nature of duties and responsibilities attached
with the post of Lokayukta, Gujarat
State, he may perhaps not be a suitable candidate for this job at
such an advanced age.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_75">The
other important aspect is that Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retired) R.A.
Mehta is associated with a few NGOs, <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_10">Social Act</a>ivist Groups and he
has also given services as a panelist for them. It is obvious that
because of his association with the NGOs, <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_11">Social Act</a>ivist Groups,
etc. he may be in a fixed frame of mind on certain issues relating to
the governance in the State. He has also shared platform with such
people as are known for their antagonism for the State Government. I
am enclosing copies of a few Newspaper clippings downloaded from the
websites which clearly indicate that Hon'ble Mr. Justice(retired)
R.A. Mehta, while being a panelist for such NGOs,  <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_12">Social Act</a>ivist
Groups, etc. has expressed views against the functioning of the
present Government in the State. You will appreciate that if such a
person having a specific biased perception for the Government in the
State is appointed as Lokayukta, he would not be able to perform his
duties with the amount of objectivity, judiciousness and impartiality
expected of the Lokayukta. It may therefore by necessary to have a
relook at the name proposed by you." 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_76">He
once again repeated the request for  clearing the name of Shri
J.R.Vora  in whose case, the whole consultation, etc.  as envisaged  
in the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986 had been gone through.  He,
therefore,  requested the Chief Justice  to reconsider the matter 
and recommend the name of Shri J.R.Vora for appointment as Lokayukta.
</p> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_77">5.17		On
2nd August 2011, the Chief Justice wrote to the Chief
Minister and stated that :
</p> 

	
 


<p id="p_78">"Kindly
refer to your D.O. Letter No. LKY.2010-2239-G, dated 16th
June 2011, whereby you have opined that Mr. Justice (Retd.) R.A.
Mehta would not be in a position to perform his duties with the
amount of objectivity, judiciousness and impartiality expected of the
Lokayukta. You have also reiterated the name of Mr. Justice (Retd.)
J.R.  Vora for appointment to the post of Lokayukta.
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_79">During
the last one and half months, I tried to gather the details about the
activities of Mr. Justice (Retd.) R.A. Mehta and I find that there is
no such activity, which makes him ineligible for appointment to the
post of Lokayukta. According to me, he is a man of high repute and
integrity and always maintained high reputation while he was in
Judiciary and still he is maintaining high standards in the Society.
Justice Mehta has never made any public statement, which is
detrimental to the Society, nor has he shown any aspiration to any
Government, whether State or Central. It cannot be said that he is
associated with one or the other NGO as there is nothing to suggest
that he is a member of an NGO or he is a social activist cannot be
treated as a qualification for his appointment to the   post of 
Lokayukta. On the contrary, it would show the ability of a person who
knows the ground reality of the society even at the age of 75, which
is prime requirement for the post.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_80">I
may refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/1398587/" id="a_13">Ashish Handa v. Chief Justice of High</a> Court of P &amp; H (1996) 3 SCC
145 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the executive is
expected to approach the Chief Justice for the purpose of appointment
to be made to such post and the name suggested by the Chief Justice
would have to be accepted. Hon'ble Supreme Court has also taken the
similar view subsequently in the case of <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_14">N.Kannadasan v. Ajoy Khose</a>,
(2009) 7 SCC 1. Thus, it is evident that once the name is suggested
by the  Chief Justice it is binding on the Government and the Council
of Ministers is bound to forward such name to the Governor of the
State for appointment.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_81">I,
therefore, request you to take up the matter with the Council of
Minsters and to forward the name of Mr. Justice(Retd.) R.A. Mehta to
Her Excellency the Governor of Gujarat for his appointment as
Lokayukta of the State of Gujarat.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_82">I
am forwarding a copy of this communication to Her Excellency the
Governor of Gujarat for kind information and perusal."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_83">5.18	On
16th August, 2011, the Governor wrote to the  Chief
Minister and requested  the Chief Minister  to send the formal
proposal of Shri R.A.Mehta as Lokayukta.   She stated as under :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_84">"This
is in continuation to my earlier D.O. letter dated 7th
June, 2011 wherein I had mentioned that I was in receipt of a
proposal from the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court Justice
Shri Mukhopadhya dated 7th June, 2011 recommending the
name of Hon'ble Justice (Retd.) Shri R.A. Mehta for appointment to
the post of Lokayukta. I had also requested you to kindly get the
matter processed expeditiously at the  Government level in accordance
with the provisions of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986 and submit a
formal proposal for my consideration at the earliest possible.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_85">Even
though a period of two months has passed I have not yet heard
anything from the State Government. I am of the view that such an
important post of Lokayukta cannot be kept vacant any longer in the 
interest of good governance.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_86">Looking
to the importance and urgency of the matter, I had expected prompt
action on the part of the Government with reference to my earlier
D.O. letter and  the recommendation from the Hon'ble Chief Justice.
Anyhow, there is no development on this front till date. I must be
frank enough to bring it to your notice that this inordinate and
uncalled for delay is a cause of grave concern to me as the Governor
of the State.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_87">I
would again like to draw your kind attention to the provisions of
Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986 wherein it is laid down
that "Governor shall by warrant and seal appoint the Lokayukta
after consultation  with the Chief Justice of the High Court and the
Leader of the Opposition." This provision casts a statutory
obligation on the part of the State Government to appoint the
Lokayukta. If the State Government, in spite of the recommendation
from the Hon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court and endorsement from
the Governor of the State could not appoint the Lokayukta, such a
failure or negligence could not be viewed lightly under the
Constitution.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_88">In
view of the above, I would again like to request the State Government
to send a formal proposal in this regard for my consideration so that
the appointment of the Lokayukta could be made forthwith.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_89">Needless
to point out to you at this juncture that Justice Shri Mukhopadhaya,
Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court had in clear,
unambiguous terms clarified about the misgivings of the Government
vide his D.O. Letter dated 2nd August, 2011 addressed to
you, a copy of which was also marked to me."
</p> 

 


 

	
 

<p id="p_90">5.19		On
18th August 2011, once the Chief Minister  addressed a
letter to the Chief Justice raising several issues with respect to
the recommendation of Shri R.A.Mehta  for the post of Lokayukta. In
the said letter, the Chief Minister  had  indicated the instances,
which according to him  would show certain pre-judged  bias on the
part  of  Shri R.A.Mehta against the present administration  and in
particular his views on the Surat Floods leading to large scale loss
of property  as also on the unfortunate riots  which took place  in
the State of Gujarat  post-Godhra train burning incident in the year
2002.  The Chief Minister  cited certain instances where  Shri
R.A.Mehta   had participated in public hearing and in the conclusion
portion  of the letter  it was stated  that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_91">Although,
I have no personal reservation against the name of Hon'ble Mr.
Justice (Retired) R.A. Mehta, but as the Head of the State
Government, I am afraid, I may not be able to accept the name of
Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retired) R.A. Mehta, who, in my view, cannot be
considered the most suitable choice for the august post of Lokayukta,
Gujarat State.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_92">Simultaneously
on 18th August 2011, the Chief Minister  also wrote a
letter to the Governor suggesting  that the  procedure laid down by
the Apex Court  in the case of Kannadasan (supra) would not apply in
case of appointment of Lokayukta and that in other States also, such
procedure is not being followed.  In so far as the recommendation of
Shri R.A.Mehta  was concerned, he stated that :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_93">"Insofar
as the recent letter dated 2nd August, 2011 from the Hon.
Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court is concerned, I may inform
you that the name recommended therein has not been accepted by
the State Government for certain specific and valid reasons.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_94">5.10		On
25th August 2011, the Governor issued  the impugned
notification which reads as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_95">"By
virtue of the power vested in me by sub-section (1) of section 3 of
the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986 (Guj. Act No.31 of 1986, I,
Dr.Shrimati Kamla, Governor  of Gujarat,  do hereby appooint, Shri
Justice (Retd.) Ramesh Amritlal Metha to be the Lokayukta with effect
 from the date he assumes charge of his office.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_96">	Given
at Raj Bhavan, Gandhinagar this twenty fifth day of August in the
year two thousand eleven (3rd Bhadrapad, 1933 Saka)."
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_97">6.	At
this stage,  we may also note that the Gujarat  Lokayukta (Amendment)
 Bill, 2011 (Gujarat Bill No.29 of 2011) was passed by the
Legislative Assembly  of the State of Gujarat  on 30th
March 2011 which primarily sought to  widen the definition of 
"public functionary'  contained in <a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_15">section 2(7)</a> of the Act by  
including various authorities, such as,  the Mayor or the Deputy
Mayor of a municipal corporation,  the President or the
Vice-President of a municipality,  the Sarpanch or the Up-Sarpanch 
of a village  panchayat, the President or the Vice-President of a
taluka panchayat or a district panchayat, etc.  Such bill when
presented before the Governor  for promulgation was  returned  with a
recommendation to consider her objection. It was pointed out  that
there are large number of  local bodies in Gujarat including 14000 
Village Panchayats, 225 Taluka Panchayats, 26 District Panchayats,
159 Municipalities and 8 Municipal Corporations.  She was, therefore,
of the opinion  that the Lokayukta  howsoever competent and efficient
would not be   able to look into the complaints of irregularities
against  such large number of persons. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_98">7.		The
State thereupon issued an ordinance,  further amending the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act, 1986.  Such  ordinance  contained several changes in
the Act, including <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_16">section 3</a> thereof.  Instead of the existing
<a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_17">section 3</a>,  it, inter alia, provided  for an institution of Lokayukta
to consist of  the Chairperson, who is or has been a Judge of the
High Court and such number of members not exceeding  two.   It also
provided that  for the purpose of conducting investigation  in
accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Governor shall with
the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers appoint  a Lokayukta. 
 Such appointment shall be  made after obtaining recommendation of a
committee consisting of the following:
</p> 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_99">the
	Chief Minister as Chairperson
	  

the
	Speaker of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly
	  

the
	Minister  in-charge  of the Legal Department
	  

a
	sitting judge of the High Court, as may be nominated by the Chief
	Justice of the High Court of Gujarat.
</p>	  

<p id="p_100">the
	Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly

 

 


 

It
was, however, provided that no sitting Judge of the High court of
Gujarat shall be appointed as Chairperson except after consultation
with the Chief Justice.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_101">8.	The
said ordinance was, however, returned by the Governor citing several
reasons including that she could not see any urgency in bringing
about such an ordinance all of a sudden.  Besides, the Chief Justice
has already forwarded a proposal for appointment of Lokayukta and the
same was at the final stage of issuance of notification.  She,
therefore,  stated that "in view of the above, I fail to
appreciate  the need  of promulgating the proposed ordinance.  As
such, I am returning the Government file with the above
observations".
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_102">9.		The
Ordinance was once again forwarded to the Governor  on or around 20th
August 2011. This was done pursuant to the office note dated 18th
 August 2011 of the General Administration  Department.  The
Governor, however, once again stuck to her views and returned the 
Ordinance  saying    "in view of the above, I do not see any
justification in promulgating the proposed Ordinance at this
juncture; and accordingly, I return herewith the Government file with
the above observations."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_103">10.		On
the basis of the above factual sequence,  several issues have arisen
before us. The principal question is  of the legality  of the
notification  issued by the Governor on 25th August 2011 
appointing Shri R.A.Mehta as Lokayukta  of the State of Gujarat.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_104">11.	At
the centre of  the controversy  are the nature of powers exercised by
the Governor under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_18">section 3</a> of the Act which provides, inter alia, 
that for the purpose of conducting investigation in accordance with
the provisions of the Act, the Governor shall by warrant under his
hand  and seal, appoint a person to be known as the Lokayukta. Such
powers   are required to be viewed  in light of the powers of the
Governor  particularly  under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_19">Article 163</a> of the Constitution, which
reads as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_105">"163.
</p><p id="p_106">Council of Ministers to aid and advise Governor: - (1) There  shall
be a Council of  Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid
and avise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so
far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his
functions or any of them in his discretion.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_107">(2)	If
any question arises, whether any matter is or is not a matter  as
respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required
to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in his
discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything  done by the
Governor shall not be called in question on the ground  that he ought
or ought not to have acted in his discretion.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_108">(3)	The
question whether  any,  and if so what, advice was tendered  by
Ministers to the Governor shall not be required into in any Court."
</p> 


 


 


 


 

<p id="p_109">12.		On
behalf of the State, the learned Advocate General raised the
following contentions:
</p> 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_110">He
	submitted that as per  <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_20">Article 163(1)</a> of the Constitution, the
	Governor must act as per the  aid and advice of the Council of
	Ministers. Under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_21">section 3</a> of the Act, therefore, the Governor could
	not have  acted without or  de hors the advice of the Council of
	Ministers. He referred to the literature on British Model of
	Governance and several decisions of the Indian Courts, to which 
	reference will be made  at a later stage, to contend that  in a
	Parliamentary Democracy, the executive  functions through the
	Council of Ministers and that the Governor is bound by the aid and
	advice  of the Council Ministers  unless when discretion is vested 
	on him/her under the Constitution itself.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_111">He
	submitted that  in addition to  the express provisions made in the 
	Constitution requiring the Governor to act in his own discretion,
	there are areas  recognized in  various decisions of the Apex Court 
	where in special situations such  discretionary powers were
	necessary.  He, of course, stated that in exercise of statutory
	functions, when the Governor is holding a position  by virtue of a
	statute such as Chancellor of a University, such powers are  to be
	exercised  without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_112">The
	learned Advocate General  raised a strong objection to the nature of
	consultation.  He submitted that  process of consultation must be
	initiated by the Chief Minister.  In absence of  statutory rules, 
	he relied on  the past convention and submitted that the process
	must emanate  from the  office of the Chief Minister.   Heavy
	reliance was placed on the Rules of Business and in particular 
	entry 36A therein  to contend that  as per the Rules of Business
	also, the Governor  was required to follow certain procedure which
	was not done in the present case.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_113">The
	learned Advocate General submitted that the Chief Minister under the
	scheme  of <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_22">section 3</a>  would be the consultant. The Chief Justice of
	the State and the Leader of Opposition would be the consultees.  He
	contended that the nature of consultation envisaged   under
	different judicial pronouncements for appointment of Constitutional
	Courts, that is, High Courts and the Supreme Court would not apply
	in the present case looking to the nature of powers, functions and
	duties  exercised by the Lokayukta under the Act.  He contended that
	 even the procedure envisaged  for appointment  to different 
	judicial or quasi judicial positions, such as, the President of
	Consumer  Forum cannot be adopted since the post of Lokayukta  was
	not a judicial post.   In short, he submitted that the procedure
	envisaged by the Apex Court in the  case of   <a href="/doc/921223/" id="a_23">Justice
	K.P.Mohapatra   v.  Sri Ram Chandra Nayak</a>,  (2002)  8 SCC 1 and
	not the one envisaged in the decision in the case of Kannadasan
	(supra) should be followed.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_114">He
	submitted that the entire   procedure adopted by the Governor was 
	wholly irregular. The Governor could not have  sought the advise of 
	the Attorney General.  She could not have insisted on recommendation
	of one name against a panel of names  as previously suggested by the
	Chief Justice. The Governor, in any case,  could not have 
	approached  the Chief Justice  directly.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_115">Most
	assertively it was contended that consultative process was still
	going on and the Council of Ministers through the Chief Minister 
	had raised certain objections  to the appointment of Shri R.A.Mehta
	as Lokayukta.  The first communication  of the Chief Minister  dated
	16th June 2011 was replied to by the Chief Justice on 
	2nd August 2011. However, the later communication dated
	18th August 2011 raised  several issues about the
	recommendation of Shri R.A.Mehta  which were  still being examined
	by the Chief Justice. At that vital stage,  the Governor could not
	have   acted unilaterally and issued the  notification.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_116">The
	learned Advocate General further contended that  there was no delay
	on the part of the Government in making the appointment.  Government
	 always acted promptly and in the best interest of the State.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_117">Counsel
	contended that in such a  case, even  at the instance of the State
	quo warranto  would lie.  In any case, the State had also prayed for
	 a declaration which can always be issued by this Court.
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_118">13.	
Learned Advocate General relied on the following decisions :
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_119">13.1		In
the case of <a href="/doc/167993993/" id="a_24">Samsher Singh  v. State of Punjab</a>, (1974)
2 SCC 831 to contend that  in a Parliamentary democracy, the Governor
in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_25">Article 163 (1)</a>  would always be  in aid
and advice of the Council of Ministers and only in exceptional and
rare cases where the Constitution  so specifically provides, the
Governor would  have  discretionary powers. </p><pre id="pre_2">

 


 


 

13.2		In
the case of  <a href="/doc/1152284/" id="a_26">Kehar Singh    v. Union of India</a>, 
</pre><p id="p_120">(1989) 1 SCC 204, wherein the Apex Court even  in the context of  the
President exercising powers under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_27">Article 72</a> to grant pardon observed
as under : 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_121"> "It
is not denied, and indeed it has been repeatedly affirmed in the
course of argument by learned counsel, Shri Ram Jethmalani and Shri
Shanti Bhushan, appearing for the petitioners that the power
to pardon rests on the advice tendered by the Executive to the
President, who subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_28">Art. 74(l)</a> of the
Constitution, must act in accordance with such advice. We may point
out that the Constitution Bench of this Court held in <a href="/doc/1222748/" id="a_29">Maru Ram
v. Union of India</a>, (1981) 1 SCR 1196 : (AIR 1980 SC 2141) that the
power under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_30">Art. 72</a> is to be exercised on the advice of the Central
Government and not by the President on his own, and that the advice

<p id="p_122">13.3		In
the case of  <a href="/doc/1279970/" id="a_31">Ram Nagina Singh  v.  S.V.Sohni</a>,
 AIR 1976 Patna 36 wherein in the context of  appointment  of
Lokayukta under the Bihar Lokayukta Act, the Division Bench of the
High Court  observed that ordinarily when power is vested even by the
statute in the Government, he has to act on the aid and advice of the
Council of the Minsters. It does not cease  to be an executive power 
merely because it is conferred by the statute.    It would be
defeating the constitutional scheme if it was to be  held that the
mere use of the word  'Governor' in any statute would be imputing an
intention to the legislature of conferring a power  'eo nomine' .
Indeed the presumption should be otherwise.

<p id="p_123">13.4		In
the case of  Ajit Kumar  v. State of Jharkhand &amp; ors. 
 In WP (PIL) No.2475 of 2001 reported in MANU/JH/0345/2002,   a
Division Bench of the  Jharkhand High Court was  also examining the
provisions of appointment of Lokayukta  in the State.  Hon'ble
Justice M.Y.Eqbal    in his order stated as under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_124">"17.
</p><p id="p_125"> From the reading the aforesaid provisions of the Act, it is manifest
that Lokayukta shall be appointed  by the Governor, by issuance of
warrant under his hand and seal.  For the appointment of a Lokayukta
the Governor   has to make consultation
 with the Hon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court and the
Leader  of Opposition of the State  Legislative Assembly.  A question
 therefore  falls for  consideration  is as to whether the Governor
at his own discretion  proposed the name  of  person for appoint
of 'Lokayukta' and then make consultation with the aforementioned two
functions or the Governor shall exercise power
on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.  At this stage it
is very important to note that <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_32">section 3</a> of the  Act only speaks 
about the  consultation with the Chief Justice  and the Leader of
Opposition and nowhere  it is provided that Chief Minister is to be
consulted."

</p><p id="p_127">26.	Reading
<a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_33">Article 163</a> and <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_34">166</a> of the Constitution and the Rules of Executive
Business, it is therefore clear that any function vested in the
Governor, whether Executive, Legislative or quasi judicial in nature 
and whether vested by the Constitution  or by the State may be
delegated   by the Rules of Business unless contrary is clearly
provided by such constitutional or statutory   provisions.  The
phrase "Governor in his discretion"  as referred under
<a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_35">Article 163</a> of the Constitution, in my opinion, does not come with
the purview of Section 3 of the Lokayukta Act, for the  reason that
the Governor has got his special  power  under a special statute,
i.e. Lokayukta  At.  Power conferred  upon the Governor  under the
said Act  has to be exercised  in accordance with the procedure
provided under the Rules  of Executive Business.  In other words, 
Governor while exercising power under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_36">Section 3</a> of the Act has to act
on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_128">Hon'ble
Justice S.J.Mukhopadhaya, other member of the Bench  who  gave a
concurring, but separate judgment observed as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_129">"39.	Initially,
this Court was informed that the consultation process
 with the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Leader of
Opposition of the State has been completed  and final decision would
be taken within few weeks. However, the matter  is being lingered on
the ground that, the Council of Ministers did not agree
to the proposal of appointment of the person which was unanimously
 agreed by the Chief  Justice of the High Court, Leader of Opposition
and the Chief Minister.  The Council of Ministers  proposed to
appoint a person who  is a 'domicile of State',
 whereinafter the Chief Minister suggested another name.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_130">xxxx


 

	xxxx
 


</p><p id="p_131">47.	In
the aforesaid background, while I agree with the findings given by
brother Eqbal, J. am of the opinion that the matter of consultation 
should not be   dealt in the like manner as dealt in the present
case, as the consultation with the high dignitaries like Chief
Justice of a High Court and  Leader of Opposition of the State
Assembly should not be negated  on unreasonable ground giving a
colour that the Council of Ministers  who will fall within the domain
of the Lokayukta do  not  like to have a Lokayukta or intend to have
a Lokayukta of their choice, which is against the spirit of Lokayukta
Act, 1973. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_132">48.	In
such a situation, it is desirable to have names of certain persons
that should be discussed initially by the Council of Ministers with
the Chief Minister as its head and only thereafter to forward  such
names  for consultation with the Chief Justice and Leader of
Opposition.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_133">49.	Further,
according to me, once a consultation made, the matter  should not 
have  been sent back to the Council of Ministers, but in accordance
with the provisions of the Lokayukta Act, 1973, it should be referred
to the Governor of the State.  If initially, the aid and advice of 
the  Council of Ministers taken  the Governor is not  required to
take again the aid and advice of the Council of  Ministers, but to
act taking into consideration the consultation as made.  On the other
hand,  where no initial aid or advise taken from the Council of
Ministers, like the present one, the Governor before issuance of 
warrant of appointment, should take  aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers."

viz.  that in exercise of  powers under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_46">section 3</a> of the  Act, the
Governor was bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.
 In absence of any recommendation from the Council of Ministers,

placed before us the debates  in the Constituent Assembly wherein the

without the aid and advice and only when the Governor has  any
discretion, he acts on his own judgment, which must be exercised  in
harmony with the Council of Ministers.

was also brought to our  notice to contend that the facts  in that
case were peculiar.  Against a  Minister of the State, serious
allegations were made. Council of Ministers refused to grant sanction
for prosecution. The Governor, however,  passed an order granting
such sanction. It was in this  background, the Apex Court opined that

<p id="p_153">16.		On
behalf of respondent No.2, learned counsel  Shri Shalin Mehta   made
detailed submissions.  At our request, he also addressed us on
general issues which were presented before us.  He submitted that  it
is though ordinarily true that the Governor must act in the aid and
advice of the  Council of Ministers, such rule is subject to certain
exceptions which from the decisions of the Apex Court  can be culled
out as  under:
</p> 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_154">	where
	the bias is inherent,
	  


	where
	the bias is apparent,
	  


	where
	the decision of Council of Ministers is  wholly irrational;
</p>	  


<p id="p_155">	where
	the  Council of Ministers, due to the situation,  is disabled or
	disentitled to give such advice,
	  


	in
	a matter of propriety,
	  


	where
	there is  a possibility  of complete break-down of democracy.
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_156">16.1	He
submitted that looking to the various statutory provisions contained
in the  Act, the institution of Lokayukta  has  trappings  of a
court.  In any case, he contended that  in case of difference of
opinion between the Chief Justice  and the Chief Minister with
respect to the finalization of the name  for appointment of
Lokayukta, it is the Chief Justice's view  which should prevail
because  :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_157">(a)	by
virtue of  the decision in the case of  Justice K.P.Mohapatra
	(supra) view of the Chief Justice would have primacy;

<p id="p_158">(b)	the
Chief Justice of the State is the best person to judge the 
	suitability of  a sitting or a retired High Court Judge to act as
	Lokayukta.
</p> 


<p id="p_159">(c)	Consultation
under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_51">section 3</a> of the Act  with Chief Justice is 	mandatory.

of the Act  cannot be subserved, if the final decision is left 	to
the executive.

<p id="p_161">16.2		Counsel
submitted that there was a difference of opinion between the  Chief
Minister and the Chief Justice with respect to the name of  Shir
R.A.Mehta  as Lokayukta.  There was no further consultation pending
with the Chief Justice after the State Government's objections raised
 by communication  dated  16th
June 2011  were  disposed of by the Chief Justice.  
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_162">16.3		He
submitted that as held by the Apex Court in the case of N.Kannadasan
(supra), the process of consultation must start from the Chief
Justice.   He also referred to the decision of the Apex Court  in the
case of  Justice K.P.Mohapatra (supra) to contend that the view of

(1) SCALE 315,  wherein, in the background
  of compulsory retirement of a judicial officer, the Apex Court held
that the Governor cannot act on the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers but has to act  only on the recommendation of the High
Court.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_164">17.		Shri
Girish Patel appearing for the  applicants, opposed the petitions and
 submitted that though ordinarily, the Governor would be required to
act under the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, such rule
is not inviolable.  In exceptional  situation, it would be open for
the  Governor  to act in her discretion.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_165">17.1		In
this regard, he submitted that consultation between different
agencies  was  going on since 2006.   The post of Lokayukta is lying
vacant since 2003 when Justice S.M.Soni relinquished the charge. For
eight long years, there is no appointment to the post of Lokayukta. 
He pointed out that previously, a public interest litigation was 
filed seeking urgent appointment of Lokayukta  in which on behalf of
the State, on 16.6.2010  it was stated that the process is at the fag
end.  Despite one full year having passed  since then, till date  no
appointment has been made. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_166">17.2		He
submitted that the petition of the State is not maintainable since it
is filed against a private individual.  The State has not joined any
Department as  the respondent.  Obviously, the Governor cannot be  a
respondent and rightly not joined  by the State.  He submitted that 
a writ of quo warranto cannot be issued     since Justice R.A.Mehta 
has not taken charge and till the person appointed assumes office,
writ of quo warranto would not lie.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_167">17.3		He
submitted that in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_53">Article 163</a> of the
Constitution,  Governor's discretion is not open to  judicial review.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_168">17.3		He
drew   our attention to various  provisions  of the Act to contend
that  an exceptional situation has arisen in the present case because
:

<p id="p_169">	aid
	and advice of the Council  of Ministers was not available ;
</p>	  


<p id="p_170">	the

</p>	  


<p id="p_172">	The
	Lokayukta Act  permits investigation into the complaints relating to
	 incidents not older than five years.  Since there was  no Lokayukta
	for the last eight years,  large number of  complaints would get
	eliminated from the  purview of Lokayukta  and any further delay
	cannot be brooked.   
</p>	
	 


	

 


<p id="p_173">17.4	He
further  contended that  to keep several issues out of the purview of
the  investigation by Lokayukta, the Chief Minister had appointed a
Commission  of Inquiry   of a retired Judge of the Supreme Court  so
that  the subjects which were   placed before the Commission  for his
inquiry cannot  be gone into by the Lokayukta.   
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_174">17.5	He
further submitted  that the said Act  was sought to be amended to
eliminate   or at least  minimize the role of the Chief Justice  in
selection  of person  for appointment as Lokayukta.

virtue of  <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_63">Article 361</a> of the Constitution  of India,  Governor of
the State is not answerable to   any  court  for the exercise and
performance of powers and duties  of his office or any act done or
purporting  to be done by him in the exercise  and performance of
those powers and duties.   However, as held by the Apex Court in the
case of Rameshwar Prasad  (supra) a writ would like against  the
decision of the Governor.  In any case, such technical issue need not
detain us as a public interest  litigation filed by a private
organization   is very much before us.  We did  not issue notice in
such petition only in order not to duplicate  the efforts when we 
were hearing the grievance of the State in the State's petition. 
However, such petition at any rate would be maintainable.

<p id="p_196"> Can
writ of quo warranto be issued ?
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_197">22.		With
respect to the question of  issuance of writ of quo warranto also, we
are  of the opinion that such issue need not detain us  for long.  
The parameters of a writ of quo warranto were discussed by the Apex
Court  in the case  of  <a href="/doc/295084/" id="a_64">University of Mysore  v.  Govinda Rao</a>, 
AIR 1965 SC 491 as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_198">"7.
</p><p id="p_199">As Halsbury has observed : 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_200">"An
information in the nature of a quo warranto took the place of the
obsolete writ of quo warranto which lay against a person who claimed
or usurped an office, franchise, or liberty, to enquire by what
authority he supported his claim, in order that the right to the
office or franchise might be determined." Broadly stated, the
quo warranto proceeding affords a judicial enquiry in which any
person holding an independent substantive public office, or
franchise, or liberty, is called upon to show by what right he holds
the said office, franchise or liberty; if the inquiry leads to the
finding that the holder of the office has no valid title to it, the
issue of the writ of quo warranto ousts him from that office. In
other words, the procedure of quo warranto confers jurisdiction and
authority on the judiciary to control executive action in the matter
of making appointments to public offices against the relevant
statutory provisions; it also protects a citizen from being deprived
of public office to which he may have a right. It would thus be seen
that if these proceedings are adopted subject to the conditions
recognised in that behalf, they tend to protect the public from
usurpers of public office; in some cases, persons not entitled to
public office may be allowed to occupy them and to continue to hold
them as a result of the connivance of the executive or with its
active help, and in such cases, if the jurisdiction of the courts to
issue writ of quo warranto is properly invoked, the usurper can be
ousted and the person entitled to the post allowed to occupy it. It
is thus clear that before a citizen can claim a writ of quo warranto,
he must satisfy the court, inter alia, that the office in question is
a public office and is held by usurper without legal authority, and
that necessarily leads to the enquiry as to whether the appointment
of the said alleged usurper has been made in accordance with law or
not."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_201">	As
canvassed by learned  counsel Shri Girish Patel,  certain judicial
pronouncements do suggest that the court would not issue a writ of
quo warranto till the person concerned  assumes the office.   In case
of   <a href="/doc/296130/" id="a_65">Parmatma Ram v. Shri Chand</a>,  reported in AIR 1962 HP 19
also similar view was expressed.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_202">	On
the other hand,  the learned Advocate General  has cited instances
where such writ petitions have been entertained by the Courts, such
as, in case of Shri Kumar Padma Prasad,  (1992) 2 SCC 428 and
Rajendrakumar Chandumal,  AIR 1957  MP 60.  However,  we need
not go into this question since as observed by the Apex Court in the
case  of Centre for PIL (supra),  the Court in an appropriate case
would also be  competent to  issue a writ of declaration.  It was
observed as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_203">"51.
</p><p id="p_204"> The procedure of quo warranto confers jurisdiction  and authority on
the judiciary to control executive action in the matter of   making
appointments to public offices against the relevant statutory
provisions.  Before a citizen can claim a writ of quo warranto he
must satisfy  the court inter alia that the office in question is a
public  office and it is held by a  person without legal authority
and that leads  to the inquiry as to whether the appointment of the
said person has been  in accordance with law or not.  A writ of quo
warranto is to prevent  a continued exercise of unlawful authority.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_205">52.	One
more aspect needs to be  mentioned.  In the present petition, as
rightly pointed out by Shri Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel
appearing  on behalf of the petitioner, a declaratory relief is
sought besides seeking a writ of quo warranto.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_206">53.	At
the outset it may be stated  that in the main writ petition the
petitioner has prayed for issuance of any other writ,  direction or
order which this Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of this case.  Thus,  nothing prevents this Court, if
so satisfied, from issuing a writ of declaration.  Further, as held
hereinabove,  recommendation  of the HPC and, consequently, the
appointment  of Shri P.J.Thomas was in contravention of the
provisions  of the 2003 Act, hence, we find  no merit in the
submissions  advanced on behalf of Respondent 2  on 
non-maintainability  of the writ petition.  If public duties  are to
be enforced and rights and interests  are to be protected, then  the
court may, in  furtherance of public  interest,  consider it 
necessary to inquire into the state of affairs of the subject-matter
of litigation  in the interest  of justice (see <a href="/doc/130040/" id="a_66">Ashjok Lanka  v.
Rishit Dixit</a>). "
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_207">22.1		In
the case of N. Kannadasan (supra), the Apex Court observed as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_208">"148.
</p><p id="p_209"> We have found hereinabove that the appellant was not  eligible for
appointment to a public office and in any event the processual
machinery relating to  consultation was not fully complied with.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_210">149.	In
this case, moreover, a writ of declaration  was sought for.  This
Court in Kumar  Padma Prasad  issued  a writ of declaration although
a writ of quo warranto was sought for.  Declaring that the appellant
therein was not qualified to be appointed  as a Judge of the High
Court, a consequential order  directing him not to appoint was also
issued."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_211">	In
the conclusion, we find that even if there is any inhibition in
issuing a writ of quo warranto, a declaration can always be issued
which would have the same effect.

<p id="p_212"> Nature
of powers of the Governor under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_67">section 3</a> of the Act:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_213">23.		That
brings us  to the  question whether   under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_68">section 3</a> of the Act,  
the Governor was required to act in aid and  advice of the Council of
Ministers or at her  own discretion.   Looking to the provisions of
<a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_69">Article 163</a> of the Constitution and the provisions made in <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_70">section 3</a>
of the Act as also   considering  the nature of Parliamentary
democracy adopted by our country under the Constitution, there is
little doubt  that the Governor under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_71">section 3</a> of  the Act was
required to   act in aid and advise of the Council of Ministers.   We
are conscious that there is a marked distinction between the  powers
exercised by the President under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_72">Article 74</a> of the Constitution
vis-a-vis  that exercised by the Governor under  <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_73">Article 163.</a>  In the
former case, the President virtually has no discretion but to act  
on   the aid and advise  of the  Council of Ministers,  under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_74">Article
163</a> there is a clear distinction  where areas are earmarked for the 
exercise of power of the Governor which must be  exercised by him or
her in her/his discretion  and not under the aid and advise   of
Council of Ministers.   However, such  areas must be traced under the
Constitution.   Exception, of course,  being where the Governor is
exercising  powers by virtue of holding certain  statutory post or
position as in case of  a Chancellor of a University.  In such a
case, the Governor would not be acting as the head  of the State but
as a statutory authority holding such a post  ex-officio  merely by
virtue of being the Governor of the State.  In such a case,  the
Governor would be  acting as statutory authority and without the aid
and advice of the Council of Ministers.   However, wherever, the
Governor acts  as the Head of the State,  except for areas  which are
ear-marked  under the Constitution  giving the discretion to the
Governor, exercise of power must be on the  aid and advice of the
Council of Ministers.    The Apex Court in the case of  Samsher Singh
 (supra)   summed the law in following manner:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_214">"154.
</p><p id="p_215">We declare the law of this branch of our Constitution' to be that the
President and Governor, custodians of all executive and other powers
under various Articles shall, by virtue of these provisions, exercise
their formal constitutional powers only upon and in accordance with
the advice of their Minister save in a few well-known exceptional
situations. Without being dogmatic or exhaustive, these situations
relate to (a) the choice of Prime Minister (Chief Minister),
restricted though this choice is by the paramount consideration that
he should command a majority in the House; (b) the dismissal of a
Government which has lost its majority in the House but refuses to
quit office; (c) the dissolution of the House where an appeal to the
country is necessitous, although in this area the Head of State
should avoid getting involved in politics and must be advised by his
Prime Minister (Chief Minister) who will eventually take the
responsibility for the step. We do not examine in detail the
constitutional proprieties in these predicaments except to utter the
caution that even here the action must to compelled by the peril to
democracy and the appeal to the House or to the country must become
blatantly obligatory. We have no doubt that de Smith's statement
regarding royal assent holds good for the President and Governor in
India:
</p> 


<p id="p_216">"Refusal
of the royal assent on the ground that the monarch strongly
disapproved of a bill or that it was intensely controversial would
nevertheless be unconstitutional. The only circumstances in which the
withholding of the royal assent might be justifiable would be if the
Government itself were to advise such a course - a highly improbable
contingency -or possible if it notorious that a bill had been passed
in disregard to mandatory procedural requirements; but since the
Government in the latter situation would be of the opinion that the
deviation would not affect the validity of the measure once it had
been assented to, prudence would suggest the giving of assent.''
 


 


 


23.1		In
the case of    <a href="/doc/1516805/" id="a_75">PU Myllai Hlychho v.   State of Mizoram</a>, 
(2005) 2 SCC 92,  the Apex Court observed: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_217">"14.
</p><p id="p_218">Our Constitution envisages the Parliamentary or Cabinet system of
Government of the British model both for the Union and the States.
Under the Cabinet system of Government as embodied in our
Constitution the Governor is the constitutional or formal head of the
State and he exercises all his powers and functions conferred on him
by or under the Constitution on the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers save in spheres where the Governor is required by or under
the Constitution to exercise his functions in his discretion.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_219">15. 
The executive power also partakes the legislative or certain judicial
actions. Wherever the Constitution requires the satisfaction of the
Governor for the exercise of any power or function, the satisfaction
required by the Constitution is not personal satisfaction of the
Governor but the satisfaction in the constitutional sense under the
Cabinet system of Government. The Governor exercises functions
conferred on him by or under the Constitution with the aid and advice
of the Council of Ministers and he is competent to make rules for
convenient transaction of the business of the Government of the
State, by allocation of business among the Ministers, under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_76">Article
166(3)</a> of the Constitution. It is a fundamental principle of English
Constitutional Law that Ministers must accept responsibility for
every executive act. It may also be noticed that in regard to the
executive action taken in the name of the Governor, he cannot be sued
for any executive action of the State and <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_77">Article 300</a> specifically
states that Government of a State may sue or be sued in the name of
the State subject to the restriction placed therein. This Court has
consistently taken the view that the powers of the President and the
powers of the Governor are similar to the powers of the Crown under
the British Parliamentary system. We followed this principle in <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_78">Ram
Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab</a> (AIR 1955 SC 549), <a href="/doc/205909/" id="a_79">A. Sanjeevi Naidu

</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_220">23.2		In
the case of  Kehar Singh (supra), the Apex Court, as already noted,  
held  that the President while deciding to grant or not to grant 
pardon also must act under the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_221">23.3		Reference
may also be made in this regard  to  the decisions of the Apex Court 
in the case of  Bhuri Nath  v  State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir 
(supra) and in the case of Vice-Chancellor, University of
Allahabad (supra) .  In Bhuri Nath the Apex Court was considering
the nature of powers exercised by the Governor  in administration of
Vaishno  Devi Shrine.  It was observed that under the Jammu and
Kashmir Shri Mata Vaishno Devi  Shrine Act,  the Governor exercises 
his statutory  powers  as ex officio Chairman of the Board and not as
executive head of the State with the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers.  The decision in case of Vice Chancellor, University of
Allahabad  (supra) concerned the question  of validity of appointment
made by the Vice Chancellor of the University. It was  observed that 
the Governor acts as Chancellor discharging statutory duty  in his
ex-officio capacity while under <a href="/doc/374793/" id="a_81">section 6</a> of the Act   he exercises
his constitutional functions under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_82">Article 163</a> with the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers. These decisions represent areas 
where the Governor exercises statutory duties  in his ex-officio
capacity and not as the head of a State.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_222">23.4		In
the 8th Edition  of Commentary on the Constitution of
India by Durga Das Basu, law on the subject has been discussed  as
under:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_223">"There
are certain powers and functions of the Governor which speak of
"special responsibilities". These Articles are Arts. 371
A(1)(b), 371A(1)(d), 371A(2)(b), 371A(2)(f) and the provisions
contained in the sixth schedule, and the expression "in his
discretion" occurring in clause(2) refers to special
responsibilities.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_224">1.
Subject to the foregoing discretionary functions or powers of the
Governor, the Constitution envisages a Parliamentary system of
government both at the Union and State levels, which means that
neither the President nor the Governor is to exercise any function
personally. He is a constitutional head of the Executive and his
powers are to be exercised on the advise of the Council of Ministers
and through Ministers or other officers to whom functions may be
allocated according to Rules of Business made under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_83">Art.166(3).</a>
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_225">Under
this Article, the Governor cannot act on his own, but only with the
aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. In substance and reality,
the decision is taken by the Council  of  Ministers headed by the
Chief Minister or by the Minister or the Secretary as per business
rules. But the decisions are expressed to be taken in the name of
Governor. The Governor being the constitutional head of the State,
unless he is required to perform the function under the Constitution
in his individual discretion, the performance of the executive power
which is co-extensive with the legislative power, is with the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister. The
expression, "required" found in <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_84">Art. 163(1)</a> is stated to
signify that  the Governor can exercise his discretionary powers only
if there is compelling necessity to do so. The necessity to exercise
such powers may arise from any express provision of the Constitution
or by necessary implication. The Sarkaria Commission Report further
adds that such necessity may arise even from rules and order made
"under" the Constitution. Barring few exceptions,
wherever the Constitution requires the satisfaction of the President
or the Governor, it is not their personal satisfaction, but the
satisfaction of the Council of Ministers on whose aid and advice the
President or the Governor has to exercise their powers and functions.
Neither of them can exercise any function individually or personally.
"
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_226">	It
thus clearly emerges that the Governor under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_85">section 3</a>  of the Act 
acts under the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_227">  Lokayukta  whether is

</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_228">24.		The
next  question is whether  the institution of Lokayukta is a court or
has trappings of a court.  Detailed  reference  to  different
provisions  under the Act will be made at a later  stage in a
slightly different context.  At this stage, suffice it to note that
admittedly and concededly, there is  no power under the Act by virtue
of which the Lokayukta   can render a binding judgment.  The
culmination of the investigation that the Lokayukta may  undertake
either on a complaint  or suo motu  would be to  render  a report.  
Such a report is not binding either on the Council of Ministers or
any other authority.  It does not decide the rights or lis between
the parties.  It does not give a final verdict  which can be enforced
against one or the other party.

1962 SC 1621) held that no doubt a Sales Tax Officer appointed under
the U. P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 is an instrumentality of the State
employed for the purposes of assessment and collection of taxes and
merely because he has, in the discharge of his duties, to perform
certain quasi-judicial functions i.e. has certain powers which are
similar to the powers exercised by Courts, still is not a Court as
understood in<a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_88"> S. 195</a>, of the Code. The Court relied upon the decision
of the House of Lords in Shell Co. of Australia for the view that a
Sales Tax Officer was not a Court in the strict sense of that term.

to what are the Courts and what are not for the purposes of<a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_90"> S.

within the meaning of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_92">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1952 and whether
the proceedings before the Commission of Inquiry were judicial

We are satisfied that the decision of the Nagpur High Court in M. V.
Rajwade's case (AIR 1954 Nag 71) and that of the Madhya Pradesh High
Court in Puhupram lay down the correct law. The least that is
required of a Court is the capacity to deliver a 'definitive
judgment', and merely because the procedure adopted by it is of a
legal character and it has power to administer an oath will not
impart to it the status of a Court. That being so, it must be held
that a Commission of Inquiry appointed by the appropriate Government
under<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_96"> S. 3(1)</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry Act is not a Court for

qualifications for the purpose of appointment as a Judge of the High
Court under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_106">Article 217</a> of the Constitution. While interpreting the
expression "judicial office" under <a href="/doc/1120401/" id="a_107">Article 217(2)(a</a>), this
Court held that the expression "judicial office" must be
interpreted in consonance with the scheme of Chapters V and VI of
Part VI of the Constitution. So construed it means a judicial office
which belongs to the judicial service as defined under <a href="/doc/1086036/" id="a_108">Article
236(b).</a> Therefore, in order to qualify for appointment as a Judge of
a High Court, a person must hold a judicial office which must be a
part of the judicial service of the State. After referring to the
cases of Chandra Mohan (AIR 1966 SC 1987) (supra) and Statesman
(Private) Ltd. (AIR 1968 SC 1495) (supra), this Court said that the
term "judicial office" in its generic sense may include a
wide variety of offices which are connected with the administration
of justice in one way or the other. Officers holding various posts
under the executive are often vested with magisterial power to meet a
particular situation. The Court said, 

 


 


 


"Did
the framers of the Constitution have this type of offices in mind
when they provided a source of appointment to the high office of a
judge of the High Court from amongst the holders of a "judicial
office"? The answer has to be in the negative. We are of the
view that holder of judicial office under <a href="/doc/1120401/" id="a_109">Article 217(2)(a)</a> means the
person who exercise only judicial functions, determines causes inter
parties and renders decisions in a judicial capacity. He must belong
to the judicial service which as a class is free from executive
control and is disciplined to uphold the dignity, integrity and
independence of the judiciary." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_242">Going
by these tests laid down as to what constitutes judicial service
under <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_110">Article 236</a> of the Constitution, the Labour Court judges and
the Judges of the Industrial Court can be held to belong to judicial
service. The hierarchy contemplated in the case of Labour Court
judges is the hierarchy of Labour Court judges and Industrial Court
Judges with the Industrial Court Judges holding the superior position
of District Judges. The Labour Courts have also been held as subject
to the High Court's power of superintendence under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_111">Article 227."</a>
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_243">25.		From
the above judicial pronouncements and bearing in mind the provisions
of the Act,  we are of the opinion that the institution of Lokayukta
cannot be considered  as a court  or having the  trappings of a
court. Lokayukta  does not decide  lis between parties. He does not
have powers to give  binding judgments.   Culmination of his
investigation  may result  into a report which report is not binding
on any authority.  He has powers of a civil court for certain limited
purposes  and institution of Lokayukta is  deemed to be a civil court
for certain limited purposes;  but is not a court.

<p id="p_244"> Nature of Consultation
:
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_245">26.	This
brings us to the next issue, regarding  the nature of  consultation
required for appointment   as a Lokayukta.  Having
held that  the Lokayukta  does not hold a judicial post, however,  in
so far as the nature of  consultation is concerned,  to our mind is
not very significant.   The contention that the nature of
consultation  envisaged  for
appointment  to a  judicial post, such as  consumer forum cannot be
adopted in the  present case  also would be of no consequence.    In 
the case of  Justice  K.P.Mohapatra (supra),  looking to the  duties
performed by the Lokayukta, the Apex Court was clearly of the opinion
that it would be the opinion of the Chief Justice which would have
primacy  [(2002) 8 SCC 1 ] .
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_246">26.1		It
was a case wherein the appointment of  Lokayukta  of Orissa State was
under challenge before the High Court in a public interest  petition.
The High Court set aside the appointment. The matter was carried 
before the Apex Court.  The Apex Court, noticed that <a href="/doc/1110656/" id="a_112">section 3(1)</a> of
the Act provided that    for the purpose of conducting the
investigation  in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the
Governor  shall appoint a person to be known as Lokpal   and one or
more persons to be known as  as the Lokayukta or Lakayuktas.   It is
further  provided that "the Lokpal shall be appointed  after
consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court of Orissa  and
the Leader of the Opposition, if any".  In this background,
reversing the decision of the High Court, the Supreme Court held and
observed as under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_247">"12.
</p><p id="p_248">In context of the aforesaid functions of the Lokpal and the required
qualification of a person who is to be appointed to hold such office,
the word 'consultation' used in <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_113">Section 3</a> is required to be
interpreted. As provided under<a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_114"> S. 3</a>, a person is not qualified to
be appointed as Lokpal unless he is or has been a Judge of the
Supreme Court or of a High Court. In the context of the functions
which are to be discharged by the Lokpal, it is apparent that they
are of utmost importance in seeing that unpolluted administration of
the State is maintained and mal-administration as defined under<a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_115"> S.
2(h)</a> is exposed so that appropriate action against such
mal-administration and administrator could be taken. The
investigation which Lokpal is required to carry out is that of
quasi-judicial nature which would envisage not only knowledge of law,
but also of the nature and work which is required to be discharged by
an administrator. In this context, the word 'consultation' used in
Section 3(1) Proviso (a) would require that consultation with the
Chief Justice of the High Court of Orissa is must or sine qua non.
For such appointment, Chief Justice of the High Court would be the
best person for proposing and suggesting such person for being
appointed as Lokpal. His opinion would be totally independent and he
would be in a position to find out who is most or more suitable for
the said office. In this context, primacy is required to be given to
the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court. It is true
that proviso (a) provides that Leader of the Opposition, if there is
any, is also required to be consulted. Therefore, if there is no
Leader of Opposition, consultation is not required.  This would
indicate nature of such consultation and which is to apprise him of
the proposed action but his opinion is not binding to the Government.
At the same time, his views or objections are to be taken into
consideration. If something is adverse against the person proposed by
the Government, he would be entitled to express his views and point
it out to the Government. This, however, would not mean that he could
suggest some other name and the Government is required to consider
it. It would, therefore, be open to the Government to override the
opinion given by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the
appointment of a Lokpal who is statutorily required to be a sitting
or retired Judge of the Supreme Court or of a HIgh Court. Under
<a href="/doc/1110656/" id="a_116">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act, there is no question of initiation of
proposal by the leader of the Opposition.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_249">xxx
 


xxx
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_250">16.
Applying the principle enunciated in the aforesaid judgment, Scheme
of <a href="/doc/1110656/" id="a_117">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act read with the functions to be discharged
by the Lokpal and the nature of his qualification, it is apparent
that the consultation with the Chief Justice is mandatory and his
opinion would have primacy. The nature of the consultation with
the Leader of the Opposition is to apprise him about the proposal of
selecting a person to the post and also to take his views on the said
proposal. However, the opinion rendered by the Leader of the
Opposition is not binding  on the State Government and the Leader of
the Opposition would have no power to recommend someone else for the
said post."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_251">26.2		As
noticed  previously, a Division Bench of the  Jharkhand High Court in
the case of  Ajit Kumar (supra) was also examining the nature of 
consultation between the Chief Justice and the Chief Minister in
selecting a name of for appointment of Lokayukta.   Justice
S.J.Mukhopadhaya  delivering a concurring, but separate judgment
stressed the need for  proper consultation.   It was observed that
the matter of consultation should not be dealt in the like manner  as
dealt  in that case.  He observed that  consultation with the high
dignitaries like the Chief Justice and Leader of Opposition of the
State Assembly should not be negated on unreasonable ground giving a
colour that the Council of Ministers  who will fall within the domain
of the Lokayukta do not like to have a Lokayukta or intend to have 
Lokayukta  of their choice, which is against the spirit of Lokayukta
Act.  It was further observed that once the consultation is made, the
matter should not have been sent back to the Council of Ministers,
but in accordance with the  provisions of the Act,  it should be
referred to the Governor of the State. If initially the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers is taken, the Governor  is not
required to take  again the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers, but to act taking into consideration the consultation  as
made.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_252">27.	From
the above decisions and particularly of the Apex Court in case of
Justice K.P.Mohapatra (supra) it clearly emerges that consultation 
with the Chief Justice is mandatory and his view would   hold
primacy. Even independently,  we are of the view that in identifying
the name for  appointment of  Lokayukta, it is the Chief Justice's
view,  in case of difference between the two dignitaries to the
consultation, which must prevail.    We say so, because, the very
nature of functions and duties  the  Lokayukta is likely to perform
under the Act would require  appointment of an independent person who
in  the view of the Chief Justice  is best suited for such a
position.  The actions of the  the  Council of Ministers, so also the
Leader of Opposition, by the very nature of position  held by them, 
be subjected to investigation that the Lokayukta may have to
undertake.   It is only the Chief Justice, the third dignitary to the
consultation process, who has no personal stake in the matter. Being
the Chief Justice of the State, he  would be the best suited  to
recommend the name of a person, who,  in his opinion, would  be able
to perform such duties independently.   We further notice that the
Act envisages  appointment of even a sitting Judge of the High Court.
 It will be  inconceivable  that against the will and wish of the
Chief Justice, the Council of Ministers   and even with the
concurrence of the Leader of Opposition   can decide to appoint a
sitting Judge of the High Court as Lokayukta.   It is one more
indication  for us to hold that in case of  break down of
consultation between the Chief Minister and the Chief Justice, on the
question of selection of  name, it would be the Chief Justice's view 
which must prevail.   Various provisions  of the Act convince us that
the Act  envisages  a strong institution  of Lokayukta  to
investigate allegations of irregularities and corruption against 
public functionaries.  It starts with appointment of an independent
Lokayukta  who is or has been a Judge of a High Court and who is
recommended by the Chief Justice  of the State.  We fail to see  how
such a purpose would be subserved if  finality of the choice is
vested in the executive whose  actions directly or indirectly may
come within the   scanner of the Lokayukta.   In case of   Center for
PIL and another (supra) [(2011) 4 SCC 1] the Apex Court discussed the
concept of "institutional integrity".  We do not see how
"Institutional integrity" of Lokayukta can be  preserved 
by giving primacy to the opinion of the Council of Ministers over
that of the Chief Justice.   As envisaged  in the  Interim Report of
the Commission, the Lokayukta  was to have status of the highest 
Judiciary.  We may not equate  the institution of Lokayukta with a
court and may not  import all concepts which go with the requirement
of independence of judiciary; nevertheless, leaving the finality of
choice of appointment to the Council of Ministers  would be  akin to
allowing a person whose conduct is likely to be under investigation
to choose his own judge.  
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_253"> Whether
there was a dead lock
 

 


 


</p><p id="p_254">28.		This
brings us to the next question, namely,  whether or not there was any
dead lock between  the Chief Minister and the Chief Justice or 
between the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister and the
Chief Justice of the State.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_255">29.		Much
has been stated before us  by the learned Advocate General in this
regard.  Taking us painstakingly  through various file notings, it
was contended that the Chief Minister, through correspondence had
placed the concerns of the Council of Ministers  before the Chief
Justice.   Though the first letter  dated 16th June 2011
was replied to by the Chief Justice,  the Chief Minister wrote
another letter dated 18th August 2011 and elaborated the
objections to the name recommended by the Chief Justice.   It was
submitted that such communication was yet to be taken into account
and replied to.  The Chief Justice  had not  turned down the  request
of the State  for reconsideration of the name.   At such a moment, it
cannot be concluded that the consultation process between the Chief
Minister and the Chief Justice had been terminated resulting into a
dead-lock.    
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_256">30.		From
the record, we, however,  find the facts somewhat different.  
Firstly, after recommending the  name of Shri R.A.Mehta, as Lokayukta
by the Chief Justice,  the Chief Minister   raised  certain  concerns
over the selection of the name vide communication dated  16th
June 2011. The Chief Justice by his letter dated  2nd
August 2011 went on record to state  that he tried to gather all the
details about the activities of Shri R.A.Mehta. He found that there
is no  such activity which makes him ineligible  for appointment to
the post of Lokayukta.  According  to the Chief Justice,   he is a
man of high repute and integrity and always maintained high
reputation  while he was in Judiciary  and still he is maintaining
high standards in the Society.   With these remarks, the Chief
Justice concluded that the matter be taken up with the Council of
Ministers   for forwarding the name of Shri R.A.Mehta   to the
Governor for appointment as Lokayukta.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_257">31.		It
is, of course, true that that on 18th August 2011,  the
Chief Minister  wrote a letter to the Chief Justice.   In fact,  the
Chief Minister  wrote two letters, one letter was  addressed to the
Chief Justice  giving details of the concerns of the Council of
Ministers appointing  Shri R.A.Mehta  as Lokayukta. The Chief
Minister  significantly concluded the issue by stating as under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_258">"Although,
I have no personal reservation against the name of Hon'ble Mr.Justice
(Retired) R.A.Mehta, but as the  Head of the State Government, I
am afraid, I may not be  able to accept the name of Hon'ble Mr
Justice (Retired) R.A.Mehta, who, in my view, cannot be  considered
the most suitable choice  for the august post of Lokayukta, Gujarat
State."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_259">Similar
letter was also addressed by the Chief Minister  to the  Governor, on
18th August 2011 in which,  it was once again stated that
:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_260">"In
so far as the recent letter dated 2nd August 2011 from the
Hon. Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court is concerned, I may
inform you that the name recommended therein has not been accepted by
the State Government for certain specific  and valid reasons."
</p> 
	 



 


<p id="p_261">Insofar
as the  Council of Ministers is concerned, therefore, question of 
appointing Shri R.A.Mehta  as  Lokayukta was closed. In view of  what
was conveyed by the Chief Minister to the Chief Justice and the
Governor, the State had finally and conclusively and in no uncertain
terms conveyed  the stand that in so far as Shri R.A. Mehta is
concerned,  his name  was  not acceptable.  When one talks of
consultation,  it cannot be a one way consultation.  We fail to see  
what further   consultation  was  left to be made  between the Chief
Justice and the Chief Minister if the view of the Council of
Ministers was  that name of Shri R.A.Mehta is simply not acceptable. 
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_262">31.1		In
addition to the above stand emerging from the record, we also find
that  at the very moment when such correspondence was going on 
between two dignitaries, the Council of Ministers had recommended
issuance of an Ordinance which would  change the entire  set up of
Lokayukta as also the manner of selection of Lokayukta.  As already
noted, the Governor was requested   to issue an Ordinance on 17th
August 2011.  This Ordinance, if promulgated, would have changed the
manner of appointment  of Lokayukta.  It would in fact, change the
very constitution of Lokayukta.  Instead of the previous provisions
which envisaged one man Lokayukta, the new provisions envisaged 
Lokayukta as Chairperson and upto maximum of two members  who could
form the institution of Lokayukta.  Appointment to such post would be
 made by a Committee  consisting of the Chief Minister, Speaker of
the Legislative Assembly,  the Minister  In-charge of the Legal
Department, a sitting Judge  of the High Court, as may be nominated
by the Chief Justice  and the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative
Assembly.   Even the role of the Chief Justice in recommending  a
person to be appointed  as Chairperson was to undergo a significant
change.  Proviso to sub-section (3)  to the  amended  <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_118">section 3</a>  
would provide that no sitting Judge of the High Court shall be
appointed  as a Chairperson except after consultation with the Chief
Justice of the High Court.   In other words, consultation with the
Chief Justice, previously required  for appointment  of a sitting
Judge or a Retired Judge of the High Court was minimized to
consulting the Chief Justice only when a sitting Judge  of the High
Court  was sought to be appointed as Chairperson.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_263">31.2		When
such Ordinance was returned  by the Governor for reconsideration,
once again a fresh Ordinance was sent on or around 20th 
August 2011. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_264">32.		We
are not looking  at the propriety of issuance of such ordinance or
legality of the provisions contained therein.  This issue is not at
large before us.  We are not even accepting the contention of the 
counsel Shri  Girish Patel  that such ordinance was issued wholly
malafide.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_265">33.		One
inescapable conclusion, however, one reaches  is that in so far as
the Council of Ministers is  concerned, there was nothing left in the
consultation  with respect to the name of Shri R.A.Mehta.  On one
hand, on 18th August 2011, the Chief Minister wrote to the
Chief Justice as well as to the Governor of the State  that name of
Shri R.A Mehta  is not acceptable and on the other    a day before
i.e. on 17.8.2011,  Council of Ministers requested the Governor to
promulgate an ordinance which would change  not only the manner of
selection  of Lokayukta, but the very constitution of the Lokayukta 
itself.  It may be well within the State's  legislative powers 
powers to do so.  In the present case,  all that we conclude is that
in so far as the name of Shri R.A. Mehta is  concerned, there was
nothing left  to be consulted  between the Chief Minister and the
Chief Justice and there was a dead lock. 
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_266"> Was
the Governor authorized to act in the manner she did ?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_267">34.		This
brings us to the last and most crucial aspect of the matter, namely, 
was the Governor authorized to act in the manner  which she did  ? 
To be able to discuss this issue, we would like to  delve  at some
length on the background leading to the enactment of the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act as well as various provisions  made under the said Act.
</p> 

 


 


 


<p id="p_268">34.1		Statement
of objects and reasons for enacting the Act records  that in the 
Interim Report   on Problems of redress of citizens' Grievances 
submitted in 1966, the Administrative Reforms Committee  recommended
inter alia  setting up a institution of Lokayukta to inquire into the
complaint of corruption in administration.  To give effect to this
recommendation of the Administrative Reforms Committee,  the State
Government had  published the Gujarat Lokpal and Lakayukta Bill 1975.
 The bill was referred  to the Government of India  for
administrative approval.  The Government of India had made certain
suggestions  in respect of the bill. The bill, however, lapsed  on
account of dissolution of  the State Assembly.  The present bill was
introduced on the same line as the earlier one, after  incorporating
some of the suggestions made by the Government of India.   The main
object of the bill was to provide for appointment of Lokayukta to
inquire into the complaints in respect of the actions taken by the
public functionaries.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_269">35.		We
have perused the interim report of the  Administrative Reforms
Commission ('Commission' for short).   The Commission  consisted of
Shri Morarji Desai as Chairman, and included   Shri  Harish Chandra
Mathur, Shri H.V.Kamath and Shri V.Shankar  as other  members.  The
Commission was appointed by the President of India with terms of
reference, which included, to give consideration to the need for 
ensuring the highest standard  of efficiency and integrity in public
services and for making  public administration  a fit instrument for
carrying out the social and economic policies of the Government   and
achieving social and economic goals of development, as also one which
is responsive  to the people.   The Commission was required to  deal
with problems  of  redressal of citizens'  grievances, namely,  the
adequacy of the existing arrangements for the redress  of grievances,
and the need for introduction of  any new  machinery for special
institution   for redress of grievances.  The Committee, in its
interim report, observed as  under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_270">"While
our other terms of reference, by and large, cover problems of
established administration, this item breaks comparatively new
ground; yet it is basic to the functioning of a democratic
Government. It touches both the administration and the citizen at the
most sensitive point of their relationship and raises the very
crucial issue of the contentment, or otherwise of the common citizen
with the manner in which the administration implements the policies
of Government. The problem was thrown up in bold relief and in its
full impact on the citizen in the very first round of our discussions
with the Ministers of the Central Government and the Congress
President; its importance, urgency and dimensions have been
increasingly impressed upon us by the large volume of both official
and non official opinion which we have had the opportunity of
consulting so far. The commission was so impressed by both the
unanimity and the strength of the popular demand on this subject that
it decided to devote itself to this problem rather than from a
separate group for the specific purpose of devising a scheme to
enable the citizen to seek redress for an administrative injustice.
The more the commission considered this issue, the more was it
convinced that the problem brooked no delay. We have no doubt that an
urgent solution of this problem will strengthen  the hands of
Government in administering the laws of the land, its policies
"without fear or favour, affection or ill-will" and
enable it to gain public faith and confidence without which social
and economic progress would be impossible. In coming to this
conclusion, the Commission has taken note of the oft-expressed public
outcry against the prevalence of corruption, the existence of
widespread inefficiency and the unresponsiveness of administration to
popular needs. The Commission feels that the answer to this outcry
lies not in expressions or reiteration of Government's general
satisfaction with the administration's achievements or its attempts
generally to justify itself but in the provision of a machinery which
will examine such complaints and sift the genuine from the false or
the untenable so that administration's failures and achievements can
be publicly viewed in their correct perspective. Even from the point
of view of protection to the services, such an institution is
necessary for projecting their image on the public in its true
character and for ensuring that the average citizen is not fed on
prejudices, assumptions and false notions of their quality and
standards. From all these points of view, the Commission has
considered itself obliged to make an interim report on this term of
reference." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_271">35.1	The
Commission  in the report, thereafter, examined the existing
safeguards  for the citizens and the deficiency   in the existing 
safeguards, particularly with respect to the facilities  available
for ventilation  of citizens' grievances.    The Commission noted 
the growing encroachment of the State on citizens' rights after  the
World Wars and more so since independence.    The Commission noted 
the vast area of administrative  discretion  in which facilities for 
citizens grievance is not available.  The Commission, therefore,
noted that  in  essence, the main issue before it  was   how  to
provide the citizen  with an institution  to which he can have  easy
access for the redress of his grievances  and which he is unable to
seek elsewhere.    The Commission noted  that the basic problem has
been attracting considerable notice and the need  for an authority to
deal with cases of corruption in the ranks  of Government  and the
same has also engaged  the attention of popular representatives  of
India  for several years.  The Commission further noted that  several
 strong legislations have been recommended, such as Prevention of
Corruption bill, Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 1952, Commission of
Inquiry Bill, 1952, etc.   the Commission also, took note  of the 
debates  for the need for setting up an institution of 
Ombudsman-type in India  which need was strongly stressed and
supported by late Shri Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_272">35.2
		The Commission noted the pattern of Ombudsman  established in
various countries, such as,  in Scandinavian countries, New Zealand
and United Kingdom and noted that  common pattern of such institution
is that  position of Ombudsman  is analogous  to that  of the  
highest or high judicial functionaries in the country.  He is left
comparatively free to choose his own methods  and agencies of
investigation.    The Commission felt that in our country also, such
pattern can be  suitably adapted  to our needs.  Such institutions 
are generally  a supplement  to the Parliamentary control,
independent of any political  affiliations, outside the normal
administrative hierarchy  and free from formalism, publicity  and
delay associated with Governmental  machinery.   They work 
unobtrusively  to remove  the sense of injustice  from the mind  of
the adversely affected  citizen  and yet uphold  in a very large 
measure  the prestige  and authority of the administration,
instilling  public confidence in its efficiency and faith in its
working and introducing a proper perspective of it in the mind  of
the public.   The Commission, then went on to notice some of the
difficulties  in setting up a replica of Ombudsman  kind of an
institution, but also discussed  and concluded that   all
difficulties pointed out are not insurmountable.   The Commission,
after careful consideration,  was of the opinion that the ministerial
decisions should also be  brought within the  scope of the functions
of the Lokayukta. The Commission  was of the opinion that  even after
 considering the political  aspect of such decision, in fact the same
would strengthen the hands of the Prime Minister rather than  be 
weakened by the institution.   The Commission,  thereupon,
recommended   an institution  for redress of citizens' grievances
comprising one authority dealing with complaint against the
administrative acts of the  Ministers  or Secretaries  to the
Government at the Center and in the States.  The Commission,
envisaged  another authority in each State  and at the centre for
dealing with the complaint against the administrative  acts of other
officials.  The Commission   observed that public opinion  has been  
agitated  for a long time over the prevalence  of corruption  in the
administration and it is likely  that cases coming up before the
independent  authorities might involve  allegations or actual
evidence of corrupt motive and favouritism.    The Commission opined
that  the institution should deal with such cases as well, except in
cases where they might involve criminal charge or  misconduct 
cognizable by a court, the case  should be  brought to the notice of
the Prime Minister  or the Chief Minister, as the case may be.    The
Commission envisaged  following main features  of the institutions of
Lokpal and Lokayukta.:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_273">"25.
</p><p id="p_274">The following would be the main features of the institutions of
Lokpal and Lokayukta-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_275">(a)	They
should be demonstrably independent and impartial.
</p> 


<p id="p_276">(b)	Their
investigations and proceedings should be conducted in private and
should be conducted in private and should be informal in character.
</p> 


<p id="p_277">(c)	Their
appointment should, as far as possible, be non-political.
</p> 


<p id="p_278">(d)	Their
status should compare with the highest judicial functionaries in the
country.
</p> 


<p id="p_279">(e)	They
should deal with matters in the discretionary field involving acts of
injustice, corruption or favouritism.
</p> 


<p id="p_280">(f)	Their
proceedings should not be subject to judicial interference and they
should have the maximum latitude and powers in obtaining information
relevant to their duties.
</p> 


<p id="p_281">(g)	They
should not look forward to any benefit or pecuniary advantage from
the executive Government.
</p> 


 

 


<p id="p_282">Bearing
in mind these essential features of the institution, we recommend
that the Lokpal be appointed and invested with functions in the 
manner described in the succeeding paragraphs."
</p> 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_283">36.	It
was on the basis of this  interim report that the Lokayukta Act, 1986
was  enacted.  The draft bill suggested  by the  Commission, of
course, differs in some significant areas from the Act promulgated by
the State.   Nevertheless, the background leading to the Act is of
considerable importance and interest for our purpose.    With this
background, the Act was enacted "to make provision for
appointment  of Lokayukta for the investigation of allegations 
against public functionaries in the State of Gujarat  and also for
safeguarding the dignity and prestige of public functionaries 
against  false and frivolous allegations and for matters  connected
therewith".

	may be prescribed in consultation with the Lokayukta.    Under

	is equated with that of the Chief Justice of the State.  Further 
	proviso to <a href="/doc/1113701/" id="a_185">section 5</a> ensures that allowances, pension and other
	conditions of service of Lokayukta  cannot be varied to his
	disadvantage after his appointment.  
</p>	

 

 


 

<p id="p_370">37.1		It
can thus be seen that the Act envisages  three pronged approach to 
ensure that the person to be appointed as Lokayukta is independent
and is allowed to and continues to function independently throughout
his  term.  Firstly, he must be or must have been a Judge of a High
Court.  His appointment must  be in consultation with the Chief
Justice of the State.  He cannot have any political affiliations.  He
cannot hold membership of the Union or State Legislatures.    He 
cannot hold any office of profit or business connection with the
Government.  This would ensure appointment of an independent person. 
 Secondly,  his tenure is  guaranteed.  His service conditions 
cannot be varied to his disadvantage.   He is  immune from  legal
action for any act  done in discharge of his duties.  He is given
wide powers  to collect evidence and engage his own staff. All these
will ensure independence of the institution of  Lokayukta.   
Thirdly, after ceasing to hold the office,  he is disqualified from
holding any office or employment under the State  Government,
Government Company or University to ensure total impartiality.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_371">38.		It
can thus be seen that the Act envisages set up of a strong
institution of Lokayukta, only upon which  the holder of the office 
can effectively discharge the functions and duties   envisaged under
the Act.   As already noted, the Act empowers him to investigate into
either a complaint received from citizen or suo motu allegations
against public functionaries  and make a report.  If an institution
like this is not empowered  to effectively  carry out such
investigation, the entire authority of the institution would
completely erode.  It is  precisely for this reason, under the Act, 
the Lokayukta has been entrusted with  wide powers  in discharge of
his functions   particularly for   carrying out the investigation
into the complaint made against the public functionaries.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_372">38.1	
Simultaneously, to protect and safeguard the public functionaries 
against any frivolous and false allegations several  provisions have 
been made under the Act.  For example,  under sub-section (4) of
<a href="/doc/349271/" id="a_186">section 10</a>,  the Lokayukta  may refuse to investigate  or discontinue
any investigation which may have been initiated if, in his opinion,
the complaint is  frivolous  or vexatious or is not made in good
faith or there are no sufficient grounds for investigating or
continuing such investigation.  Sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/333863/" id="a_187">section 9</a> provides
that any person who willfully or maliciously makes any false
allegations  in a complaint under the Act shall on conviction be
punished with imprisonment  for a term which may extend to two years
and shall also be liable to file. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_373">38.2		<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_188">The
Act</a> has therefore a dual purpose.  On the one hand, it aims to
provide for an effective machinery   for a citizen to ventilate his
grievance  against any irregular act by the public functionary and to
investigate in such complaint or to initiate investigation suo motu.
As already noted, number of statutory provisions have been made to
ensure installation of an independent Lokayukta and further to ensure
that such Lokayukta  during his term in office can  discharge his
function independently and effectively, without fear or favour. 
Simultaneously, while doing so, the Act  also aims at  protecting the
public functionaries  against frivolous and vexatious allegations by 
  authorizing the Lokayukta to refuse to investigate  any such
complaint as also by providing punishment  for willful malicious and
false allegations.

political democracy. In other words, they frown upon gender
discrimination and aim at elimination of obstacles  to enjoy social,
economic, political and cultural rights on equal footing. Law is a
living organism and its utility depends on its vitality and ability
to serve as sustaining pillar of society. Contours of law in an
evolving society must constantly keep changing as civilisation
and culture advances. The customs and mores undergo change with
march  of time. Justice to the individual is one of the highest

<p id="p_386">40.2		In

under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_387">"36.
</p><p id="p_388">It has to be reiterated that sales tax laws in all the States provide
for exemption. It is well-settled that the different entries in lists
I, II and III of the 7th Schedule deal with the fields of
legislation, and these should be construed widely, liberally and
harmoniously. And these entries have been construed to include
ancillary or incidental power. Power to grant exemption is inherent
in all taxing legislations. Economic unity is a desired goal,
economic equilibrium and prosperity is also the goal. Development on
parity is one of the commitments of the Constitution. Directive
principles enshrined in Arts. 38 and 39 must be harmonised with
economic unity as well as economic development of developed and
under-developed areas. In that light on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_192">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution,
it is necessary that the prohibitions in <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_193">Art. 301</a> and the scope of
<a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_194">Art. 304(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_195">(b)</a> should be understood and construed.
Constitution is a living organism and the latent meaning of the
expressions used can be given effect to only if a particular
situation arises. It is not that with changing times the
meaning changes but changing times illustrate and illuminate the
meaning of the expressions used. The connotation of the expressions
used takes its shape and colour in evolving dynamic situations. A
backward State or a disturbed State cannot with parity engage in
competition with advanced or developed States. Even within a State,
there are often backward areas which can be developed only if some
special incentives are
granted. If the incentives in the form of subsidies or grant are
given to any part of units of a State so that it may come out
of its limping or infancy to compete as equals with others, that, in
our opinion, does not and cannot contravene the spirit and the letter
of Part XIII of the Constitution. However, this is permissible only
if there is a valid reason, that is to say, if there are justifiable
and rational reasons for differentiation. If there is none, it will
amount to hostile discrimination. Judged in this light, despite the
submissions of Mr. Sanjay Parikh and Mr. Vaidyanathan, we are unable
to accept the contentions that the petitioners sought to urge in this
application."

choose the one which will be in accord with the other parts of the

other which leads to absurdity, confusion, or friction, contradiction
and conflict between its various provisions, or undermines, or tends
to defeat or destroy the basic scheme and purpose of the enactment.
These canons of construction apply to the interpretation of our
Constitution with greater force, because the Constitution is a living
integrated organism, having a soul and consciousness of its own. The
pulse beats emanating from the spinal cord of the basic framework can
be felt all over its body, even in the extremities of its limbs.
Constitutional exposition is not mere literary garniture, nor a mere
exercise in grammar. As one of us (Chandrachud J. as he then was)
put it in Kesavananda Bharati's case (AIR 1973 SC 1461) "while
interpreting words in a solemn document like the Constitution, one
must look at them not in a school-masterly fashion, not with the cold
eye of a lexicographer, but with the realization that they occur in
'a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on the
others' so that the construction must hold a balance between all its
parts".

respect to th extent  of incapacities, system-wide, in terms of
institutional resources, skills and knowledge, as well as about
incapacities of ethical nature, in keeping an account of the monies
generated by various facets of social action in the country, and
thereby developing effective mechanisms of control.  These
incapacities go to the very heart of constitutional imperatives of
governance.  Whether such incapacities are on account of not having
devoted enough resources towards building such capacities, or on
account of a broader culture of venality in the   wider spheres of
social and political action, they run afoul of constitutional
impertinents.

individuals or groups in the social and economic sphere, the reason

support to those who benefit from such predatory capitalism, often
violating the human rights of its citizens, particularly its poor,

addition, it would also appear that in this miasmic cultural
environment in which greed is extolled, conspicuous consumption
viewed as both necessary and socially valuable, and the wealthy
viewed as demigods, the agents  of the State may have also succumbed
to the notions of the neoliberal paradigm that the role of the State
ought to only be an enabling one, and not exercise significant
control.  This attitude would have  a significant impact on exercise
of discretion, especially in the context of regulating economic
activities, including keeping an account of the monies generated in
various activities, both legal and illegal, Carried away by the
ideology of neoliberalism, it is entirely possible that the agents of
the State entrusted with the task of supervising the economic and
social activities may err more on the side of extreme caution,
whereby signals of wrong doing may be ignored even when they are
strong.  Instances of the powers that be ignoring publicly visible
stock market scams, or turning a blind eye to large scale illegal
mining have become  all too familiar, and may be  readily cited. That
such activities are allowed to continue to occur, with weak, or
non-existent, responses from the State may, at best, be charitably
ascribed to this broader culture of permissibility of all manner of
private activities in search of ever more lucre.  ....."

Bharati [(1973) 4 SCC 225] in the following manner:  
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_403">"The
majority judgment in Kesavananda Bharti conceded to Parliament the
right to make alterations in the Constitution so long as they were
within the basic framework. The Preamble assured the people of India
of policy whose basic structure was described therein as a Sovereign
Democratic Republic; Parliament could make any amendments to the
Constitution as it deemed expedient so long as they did not damage or
destroy India's sovereignty and its democratic, republican character.
Democracy was a meaningful concept whose essential attributes were
recited in the Preamble itself : Justice, social, economic and
political : Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and
worship; and Equality of status and opportunity. Its aim, again as
set out in the Preamble, was to promote among the people an abiding
sense of 'Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the
unity of the Nation'. The newly introduced clause (5) demolished the
very pillars on which the  Preamble rested by empowering Parliament
to exercise its constituent power without any "limitation
whatever". No constituent power could conceivably go higher than
the power conferred by clause (5) for it empowered Parliament even to
"repeal the provisions of this Constitution", that is to
say, to abrogate democracy and substitute for it a totally
antithetical form of government. That could most effectively be
achieved, without calling democracy by any other name, by denial of
social, economic and political justice to the people, by emasculating
liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship and by
abjuring commitment to the magnificent ideal of a society of equals.
The power to destroy was not a power to amendment. Since the
Constitution had conferred a limited amending power on Parliament,
Parliament could not under the exercise of that limited power enlarge
that very power into an absolute power. A limited amending power was
one of the basic features of the Constitution and, therefore, the
limitations on that power could not be destroyed. In other words,
Parliament could not, under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_199">Art. 368</a>, expand its amending power so as
to acquire for itself the right to repeal or abrogate the
Constitution or to destroy its basic and essential features. The
donee of a limited power could not by the exercise of that power
confer the limited power into an unlimited one."

Constitutional provisions are required to be understood and
interpreted with an object oriented approach. A Constitution must not
be construed in a narrow and pedantic sense. The words used may be
general in terms but, their full import and true meaning, has to be
appreciated considering the true context in which the same are used
and the purpose which they seek to achieve. Debates in the
Constituent Assembly referred to in an earlier part of this judgment
clearly indicates that non-member's inclusion in the cabinet was
considered to be a 'privilege' that extends only for six months,'
during which period the member must get elected otherwise he would
cease to be a Minister. It is a settled position that debates in the
Constituent Assembly may be relied upon as an aid to interpret a
constitutional provision because it is the function of the Court to
find out the intention of the framers of the Constitution. We must
remember that a Constitution is not just a document in solemn form,
but a living framework for the Government of the people exhibiting a
sufficient degree of cohesion and its successful working depends upon
the democratic spirit underlying it being respected in letter and in
spirit. The debates clearly indicate the 'privilege' to extend "only"
for six months.

<p id="p_409">34.
The very concept of responsible Government and representative
democracy signifies Government by the people. In constitutional
terms, it denotes that the sovereign power which resides in the
people is exercised on their behalf by their chosen representatives
and for exercise of those powers, the representatives are necessarily
accountable to the people for what they do. The Members of the
Legislature, thus, must owe their power directly or indirectly to the
people. The Members of the State Assemblies like Lok Sabha trace
their power directly as elected by the people while the Members of
the Council of State like Rajya Sabha owe it to the people indirectly
since they are chosen by the representative of the people. The
Council of Minister of which a Chief Minister is head in the State
and on whose aid and advice the Governor has to act, must, therefore
owe their power to the people directly or indirectly.

India is a Democratic Republic. Its chosen system of political
organisation is reflected in The Preamble to the Constitution, which
indicates the source from which the Constitution comes, viz., "WE
THE PEOPLE OF INDIA". By permitting a non-legislator Minister to
be reappointed,without getting elected with the period prescribed by
<a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_201">Article 164(4</a>), would amount to ignoring the electorate in having its
say as to who should represent it - a position which is wholly
unacceptable. The seductive temptations to cling to office regardless
of constitutional restraint must be totally eschewed. Will of the
people cannot be permitted to be subordinated to political expediency
of the Prime Minster or the Chief Minister as the case may be, to
have in his cabinet a non-legislator as a Minister for an indefinite
period by repeated reappointments without the individual seeking
popular mandate of the electorate.

We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that it would be
subverting the Constitution to permit an individual, who is not a
member of the Legislature, to be appointed a Minister repeatedly for
a term of "six consecutive months", without him getting
himself elected in the meanwhile. The practice would be clearly
derogatory to the constitutional scheme, improper, undemocratic and
invalid. <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_202">Article 164(4)</a> is at best only in the nature of an exception
to the normal rule of only members of the Legislature being
Ministers, restricted to a short period of six consecutive months.
This exception is essentially required to be used to meet very
extraordinary situation and must be strictly construed and sparingly
used. The clear mandate of <a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_203">Article 164(4)</a> that if an individual
concerned is not able to get elected to the legislature within the
grace period of six consecutive months, he shall cease to be a
Minister, cannot be allowed to be frustrated by giving a gap of few
days and reappointing the individual as a Minister, without his
securing confidence of the electorate in the meanwhile. Democratic
process which lies at the core of our Constitutional schemes cannot
be permitted to be flouted in this manner."
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_414">In
the above case, the Apex Court considering a situation where a person
who was not a member of the Legislative  Assembly was appointed as
Minister  and within six months as envisaged  under the Constitution,
he did not  get himself elected and sought re-nomination as a
Minister.  It was contended that  there is no embargo on
reappointment as a Minister  even though the period of six months
envisaged under the Constitution  for getting himself elected was
over.  It was in such a context, the above observations were made by
the Apex Court.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_415">42.		We
may notice that under the Act  even while making the position of
Lokayukta  immune from any outside pressures, his ultimate  decision
is left either for the political system or people to  judge.   The
recommendation that the Lokayukta may make is neither binding nor
compulsory to be  acted upon.    If the recommendation is against 
the Chief Minister of the State, it would be sufficient if the same
is placed before the Council of Ministers. There is no further 
obligation to act upon the same.   If it is against any other person,
the same shall be referred to the competent  authority.  The
competent authority will examine the report  and  intimate  the
Lokayukta the action taken or proposed  on the basis of the report.
In a given case he may take no action.   <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_204">The Act</a> does not  expect 
any further steps than this.  However, the Act leaves aftermath  or
fall-out of any adverse  indictment to the maturity of the political
system or ultimately for the people to  judge, the action to be taken
in such a case. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_416">42.1		In
an electoral system,  people are required to make their choice with
respect to the policies and principles of different political outfits
with different political idealogies.    Such choice must be  an
informed choice  to be made on the basis of  accurate  information. 
It is in this respect that the Act, to our mind, has a significant
role to play.  The existing  conventional  systems of redressel of 
grievances are time consuming.   It  can be easily seen that it would
be a while before the people  would get the correct information about
the allegations  made  against the  public functionaries.  Filing of
FIR  itself is not sufficient since anyone can approach the
Investigating Agency with a complaint   and if there is prima facie
disclosure of commission of  cognizable offence, the Investigating
Agency is  bound to register a FIR.    Completion of  investigation
and filing of chargesheet also may not be a sufficient  proof of
involvement of any person, since it is only an Investigating Agency's
opinion that there is sufficient material to proceed against the
accused.   Often times, the Investigating Agency, it is alleged,  is
controlled by the people in power.  Framing  of charge by  the
competent criminal court  also would  only indicate that the Court is
of the opinion that there is   sufficient material on record to
proceed against the accused and nothing more.  Achieving conviction
or for that matter acquittal, often  consumes considerable time. 
Application for discharge,  appeals and revisions are inbuilt in our
judicial system.  An acquittal recorded by the competent court also 
may not always  clear the cloud for  the person facing serious
allegations of corruption, since often times,  acquittal is a result
of either faulty  or insufficient investigation or  benefit of doubt
following the witnesses turning  hostile or a technical flaw  such as
 non-obtaining of sanction for  prosecution though required under the
law. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_417">43.	For
the people to make an informed choice at the electoral proceedings,
an investigation report of  Lokayukta, to our mind would and is
envisaged to play an  extremely important role.  As already noted,
Lokayukta is  a person who is  of  unimpeachable  character who  is
or has been Judge of a High Court, whose recommendation is made  by
none other than the Chief Justice, who  once  appointed cannot be
disturbed for  period of 5  years, who is allowed to choose his own
procedures,  to choose his own staff and officers and is clothed with
powers of a civil court in collecting evidence.  Till the final
report is made,  the identity of the complainant or the person
complained against is not to be disclosed.    This would also  ensure
that a person's image  is not  tarnished by mere making of 
allegations.   <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_205">The Act</a> thus  achieves dual purpose.  On one hand
report made by the Lokayukta after full investigation if makes
indictment of any public functionary, it would have its own effect
and political fall out.  At any rate it would provide vital
information to the  people who will decide the political future of
the person in the next election.  On the other hand a clean chit
given by the Lokayukta would  also clear the person of false  and
baseless allegation.  In a electoral    system, often times, it is
not important whether the persons is  or is not guilty.  It is
important  what people perceive  whether he is or he is not guilty. 
By merely making allegations  sometimes therefore,  it is possible to
damage a person irreparably.  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_206">The Act</a> thus can be a powerful  tool to
expose as also to clear those public functionaries against whom 
false allegations may have been made.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_418">43.1		
Democracy is  recognized as  a basic  future of our Constitution. 
Clean governance is the  essence of democracy.   It is also the
crying  need of the day.  The regularity with which  allegations of
corruption are  made against various  public functionaries makes it
essential to create and nurture a strong and independent institution
of Lokayukta who can separate the chaff  from the grain and present
before the people true facts. The scales of alleged corruption are
benumbing.  Institution of Lokayukta  therefore, assumes  greater
significance than ever before.   Its importance cannot be overstated.
 Its existence cannot be left to the discretion of the executive. 
This is the only way to interpret the provisions  of the  Act so as
to fulfill the aspirations of the people. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_419">44.		We
have already noted certain decisions  where the Apex Court  has held 
that the Governor can  in exceptional circumstances  act in his/her
discretion.  Such  areas are  recognized  by   various decisions of
the Apex Court. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_420">44.1		In
the case of  <a href="/doc/1563902/" id="a_207">State of Maharashtra  v.  Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak</a>
(surpa),  a complaint against the Chief Minister   of the State was
being examined.  It was on this background on  a concession  of the
counsel for the Chief Minister, it was held that the Governor would
be well within  his  power to act on his discretion.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_421">44.2		In
decision  of  <a href="/doc/1679128/" id="a_208">Election Commission of India  v.   Dr. Subramaniam
Swamy</a>, (1996) 4 SCC 104,  was a case of Election Commissioner,
where out of  necessity the Apex Court held that the Governor had to
act on his  discretion  not on the aid and advise of the Council of
Ministers.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_422">44.3		The
case of M.P. Special Police Establishment (supra)  is yet another
example of discretionary powers  of the Governor  where question of 
granting sanction for prosecution against the Minister of the State 
came up for consideration.  The Council of Ministers    was of the
opinion that no such sanction should be granted.  Acting on the
report of the Lokayukta, however, the Governor  proceeded to grant
sanction.  It was in this background, the Apex Court  held and
observed as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_423">"19.
</p><p id="p_424"><a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_209">Article 163</a> has been extracted above. Undoubtedly, in a matter of
grant of sanction to prosecute the Governor is normally required to
act on aid and advice of the Council of Ministers and not in his
discretion. However, an exception may arise whilst considering grant
of sanction to prosecute a Chief Minister or a Minister where as a
matter of propriety the Governor may have to act in his own
discretion. Similar would be the situation if the Council of
Ministers disable itself or disentitles itself.
</p>

</p><p id="p_426">31.
We have, on the premises aforementioned, no hesitation to hold that
the decision of the Council of Ministers was ex facie irrational
whereas the decision of the Governor was not. In a situation of this
nature, the writ Court while exercising its jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_210">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India as also this Court under
Articles 136 and 142 of the Constitution of India can pass an
appropriate order which would do complete justice to the parties. The
High Court unfortunately failed to consider this aspect of the
matter.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_427">32. 
 If, on these facts and circumstances, the Governor cannot act in his
own discretion there would be a complete breakdown of the rule of law
inasmuch as it would then be open for Governments to refuse sanction
in spite of overwhelming material showing that a prima facie case is
made out. If, in cases where prima facie case is clearly made out,
sanction to prosecute high functionaries is refused or withheld
democracy itself will be at stake. It would then lead to a situation
where people in power may break the law with impunity safe in the
knowledge that they will not be prosecuted as the requisite sanction
will not be granted."
</p> 


 

 


<p id="p_428">44.4		In
the case of Rajendra Singh Verma (supra),   a judicial officer
subordinate to the  High Court  was compulsorily retired on the
recommendation of the High Court.  The Governor passed the  order
without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Apex
Court  turning down the challenge  on the ground that the Governor
could not have acted  without  the aid and advise  of the Council of
Ministers, observed that the  High Court alone  is the sole 
authority  competent to initiate disciplinary proceedings  against 
the subordinate judicial officers  or to impose various punishments
including passing of order of compulsory retirement.    The State is
least competent to  aid and advise the Governor on such subjects.  
While the  High Court retains  the power of disciplinary control over
the subordinate judiciary including power to initiate  disciplinary
proceedings,  suspend them during enquiries  and impose punishment on
them, but when it comes to the question of dismissal, removal or
reduction in rank or termination of services of judicial officers on
any count, whatsoever, the High Court becomes the recommending
authority and cannot itself pass the orders.  The formal order to
give effect to such a decision has to be passed by the State Governor
on the recommendations  of  the High Court.  The Apex Court,
proceeded to observed as under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_429">"81.
</p><p id="p_430">Thus, it is fairly well settled by catena of decisions of this Court
that in  the matter of   compulsory retirement of a Judicial Officer
the Governor cannot act on the  aid and the advice  of Council of
Ministers but has to act only on the recommendation of the High
Court.  Though the Lt. Governor is a party to these appeals, he has
not raised   any plea that the recommendation made by the Delhi High
Court was not binding on him and he could have acted in the matter
only on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers. Thus the
order of the Ld. Governor compulsorily retiring the appellants
without seeking aid and advice of his Council of Ministers is neither
ultra vires nor illegal and is rightly sustained by the High Court. 
The Governor could not have passed any order on the aid and advice of
Council of Ministers in this case.  The advice should be of no other
authority except that of the High Court in the matter of judicial
offices.   This is the plain implication of <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_211">Article 235.</a>  Reliance on
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_212">Article 239AA(4)</a> is entirely  out of place so far as the High Court
is concerned, dealing with the judicial offices.  To give any other
interpretation to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_213">Article 239AA(4)</a> will be to defeat the supreme
object underlying <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_214">Article 235</a> of the Constitution, specially intended
for protection of the judicial offices and necessarily independence
of the subordinate judiciary. It is absolutely clear that the
Governor cannot  take the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers
in the case of judicial officers and accept its  advice and act
according to it.  There is no room  for any  outside  body between
the Governor and the High Court.  Therefore,  this Court does not
find any substance in this contention  also and the same is
rejected."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_431">45.		In
the present case, we need not go to the extend of recognizing the
power of the Governor  to act against the aid and advice of the
Council of Ministers. The situation was somewhat peculiar.  The post
of Lokayukta was lying vacant for  more than eight years since last
held by Justice S.M.Soni.  For some reason or the other, no
appointment was forthcoming.  The consultation process, as we have 
already concluded, between the Chief Minister and the Chief Justice
had finally resulted into a dead-lock when the Chief Justice 
recommending the name of Justice R.A.Mehta and the Chief Minister
acting on behalf of the Council of Ministers  finally rejecting such
a choice.   To our mind, therefore, there was no further consultation
possible between two dignitaries.  The recommendation of the Chief
Justice, as we have already  held, would have primacy and would be 
binding on the Chief Minister.  It is in this context, we are of the
opinion that the Governor of the State was not acting against the aid
and advice of the Council of Ministers.  No such contrary advise was
rendered. Any contrary advise would  itself be unconstitutional,
because the plain meaning of our conclusion that the view of the 
Chief Justice would have primacy,  would necessarily mean  that when
finally, the consultative  process  reaches in an unresolved
situation, it would be the recommendation of the Chief Justice which
shall prevail  over other views.  This is not to suggest that there
should not be any meaningful, purposeful and effective  consultation.
 This is only to suggest that once such process is over and if it is
not possible  to achieve any unanimity,  the law would not envisage a
vacuum, or a permanent impasse  or no appointment. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_432">46.		We
may trace some of the aspects emerging from the record.  As already
noted, we are of the view that Lokayukta Act and the institution of
Lokayukta  has an important role to play  in the present
socio-economic  situation in the country, where  large number of
allegations are made   against the  public functionaries, often times
without due seriousness.  People of the country  have a  right to be
informed about the truth or otherwise  of such allegations. 
Institution of Lokayukta  can play a vital role  in this respect.  
The post of Lokayukta   in the State of Gujarat  was lying vacant
since nearly 8 years.    Prior to 2006, when the initiative was taken
by the Chief Minister to consult other dignitaries, we do not know
what were  the reasons   for non-appointment  for nearly three years.
 In any case,  since  2006,  when initial steps  were taken, five
more more   have passed.  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_215">The Act</a>, as already noted, provides that
allegations beyond five years cannot be investigated into.   The
Council of Ministers, which claims the sole authority to initiate the
consultation process,  also claims the exclusive    right  to aid and
advice the Governor in making the  appointment and also asserts that
even when there is disagreement with the recommendation of the Chief
Justice, it would be  the Council of Ministers'   view which would
prevail, must at least make  some introspection to reflect  why for
eight long  years  no appointment of Lokayukta was made.  We are not
here to conclude   this issue of delay in appointment for want of
sufficient materials or even arguments. Suffice it to say,  in
peculiar facts of the case,  once the consultation with the Chief
Justice was  over, there was no further  need to wait for 
recommending the name of the person so selected for appointment.   
In the meantime,  the Act itself was sought  to be amended which
would require starting the entire process all over again  leading to
unforeseeable  further consumption of time.  In fact before that
first step required would be to constitute  the Committee for
selection for the  post of Lokayukta.  It was in this  background,
the Governor  acted on the recommendation of the Chief Justice.  In
our opinion,  the same does not mean   that the Governor acted  in
her absolute  discretion or against the aid and advice  of the
Council of Ministers.  Discretion  if at all exercised by her was to
act on the recommendation of the Chief Justice  which in any case 
was binding on the Council of Ministers.  She called  for formal
recommendation from the Council of Ministers, which when was not
forthcoming,  she issued appointment in tune with the  recommendation
of the Chief Justice.  We may notice that section 3 of the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act has a significant  feature which is not found in Acts
of other States pertaining to Lokayukta   which were  brought to our
notice.  Proviso to sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Gujarat Act 
envisages appointment of Lokayukta after consultation with the Chief
Justice and except where such appointment is to be made at a time
when legislative assembly has been dissolved or a proclamation under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_216">Article 356</a>  of the Constitution is in operation, after consultation
with the Leader of Opposition.  This requirement  of consulting
leader of  opposition only if the Assembly is not  dissolved or
suspended is different from Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa State Acts of
Lokayukta.  Significance of this provision is that the Governor may
appoint a Lokayukta even where the State Legislative Assembly is
dissolved or is suspended.  In either case,  there will  neither be
the leader of opposition  to be consulted   nor the  Council of
Ministers to aid and advice the Governor.  This means Governor  can
appoint a Lokayukta even when there is no Council of Ministers. This 
is  one more indication to believe that the post of Lokayukta cannot
be left vacant for indefinite period of  time.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_433">47.		Before
closing, we would like to dispose of a  few peripheral issues.  The
learned Advocate General had contended that  the process adopted by
the Governor  was wholly irregular.  We may record that once the
Governor sought the opinion  of the Attorney General and requested 
the Chief Justice to recommend only one name instead of a panel of
names,  except showing initial disagreement, nothing further was done
on behalf of the Council of Ministers.   We are not suggesting that
the State was  expected to challenge such decision.    We do not
expect  and even desire  the State should be a litigant in such
issues with regular frequency.  Nevertheless, we may only record that
  it had virtually acquiesced  into such procedure.  Consultation
with the Chief Justice  was under taken.  The contention  that the
decision  of the Governor breached the rules of business  also need
not detain us   for long.   Rules of business are essentially seen as
directory in nature and not mandatory.   In this regard, we may refer
to a decision of the Apex Court  in the case  of <a href="/doc/203735/" id="a_217">Chitralekha  v.
State of Mysore</a>,   reported in AIR 1964 SC 1823 wherein it was
observed as under:

did not conform to the requirements of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_218">Art. 166</a> of the Constitution.
As the argument turns upon the form of the said Annexure it will be
convenient to read the material part thereof.

settled law that provisions of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_226">Art. 166</a> of the Constitution are only
directory and not mandatory in character and, if they are not
complied with, it can be established as a question of fact that the

Punjab</a>, (1962) Supp 3 SCR 713: (AIR 1963 SC 395) does not help the
appellants, for in that case the order signed by the Revenue Minister
was not communicated to the party and, therefore, it was held that
there was no effective order."
</p> 


    

 


 


 


<p id="p_447">This
view was reiterated  by the Apex Court in  the case of <a href="/doc/1834350/" id="a_228">State of

view of our conclusion that the respondent has failed to prove that
he was appointed by an authority higher in rank than the Chief
Secretary of the State."

<p id="p_450">This

oblivion to the decisions  in the case of   <a href="/doc/19689/" id="a_233">Fonseca (P) Ld.  v.

case of Fonseca (P) Ltd. (1973 SC 563) ,  as per the rules of
business, a particular authority  had no power to pass order.  It was
 on this background that the decision was held  void.   In the case
of M/s.Rajurshewar Associates (supra),   we notice that the matter
was required to be  placed before the Council of Ministers  which was
never done.  In this background, the court struck down the decision
as not fulfilling the requirements.  In any case, we do not find that
any insistence  on adherence of rules of business  would render the
decision of the Governor bad if it is otherwise  found in accordance
with the  Constitutional provisions, scheme of the Act  and the
requirements of the day.

<p id="p_451">48.	We
are, however, unable to concur with the  stand of the  Governor that
the Governor alone has the power to appoint the Lokayukta under
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_235">section 3</a> of the Act.   <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_236">Section 3</a> of the Act envisages   appointment
of Lokayukta  by the Governor.  Such appointment  is to be made  on
aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Any other view  would
create a very anomalous situation.  As already noted, the appointment
is to be made after consultation with the Chief Justice as well as
the Leader of Opposition.  If the  above view  is accepted, it would
lead  to a situation where the Council of Ministers or the Chief
Minister would have no  voice whatsoever in appointment  of
Lokayukta.  The Legislature  cannot be seen to have  and in fact has 
not provided for such a situation.

 Dissent
:
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_455"> Per
:  Honourable Ms. Justice Sonia Gokani
 

 


 

</p><p id="p_456">1.	I
had the privilege of listening to the delivery of judgment by
brother-Akil Kureshi, J. Although I am in agreement with the
conclusions drawn on some of the issues during the course of this
delivery, I am respectfully in disagreement with the final conclusion
arrived at by him.
</p> 

<p id="p_457">2.	Having
regard to the vital issues proposed for consideration in these
petitions, on all the aspects, I have chosen to adjudicate upon and
give my own findings for those conclusions as well, where there is
agreement.
</p> 

<p id="p_458">3.	Challenge
in the present petition, being Special Civil Application No.12632 of
2011, is to the order of the appointment of Lokayukta for the State
of Gujarat by H.E the Governor of the State under Section 3 of the
Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986  allegedly having been made illegally and
unconstitutionally,  without the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers, with the prayer to issue writ in the nature of
quo-warranto against the respondent No.1(Designate Lokayukta) as also
for issuance of such other writs as may be deemed appropriate in the
circumstances for setting aside the order impugned. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_459"> Factual
Background:-
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_460">4.	In
order to appreciate the controversy and the rival contentions raised
by both the sides, some of the factual details giving rise to the
present petition shall be necessary to be capsulized at the outset.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_461">5.	The
appointment and the functions of Lokayukta for the State of Gujarat
are governed by the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, which came into existence
in the year 1986 ( to be referred to hereinafter as " the Act")
 

 


 

</p><p id="p_462">6.	So
far, for the State of Gujarat three times, the appointment of
Lokayukta has been made and lastly, the said post was held by Mr.
Justice S.M. Soni. The post fell vacant in the year 2003.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_463">7.	It
emerges from the record made available to this Court that the
proposal for the said post emanated from the office of the Chief
Minister  in the month of August, 2006 .
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_464">7.1	Correspondence
dated 7.8.2006 indicates that as Justice Soni relinquished the office
of Lokayukta on 24.11.2003,  the question of finding his successor
engaged the attention of the Government.  In this background,
proposal was sent to the then Chief Justice by sending the name of
Mr. Justice K.R. Vyas (retired) by the Chief Minister  on this issue
for consideration at his end for the appointment of Lokayukta for
Gujarat State. This letter also further mentions that the
consultation under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_237">Section 3</a> of the Act is to be done with the Chief
Justice of the High Court and not with the High Court of Gujarat.
Thus, a request was made to consider, as required for the purpose of
consultation if there was any objection to the name proposed. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_465">7.2
	Correspondence from the Chief Justice dated August 7, 2006 is
indicative that he had no objection to the appointment of Mr. Justice
K.R. Vyas, former Chief Justice Bombay High Court as Lokayukta,
Gujarat State.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_466">7.3
	It further emerges from the record that on 10.8.2006, after the
receipt of consent from the Chief Justice, the file was sent to H.E.
the Governor, for appointment of Mr.Justice K.R.Vyas. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_467">7.4
	The query was raised on 25.8.2006 from H.E. the Governor as to
whether the leader of opposition had been consulted in this regard or
not and request was also made to the office of Chief Minister for
sending the minutes for perusal.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_468">7.5
Communication dated 29.8.2006 is suggestive that there is no
tradition of drawing the minutes, instead, the entire file was sent
which contained all necessary details.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_469">7.6
On 13.9.2006 a letter was sent to the office of the Chief Minister by
H.E. the Governor posing many queries, one of which was to apprise
the Governor of the process of consultation followed by other States.
	These informations were collected and submitted to the Governor on
27.2.2007. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_470">7.7	The
materials suggests that, thereafter, the first time on February 6,
2009 a noting was made on the file by H.E. the Governor of the
appointment of Mr.Justice K.R. Vyas as the Chairman of Maharashtra
State Human Rights Commission and on reference to the provision of
<a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_238">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, 1993, it was conveyed that Mr.
Justice K.R. Vyas would be no longer available for appointment as
Lokayukta, Gujarat State in as much as he would not be eligible for
further employment as provided under <a href="/doc/78994/" id="a_239">Section 24(3)</a> of the Human
Rights Act.
</p> 

<p id="p_471">	It
was conveyed by the General Administration Department (GAD) that
<a href="/doc/78994/" id="a_240">Section 24(3)</a> would not come in the way of such appointment and
insistence was made for his appointment to the post of  Lokayukta. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_472">7.8
	Further noting dated 10.9.2009 by H.E. the Governor on this issue,
reads that sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/374793/" id="a_241">Section 6</a> of the Protection of Human
Rights Act, would not allow the person, who had held the office of
the Chairman to be  eligible for the post of Lokayukta. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_473">8.	In
this backdrop on 10.9.2009, the then Governor addressed a letter to
the Chief Minister requesting him to send a fresh proposal of the
Government for appointment of Lokayukta, after consultation with the
Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court and the Leader of
Opposition in the State Legislative Assembly. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_474">9.	On
29.12.2009, a letter was sent by the Private Secretary of H.E. the
Governor to the Registrar General of the High Court, which reads
thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_475">"The post of the
Lokayukta has been lying vacant for the last some years. It is
necessary that the post is filled up at the earliest.
</p> 


<p id="p_476">	As per the provisions of
Section 3(1) of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act,1986, the Lokayukta shall
be appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Hon'ble
Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court and after consultation also
with the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_477">	In this context, I am
directed by Her Excellency to request you to place the above for kind
perusal of the Hon'ble Chief Justice for sending a panel for
consideration and thereafter a consultation will be held with him by
Her Excellency the Governor."
</p> 


 

 


<p id="p_478">9.1	This
was replied to by the then Registrar General on  2/1/2010 ensuring to
place the said communication before the Hon'ble Chief Justice after
Winter Vacation.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_479">10.	On
8.2.2010, a letter was addressed by the Chief Minister to the Chief
Justice of the State mentioning that  the consultation process with
regard to the appointment of Mr. Justice K.R. Vyas though was over,
by virtue of sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/374793/" id="a_242">Section 6</a> of the Protection of Human
Rights Act, his appointment was not feasible, names of the retired
judges of High Court of Gujarat were requested for, for consideration
and appointment to  the post of Lokayukta. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_480">10.1	In
response to the said letter of 24.2.2010, the Chief Justice sent a
penal of four names mentioning therein that all these persons are fit
to be appointed to the post of Lokayukta and chronology of names in
the letter neither depicted nor was suggestive of any preference of
his and any one of these judges could be appointed to the said post.
Letter reads thus:
</p> 


<p id="p_481">"May
I draw your attention  to the correspondence regarding appointment to
the post of Lokayukta, which has been lying vacant since last few
years. According to me, the following persons are fit to be appointed
to the post of Lokayukta in the State of Gujarat:
</p> 
	  


<p id="p_482">	Mr.
</p><p id="p_483">	Justice Pravinsingh Motisinh Chauhan
	  


	Mr.
</p><p id="p_484">	Justice Babulal Chandulal Patel
	  


	Mr.
</p><p id="p_485">	Justice Ramesh Prabhudas Dholakia
	  


	Mr.
</p><p id="p_486">	Justice Jayprakash Ramakant Vora

 


 


 


I
may mention that the aforesaid names are not shown on the basis of
preference and any of them can be appointed."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_487">	On
the very same day, the Chief Justice also wrote to H.E. the Governor
sending these four names of retired judges to her. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_488">10.2	On
2.3.2010, a request was made to the Leader of Opposition of the State
Assembly by the Chief Minister to attend the meeting as a part of the
process of consultation for appointment of Lokayukta.
</p> 


<p id="p_489">	This
move was objected to on 3.3.2010 by the Leader of Opposition by a
detailed letter essentially objecting to the initiation made by the
Chief Minister of the State. It would be apt to reproduce the
relevant contents as under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_490">" Having regard to
the said provisions of the Act, the principal object of the Act which
has been enacted being to inquire into allegations against public
functionaries,  including the Chief Minister, the State Legislature
in its legislative wisdom has expressly conferred power of
appointment of a Lokayukta only upon the Governor. The only statutory
requirement envisaged in making of appointment of a Lokayukta by the
Governor is consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court and
leader of opposition in the Legislative Assembly. Thus, under the
provisions of the said Act, there is no scope for consultation with
the Chief Minister of the State either by the Governor or by the
leader of opposition. In fact and in law, the Chief Minister of the
State of Gujarat has neither the authority nor the jurisdiction to
embark upon any consultation with the undersigned- leader of
opposition in the appointment of a Lokayukta.  The object of the Act
being to inquire into the allegations even against the Chief Minister
by the Lokayukta it stands to reason and logic that there is neither
any requirement of any consultation in the matter of appointment of a
Lokayukta with the Chief Minister of the State of Gujarat nor is the
power of appointment of a Lokyukta conferred upon the Government. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_243">If
the Act</a> envisaged the appointment of a Lokayukta by the Government,
it would have expressly stated so."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_491">10.3	On
that very day i.e. on 3.3.2010, H.E. the  Governor also wrote to the
Chief Minister stating that she had initiated the process of
consultation and pursuant thereto, consultation with the Leader of
Opposition is already held and she expressed that " due to
absence of legality", proposed meeting at his end be cancelled
forthwith and necessary action of consultation was to be initiated by
her only as per the Lokayukta Act.
</p> 


<p id="p_492">	On
3.3.2010 itself, once again, a request was made to the Leader of
Opposition by the Chief Minister inviting him to the meeting on
4.3.2010 for the very purpose. 
</p>
 


	
 


<p id="p_493">10.4	
On the ground that the Governor had already initiated the process of
consultation and also on the ground that the Council of Ministers had
no say in the appointment of Lokayukta, the request was made by the
Leader of Opposition to terminate the process of consultation 
forthwith in the communication dated 4.3.2010 addressed to the Chief
Minister,  "In keeping with fitness of things" 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_494">10.5	On
4.3.2010, once again, the request for participation was reiterated by
the Chief Minister to the Leader of Opposition and on that very day,
by a separate letter addressed to H.E.  the Governor, the Chief
Minister sought appointment on the ground that there were legal and
constitutional issues which had been raised in the letter she had
lastly addressed which necessitated meeting with her.
</p> 


<p id="p_495">	The
meeting otherwise scheduled on 4.3.2010, as a part of consultation
process was held in absence of Leader of Opposition as could be
noted, which concluded with a noting that since there was absence of
Leader of Opposition, the meeting needed to be convened on 5.3.2010
once again. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_496">10.6	In
the meantime, the Private Secretary to the Governor conveyed to the
office of Chief Minister the timings of meeting on 8.3.2010.
</p> 


<p id="p_497">	And
on 5.3.2010 itself, the Leader of Opposition conveyed it to the Chief
Minister that as already communicated by him, the consultation with
H.E.the Governor in this regard was over.
</p> 


<p id="p_498">10.7	It
further emerges that on 8.3.2010, the meeting of  the Governor with
the Chief Minister and the Law Minister in connection with this very
issue,  was held.
</p> 


<p id="p_499">	After
this meeting also, a letter was addressed by the Chief Minister to
the Leader of Opposition for the purpose of consultation. This letter
dealt with various provisions of law as also the judgments of various
Courts to support the main contention proposing the meeting on
22.3.2010.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_500">10.8	On
22.3.2010, the Leader of Opposition reiterated his stand stating that
the Council of Ministers has no role to play in appointment of
Lokayukta. There again, various authorities of the Apex Court were
cited to substantiate the version given in the letter. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_501">10.9
	The meeting scheduled on 22.3.2010, took place in absence of the
Leader of Opposition. On 31.3.2010 in the meeting of Council of
Ministers all the four names suggested by the Hon'ble the Chief
Justice were discussed and out of the four names, name of Mr. Justice
J.R. Vora was found most suitable for the appointment as Lokayukta
for Gujarat State.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_502">10.10
 On 1.4.2010, this file was sent to H.E. the Governor of the State
recommending the appointment of Mr. Justice J.R. Vora as the
Lokayukta of Gujarat State. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_503">11.	After
 the proposal was sent to  the Governor recommending the name of Mr.
Justice J.R. Vora, on 23.4.2010, she wrote to  the Chief Justice
soliciting his expert opinion with regard to two names (out of four) 
sent by him on 24.2.2010.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_504">11.1
The reply sent by the Chief Justice was indicative as to             
                                                      which  was the
better choice out of the two names mentioned in the letter of the
Governor.
</p> 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">12</span>
<p id="p_505">	On 3.5.2010,  the Governor wrote to the Chief Justice pursuant to
reference she had made to the Attorney General of India seeking his
expert legal opinion, urging the Chief Justice to recommend only one
suitable name in the wake of the decision of Apex Court in the case
of <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_244">N. Kannadasan vs. Ajoy Khose  and others</a> reported in (2009) 7 SCC
1 for this post.	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_506">12.1
After this communication of 3.5.2010,  on 5.5.2010 the file was sent
back to the Council of Ministers by the Governor, by making a note
that on a reference made to the Attorney General of India seeking his
expert legal opinion, it had become clear that the Chief Justice of
the High Court is the most suitable person to know the suitability of
the person to be appointed as Lokayukta and  the matter was referred
to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for re-examining the matter, with
further direction to the Government that the file be returned once
the formal proposal was received from the Chief Justice. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_507">12.2
	After this letter of the Governor, reply was sent by the Chief
Justice vide his letter dated 29.12.2010, noting the fact that
question was raised with regard to the name recommended earlier for
appointment to the post of Lokyukta with further mentioning that Mr.
Jutice J.R. Vora, whose name had been proposed and chosen for the
said post,  had been appointed as Director of Gujarat State Judicial
Academy, in the interregnum, and therefore, his name need not be
considered for appointment to the post of Lokayukta. In this
background, recommendation of the name of Mr. Justice S.D.Dave was
made for appointment to the said post by stating that he would be
suitable for appointment to the post of Lokayukta, which carries more
responsibilities. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_508">12.3	The
Chief Justice sent a copy of this letter to the Chief Minister
containing the same contents, on dated 31.12.2010, recommending the
name of Mr. Justice S.D. Dave for the appointment. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_509">12.4.	
</p><p id="p_510">On 6.1.2011, the Governor wrote to the Chief Minister that as the 
recommendation was made for the name of Mr. Justice S.D. Dave,
process is required to be expedited considering the fact that the
important post was vacant for a long time.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_511">13.	On
21.2.2011, a letter was addressed by the Chief Minister to the
Hon'ble Chief Justice urging that the entire process of consultation,
as envisaged under Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, had been
completed and  that was done concerning one of the names (that of Mr.
Justice J.R. Vora) recommended by the Chief Justice vide his letter
dated 24.2.2010. As the entire process for his appointment had been
gone through, in the public interest, request was made to consult Mr.
Justice J.R. Vora on his willingness to assume the responsibility and
to recommend his name, once again, so that the delay in filling up
the vacancy of Lokayukta could be addressed to. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_512">14.	On
15.3.2011, the letter was addressed by H.E. the Governor to the Chief
Minister to consider the name of Mr. Justice S.D. Dave as was
recommended by the Chief Justice as expeditiously as possible, a copy
of which was sent to the Chief Justice.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_513">15.	
Vide letter dated 22.3.2011, Chief Justice requested the Chief
Minister to consider the name recommended on 31.12.2010 with further
mentioning that the name of Mr. Justice J. R. Vora was recalled.
Again, it was mentioned that it was not the duty of the Chief Justice
to consult Mr. Justice J.R. Vora and since he was already appointed
as Director of Gujarat State Judicial Academy, in the interest of
judiciary, for the post of Lokayukta, he requested to consider the
name of Mr. Justice S. D. Dave. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_514">16.	On
1.5.2011 by a fax message to the Governor Mr. Justice S.D.Dave
requested Her Excellency to recall his nomination on the ground of
his personal difficulties. The letter dated 1.5.2011 reads thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_515">"As I understand, my
name has been recommended by Your Excellency in consultation with the
Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court of Gujarat and the Leader
of Opposition for the Office of the Lokayukta, Gujarat. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_516">	My circumstances oblige
me to request Your Excellency to recall my Nomination. I am thankful
to Your Excellency and the Members of the Collegium for the trust
reposed in me."
</p> 


		
 


<p id="p_517">17.	With
this development, on 4.5.2011 the Chief Minister once again, made a
request for recommending the name of Mr. Justice J.R. Vora, by
writing to the Chief Justice, making it explicit that Mr. Justice
J.R. Vora when consulted, he had expressed his willingness to be
considered for the said post and as consultation process concerning
his name had already been gone through, it would help expedite the
process of appointment. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_518">18.	On
7.6.2011 the Chief Justice recommended the name of Mr. Justice R.A.
Mehta for appointment on the said post in this manner:-
</p> 


<p id="p_519">" By the said letter
dated 4th May 2011, you have reiterated your earlier request to
consider the name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) J.R. Vora for this
post. As regards nomination of Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) J.R. Vora
is concerned, I have already mentioned in my earlier correspondence
that as Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vora has already been appointed as the
Director, Gujarat State Judicial Academy, in the interest of
judiciary, his name may not be considered for appointment to the post
of Lokayukta.
</p> 


<p id="p_520">	In view of the present
development that Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) S.D.Dave would not like
to be considered for appointment as Lokayukta, I now consider Hon'ble
Mr. Justice (Retd.) Ramesh Amritlal Mehta suitable for appointment to
this post. I accordingly, recommend the name of Hon'ble Mr.
Justice(Retd.) Ramesh Amritlal Mehta, for appointment to the post of
Lokayukta, Gujarat State, which carried more responsibilities."
</p> 


 

 


<p id="p_521">18.1	On
16.6.2011, the Chief Minister wrote to the Chief Justice giving
reasons as to why there were reservations against the name of Mr.
Justice R.A. Mehta. His advanced age was one of the grounds and other
grounds narrated for such reservations are as follows:- 
</p>
 


<p id="p_522">"The other important
aspect is that Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retired) R.A. Mehta is associated
with a few NGOs, <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_245">Social Act</a>ivist Groups and he has also given
services as a panelist for them. It is obvious that because of his
association with the NGOs, <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_246">Social Act</a>ivist Groups, etc. he may be in
a fixed frame of mind on certain issues relating to the governance in
the State. He has also shared platform with such people as are known
for their antagonism for the State Government.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_523">xxx   xxx   xxx
 


	You will appreciate that
if such a person having a specific biased perception for the
Government in the State is appointed as Lokayukta, he would not be
able to perform his duties with the amount of objectivity,
judiciousness and impartiality expected of the Lokayukta. It may
therefore be necessary to have a relook at the name proposed by you."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_524">	Once
again, in his communication itself, reiteration was made of
recommending the name of Mr. Justice J.R. Vora in this letter as
well. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_525">18.2	On
that very day i.e. on 16.6.2011, H.E. the Governor wrote to the Chief
Minister and the Leader of Opposition also wrote to the Chief
Minister conveying the agreement to the appointment of Mr. Justice
R.A.Mehta as also requesting him to expedite the process of his
appointment.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_526">18.3	On
2.8.2011, the Chief Justice wrote to the Chief Minister mentioning
therein that he gathered details of the activities of Mr. Justice
R.A. Mehta and found nothing objectionable. There was nothing which
would make him ineligible for the post of Lokayukta and he being a
member of an NGO and a social activist, on the contrary, would show
his ability to work for the society even at the age of 75 years. In
this background, a request was made by the Chief Justice vide this
letter to take up the matter with the Council of Ministers and to
forward the name of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta to Her Excellency the
Governor for his appointment as Lokayukta of the State of Gujarat. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_527">18.4	On
18.8.2011, the Chief Minister wrote to the Chief Justice and gave
details as to why there were reservations against Mr. Justice R.A.
Mehta further substantiating those reservations with documents, and
making further request to recommend the name of a Judge recently
retired from service in the place of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta. Here
again, advanced age was also mentioned as one of the grounds for
reservation. Request made was reflected in this fashion:-
</p> 


<p id="p_528">" It can be seen
from the above that the question is not of Shri R.A. Mehta
maintaining high standards in the society, or of not having made any
public statement which is detrimental to the society, but the
question is of his preconceived opinion and strong prejudiced mindset
against the present political dispensation in the State. While he may
be technically eligible for being considered for appointment as
Lokayukta, the moot question is whether such a person having a strong
biased perspective for the Government in the State if appointed as
Lokayukta, will be able to perform his duty with the high level of
objectivity, judiciousness and impartiality expected of the
Lokayukta. In all fairness, the answer to this question will be in
the negative. Although, I have no personal reservation against the
name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retired) R.A. Mehta, but as the Head of
the State Government, I am afraid, I may not be able to accept the
name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice (Retired) R.A. Mehta, who, in my view,
cannot be considered the most suitable choice for the august post of
Lokayukta, Gujarat State.
</p> 


 

 


<p id="p_529">	The other important
aspect of the age is also not in his favour. We need to have a
relatively younger person for the office of Lokayukta, Gujarat State,
as the term for the Lokayukta is of fiver years. Hence, it would be
in the fitness of things, if you could recommend the name of a Judge
who has recently retired from the service. 
</p>
 


	
 


<p id="p_530">	I am sure, you will take
the contents of this letter in proper perspective and in right
spirit, and recommend another name for the vacant post of Lokayukta,
Gujarat State."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_531">18.5	On
18.8.2010, responding to the last communication of H.E. the Governor,
Chief Minister refuted allegation of delay on the part of the State
in appointment and further wrote thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_532">"4.	In so far as the
recent letter dated 2nd August, 2011 from the Hon. Chief Justice of
the Gujarat High Court is concerned, I may inform you that the name
recommended therein has not been accepted by the State Government for
certain specific and valid reasons. A copy of my d.o. letter of even
No. dated 18.8.2011 addressed to the Hon. Chief Justice of the
Gujarat High Court is enclosed for your perusal. I will be able to
take further course of action in the matter only after receiving the
response to my said d.o. letter addressed to the Hon. Chief Justice
of the Gujarat High Court."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_533">19.	There
appears to be no further correspondence amongst any of the
dignitaries and on 25.8.2011, the impugned warrant came to be issued
by H.E. the Governor in her office itself and on that very day
communication in that regard had been sent to Additional
Registrar-cum-PPS to the Chief Justice by the Private Secretary to
the Governor intimating the appointment of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta as
the Lokayukta for the State of Gujarat.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_534">20.	On
26.8.2011, a letter was sent to the office of the Chief Minister by
the Private Secretary to the Governor revealing this appointment
under the hand and seal of the Governor. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_535">21.	It
would be also relevant, at this stage, to make a mention of some
other developments which took place during this time. The  Gujarat
Bill No.29 of 2011 was passed by the Legislative Assembly on
30.3.2011 making an amendment in <a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_247">Section 2</a> in sub-Clause (7) after
sub-Clause (d) of Lokayukta Act by adding a list of various 'public
functionaries'. This was done in the wake of the recommendation of
the 13th Finance Commission.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_536">21.2	This
Bill dated 30.3.2011, when sent for the assent of the Governor, at
her end, it was suggested 27th May 2011 that the proposed
Bill passed on recommendation of the 13th Finance Commission since
brings elected representatives of the Local Boards within its purview
and  the post of Lokayukta is vacant since 2003. Besides, there were
large number of local Boards in Gujarat, one Lokayukta, however,
competent and efficient may not be in a position to look into the
complaints of irregularities and, therefore, it was suggested that
since the Bill under reference does not specify more number of
Lokayuktas, the same should be considered and that being the
limitation of the proposed Bill, for reconsideration of Assembly, the
Bill was sent back.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_537">21.3	After
this, taking note of notings of H.E. the Governor, an ordinance was
prepared by GAD on 16.8.2011. This ordinance was sent for the
promulgation to the Governor. A detailed note was made by her
particularly objecting to the changes and modifications proposed in
<a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_248">Sections 2</a>,<a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_249">3</a>,<a href="/doc/1911574/" id="a_250">4</a>,<a href="/doc/942879/" id="a_251">7</a>,<a href="/doc/720759/" id="a_252">14</a>,<a href="/doc/1294089/" id="a_253">15</a> and <a href="/doc/302919/" id="a_254">20</a> of the existing Gujarat Lokyukta Act,
1986 and on the ground that there was no urgency to bring such an
ordinance, the same was returned to the Government. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_538">21.4	It
emerges from the record that once again, ordinance which was  sent to
her on 20.8.2011 was returned by her to the Council of Ministers with
a further detailed note made on 26.8.2011 after issuance of warrant
on 25.8.2011. At an appropriate place, further discussion and
deliberations of these developments shall be made. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_539"> Prayers/Reliefs:-
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_540">22.	On
the basis of the aforementioned factual matrix, the warrant issued on
25.8.2011 by H.E. the Governor is sought to be quashed challenging
the act of the appointment of Lokayukta with the following prayer:-
</p> 


<p id="p_541">"8(A)	 YOUR
LORDSHIPS may be pleased to issue an appropriate writ, order or
direction quashing and setting aside the decision and the consequent
impugned warrant dated 25.8.2011(Annexure-A);
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_542">(Amended as per Hon'ble
Court's order dated 5.9.2011)
 


 


 


(AA)	YOUR LORDSHIPS may
be pleased to issue a writ in the nature of quo warranto or any other
appropriate writ, order or direction in the matter of appointment of
respondent as Lokayukta pursuant to the impugned warrant dated
25.8.2011 (Annexure-A);
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_543">(B)	Pending hearing and
final disposal of this petition, Your Lordships may be pleased to
stay the implementation, execution and operation of the impugned
warrant dated 25.8.2011(Annexure-A);
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_544">(C)	An ex-part ad interim
relief in terms of para 8 (B) above may kindly be granted;"
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_545">23.	It
would be necessary to make a mention here that initially H.E. the
Governor was impleaded as the party respondent. Considering the
immunity awarded to the Governor under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_255">Article 361</a> of the
Constitution of India, the amendment was directed vide order of this
Court dated 5.9.2011. Respondents No.2 and 3 were impleaded
subsequently.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_546">24. 
The Registrar General, High Court of Gujarat (Respondent No.2) in his
affidavit-in-reply dated 20.9.2011, pleaded that he was not
conversant with the facts of the case and the entire issue was dealt
with by the Secretariat  of the Chief Justice of High Court and thus,
he had nothing to offer to the averments made in the petition.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_547">25.	Mr.
</p><p id="p_548">K.S. Prasad, Additional Registrar-cum-Principal Private Secretary to
the office of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice (Respondent No.3) filed
the affidavit-in-reply detailing the chronology of events as also
submitting the confidential photocopies of exchanges amongst various
dignitaries. Although details of these correspondences are mentioned
while mentioning facts, at appropriate junctures, their contents
shall find place in this judgment.
</p> 


<p id="p_549"> Brief
details of other petitions:-
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_550">26.1	It
would be relevant to make a mention here that Special Civil
Application No.13499 of 2011 preferred by NCLL also sought relief of
issuance of quo warranto and other similar nature of writ. This
petition is supporting the cause of the State Government espoused in
Special Civil Application No.12632 of 2011.
</p> 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_551">	2	There
	is yet another matter being WP(PIL) No.104 of 2011, which opposes
	the act of issuance of warrant by H.E. the Governor.
</p>	 


	 
	

 


<p id="p_552">26.3	It
is also necessary to refer to a PIL being W.P.(PIL) No.97 of 2011, 
which has been preferred seeking appointment of Lokayukta for the
State of Gujarat where notice was issued to the State on 18.8.2011. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_553">There
is yet another writ petition being WP(PIL) No. 102 of 2011 supporting
the act of appointment . No notices were issued in other petitions
preferred to support and oppose the act of issuance of warrants,
however, all the learned advocates and Senior Counsel appearing in
those matters have been heard as interveners  since those parties
moved Miscellaneous Application being Civil Application No. 9364 of
2011 with Civil Application No. 9416 of 2011 with Civil Application
No. 9363 of 2011    for being impleaded as parties in main petition
being Special Civil Application No.12632 of 2010 so as to grasp all
the issues in its entirety.
</p> 

<p id="p_554"> Submissions
of parties and interveners:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_555">27.	Learned
Advocate General of the State  of Gujarat was heard extensively whose
various contentions supporting the petition and the points in issue
raised are required to be summarized hereunder:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_556">(i)	The
aid and advice of Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister
is a pre-requisite for making appointment	of   respondent No.1and no
appointment without that is made permissible by the Constitution.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_557">(ii)	The
Governor being the ornamental head, barring 6 areas as specified
under the Constitution, she enjoys no power to act independently.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_558">(iii)
Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister are responsible in
Parliamentary form of governance for all the decisions taken and
Governor would have no right to deny execution except as otherwise
specified. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_559">(iv)	All
requirements contemplated under Section 3 of the Lokayukta Act for
appointment when was completed and the rest was a mere routine or a
formality, at that stage, H.E the Governor on her own could not have
written to the Chief Justice requesting to  send the name once again
on 5.5.2010 on the advice of the Attorney General of India and the
same has not been done in the right earnest of independently seeking
opinion of the Attorney General in the first place. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_560">(v)	Request
to the Hon'ble Chief Justice when was once again made by the Chief
Minister to reconsider the name of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta and when
the same was under consideration and when that was within her
knowledge, this uncanny haste in appointment has no legal backing. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_561">(vi)
	Even if there was an impass or stalemate on the recommended name and
the consultative process did not lead anywhere, then also, it was not
within the right of H.E. the Governor to act on her own in the manner
that is done in this case. She, in fact, acted contrary to the advice
of the Council of Ministers and, therefore, the act is not
sustainable. The manner of issuance of warrant without notification
and without the same going to the Government press is also not
befitting the scheme of the Act. In the event of stalement and
otherwise, such action of Government  would be subjected to judicial
mandate but under no circumstances, the Governor would have any
authority to issue warrant of appointment.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_562">(vii)	The
ratio of the Apex Court laid  down in the case of  <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_256">N. Kannadasan vs.
Ajoy Khose  and others</a> (supra) does not apply to the facts of the
instant case as this appointment is made neither under Constitution
nor for the Presiding Officer of the Court. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_563">(viii)	Allowing
and endorsing this act and order of appointment would tantamount to
throwing all core constituents of Parliamentary democracy to the
wind.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_564">28.	The
prepositions of law contended by the learned Advocate General are as
follows:-
</p> 


<p id="p_565">(1)	Every
decision of the Governor should be on the aid and advice of the
Council of Ministers in Cabinet form of Government barring 6 areas
expressly set out under the Constitution and those areas evolved by
virtue of the judgment of the Apex Court.  	
</p> 


<p id="p_566">	Corollary
to this main proposition, following propositions are raised as well:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_567">(2)	Role
of Governor in the appointment of Lokayukta under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_257">Section 3</a> of the
Act to be viewed keeping in view <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_258">Article 163</a> and <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_259">Article 166</a> of the
Constitution. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_568">(3)	Mode
and method of conducting the process of consultation as contemplated
under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_260">Section 3</a> of the Act.
</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">(4)</span>
<p id="p_569">	Whether this excludes views of the Council of Ministers headed by
the Chief Minister? 
</p>
 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">(5)</span>
<p id="p_570">	Whether this process should not be effective and informative one?
</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">(6)</span>
<p id="p_571">	How and wherefrom the process should be originated in absence of any
Rules and should convention be not governing the proposal?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_572">29.	The
authorities sought to be relied upon by the learned Advocate General
can be broadly divided under three different heads as follows:-
</p> 

<p id="p_573">Ist
Head:- Role and function of Governor under the Constitution and
powers of appointment of Lokayukta:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_574">I).	<a href="/doc/167993993/" id="a_261">Samsher
Singh vs. State of Punjab and another</a> reported in (1974) 2 SCC
831, where the Court has highlighted the role of the Governor as
well as that of the President as envisaged under the constitutional
framework. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_575">II).	<a href="/doc/1152284/" id="a_262">Kehar
Singh and another vs. Union of India and another</a> reported in
(1989)1 SCC 204, wherein it is held that the power under
<a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_263">Article 72</a> has to be exercised by the President under the aid and
advice of the Central Government.
</p> 


<p id="p_576">III.	Similar
was the issue where Court followed Patna High Court in the unreported
decision of Jharkhand High Court in the case of Ajit Kumar etc.
vs. State of Jharkhand and Ors. etc. in WP(PIL)No.2475 of 2001
with CWJC No.1894 of 2001 decided on 10.5.2002.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_577">IV.
</p><p id="p_578">	In the case of <a href="/doc/1279970/" id="a_264">Ram Nagina Singh and others vs. S.V.Sohni and
others</a> reported in AIR 1976 Patna 36 challenge was to the
role of the Governor in  making an  appointment without the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers and the Court held that Governor
enjoys no such power of   'eo nomine'
 


V.	In
the case of <a href="/doc/1868808/" id="a_265">Ram Chandra Nayak vs. State of Orissa and others</a> 
reported in AIR 2002 Orissa 25, where again the Court held that
under the Orissa Lokpal and Lokayuktas Acts, for appointment of
Lokpal or Lokayukta, the Governor has to act under the aid and advice
of Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister as Head. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_579">VI.	In
the case of <a href="/doc/363/" id="a_266">Bhuri Nath and others vs. State of J &amp; K
and others</a> reported in (1997) 2 SCC 745, a distinction was
drawn between the executive power of the State and exercise of power
by the Governor and the President in official capacity, holding that
unless the Governor is required by the Constitution to exercise 
individual discretion, exercise of executive powers which is
coextensive with the legislative power is only with the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_580">VII.	Reliance
also was placed on the judgment  of  Centre for <a href="/doc/310431/" id="a_267">PIL and another
vs. Union of India and another</a> reported in (2011) 4 SCC 1
where the appointment of Central Vigilance Commissioner was under
challenge. It has been held that once recommendation has been made by
the High-Powered committee under <a href="/doc/889484/" id="a_268">Section 4(1)</a> of the 2003 Act, the
same may not be binding on the President proprio  vigore.
However, if such recommendation is accepted by the Prime Minister,
who is the authority concerned under <a href="/doc/1608494/" id="a_269">Article 77(3)</a> and if the
recommendation is then forwarded to the President under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_270">Article 74</a>
the President,  the President is bound to act in accordance with the
advice tendered. 
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_581">IInd
Head: Consultation process with the Chief Justice and its meaning
 


 


 


I.	In
the case of <a href="/doc/878118/" id="a_271">Ashok Tanwar and another vs. State of H.P. and
others</a> reported  in (2005) 2 SCC 104 where with regard to
the  question of appointment of President of State Commission, it was
held that consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court  is
not as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_272">Article 217</a> of the Constitution for the
appointment of High Court Judge. It was further held that this
consultation is only with the Chief Justice of the State and not with
the collegium. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_582">II.	The
judgment given in the case of <a href="/doc/921223/" id="a_273">Justice K.P.Mohapatra vs. Sri Ram
Chandra Nayak and others</a> reported in (2002) 8 SCC 1 is
with regard to the appointment of Lokpal, wherein it is ruled by the
Division Bench of the Apex Court held that primacy in the appointment
is required to be given to the opinion of the Chief Justice of the
High Court as consultation with the Chief Justice is mandatory,
whereas views and the objections of the Leader of the Opposition are
to be taken into consideration, but, the Leader of the Opposition is
not entitled to suggest  name of another candidate nor to insist on
Government considering such name. The process of consultation also
has been discussed at length in the said judgment. 
</p>
 

 


 

 


 

<p id="p_583">IIIrd
Head:- When can the authority/institution/office be called Court/
trappings of Court
 

 


 


 	
Decision relied upon in the case of <a href="/doc/1353604/" id="a_274">State of Maharashtra vs.
Labour Law Practitioners' Association and others</a> reported in
(1998) 2 SCC 688,   holds that the Labour Court performs the
judicial functions and is a Court. This decision provides the test as
to whether the functions discharged by any institution or body is
that of the Court and whether the Tribunal had a trapping of the
Court considering the nature of  its work, that has been held in
affirmation. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_584">Other
decisions sought to be depended on are :

</p><p id="p_586">30.	Learned
Senior Counsel Mr. Mihir Thakor in support of the petition of NCLL
(being Special Civil Application No.13499 of 2011) fervently
submitted that the constitutional scheme as envisaged and adopted by
the nation is democratic Parliamentary System and it can sustain only
on scrupulous adherence to the principles embodied in the
Constitution where both the President and the Governor are to act in
aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_587">31.	It
is further urged that debates made in the Constituent Assembly are
eloquently clear that the Governor and the President have no role to
act independently except in the areas specified under the
Constitution. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_588">32.	It
was extensively and strenuously urged that when it is said that 'King
can do no wrong', it essentially speaks of liability of elected
representatives whose acts are made liable under the Constitution and
this adoption of core principles of Parliamentary democracy cannot be
allowed to be disregarded by any authority.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_589">33.	
It is  the submission of the learned counsel that in the instant
case, Governor could not have directly appointed the Lokayukta
without the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief
Minister. He further extended it by saying that the appointment of
the Lokayukta under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_275">Section 3</a> is contemplated even when the
Legislative Assembly is dissolved and in such a situation also, the
Governor needs to depend on the advice of the Council of Ministers
headed by the Prime Minister,  but,  has no power to act
independently. According to the learned counsel, the decision of the
Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/192242103/" id="a_276">M.P. Special Police Establishment vs.
State of M.P. and others</a> reported in (2004) 8 SCC 788
contemplated independent functioning of Governor in a
situation where democracy is at peril and that judgment has no
application whatsoever in the present case.	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_590">34.	He
further urged this Court that if the act of issuance of warrant by
the Governor is not interfered with, it would not only amount to
permitting  creation of two power centers, but, that would also
tantamount to disregarding Constitutional mandate which has carved
out the specific role of Governor in the Parliamentary democracy.
</p> 


<p id="p_591">	It
was further contended that the conventions have very potent role to
play. However, he depended largely on the submission of the learned
Advocate General in this regard. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_592">35.	Heavy
reliance was placed on the judgment of  <a href="/doc/167993993/" id="a_277">Samsher Singh vs. State
of Punjab and another</a> (supra) to define the role of
Governor under the Constitution. Particularly, emphasizing this role
as executive authority on aid and advice of Council of Ministers.
</p> 


<p id="p_593">	Reliance
on the case of <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_278">Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur and others vs
The State of Punjab</a> reported in AIR 1955 SC 549 is
also to indicate the role of the Governor, under the Constitution,
wherein the Apex Court has held as under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_594">"14.	In India, as
in England, the executive has to act subject to the control of the
legislature; but in what way is this control exercised by the
legislature? Under <a href="/doc/243691/" id="a_279">Article 53(1)</a> of our Constitution, the executive
power of the Union is vested in the President but under <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_280">Article 75</a>
there is to be a council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the
head to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his
functions. The President has thus been made a formal or
constitutional head of the executive and the real executive powers
are vested in the Ministers or the Cabinet.
</p> 


<p id="p_595">The same provisions
obtain in regard to the Government of States; the Governor or the
Rajpramukh, a the case may be, occupies the position of the head of
the executive in the State but it is virtually the council of
Ministers in each State that carries on the executive Government. In
the Indian Constitution, therefore, we have the same system of
parliamentary executive as in England and the council of Ministers
consisting, as it does, of the members of the legislature is, like
the British Cabinet, "a hyphen which joins, a buckle which
fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part."
</p> 


<p id="p_596">The Cabinet enjoying as
it does a majority in the legislature concentrates in itself the
virtual control of both legislative and executive functions and as
the Ministers constituting the Cabinet on presumably agreed on
fundamentals and act on the principle of collective responsibility,
the most important questions of policy are all formulated by them."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_597">36.	The
debate of Constituent Assembly sought to be relied upon shall be
reflected at an  appropriate stage. Suffice to specify at this
juncture that these debates cumulatively indicate the role of
Governor in carrying out all the functions and exercise powers unless
otherwise indicated, on advice of Council of Ministers.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_598">37.	Learned
advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta appearing for presenting the factual
details from the Hon'ble the Chief Justice  has elaborately dealt
with all the points in issues proposed with a specific note in the
beginning that though he has a very limited role to play, while
presenting the factual details from the Chief Justice, in his
endeavour to assist the Court on all respects, particularly, on all
the queries raised by the Court his submissions were made. The thrust
of the arguments were as follows:-
</p> 


<p id="p_599">	(i)	Concept
of appointment of Lokayukta has arisen from the concept of Ombudsmen
in England and it has very vital role to play.
</p> 


<p id="p_600">	(ii)
	Office of Lokayukta has trappings of Court. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_601">	(iii)	In
the instant case, the consultation with the Chief Justice had ended
and, therefore, it was necessary for translating the views of the
Chief Justice into action by the State. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_602">	(iv)	The
Chief Justice made it abundantly clear in his last communication
dated 2.8.2011 that the integrity of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta was above
the Board and this reply was given after due scrutiny and therefore,
there was no further question of any dialogue. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_603">	Reliance
was placed upon the judgment of <a href="/doc/921223/" id="a_281">Justice K.P.Mohapatra vs. Sri
Ram Chandra Nayak and others</a> (supra), which according to him
makes it very clear that the appointment suffers no illegality.
</p> 


<p id="p_604">	(v)	He
agreed that it is an acceptable general rule that the Governor needs
to act on aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. However, there
are exceptions carved out and the present case falls under one of
such exceptions. It was reiteratively urged to this Court that nobody
can be a  judge in his own case and there would be naturally inherent
bias of Council of Ministers when there arises a question of
appointment of Lokayukta.
</p> 


<p id="p_605">	Heavy
reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_282">N. Kannadasan vs. Ajoy Khose  and
others</a> (supra), to insist that process of recommendation was
as required under the law. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_606">(vi)	Learned
Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta since had equated the post of Lokayukta
with that of the Ombudsman, he relied upon the text and the material
of Administrative law to highlight importance of Ombudsman and his
vital role as a watchdog in Parliamentary democracy, which is as
follows:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_607">"The Ombudsman
follows an administrative, inquisitorial and private process of
investigation, with full access to departmental files, full power to
question civil servants and the right to except the cooperation of
the department being investigated. The adversary procedure of the
courts, conducted at arm's length between the parties through legal
intermediaries, could not be more different. I am in no doubt that
the Ombudsman's methods enable him to get closer to reconstructing
the administrative history of a citizen's case than does High Court
procedure .."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_608">	"As we saw in ch
19, the popularity of tribunal's has also grown a pace in the 40 or
so years since the establishment of the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
However, here, too, the need for Ombudsmen to fulfil a distinctive
role remains. Indeed, as we explain below at 20.3.2, the
Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 countenances recourses to the
Ombudsman only where there is no possibility of appeal to a tribunal
or where it would not be reasonable to expect the individual to
exercise a right of appeal. The Ombudsman is therefore intended to
complement or inapt. Moreover, tribunals and the Ombudsman are
complementary in that the matters over which they have jurisdiction
are to some extent distinct, the former being empowered to examine
the merits of decisions, the latter focusing on the quality of the
administrative process - although it must be acknowledged (see
further below at 20.3.1) that this distinction does not, indeed
cannot, exist as a bright line."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_609">	"Is the Ombudsman
to be at the apex of the system, a safety valve and last resort for
cases which have not been dealt with satisfactorily by the [internal]
adjudicators ?" If so, should there be a requirement for this
procedure to be exhausted before a referral to the ombudsman ?
[However], there are problems with using the ombudsman system as a
kind of vestigal appeal body. In such a role, the office may not
receive sufficiently large numbers of cases to enable there to be an
assessment of whether public services are performing effectively.
This would reduce the ombudsman's ability to comment on and suggest
improvements in administrative practice."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_610">	It
is required to be noted that though as a counsel representing
Secretariat of Chief Justice, limited role was to be played by
learned advocate Mr. Mehta, he contributed on each of the aspects
concluding that the warrant dated 25.8.2011 was legally executed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_611">38.	Learned
Senior Counsel Mr. Girish Patel challenged the very maintainability
of this petition and questioned as to against whom the writ of quo
warranto could be issued as Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta has not taken
charge of the office of Lokayukta.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_612">	It
was emphasized by learned Senior Counsel that since last 8 years no
appointment has been made in the State. Consultation with authorities
was going on from the year 2006. This is an exceptional situation in
as much as the entire process of appointment has been subverted by
introducing the Bill and attempting the promulgation of ordinance
which would have changed the very nature and power of all the
dignitaries. It is further urged that in the earlier PIL filed being
SCA 5667 of 2010, learned Additional Advocate General had ensured
that the appointment of Lokyukta was almost at the fag end, but, for
nearly one year, it has not seen the light of the day. He also
emphasized appropriate invocation of the "doctrine of
necessity" keeping in view the developments of last one week
prior to the issuance of the warrant on 25.8.2011.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_613">	He
also emphasized that  the appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court
under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_283">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952  was  sought to be made
when the process was almost at the penultimate stage and that in his
opinion was to take out from the purview many serious issues which
otherwise were to fall under the jurisdiction of Lokayukta.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_614">38.1	On
the basis of these submissions, it has been fervently urged by the
learned Senior Counsel to dismiss the petition and he substantiated
his version by following authorities:-

38.2	As
some of the authorities sought to be relied upon by both the sides
are common, they have been discussed briefly earlier and shall be
discussed at an appropriate place. Some of the authorities submitted
are new and require a brief mentioning.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_634">(i)	In
the case of <a href="/doc/1563902/" id="a_296">State of Maharashtra vs. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak and
another</a> (supra), question was of permission of prosecution
against the Chief Minister of State of Maharashtra, where the Court
has held that the Governor need not act on the basis of the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers. The doctrine of necessity has
been invoked here in the following manner:-
</p> 


<p id="p_635">"They are : "If
in the existing case, the entire Council of Ministers becomes
interested in the use of the statutory .power one way or the other,
the doctrine of necessity will fill up the gap by enabling the
Governor by dispensing with the advice of his Council of Ministers
and take a decision of his own on the merits of the case. Such a
discretion of the Governor must be implied as inherent in his
constitutional powers ......... The doctrine of necessity will supply
the necessary power to the Governor to act without the advice of the
Council of Ministers in such a case where the entire Council of
Ministers is biased. In fact, it will be contrary to the Constitution
and the principles of democratic Government which it enshrines if the
Governor was obliged not to act and to decline to perform his
statutory duties because his Ministers had become involved
personally. For the interest of democratic Government and its
functioning, the Governor must act in such a case on his own.
Otherwise, he will become an instrument for serving the personal and
selfish interest of his Ministers." We wish to say no more. As
we said, we cannot and we will not embark upon an enquiry. We will go
by the Judges' record."	
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_636">(ii)	In
the case of <a href="/doc/611866/" id="a_297">M/s. Doypack Systems Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India
and others</a> (supra), it was held that firstly
the object and reasons of the Act should be taken into consideration 
in interpreting the provisions of the statute in case of doubt.
Secondly, documents which were sought to be produced in Court, were
part of the preparation of documents, leading to formation of the
advice tendered to the President of India and as such were privileged
under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_298">Article 74(2)</a> of the Constitution. The question was whether the
advice tendered by the Ministers to the President can be inquired
independently.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_637">(iii)	In
the case of <a href="/doc/405446/" id="a_299">J. Jayalalitha vs. Her Excellency The Governor</a>
reliance was on the decision of <a href="/doc/1563902/" id="a_300">State of Maharashtra vs. Ramdas
Shrinivas Nayak and another</a> (supra), it was held that the
question of sanction against the Minister deserved to be decided by
the Governor in his individual discretion and also further observed
that the decision of the Governor to act as per his own discretion
was final. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_638">(iv)	
In the case of <a href="/doc/66020071/" id="a_301">S.R. Chaudhuri vs. State of Punjab and others</a>
(supra), it was a question where there were repeated appointments of
a non-legislator as Minister, each time for a period of six
consecutive months, which was held to be subversion of Parliamentary
democracy.
</p> 


<p id="p_639">"39. India is a
Democratic Republic. Its chosen system of political organisation is
reflected in The Preamble to the Constitution, which indicates the
source from which the Constitution comes, viz., "WE THE PEOPLE
OF INDIA". By permitting a non-legislator Minister to be
reappointed,without getting elected with the period prescribed by
<a href="/doc/1388061/" id="a_302">Article 164(4</a>), would amount to ignoring the electorate in having its
say as to who should represent it - a position which is wholly
unacceptable. The seductive temptations to cling to office regardless
of constitutional restraint must be totally eschewd. Will of the
people cannot be permitted to be subordinated to political expediency
of the Prime Minster or the Chief Minister as the case may be, to
have in his cabinet a non-legislator as a Minister for an indefinite
period by repeated reappointments without the individual seeking
popular mandate of the electorate.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_640">40. Chief Ministers or
the Governors, as the case may be, must for ever remain conscious of
their constitutional obligations and not sacrifice either political
responsibility or parliamentary conventions at the altar of political
expediency". Prof. B. O. Nwabueze in his book Constitutionalism
in the Emergent States" (1973 Edition - page 139), almost thirty
years ago warned :
</p> 


<p id="p_641">"Experience has
amply demonstrated that the greatest danger to constitutional
Government in emergent States arises from the human factor in
politics, from the capacity of politicians to destort and vitiate
whatever Governmental forms may be devised. Institutional forms are
of course important, since they can guide or better or for worse the
behaviour of the individuals who operate them.  Yet, however
carefully the institutional forms may have been constructed, in the
final analysis, much more will turn upon the actual behaviour of
these individuals - upon their willingness to observe the rules, upon
statesman like acceptance that the integrity of the whole Government
framework and the regularity of its procedures should transcend any
personal aggrandizement. The successful working of any constitution
depends upon what has aptly been called the 'democratic spirit', that
is, a spirit of fair play, of self-restraint and of mutual
accommodation of differing interests and opinions. There can be no
constitutional Government unless the wielders of power are prepared
to observe the limits upon Government powers."
</p> 


	                           
<p id="p_642">                                                   (Emphasis ours)
 


 


 


 


 


</p><p id="p_643">(v)	
In the case of <a href="/doc/79280249/" id="a_303">Rameshwar Prasad and Ors. vs. Union of India and
Anr</a>. (supra), reliance is sought to be placed on following
relevant paragraphs:-
</p> 


<p id="p_644">"55. The other
related issue of debate was regarding the extent of discretionary
powers to be allowed to the Governor. Following the decision to have
a nominated Governor, references in the various articles of the Draft
Constitution relating to the exercise of specified functions by the
Governor 'in his discretion' were deleted. (Chapter IV "Role of
the Governor", Report of the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State
Relations (1988) at para 4.2.07). <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_304">Article 163</a> of the Constitution
(then Draft <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_305">Article 143</a>) generated considerable discussion, and Dr.
Ambedkar is stated to have "maintained that vesting the Governor
with certain discretionary powers was not contrary to responsible
Government." (Constituent Assembly Debates (Volume VIII, Revised
Edition) at pp.00-502).
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_645">56. The expression
"required" found in <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_306">Article 163(1)</a> is stated to signify
that the Governor can exercise his discretionary powers only if there
is a compelling necessity to do so. It has been reasoned that the
expression "by or under the Constitution" means that the
necessity to exercise such powers may arise from any express
provision of the Constitution or by necessary implication. The
Sarkaria Commission Report further adds that such necessity may arise
even from rules and orders made "under" the Constitution.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_646">57. xxx   xxx   xxx
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_647">58. Finding that the
position of the Governor is indispensable for the successful working
of the Constitutional scheme of governance, the Sarkaria Commission
has noted that "most of the safeguards will be such as cannot be
reduced to a set of precise rules of procedure or practice. This is
so because of the very nature of the office and the role of the
Governor. The safeguards have mostly to be in the nature of
conventions and practices, to be understood in their proper
pers-pective and faithfully adhered to, not only by the Union and the
State Governments but also by the political parties." (Chapter
IV "Role of the Governor", Report of the Sarkaria
Commission on Centre-State Relations (1988) at para 4.5.07). It was
further added that "the fact that it will be impossible to lay
down a concrete set of standards and norms for the functioning of a
Governor will make it difficult for a Parliamentary Committee or the
Supreme Court to inquire into a specific charge against a Governor."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_648">(vi).	While
emphasizing that office of Lokayukta is the Court, quoting, the case
of <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_307">N. Kannadasan vs. Ajoy Khose  and others</a> (supra)
reliance is also sought to be placed on following relevant paragraphs
to drive point  home as to how the interpretation of statute is
required to be done:-
</p> 


<p id="p_649">"42.	There cannot be
any doubt whatsoever that ordinarily a literal meaning should be
given to the provisions of the Constitution as also a statute.
However, while applying the golden rules of literal interpretation
one must be clear in his mind that same should not defeat the object
and purpose for which the Act was enacted. We could advert to this
question a little later.
</p> 


<p id="p_650">46.	In Supreme Court
Advocates-on-Record Assn. this Court laid down the qualities of a
Judge:(SCC pp.601-02, para 273)
 


	"273.	... Under our
constitutional scheme, the judiciary has been assigned the onerous
task of safeguarding the fundamental rights of our citizens and of
upholding the rule of law. Since the Courts are entrusted the duty to
uphold the Constitution and the law, it very often comes in conflict
with the State when it tries to enforce its orders by exacting
obedience from recalcitrant or indifferent State agencies. Therefore,
the need for an independent and impartial judiciary manned by persons
of sterling quality and character, undaunting courage and
determination and resolute impartiality and independence who would
dispense justice without fear or favour, ill will or affection.
Justice without fear or favour, ill will or affection, is the
cardinal creed of our Constitution and a solemn assurance of every
Judge to the people of this great country. There can be no two
opinions at the Bar that an independent and impartial judiciary is
the most essential characteristic of a free society."

</p><p id="p_658">54.	A case of this nature
is a matter of moment. It concerns public interest. Public
information about independence and impartiality of the judiciary
would be in question. The duty of all organs of the State is that the
public trust and confidence in the judiciary may not go in vain.
Construction of a statute would not necessarily depend upon
application of any known formalism. It must be done having regard to
the text and context thereof. For the aforementioned purpose, it is
necessary to take into consideration the statutory scheme and the
purpose and object it seeks to achieve.

</p><p id="p_662"><a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_308">Varghese v. ITO</a> the strict literal reading of a statute was avoided
as by reason thereof several vital considerations, which must always
be borne in mind, would be ignored, stating (SCC p.180, para 5)
 


	"5. ...The task of
interpretation of a statutory enactment is not a mechanical task. It
is more than a mere reading of mathematical formulae because few
words possess the precision of mathematical symbols. It is an attempt
to iscover the intent of the legislature from the language used by it
and it must always be rememberd that language is at best an imperfect
instrument for the expression of human thought and as pointed out by
Lord Denning, it would be idle to expect every statutory provision to
be 'drafted with divine prescience and perfect clarity'. We can do no
better than repeat the famous words of Judge Learned Hand when he
said:
</p> 


<p id="p_663">	'.... it is true that
the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary and
ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of
any writing: be it a statute, a contract or anything else. But it is
one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not
to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that
statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose
sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their
meaning.'
 


	*    *    *
 


	'... the meaning of a
sentence may be more than that of the separate words, as a melody is
more than the notes, and no degree of particularity can ever obviate
recourse to the setting in which all appear, and which all
collectively create.'"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_664">39.	Learned Senior Counsel
also sought to rely upon two more authorities in the case of <a href="/doc/296515/" id="a_309">Pundlik

<p id="p_665">40.	Learned Senior advocate
Mr. Mukul Sinha as an intervener made his categorical and forceful
submission emphasizing that the post of Lokayukta is higher than that

against corruption and very nature of this office is indicative that

was further urged that the power of the Governor exercised under

Ministers in each state that curves on the executive Government."
It also says that      except in those cases specified under the
Constitution, the Governor  is to  act  on the aid and advice of the

<p id="p_692">49.	The
Constitution envisages  the Parliamentary System of the government
both at the Union and at the State level where  "neither the

Constitutional head of the executive and can only exercise the powers
on the advice of the Council of Ministers through the Ministers  or
the other officers as may be allocated under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_326">Article 166(3).</a>

<p id="p_693">50.	In
the case of  Samsher Singh (supra) the Apex Court has
further held in connection with this issue:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_694">"27. Our
Constitution embodies generally the Parliamentary or Cabinet system
of Government of the British model both for the Union and the States.
Under this system the President is the Constitutional or formal head
of the Union and he exercises his powers and functions conferred on
him by or under the Constitution on the aid and advice of his Council
of Ministers. <a href="/doc/41049/" id="a_327">Article 103</a> is an exception to the aid and advice of
the Council of Ministers because it specifically provides that the
President acts only according to the opinion of the Election
Commission. This is when any question arises as to whether a member
of either House of Parliament has become subject to any of the
disqualifications mentioned in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/390434/" id="a_328">Article 102."</a>
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_695">28. Under the Cabinet
system of Government as embodied in our Constitution the Governor is
the constitutional or formal head of the State and he exercises all
his powers and functions conferred on him by or under the
Constitution on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers save
in spheres where the Governor is required by or under the
Constitution to exercise his functions in his discretion.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_696">xxx   xxx   xxx
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_697">32. It is a fundamental
principle of English constitutional law that Ministers must accept
responsibility for every executive act. In England the sovereign
never acts on his own responsibility. The power of the sovereign is
conditioned by the practical rule that the Crown must find advisers
to bear responsibility for his action. Those advisers must have the
confidence of the House of Commons. This rule of English
constitutional law is incorporated in our Constitution. Indian
Constitution envisages a parliamentary and responsible form of
Government at the Centre and in the States and not a Presidential
form of Government. The powers of the Governor as the constitutional
head are not different.

<p id="p_698">xxx   xxx   xxx 

 


 


 


</p><p id="p_699">57. For the foregoing
reasons we hold that the President or the Governor acts on the aid
and advice of the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the
head in the case of the Union and the Chief Minister at the head in
the case of State in all matters which vest in the executive whether
those functions are executive or legislative in character. Neither
the President nor the Governor is to exercise the executive functions
personally."

<p id="p_700">	Respective
roles and powers of both the President and the Governor in
west-ministerial democracy are summarized in this decision of Samsher
Singh's case (supra) with very powerful words thus:-
</p>

 


<p id="p_701">"151. The
omnipotence   of the President and the Governor at State level is
euphemistically inscribed in the pages of our Fundamental Law with
the obvious intent that even where express conferment of power or
functions is written into the Articles, such business has to be
disposed of decisively by the Ministry answerable to the Legislature
and through it vicariously to the people, thus vindicating our
democracy instead of surrendering it to a single summit soul whose
deification is incompatible with the basics of our political
architecture-lest national elections become but Dead Sea fruits,
legislative organs become labels full of sound and fury signifying
nothing and the Council of Ministers put in a quandary of
responsibility to the House of the People and submission to the
personal decision of the Head of State. A parliamentary style
Republic like ours could not have conceptualised its self-liquidation
by the process. On the contrary, democratic capital formation to
strengthen the people's rights can be achieved only through
invigoration of the mechanism of Cabinet-House-Elections."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_702">51.	It
would be relevant to reproduce some of the findings of the Apex Court
arrived at in the case of  <a href="/doc/363/" id="a_329">Bhuri Nath and others vs. State of J
&amp; K and others</a> (supra):-
</p> 


<p id="p_703">"19.	By
operation of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_330">Article 154</a>, the executive power of the State shall be
vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him either directly
or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the
Constitution.  By operation of <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_331">Article 162</a>, subject to the provisions
of the Constitution, the executive power of the State shall extend to
all matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has
power to make law.  Thus, except his discretionary powers like that
of appointing Chief Minister, the Governor does not exercise any
power in his individual discretion.  The Governor is aided and
advised by the Council of Ministers appointed by him under Article
</p><p id="p_704">163.  The executive power of the State is co-extensive with that of
the legislative power of the State and the Governor in the
constitutional sense discharges the functions under the Constitution
with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except in so far
as he is by or under the Constitution required to exercise his
functions in his discretion.
</p><p id="p_705"> This is subject to <a href="/doc/666119/" id="a_332">Article 370</a> and the Constitution (Application to
Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950 repealed and revised by the
Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 and the
Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, 1957 (Part V). All the executive
actions of the State Government shall be expressed to be taken in the
name of the Governor as per the business rules of the Government made
in accordance with <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_333">Article 166</a> of the Constitution and the business
rules made by the Governor under Clause  (3) thereof (Section 45 of
the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir).  In Samsher Singh's case (AIR
1974 SC 2192), a Bench of seven Judges of this Court had held that
under the Cabinet system of Government, as embodied in our
Constitution, the Governor is the formal head of the State.  He
exercises all his powers and functions conferred on him by or under
the Constitution with the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers
save in spheres where the Governor is required by or under the
constitution to exercise his functions in his discretion.  The
satisfaction of the Governor for the exercise of any other powers or
functions required by the Constitution is not the personal
satisfaction of the Governor but is the satisfaction in the
constitutional sense under the Cabinet system of Government.  The
executive is to act subject to the control of the legislature.  The
executive power of the State is vested in the Governor as head of the
executive.  The real executive power is vested in the Council of
Ministers of the Cabinet.  There is a Council of Ministers with the
Chief Minister as its head to aid and advise the Governor in the
exercise of his executive functions.  <a href="/doc/1180101/" id="a_334">In R. K. Jain v. Union of
India</a>, (1993) 4 SCC 120 : (1993 AIR SCW 1899), it was held that the
Cabinet system is constitutional mechanism to ensure that before
important decisions are taken, many sides of the question are weighed
and considered.  The Cabinet takes political decisions of importance
and the permanent bureaucracy works out the details and implements
the policy. The Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister bears collective
responsibility for the governance of the country.  The Cabinet as a
whole is responsible for the advice and conduct of business by each
of the members of Cabinet of his Department and requires to maintain
secrecy in the performance of the decision making process
individually or collectively. They  are also equally responsible
individually and collectively  for their  acts and policies.  The
Cabinet, as a whole, is collectively responsible for the advice to
the President and to the Parliament and the people.  <a href="/doc/139734870/" id="a_335">In S. R. Bommai
v. Union of India</a>, (1994) 3 SCC 1:  (1994 AIR SCW 2946 at P. 3157,
Paras 246 and 247) at page 238 in paragraphs 313 and 314, this  Court
had held that the executive power of the Union shall be vested in the
President and shall be exercised by him whether directly or through
officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution.  All
the executive actions of the Government shall be expressed to be
taken in the name of the President under
<a href="/doc/313937/" id="a_336">Article  77 (1).</a> Therefore, he acts with the aid and advice of the
Council of Ministers under <a href="/doc/1163710/" id="a_337">Article 18</a> of the Constitution headed by

<p id="p_706">52.	In
the case of Kehar Singh and another vs. Union of India and
another (Supra), the Apex Court held as under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_707">"7.	The
Constitution of India, in keeping with modern constitutional
practice, is a constitutive document, fundamental to the governance
of the country, whereby, according to accepted political theory, the
people of India have provided a constitutional polity consisting of
certain primary organs, institutions and functionaries to exercise
the powers provided in the Constitution. All power belongs to the
people, and it is entrusted by them to specified institutions and
functionaries with the intention of working but, maintaining and
operating a constitutional order. The Preambular statement of the
Constitution begins with the significant recital :
</p> 


<p id="p_708">"We, the people of
India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign
Socialist Secular Democratic Republic ..... do hereby adopt, enact
and give to ourselves this Constitution."
</p> 


<p id="p_709">To any civilised society,
there can be no attributes more important than the life and personal
liberty of its members. That is evident from the paramount position
given by the Courts to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_338">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution. These twin
attributes enjoy a fundamental ascendancy over all other attributes
of the political and social order, and consequently, the Legislature,
the Executive and the Judiciary are more sensitive to them than to
the other attributes of daily existence. The deprivation of personal
liberty and the threat of the deprivation of life by the action of
the State is in most civilised societies regarded seriously, and
recourse, either under express constitutional provision or through
legislative enactment is provided to the judicial organ. But, the
fallibility of human judgment being undeniable even in the most
trained mind, a mind resourced by a harvest of experience, it has
been considered appropriate that in the matter of life and personal
liberty, the protection should be extended by entrusting power
further to some high authority to scrutinise the validity of the
threatened denial of life or the threatened or continued denial of
personal liberty. The power so entrusted is a power belonging to the
people and reposed in the highest dignitary of the State. In England,
the power is regarded as the royal prerogative of pardon exercised by
the Sovereign, generally through the Home Secretary. It is a power
which is capable of exercise on a variety of grounds, for reasons of
State as well as the desire to safeguard against judicial error. It
is an act of grace issuing from the Sovereign. In the United
States, however, after the founding of the Republic, a pardon by the
President has been regarded not as a private act of grace but as a
part of the constitutional scheme. In an opinion, remarkable for its
crudities and clarity, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court in
W. I. Biddle v. Vuco Perovich, (1926) 71 Law ed 1161 enunciated this
view, and it has since been affirmed in other decisions. The power to
pardon is a part of the constitutional scheme, and we have no doubt,
in our mind, that it should be so treated also in the Indian
Republic. It has been reposed by the people through the Constitution
in the Head of the State, and enjoys high status. It is a
constitutional responsibility of great significance, to be exercised
when occasion arises in accordance with the discretion contemplated
by the context. It is not denied, and indeed it has been repeatedly
affirmed in the course of argument by learned counsel, Shri Ram
Jethmalani and Shri Shanti Bhushan, appearing for the petitioners
that the power to pardon rests on the advice tendered by the
Executive to the President, who subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_339">Art.
74(l)</a> of the Constitution, must act in accordance with such advice.
We may point out that the Constitution Bench of this Court held in
<a href="/doc/1222748/" id="a_340">Maru Ram v. Union of India</a>, (1981) 1 SCR 1196 : (AIR 1980 SC 2141)
that the power under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_341">Art. 72</a> is to be exercised on the advice of the
Central Government and not by the President on his own, and that the
advice of the Government binds the Head of the State."(emphasis
supplied)
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_710">53.	As
an aid to interpret the constitutional provisions the Court needs to
find out the intention of the framers of the Constitution and debates
in the Constituent Assembly is one of the vital and recognized aids
and the  same  can be relied upon as  held by the Apex Court in the
case of  <a href="/doc/66020071/" id="a_342">S.R. Chaudhuri vs. State of Punjab and others</a>
(supra). This judgment further says that:-
</p> 
	  


<p id="p_711">	Constitutional
	provisions are required to be understood and interpreted with an
	object-oriented approach. A Constitution must not be construed in a
	narrow and pedantic sense. The words used may be general in terms
	but, their full import and true meaning, has to be appreciated
	considering the true contacts in which the same are used and the
	purpose which they seek to achieve. Debates in the constituent
	assembly refer to an earlier part of this judgment clearly indicates
	that a none-members inclusion in the cabinet was considered to be a
	"previledge" that extents only for six months, during
	which period the members must get elected, otherwise he would ceased
	to be a Minister. It is a  settled position that debates in the
	constituent assembly may be relied upon as an aid to interpret a
	constitutional provision because it is the function of the Court to
	find out the intension of the framers of the constitution. We must
	remember that a constitution is not just a document in solemn form,
	but a living frame work for the Government of the people exhibiting
	a sufficient degree of cohesion and its successful working depends
	upon the democratic spirit underlying it being respected in letter
	and in  spirit . The debates clearly indicate the "privileged"
	to extent "only" for six months ."

                                                debates in the of

</p> 


<p id="p_716">	If this amendment were

Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister as the head to to aid
and advice the Governor in the exercise of his functions."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_718">Sir,  it appears from a
reading of this clause, that the Government of India Act, of 1935 has
been copied more or less blindly without mature consideration. There
is no strong or valid reason for giving the Governor more authority
either in his discretion or otherwise vis-a-vis his ministers, than
has been given to the President in relation to his ministers. If we
turn to <a href="/doc/1293929/" id="a_346">article 61(1</a>), we find it reads as follows:-
</p> 


<p id="p_719">	When you, Sir, raised a
very important issue, the other day, Dr. Ambedkar clarified this
clause by saying that the President is bound to accept the advice of
his ministers in the exercise of all of his functions. But here
<a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_347">article 143</a> vests certain discretionary powers in the Governor, and
to me it seems that even as it was it was bad enough, but now after
having amended <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_348">article 131</a> regarding election of the Governor and
accepted nominated Governors, it would be wrong in principle and
contrary to the tenets and principles of constitutional Government,
which you are going to build up in this country.  It would be wrong I
say, to invest a Governor with these additional powers, namely,
discretionary powers. I feel that no departure from the principles of
constitutional Government should be favoured except for reasons of
emergency and these discretionary powers must be done away with. I
hope this amendment of mine will commend itself to the House. I move,
Sir.

Shri Alladi Krishnaswami
Ayyar"(Madras:General):
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_721">	Sir, there is really no
difference between those who oppose and those who approve the
amendment. In the first place, the general principle is laid down in
<a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_349">article 143</a> namely, the principle of ministerial responsibility, that
the Governor in the various spheres of executive activity should act
on the advice of his ministers. Then the article goes on to provide
"except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution
required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion."
So long as there are articles in the Constitution which enable the
Governor to act in his discretion and in certain circumstances, it
may be, to over-ride the cabinet or to refer to the President, this
article as it is framed is perfectly in order. If later on the House
comes to the conclusion that those article which enable the Governor
to act in his discretion is specific cases should be deleted, it will
be open to revise this article. But so long as there are later
artilces which permit the Governor to act in his discretion and not
on ministerial responsibility, the article as drafted is perfectly in
order.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_722">xxx   xxx   xxx
 


 


 


"	The only other
question is whether first to make a provision in <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_350">article 143</a> that the
Governor shall act on ministerial responsibility and then to go on
providing " Notwithstanding anything contained in article
</p><p id="p_723">143.... he can do this " or "Notwithstanding anything
contained in <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_351">article 143</a> he can act in his discretion." I should
think it is a much better method of drafting to provide in <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_352">article
143</a> itself that the Governor shall always act on ministerial
responsibility excepting in particular or specific cases where he is
empowered to act in his discretion. If of course the House comes to
the conclusion that in no case shall the Governor act in his
discretion,   that he shall in every case act only on ministerial
responsibility, then there will be a consequential change in this
article. That is, after those articles are considered and passed it
will be quite open to the House to delete the latter part of <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_353">article
143</a> as being consequential on the decision come to by the House on
the later articles. But, as it is, this is perfectly in order and I
do not think any change is warranted in the language of <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_354">article 143.</a>
It will cumbrous to say at the opening of each article
"Notwithstanding anything  contained in <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_355">article 143</a> the Governor

nominated Governor has been given power to interfere in what may be
called the day-to-day business of the Council of Ministers. I wonder
why the Governor should call upon the Chief Minister to submit for
the consideration of the Council of Ministers any matter on which a
decision has been taken by a Minister but which has not been
considered by the Council. I submit that this is entirely a matter
for the Council to decide among themselves and to arrive at any
particular procedure they like. If a matter has been considered by
one of the Ministers, but has not been considered by the whole
Council, the Governor cannot step in and tell the Chief Minister,
'you must put it before the Council of Ministers'. The Chief Minister
and his colleagues are competent enough to decide which matter should
go before the Council and which it is not necessary to be put before
the Council. This to my mind is in tune with the tenets of
constitutional democracy that we propose to set up in the States.

Dr.P.S. Deshmukh(C.P.
</p><p id="p_729">&amp; Berar:General): Mr. President, Sir, I am afraid I am not able
to agree with my honourable Friend Mr. Kamath in his suggestion that
the article should be omitted. If he were to pay a little more
attention to the provisions made by <a href="/doc/33485/" id="a_356">article 146</a>, which we have just
passed he will, I think, admit the wisdom of incorporating this
artilce in the Constitution. Now under <a href="/doc/33485/" id="a_357">article 146</a> every order which
is issued by the Ministry or the Cabinet or even individual Ministers
will be an order which will be published and proclaimed in the name
of the Governor. If <a href="/doc/242661/" id="a_358">article 147</a> is not there, there is nothing which
will empower the Governor to know the various actions taken from day
to day, and the orders pased and issued in his name. My Friend has
said that this would refer even to routine matters. I can tell him,
Sir, that ordinary matters which are unimportant and which are of a
routine nature. I am sure, no Governor in his wisdom would like to
question, or request the Chief Minister that they should go to the
Cabinet for reconsideration
 


Shri H.V. Kamnath:What
is the guarantee?
</p> 


<p id="p_730">Dr.P.S. Deshmukh:
</p><p id="p_731">The guarantee is the Governor's wisdom, and the wisdom
of the authority that will point such a .....
</p> 


<p id="p_732">Shri H.V. Kamath:
</p><p id="p_733">What is the guarantee I asked?
</p> 


<p id="p_734">Dr. P.S. Deshmukh
: The guarantee I said is the Governor's wisdom and the wisdom of the
authority that will appoint the Governor.
</p> 


<p id="p_735">	Sir, this article can
never refer to unimportant, routine matters, but it can refer only to
orders which the Governor thinks are likely to have larger
repercussions, and are of such importance that it will be wise if all
the Ministers in the Cabinet were to consider it. And apart from this
direction that the question may be considered by the Cabinet, there
is nothing. The  Governor is not given the authority to over-rule
the decision of the Cabinet. The article merely empowers the
Governor whenever he considers that an individual Minister's decision
should rather be given some more attention, that he would refer it
for the consideration of the whole Cabinet.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_736">Shri K.M. Munshi:
</p><p id="p_737">(Bombay:General): Mr. President, Sir, I cannot understand the
objection that is raised to the powers of the Governor under article
</p><p id="p_738">147. The House has accepted, and very rightly accepted, that there
should be a Governor in the provinces. That Governor is not
necessarily to be a cipher as some Members said, nor need he be only
a super-host giving lunches and dinners to persons in society. He has
a political function to perform and that political function is to be
the Constitutional Head.
</p> 


<p id="p_739">	Some honourable Members
who spoke are under the impression that a Constitutional Head has no
functions at all and that he has to do nothing else than to endorse
what the Premier or the Ministers do, without even giving them the
benefit of his advice or giving them the impressions of a detached
spectator on governmental actions. This I subit is entirely wrong.
The Governmental set-up which we have envisaged is on the model of
the British Constitution. <a href="/doc/242661/" id="a_359">Article 147</a> is repetition of <a href="/doc/948485/" id="a_360">article 65</a>
which we have already accepted with regard to the President in the
Centre. The responsibility of the Government, if at all, is much more
comprehensive and stronger in the Centre under this Constitution than
in the Provinces. In view of this, I cannot understand why these
objections are taken again  in respect of the same powers. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_740">	My Friend, Mr. Gupte,
referred to sub-clause(c) and asked the question, where is the
Governor to get the information from? If you read sub-clause (b), it
says;-
</p> 


<p id="p_741">	"It shall be the
duty of the Chief Minister of each State to furnish such information
relating to the administration of the affairs of the State and
proposals for legislation as the Governor may call for'"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_742">	Under this clause it
will be open for the Governor to ask the Chief Minister for
information with regard to important questions and if he feels that
certain decisions have been  taken not by the Cabinet as a whole but
by an individual Minister which requires reconsdieration at the hands
of the Cabinet as a whole, clause © will given him the power to
get that done. What is wrong about it? When a Minister acts behind
the back of his colleagues, behind the back of the Chief Minister who
is responsible for all the actions of the Ministers, why cannot the
Governor say,"Here is a particular order. I feel that it is a
matter of great importance. I want that by virtue of collective
responsibility all the Ministers must meet together and consider it"?
 If they accept it, he is bound to accept their advice. He has no
right to over-rule them. It is merely a matter of caution that a
decision, which in the opinion of the Constitutional head, is such as
requires the imprimatur of the whole Cabinet and not of a single
Minister, should so receive it. Therefore it is a safeguard which
preserves the collective responsibility and the powers of the Prime
Minister, and not a power which interferes with the Government.
Therefore the fear that it would so interfere is entirely unfounded.
</p>

Shri K.M.Munshi:	I
want to make it clear that the position of the Governor must be
considered from the point of view of the constitutional head as in
England. A constitutional head is not a cipher. I will read for the
benefit of the House the position of the King in England as
enunciated by the late Mr.Asquith who could not be considered a weak
Prime Minister at any time of his life. This is his definition of the
position of the constitutional head in England:-
</p> 


<p id="p_744">	Therefore it is not as
though he cannot get any information apart from what he gets from his
Ministers.
</p> 


<p id="p_745">	" to point out
objections which seem to him valid against the course which they
advice; to suggest, if he thinks fit, an alternative policy. Such
instructions are always received by Ministers with the utlost respect
and considered with more respect and deference than if they proceeded
from any other quarter.  But, in the end,  the Soverign always acts
upon the advice which Ministers after ( if need be) reconsideration,
feel it their duty to offer. They given that advice well knowing that
they can, and probably will, be called upon toe account for it by
Parliament."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_746">xxx   xxx   xxx
 


 


 


	The Honourable
Dr.B.R.Ambedkar:-As the debate has taken place and as several
Members of the House seem to think that there is something behind
this <a href="/doc/242661/" id="a_361">article 147</a> which would put the position of the Ministers and of
the Cabinet in the provinces in jeopardy, I propose to offer some
explanation.
</p> 


<p id="p_747">	The first thin I would
like the House to bear in mind in this. The Governor under the
Constitution has no functions which he can discharge by himself; no
functions at all. While he has no functions, he has certain duties to
perform, and I think the House will do well to bear in mind this
distinction. This article certainly, it should be borne in mind, does
not confer upon the Governor the power to overrule the Ministry on
any particular matter. Even under this article, the Governor is bound
to accept the advice of the Ministry. That I think, ought not to be
forgotten. This article, nowhere, either in clause (a) or clause (b)
or clause(c), says that the Governor in any particular circumstances
may overrule the Ministry. Therefore, the criticism that has been
made that this article somehow enables the Governor to interfere or
has upset the decision of the Cabinet is entirely beside the point,
and completely mistaken. 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_748">55.	It
will be apt to make a note of some of the commentaries given by Ivor
Jennings under the title of Cabinet Government for better
understanding of the subject:-
</p> 


<p id="p_749">"The existence or
absence of a monarch does not in itself make a fundamental
distinction in a Constitution. In a Cabinet system the Cabinet
governs. The functions of the head of the State, be the King or
President, are ancillary. it would be wrong, however, to
underestimate the influence of the monarch in British politics. The
documents now available show that the Whig view of monarchy which
prevailed in the middle of last century and which was expounded by
Bagehot was not wholly in accordance with the facts. The Sovereign
must, in the last resort, accept the decisions of the Government, but
he may have considerable influence on those decisions. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_750">	Queen
Victoria Offended against these principles. She tried to thwart  the
policy which the Liberal  party  had put before the electors in 1880
and which  had secured for that party  a large majority. She
used her power to try to prevent  the formation of a Liberal 
Government when the same party  secured a majority in 1886. She
intrigued  with the leaders of the Opposition in an attempt  to
secure  the defeat of the Government later in the same year. She
acted as broker in the alliance between conservatives and Liberal
Unionists. 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_751">	The subsequent monarchs 
appear to have taken a constitutional view  of their functions. A
phrase  from a letter from the private secretary to the Prime
Minister, referring to the Army reforms of 1905, is worth  quoting.
'The king  cannot  withhold  his consent  from the proposals  which
he is advised  by the Cabinet to approve, but he cannot  conceal  his
strong misgiving.... Though George  V insisted  on seeing the leaders
of the Opposition in 1910, when George V tried to persuade the Prime
Minister's  consent,  and he sought information, not assistance in
defeating  the Government. In 1918 when George V tried to persuade
the Prime Minister  to retain Sir William Roberton as Chief of the
Imperial General Staff, Mr Lloyd George threatened resignation if the
King  insisted. Lotd Stamfordham replied  that the King  had no idea 
of insisting.  In 1929, apparently, George V raised objections to
receiving  an amabassador  from the Soviet Union.  The Foreign 
Secretary had put it to his Sovereign  that here was a Cabinet
decision. Politely  but firmly, he did so put it and the King
received  the ambassador. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_752">	Mr Asquith in 1913 wrote
a long memorandum on the rights and obligations of the Crown. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_753">	We have now a
well-established tradition of two hundred years that, in the last
resort, the occupant  of the Throne  accepts and acts on the advice
of his  ministers.. He is entitled and abound to give his minsters.
He is entitled and bound to give his ministers all relevant 
information which comes to him, to point out objections which seem to
him valid against the course which they advise, to suggest (if he
thinks fit) in alternative policy. Such intimations are always
received by ministers  with the utmost respect and considered with
more respect and deference than if they proceeded from any other
quarter.  But, in the end, the Sovereign  always acts upon the advice
which ministers, after (if need be) reconsideration, feel it their
duty  to offer. They give that advice well knowing that they can, and
probably will, be called upon to account for it by Parliament. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_754">	The dispute over Home
Rule, which produced  this memorandum, also produced one from Lord
Esher, who was advising George V:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_755">	Every constitutional
monarch possesses  a dual personality. He may hold and express
opinions upon the conduct of his ministers and their measures. He mad
endeavour to influence their actions. He may delay decisions in order
to give more time for reflection. He may refuse  assent to their
advice up to the point where he is obliged  to choose between
accepting  it and loosing  their services. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_756">	 If the sovereign 
believes  advice to him to be wrong, he may refuse t take it, and if
his ministers   yields the Sovereign is justified. If the minister
persists,  feeling that he has behind him a majority of the people's
representatives, a constitutional Sovereign must give way. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_757">	 It is precisely  at
this point  that the dual personality of the Monarch becomes clear.
Hitherto he has exercised free volition, he has used his prerogative
of criticism and delay, of personal influence  and remonstrance. At a
given moment, however, when he is forced to choose between
acquiescence and the loss of his minister, the Sovereign
automatically, under the Constitution  which by the constitution Oath
he has sworn to maintain, ceases to have any opinion. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_758">	The King can do no
wrong. This cannot be said of anyone who is a free agent. Within
certain limits, and under certain circumstances, the King ceases, 
constitutionally, to be a free agent.  Hence, the meaning  of the 
pregnant  phrase,  the King  can do no wrong. With due regard  to the
security  of the Throne, the Sovereign  cannot retain the final right
of private judgment. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_759">	Has the King then no
prerogatives?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_760">	Yes, he has many, but
when translated into action they must be exercised  on the advice of
a minister  responsible to Parliament. In no case can the Sovereign 
take political action unless he is screened by a minister 
responsible to Parliament. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_761">	This proposition is
fundamental, and differentiates a constitutional monarchy bassed upon
the principles of 1688 from all other forms of government.  No one
acquainted with the inner  working  of the Constitution  can doubt 
the enormous powers retained and exercised by the Sovereign.  In the
domain  of patronage and appointment, naval, military, ecclesiastical
and civil, he wields great influence  and power. Over foreign policy
his personality exercises a sway commensurate with his intimate 
knowledge  of foreign  courts, and his sustained relations with
foreign potentates. In the distribution  of honours and rewards, the
impartiality of the Sovereign  renders his decision final. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_762">	Even within the doubtful
land of legislation the King's influence  and power of suggesting 
compromise, and sometimes  effecting it, are invaluable assets  in
the difficult business of government. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_763">	It is irrational to
contend  that because  under our constitutional rules and practice
the Sovereign  has now and then to act automatically, he is therefore
 an automation without influence or power....
</p> 


<p id="p_764">	What then is the King to
do, if he is asked by his minister  to violate the Constitution ?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_765">	The answer is that the
Sovereign  cannot act unconstitutionally so long as he acts on the
advice  of a minister  supported by a majority  in the House  of
Commons.   Ministerial  responsibility  is the safeguard  of the
monarchy. Without it the throne  could not stand for long, amid
the gusts of politcal  conflict and the storm of political passion. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_766">	What, however,  is the
King to do if he is asked to support his ministers  in putting a
strain upon the constitution ,which in his view  is  improper  and 
dangerous to the welfare of the state ?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_767">	 In the last resort
the King has no option. If the constitutional doctrines  of
ministerial  responsibility mean anything at all, the King  would
have to sign his own death-warrant, if it was presented  to him for
signature by a minister  commanding  a majority  in Parliament.  If
there is any tampering  wit this fundamental principle, the end of
the monarchy is in sight....
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_768">	 Even if it is true 
that the King  has no power  to act upon his private  judgment and to
overide  the will of the ministers , he has ,  however,  the
unquestioned right of remonstrance. This right should be used for the
double  purpose of safeguarding the King's conscience and of placing
beyond all risk of misconception the whole responsibility for the
advice they tender upon the shoulders of Ministry. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_769">		This statement  must be
read with some qualification. The legal rule that the King  can do no
wrong has no application to the matter. Since an act of the King
could not give a private citizen a legal remedy at common law it was
no doubt desirable that executive acts should be  done by ministers
and other servants of the Crown, but this has no relevance to the 
duty or otherwise of the King to act on the advice  of his ministers.
Nor is much help obtained by an appeal  to the principles of 1688.
For a century after 1688 the King  was by no means  bound to accept 
the advice of ministers.  The change came about not because Whig 
principles were accepted but because after 1832 Government rested not
on the favour of the Crown but on the vote of  the people. Unless the
King could appeal to the  people against his Government  he had to
accept  its advice, and if he appealed to the people against the
Government  he must expect the Government  to appeal to the people
against the King.  In other words , he had inevitabley  in such a
case to enter into a party conflict which he stood every  chance of 
losing, if not immediately, atleast in the future. Lord Esher 
rightly  based his memorandum on the principle  that if the King
exercised   his own judgment the throne could not stand for long"
</p>

 


 

 


<p id="p_770">56.	Thus,
on the basis of the discussion held here, it can be said that except
those functions/areas which have been specifically carved out under
the Constitution, the Governor has to act with the aid and advice of
the Council of Ministers. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_771">	It
would be important to make a mention that though the advice tendered
to the Council of Ministers cannot be questioned or inquired into by
the Court, but when the decision is taken by the Governor without the
aid and advice of the Court, the Court can look into the same and
this is well laid down preposition of law. Reference needs to be made
in the case of <a href="/doc/1297614/" id="a_362">L.G. Chaudhari vs. The Secretary, L.S.G. Dept.,
Govt. of Bihar and others</a> reported in AIR 1980 SC 383
and also in the case of <a href="/doc/320843/" id="a_363">State of M.P. vs. Nandlal Jaiswal</a>
reported in AIR 1987 SC 251.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_772">57.	In
the case of Rameshwar
Prasad (IV) and others vs. Union of India and another, the
Apex Court has held as under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_773">"The Constitution
grants immunity to the Governor as provided in <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_364">Article 361.</a> <a href="/doc/1340387/" id="a_365">Article
361(1</a>), inter alia, provides that the Governor shall not be
answerable to any Court for the exercise and performance of the
powers and duties of his office as far any act done or purporting to
be done by him in exercise and performance of those powers and
duties."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_774">	It is also further held in
this judgment that " The immunity granted under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_366">Article 361</a>
does not mean that in the absence of Governor, the ground of mala
fides on proclamation being ultra vires would not be examined by the
Court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_775">58.	Necessary
at this stage is to construe the provision of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_367">Article 166 :-</a>
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_776">	"<a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_368">Article
166</a> of the Constitution runs as under:-
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_777">"Article
</p><p id="p_778">166.Conduct of business of the Government of the State-(1) All
executive action of the Government of a State shall be expressed to
be taken in the name of the Governor.
</p> 


<p id="p_779">(2)	Orders and other
instruments made and executed in the name of the Governor shall be
authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made
by the Governor, and the validity of an order or instrument which is
so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that
it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the Governor.
</p> 


<p id="p_780">(3) The Governor shall
make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the
Government of the State, and for the allocation among ministers of
the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to
which the Governor is by or under this Constitution required to act
in his discretion."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_781">	For
the conduct of the Government's business <a href="/doc/1838225/" id="a_369">Article 166(1</a>), provides
that all executive actions of the Governor shall be expressly taken
in the name of the Governor. <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_370">Article 166(3)</a> envisages making of the
Rules by the Governor to allocate all his functions to the Ministers
under the Rule of business except those where discretion, under the
Constitution, has been vested in the Governor and the same is to be
exercised by him or her individually.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_782">59.	In
Samsher Singh's case (AIR 1974 SC 2192 at P. 2198),
this Court had held thus:
</p> 


<p id="p_783">"Under the Cabinet
system of Government as embodied in our Constitution, the Governor is
the constitutional or formal head of the State and he exercises all
his powers and functions conferred on him by or under the
Constitution on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers save
in spheres where the Governor is required by or under the
Constitution to exercise his functions in his discretion.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_784">The executive power is
generally described as the residue which does not fall within the
legislative or judicial power.  But executive power may also partake
of legislative or judicial actions.  All powers and functions of the
President except his legislative powers as for example in <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_371">Article
123</a>, viz., ordinance making power and all powers and functions of the
Governor except his legislative power as for example in <a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_372">Article 213</a>
in the President under <a href="/doc/243691/" id="a_373">Article 53 (1)</a> in one case and are executive
powers of the State vested in the  Governor under <a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_374">Article 154(1)</a> in
the other case.  Clause (2) or Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_375">Article 77</a> is not
limited in its operation to the executive action of the Government of
India under Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_376">Article 77.</a>  Similarly, Clause (2) or
Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_377">Article 166</a> is not limited in its operation to the
executive action of the Government of the State under Clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_378">Article 166.</a>  The expression "Business of the Government of
India" in Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_379">Article 77</a>, and the expression "Business
of the Government of the State" in Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_380">Article 166</a>
includes all executive business."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_785">20.	The constitutional
mechanism, i.e., Cabinet system of Government is devised for
convenient transaction of business of the executive power of the
State.  Though constitutionally the executive power of the State
vests in the Governor, he does not, unless Constitution expressly 
conferred on him, personally take the decision.  The decisions are
taken according to business  rules at different  levels and
ultimately the decision rests with the authority specified in the
business rules and is expressed to be taken in the  name of the
Governor.  In substance and the reality, decisions are taken by the
Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister or the Minister or
Secretary as per business rules.  But they are all expressed to be
taken by the Council of Ministers in the name of the Governor and
authenticated by an authorised officer.  The Governor being the
constitutional head of' the State, unless he is required to perform
the function under the Constitution in his individual discretion, the
performance of the executive power, which is coextensive with the
legislative power, is with the aid and the advice of the Council of
Ministers headed by the  Chief Minister.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_786">21. As posed earlier, the
question is; when the Governor discharges the functions under the
Act, is it with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers or in
his official capacity as the Governor ? The legislative is aware of
the above constitutional mechanism of governance."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_787">60.	Thus,
when the responsibility for the decision taken as held in Samsher
Singh's case (supra) rests with the Council of Ministers
headed by the Chief Minister, unless required by the Constitution,
transaction of business of executive powers of the State shall need
to be as contemplated under the Rules of business and no individual
discretion is required to be exercised by the Governor in those
cases.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_788">61.	A
reference shall be made at this stage to the following two
authorities, namely that of A.Sanjeevi Naidu etc. vs. State of
Madras reported in AIR 1970 SC 1102 paragraphs
11 and 12 are reproduced as under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_789">"11.	We think that
the above submissions advanced on behalf of the appellants are
without force and are based on a misconception of the principles
underlying our Constitution. Under our Constitution, the Governor is
essentially a constitutional head, the administration of State is run
by the Council of Ministers. But in the very nature of things, it is
impossible for the Council of Ministers to deal with each and every
matter that comes before the Government. In order to obviate that
difficulty the Constitution has authorised the Governor under
sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_381">article (3)</a> of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_382">Article 166</a> to make rules for the more convenient
transaction of business of the Government of the State and for the
allocation amongst its Ministers, the business of the Government. All
matters excepting those in which Governor is required to act in his
discretion have to be allocated to one or the other of the Ministers
on the advice of the Chief Minister. Apart from allocating business
among the Ministers, the Governor can also make rules on the advice
of his Council of Ministers for more convenient transaction of
business. He can, not only allocate the various subjects amongst the
Ministers but may go further and designate a particular official to
discharge any particular function. But this again he can do only on
the advice of the Council of Ministers.

<p id="p_790">12.	The cabinet is
responsible to the legislature for every action taken in any of the
ministries. That is the essence of joint responsibility. That does
not mean that each and every decision must be taken by the cabinet.
The political responsibility of the Council of Ministers does not and
cannot predicate the personal responsibility of the Ministers to
discharge all or any of the governmental functions. Similarly an
individual Minister is responsible to the legislature for every
action taken or omitted to be taken in his ministry. This again is a
political responsibility and not personal responsibility. Even the
most hard-working Minister cannot attend to every business in his
department. If he attempts to do it, he is bound to make a mess of
his department. In every well-planned administration, most of the
decisions are taken by the civil servants who are likely to be
experts and not subject to political pressure. The Minister is not
expected to burden himself with the day to day administration. His
primary function is to lay down the policies and programmes of his
ministry while the Council of Ministers settle the major policies and
programmes of the Government. When a civil servant takes a decision,
he does not do it as delegate of his Minister. He does it on behalf
of the Government. It is always open to a Minister to call for any
file in his ministry and pass orders. He may also issue directions to
the officers in his ministry regarding the disposal of Government
business either generally or as regards any specific case. Subject to
that over all power, the officers designated by the 'Rules' or the
standing orders, can take decisions on behalf of the Government.
These officers are the limbs of the Government and not its
delegates."

<p id="p_792">"17.	The order of

<p id="p_794">62.
	In the light of the discussion made hereinabove, Section 3 of the
Gujarat Lokayukta Act,1986, if is examined, at this stage, it reads
as follows:-
</p> 


<p id="p_795">"
</p><p id="p_796">3.	Appointment
of Lokayukta.-(l)
For the purpose of conducting investigations in accordance with the
provisions of this Act,the Governor  shall, by warrant under his hand
and seal, appoint a person to be known as the Lokayukta:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_797">Provided
that the Lokayukta shall be appointed after consultation with the
Chief Justice of the High Court and except where such appointment is
to be made at a time when the Legislative Assembly of the State of
Gujarat has been dissolved or a Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_392">article 356</a> of the
Constitution is in operation in the State of Gujarat, after
consultation also with the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative
Assembly, or if there be no such Leader, a person elected  in this
behalf by the members of the Opposition in that House in such manner
as the Speaker may direct.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_798">(2)	A
person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Lokayukta unless
he is or has been a Judge of a High Court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_799">(3)	Every
person appointed as the Lokayukta shall, before entering upon his
office, make and subscribe, before the Governor or some person
appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation in the form
set out for the purpose in the First Schedule." 
</p>
 


 
<p id="p_800">63.	There
does not appear to be any indication in the statute,  much less a
strong and clear indication, which will suggest departure from the
tenets of Parliamentary democracy for this Court to hold that the
appointment under Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act,1986 was not
to be done under the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. On
the contrary, all indications are that this appointment is
essentially required to be done by the Governor only on aid and
advice and there is no discretion permitted by this statue that could
be exercised considering the scheme of the Constitution and more
particularly,  Articles 163 and 166 of the Constitution.
</p> 


<p id="p_801">	It
is also required to be noted here that under the Rules of Business of
government of Gujarat subject of  appointment
of Lokayukta
is chronologically numbered as  36(A)
titled as the Gujarat Government Rules of Business, 1990. Under
Part-II of these Rules, subject is allocated to the General
Administration Department (GAD) and thus, there is a specific
allotment of the business by the Governor. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_802">	Even
considering the submission of other side that  <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_393">Article 166</a> is to be
construed directory and not mandatory,  then also, it is indicative
of the fact that
this is an area where discretion under the Constitution was not to be
exercised by the Governor. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_803">	In
case of M/s Rajureshwar Associates V/s. State of Maharashtra and
others reported in AIR 2004 Supreme Court 3770, 
the Chief Minister informally directed not to place before the
Cabinet matter even where there was non concurrence
of Finance Department despite  Business Rule 11(2) of the Government
of Maharastra required placing of such matter before the cabinet in
such eventuality. Apex Court disapproved such a bypassing of business
rules thus :  
</p>
 


<p id="p_804">"46 Reliance on the
case of Nanded Mill for coming to the conclusion that the matter need
not be placed before the Cabinet is totally misplaced. It was not the
decision of the Cabinet that such matters should not be placed before
it. Even assuming that the Chief Minister had informally directed as
is stated in the noting of the Principal Secretary, the requirement
under the Rules of Business could not be bye  passed  by  any 
individual functionary "  
</p>
 


  

 


<p id="p_805">64.	Similar
such issue had arisen before the Patna High Court where the question
was whether the Governor had power to appoint a Lokayukta under the
Bihar Lokayukta Act. In the case of <a href="/doc/1279970/" id="a_394">Ram
Nagina Singh and others vs. S. V. Sohni and others</a>
(supra), it has been held in clear terms by Patna High Court that the
appointment of Lokayukta can be made by the Governor only on the aid
and advice of the Council of Ministers and not independently, which
reads as under:- 
</p>
 


<p id="p_806">"20.	Without
deciding the extreme contention that has been put forth by the
learned Solicitor General, it appears to me that ordinarily when a
power is vested, even by a Statute, in the Governor, he is to act on
the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. It does not cease to
be an executive power merely because it is conferred by a Statute. It
would be defeating the constitutional scheme if it was to be held
that the mere use of the word "Governor" in any Statute
would be imputing an intention to the legislature of conferring a
power 'eo nomine'. Indeed the presumption should be otherwise. When
the Governor is under the constitutional scheme to act on the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers, the use of expression Governor in
any Statute would, in any event, and unless a strong contrary
intention can be inferred, mean Governor acting on the aid and advice
of the Council of Ministers. Any other interpretation would upset the
constitutional scheme. Even if it be possible for the legislature to
invest the Governor with powers eo nomine, in so far as the present
Statute is concerned, this, in my view, has not been done. In order
to come to a conclusion that the Governor has been invested with
powers by the legislature eo nomine very strong indications will have
to be there in the relevant Statute; since, as already explained, in
one sense it goes against the concept of Parliamentary form of
Government, which is one of the basic postulates of the Constitution.
In the present Statute I find no such indication. On the other hand,
indications are to the contrary. <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_395">Section 3</a> of the Ordinance states
that the Governor shall by a warrant under his hand and seal appoint
the Lokayukta in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High
Court and the leader of Opposition. If Governor is to act eo nomine
it would mean that although leader of Opposition will have an
effective role to play, the State Government would have no hand in
the appointment. This appears to be inconceivable, unless there was
something in the Statute which could irresistibly lead to the
conclusion that the legislature had not contemplated aid and advice
of Council of Ministers in the making of the appointment. I am
further of the opinion that the use of the word Governor in <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_396">Section 3</a>
of the Ordinance was appropriate for the reason that the section
contemplates the issue of warrant under the hand and seal of the
Governor. Taking all these into consideration, I am of the view that
the appointment of Lokayukta, as envisaged in <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_397">Section 3</a>, has to be
made by the Governor with the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers."
</p> 


<p id="p_807">xxx   xxx   xxx
 


</p><p id="p_808">26. The other objections
raised on behalf of the petitioners is that the expression inquiry in
<a href="/doc/60543/" id="a_398">Article 163 (3)</a> of the Constitution does not apply to cases where
either facts are admitted or where all the relevant and material
facts are placed before the Court and they lead to only one
conclusion. Where a decision has to be arrived at by looking into
materials on the record, it is plain that it is only after an inquiry
that any conclusion can be arrived at. The Court does in such a
situation, inquire into a matter. Further, in my view, where the
foundation of a decision is existence or non-existence of a fact, it
cannot be said that the Court does not inquire into it even though it
is on the basis of such existence or non-existence that a conclusion
is arrived at. It is, therefore, clear that even where facts are
admitted, no conclusion is possible without inquiring into a matter
or issue which is pre-requisite to the exercise of the jurisdiction
or power of the Court in the matter of giving relief to a party in a
judicial proceeding. It would thus be not correct to say that if a
fact in issue is admitted the court has not to inquire into it. The
bar here is on inquiry and not what a party chooses to call as
evidence to prove and disprove the facts. The issue is inherent in
the controversy itself.  
</p>
 


<p id="p_809">27.	Learned counsel for
the petitioners further contended that <a href="/doc/60543/" id="a_399">Article 163 (3)</a> creates a
privilege in favour of the State and it is capable of being waived.
In this case, it is said, it has actually been waived. But as I read
the Article, I do not think that any question of privilege is
involved. The Article is a bar to the jurisdiction of the Court to
inquire into specified matters. There is a clear difference between a
privilege and a bar to the jurisdiction of the Court. The Article
does not create any privilege but contemplates that certain matters
shall not be inquired into by Courts.55 In this view of the matter
the last contention in relation to <a href="/doc/60543/" id="a_400">Article 163 (3)</a> of the
Constitution also cannot be accepted."
</p> 
	 


	

 


<p id="p_810">65.	In
 the case of Ajit Kumar etc. vs. State of Jharkhand and Ors.
etc.(supra) one of the Judges(J. Iqbal) dealt with the powers
of Governor in the appointment of Lokayukta  as under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_811">"23.	The aforesaid
ratio of Samsher Singh's case was again followed by the Apex Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1228497/" id="a_401">State of M.P. And Ors. v. Dr.Yashwant Trimbak</a>, (1996) 2
SCC 305, and held that under <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_402">Article 163(1)</a> of the Constitution
excepting functions required by the Constitution to be exercised by
the Governor in his discretion, the Governor acts on the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers. Any function vested in the
Governor, whether executive, legislative or quasi-judicial in nature
and whether vested by the Constitution or by a statute be delegated
by Rules of Business unless the contrary is clearly provided for by
such constitutional or statutory provision.
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_812">24.	As noticed, <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_403">Article
166(3)</a> of the Constitution confer power on the Governor to make rules
for more convenient transaction of business of the Government of the
State. In exercise of all power Governor of Bihar has framed rules
called the Rules of executive business which has been made applicable
in the State of Jharkhand. The business of the State is complicated
one and necessarily to be conducted through the agency of a large
number of officials and authorities. It is true that the Governor of
State shall exercise his power with the aid and advice of Council of
Ministes but the Council of Ministers are no more than an advisor. It
is for the Governor of the State to acept or not to accept the advice
of the Council of Minister specially while deciding the power vested
in him under the special statute. The Supreme Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/98066/" id="a_404">Bachhittar Singh vs State of Punjab and Anr</a>. AIR 1963 SC 395, while
considering the question as to when the aid and advice of the Council
of Ministers will become the action of the State observed:-
</p> 


<p id="p_813">	"The business of
State is a complicated one and has necessarily to be conducted
through the agency of a large number of officials and authorities.
The Constitution, therefore, requires and so did the Rules of
Business framed by the Rajpramukh of Pepsu provided,that the action
must be taken by the authority concerned in the name of the
Rajpramukh. It is not till this formality is observed that the action
can be regarded as that of the State or hereby the Rajpramukh. We may
further observe that, constitutionally speaking the Minister is no
more than an advisor and that the head of the State, the Governor or
Rajpramukh, is to act with the aid and advice of his Council  of
Ministers. Therefore, until such advice is accepted by the Governor
whatever the Minister or the Council of Ministers may say in regard
to a particular matter does not become the action of the State until
the advice of the Council of Ministers is accepted or deemed to be
accepted by the head of the State. Indeed, it is possible that after
expressing one opinion about a particular matter at a particular
stage a Minister or the Council of Ministers may express quite a
different opinion, one which may be completely opposed to the earlier
opinion, which of them can be regarded as the 'order of the State
government? Therefore, to make the opinion amount to  a decision of
the Government it must be communicated to the person concerned.

<p id="p_814">xxx   xxx   xxx
 


 


 


	In
a concurring judgment,  Member Judge of this Division Bench (S.J.
Mukhopadhyay, J.) also held in terms that unless the Constitution
specifies by making exception, the Governor requires to act on aid
and advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister
under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_405">Article 163.</a> Findings on this issue  are as under:-
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_815">43.	However, I may add
that the manner in which the appointment of Lokayukta was dealt is
peculiar, not only against the provisions of law, but also against,
the spirit. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_816">	The power of appointment
of Lokayukta is vested with the Governor of the State. It is to be
made as per Section 3 of the Lokayukta Act,1973 by the Governor by
issuance of warrant under his hand and seal after necessary
consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court and Leader of
Opposition . Nowhere, under the Act any stipulation has been made to
have any consultation with the Chief Minister of the State. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_817">	Though such consultation
is made with the Chief Justice and Leader of Opposition, cannot be
stated, that the creature of the law intended to exclude the Chief
Minister  from the purview of consultation? Obviously, the answer
will be in 'negative', for the reasons as discussed hereunder:-
</p> 


<p id="p_818">	The Chief Minister is
the head of the Council of Ministers. As per <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_406">Article 163</a> of the
Constitution of India, the Council of Ministers with the Chief
Minister at the head is to aid and advice the Governor in the
exercise of all his functions. The exceptions so far as the Governor
is by or under the Constitution requires to exercise functions or any
of them in his discretion.
</p> 


<p id="p_819">	The power of Governor to
appoint Lokayukta under the Lokayukta Act, 1973 is not an exceptional
Act to be exercised by the Governor under the Constitution.
Therefore, the Chief Minister as a Head of Council of Ministers will
automatically figure in the matter of appointment of Lokayukta, which
is to be made by the Governor in the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers being not an exceptional power delegated under the
Constitution." 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_820">	Section
3 of Gujarat Lokayukta Act provides for appointment even when
legislative assembly is dissolved, but that also is no indication of
independent powers of the Governor and in such circumstances,
Governor is required to act on aid and advice of Council of Ministers
headed by the Prime Minister. Governor therefore, also cannot draw 
its powers from these wordings and insist on independent exercise of
powers. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_407">The Act</a> suggests no departure from  the constitutional
requirements certainly.
</p> 


<p id="p_821">	Before
concluding this issue, exceptions spelt out by the Constitution for
the Governor to act independently are to be reproduced from Samsher
Singh's case(supra):- 
</p>
 


<p id="p_822">"9.	First, there are
several constitutional functions, powers and duties of the Governor.
These are conferred on him eo nomine the Governor. The Governor, is,
by and under the Constitution, required to act in his discretion in
several matters. These constitutional functions and powers of the
Governor eo nomine as well as these in the discretion of the Governor
are not executive powers of the State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_408">Article
154</a> read with <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_409">Article 162.</a> 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_823">10.	Second, the Governor
under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_410">Article 163</a> of the Constitution can take aid and advice of his
Council of Ministers when he is exercising executive power of the
State. The Governor can exercise powers and functions without the aid
and advice of his Council of Ministers when he is required by or
under the Constitution to act in his discretion, where he is required
to exercise his constitutional functions conferred on him eo nominee
as the Governor. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_824">20.	Articles where the
expression "acts in his discretion" is used in relation
to the powers and functions of the Governor are those which speak of
special responsibilities of the Governor. These articles are
371A(1)(b), 371A(l)(d), 371A(2)(b) and 371(A)(2)(f). There are two
paragraphs in the Sixth Schedule, namely 9(2) 	and 18(3) where the
words "in his discretion" are used in relation 	to
determination of amount of royalties payable by licensees or lessees
prospecting for, or extracting minerals, to the District Council.
Paragraph 18(3) has been omitted with effect from January 21, 1972.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_825">21.	The provisions contained
in <a href="/doc/1774596/" id="a_411">Article 371A(1)(b)</a> speak of the special responsibility of the
Governor of Nagaland with respect to law and order in the State of
Nagaland and exercise of his individual judgment as to the action to
be taken. The proviso states that the decision of the Governor in his
discretion shall be final and it shall not be called in question. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_826">22,	<a href="/doc/1288329/" id="a_412">Article 371A (1)(d)</a>
states that the Governor shall in his discretion make rules providing
for the composition of the Regional Council for the Tuensang
District.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_827">23.	<a href="/doc/1221523/" id="a_413">Article 371A (2)(b)</a>
states that for periods mentioned there the Governor shall in his
discretion arrange for an equitable allocation of certain funds,
between the Tuensang District and the rest of the State.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_828">24.	<a href="/doc/361436/" id="a_414">Article 371A(2)(f)</a>
states that the final decision on all matters relating to the
Tuensang District shall be made by the Governor in his discretion."
</p> 


	 

 


 

 


<p id="p_829">66.	It
can thus be concluded from the discussion held herein above that in
Parliamentary form of democracy, Governor though exercises executive
powers, these powers are necessarily to be exercised with the aid and
advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister
unless the constitutional provisions carve  out areas permitting
individual discretion of the Governor.
</p> 


<p id="p_830">	Moreover,
for all the executive functions to be carried out in the name of
Governor who is constitutional head, these executive functions are to
be carried out as per business rules and allocation of subjects in
the rules determines the authority and decision of such a subject
rests with such authority specified in the business rules. And yet,
in substance, it is the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief
Minister which owes collective responsibility for every decision
taken expressly in the name of the Governor under the business rules.
</p>

 


<p id="p_831">	Appointment
of Lokayukta for the State of Gujarat since falls under the Business
Rules ( Item No.36A First Schedule of the Gujarat Government Rules of
Business, 1990), with no indication much less strong  indication in
the statute of Governor having been invested with the power to
exercise personal discretion, appointment of Lokayukta though
expressly done in the name of Governor, Lokayukta has to be appointed
only on aid and advice of Council of Ministers headed by the Chief
Minister.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_832">67.	In
such premise, whether the appointment made of the Lokayukta in the
instant case, is justifiable and whether there existed compelling
reasons which could have permitted the Governor to exercise such
powers independently arising from any express provisions of the
Constitution or otherwise shall be dealt with later on in this
judgment.
</p> 

<p id="p_833"> Office
of Lokayukta- Whether Court or has trappings of Court:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_834">68.	As
provided under Section 3 of the Lokayukta Act, appointment is
expressly to be done by the Governor on aid and advice of Council of
Ministers headed by the Chief Minister who are required to so do it
after consultation with the Chief Justice and the Leader of the
Opposition party. And, that brings to the fore second vital question
as to whether the office of the Lokayukta is Court or has trappings
of the Court or not.
</p> 


<p id="p_835">	This
question assumes importance as that would determine the extent of
power of each dignitary in making such appointment and that also
would have vital bearing on applying the law laid down by the Apex
Court in appointment of judges and Presiding Officers for the Courts
and such institutions/offices which can be termed Courts or having 
trappings of Courts.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_836">69.	It
would be relevant to consider the scheme of the present Act of the
Lokayukta before examining this question. Relevant provisions for

of Lokayukta in case of the Chief Minister.-! 1)
If after 
investigation
of any action in respect of which a complaint involving 
an
allegation has been made against the Chief Minister or against
the 
Chief Minister in conjunction with any other public
functionary, the 
Lokayukta is satisfied that such allegation can
be substantiated, 
either wholly or partly against the Chief
Minister, he shall, by a report 
in writing, communicate his
findings, alongwith the relevant docu-

<p id="p_915">On
receipt of the report under sub-section (1),
the
Chief Mini­ster shall cause the same to be placed, without delay,
before the Council of Ministers."	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_916">70.	It
can be seen from these provisions that for being appointed as 
Lokayukta, a person  has to be minimum a sitting or a retired judge
of the High Court. He is  authorized to investigate any complaint
received or forwarded to him and such a complaint is either
investigated or he can at his discretion  refuse to investigate the
complaint on account of the same being frivolous or vexatious in
nature. And if complaint is investigated, he is required to present
the report.
</p> 


<p id="p_917">	For
the purpose of conducting such an investigation, it has all the
powers of a Civil Court. By virtue of provision of Section 11(5) of
the Lokayukta Act also, it is deemed to be a Civil Court. The
proceedings  before the Lokayukta are deemed to be judicial
proceedings with the meaning of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_444">Section 193C</a> and <a href="/doc/218156/" id="a_445">220</a> of the Indian
Penal Code. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_918">	The
reports of Lokayukta have no binding effect, nor do they result into
either conviction or achieving any finality in terms of adjudication.
These reports can, of course, be made basis to initiate prosecution
against public functionaries concerned. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_919">	Considering
this scheme of the Act the tests which have been set out in various
judgments are to be examined before it can be concluded whether the
function of Lokayukta is that of the Court or not. It is required to
be emphasized at this juncture that the report of Lokayukta does not
culminate into punishing any erring person per se, but it creates
strong opinion of people in judging the elected representative and
the public functionaries. Importance of such reports would be dealt
with separately hereinafter, but, for the purpose of deciding whether
the office can be said to be the Court or whether the same has
trappings of the Court, the answer shall have to be also found from
binding judgments.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_920">71.	During
the course of hearing submission was made to equate office of the
Lokayukta with the High Court and also to place the same  on higher
level than that of the High Court considering people's aspiration,
however, such a submission cannot be accepted to hold this office as
Court  at present. There is a wide gap between 'what should be' and
'ought to be' and 'what is'. The point in issue on hand shall need to
be determined on the basis of the provisions which are at present
existing. Courts are expected to be alive to the changing social
needs, for present it has to act on the tangible material available
and the statute as that stood on 25.8.2011.
</p> 


<p id="p_921">72.	There
are very well laid down tests and criteria for determining whether
any authority/institution/office is a Court or whether it has
trappings of Court.
</p> 


<p id="p_922">	The
Supreme Court in different cases carved out following litmus tests as
guide on this question. It is pertinent to reproduce relevant
portions of those judgments at this stage.
</p> 


<p id="p_923">	In
the case of <a href="/doc/1879682/" id="a_446">Dr. Baliram Waman Hiray vs. Justice Lentin and
others</a> reported in (1988)4 SCC 419,
Courts and quasi-judicial
 bodies having trappings of Court are expressly discussed thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_924">"33. <a href="/doc/197199/" id="a_447">In Virindar
Kumar Satyawadi v. State of Punjab</a>, (AIR 1956 SC 153) (supra), a
three-Judges Bench speaking through Venkatarama Ayyar, J. relying
upon the celebrated decision of the House of Lords in Shell Co. of
Australia v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation, 1931 AC 275 explained
the legal connotation of the term 'Court' in these words (at p. 157
of  AIR): 
</p>
 


<p id="p_925">"What distinguishes
a Court from a quasi-judicial tribunal is that it is  charged with
a duty to decide disputes in a judicial manner and declare the rights
of parties in a definitive judgment. To decide in a judicial
manner involves that the parties are entitled as a matter of right to
be heard in support of their claim and to adduce evidence in proof of
it. And it also imports an obligation on the part of the authority to
decide the matter on a consideration of the evidence adduced and in
accordance with law. When a question therefore arises as to whether
an authority created by an Act is a Court as distinguished from a
quasi-judicial tribunal, what has to be decided is whether having
regard to the provisions of the Act it possesses all the attributes
of a Court."
</p> 


<p id="p_926">It is a familiar feature
of modern legislation to set up bodies and tribunals, and entrust
them with work of a judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative
character, but they are not Courts in the accepted sense of that
term, though they may possess, as observed by' Lord Sankey, L.C. in
Shell Co. of Australia's case, some of the trappings of a Court.
Venkatarama Ayyar, J. in Virindar Kumar Satyawadi has referred to
several decisions of the Courts in England and Australia as to what
are the essential characteristics of a Court as distinguished from
tribunals exercising quasi-judicial functions."

<p id="p_927">	In
the case of <a href="/doc/1353604/" id="a_448">State of Maharashtra vs. Labour Law Practitioners'
Association and others</a> reported in (1998) 2 SCC 688
'Courts'  and 'judicial service' are discussed elaborately:-	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_928">"16. We need not
refer at length to various other judgments which have dealt with the
question whether a Tribunal set up under different Acts which were
before the Court in each case was a judicial body or a Court, and
whether it was a Court subordinate to the High Court. <a href="/doc/1531171/" id="a_449">In Harinagar
Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Shyam Sunder Jhunjhunwala</a>, AIR 1961 SC 1669 the
Central Government exercising appellate powers under <a href="/doc/1907970/" id="a_450">Section 111</a> of
the Companies Act was held to be acting as a judicial body and not as
an administrative body. In the case of <a href="/doc/475465/" id="a_451">Shripatrao Dajisaheb Ghatge v.
The State of Maharashtra</a>, AIR 1977 Bombay 384 (FB), the term "Courts"
was held to cover all tribunals which were basically Courts
performing judicial functions giving judgments which were binding and
exercising sovereign judicial power transferred to them by the State.
It was held that High Court could exercise its jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_452">Article 227</a> over such tribunals. A Full Bench of the Gujarat High
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/6742/" id="a_453">Shaikh Mohammedbhikhan Hussainbhai v. The
Manager, Chandrabhanu Cinema</a>, 1986 Lab IC 1749 : (AIR 1986 Gujarat

the purposes of <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_454">Contempt of Courts Act</a> and were also Courts

<p id="p_930">17. The Allahabad High
Court in the case of M/s. Poysha Industrial Company Ltd., Ghaziabad
v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1985 Lab IC 1683 has, however, held that
the presiding officer of a Labour Court does not belong to the
judicial service of the State as defined in <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_455">Article 236.</a> The
Allahabad High Court's judgment has relied upon the decision of this
Court in Chandra Mohan's case (AIR 1966 SC 1987) (supra) for the
purpose of holding that it is only the hierarchy of ordinary civil
Courts in the narrow sense headed by a District Judge which comes
under the term "judicial service" under <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_456">Article 236.</a> The
view taken by the Allahabad High Court appears to be too narrow a
view of the term "judicial service". In Chandra Mohan's
case (supra), this Court was primarily concerned with excluding from
judicial service persons who held posts in services which were not
exclusively judicial. When the service is exclusively judicial, there
is no reason to exclude such judicial service from that term under
<a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_457">Article 236.</a> The High Court in the present case is justified in
rejecting the narrow view taken in that judgment.

<p id="p_931">18. In the case of <a href="/doc/868559/" id="a_458">Shri
Kumar Padma Prasad v. Union of India</a>, (1992) 2 SCC 428 : (1992 AIR
SCW 1993), this Court had to consider qualifications for the purpose
of appointment as a Judge of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_459">Article 217</a> of the
Constitution. While interpreting the expression "judicial
office" under <a href="/doc/1120401/" id="a_460">Article 217(2)(a</a>), this Court held that the
expression "judicial office" must be interpreted in
consonance with the scheme of Chapters V and VI of Part VI of the
Constitution. So construed it means a judicial office which belongs
to the judicial service as defined under <a href="/doc/1086036/" id="a_461">Article 236(b).</a> Therefore,
in order to qualify for appointment as a Judge of a High Court, a
person must hold a judicial office which must be a part of the
judicial service of the State. After referring to the cases of
Chandra Mohan (AIR 1966 SC 1987) (supra) and Statesman (Private) Ltd.
(AIR 1968 SC 1495) (supra), this Court said that the term "judicial
office" in its generic sense may include a wide variety of
offices which are connected with the administration of justice in one
way or the other. Officers holding various posts under the executive
are often vested with magisterial power to meet a particular
situation. The Court said, "Did the framers of the Constitution
have this type of offices in mind when they provided a source of
appointment to the high office of a judge of the High Court from
amongst the holders of a "judicial office"? The answer has
to be in the negative. We are of the view that holder of judicial
office under <a href="/doc/1120401/" id="a_462">Article 217(2)(a)</a> means the person who exercise only
judicial functions, determines causes inter parties and renders
decisions in a judicial capacity. He must belong to the judicial
service which as a class is free from executive control and is
disciplined to uphold the dignity, integrity and independence of the
judiciary." Going by these tests laid down as to what
constitutes judicial service under <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_463">Article 236</a> of the Constitution,
the Labour Court judges and the Judges of the Industrial Court can be
held to belong to judicial service. The hierarchy contemplated in the
case of Labour Court judges is the hierarchy of Labour Court judges
and Industrial Court Judges with the Industrial Court Judges holding
the superior position of District Judges. The Labour Courts have also
been held as subject to the High Court's power of superintendence
under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_464">Article 227."</a>

</p> 


<p id="p_933">"7.<a href="/doc/1776469/" id="a_466">In Brajnandan

case (supra) and various other decisions and it was held by this
Court that in order to  constitute a Court in the strict sense
of the term, an essential condition is that the Court should have,
apart from having some of the trappings of a judicial tribunal,  power
to give a decision or a definitive judgment which has finality and
authoritativeness which are the essential tests of a judicial
pronouncement.

provisions make it clear that the Assistant Charity Commissioner has
not only the trapping of a judicial tribunal but also has power to
give a decision or a definitive judgment which has finality and
authoritativeness which are essential tests of a judicial
pronouncement. The Assistant Charity Commissioner, therefore,
possesses all the attributes of a court. The fact that the Assistant
Charity Commissioner has also to perform some administrative
functions is not of any relevance for coming to the conclusion that
he is not a court, having regard to the provisions of the Act which
substantially confer on him the power to give a definite judgment
subject to finality in appeal, after hearing all concerned. Functions
of the Assistant Charity Commissioner are predominantly adjudicatory.
The Assistant Charity Commissioner has almost all the powers which an
ordinary Civil Court has including power of summoning witnesses,
compelling production of documents, examining witnesses on oath and
coming to a definite conclusion on the evidence induced and arguments
submitted."

issue:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_937">38.	The term "courts"
</p><p id="p_938">refers to places where justice is administered or refers to Judges
who exercise judicial functions. Courts are established by the State
for administration of justice that is for exercise of the judicial
power of the State to maintain and uphold the rights, to punish
wrongs and to adjudicate upon disputes. Tribunals on the other hand
are special alternative institutional mechanisms, usually brought
into existence by or under a statute to decide disputes arising with
reference to that particular statute, or to determine controversies
arising out of any administrative law. Courts refer to civil courts,
criminal courts and the High Courts.

discretion of Court and that of the Tribunal is reiterated
extensively:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_940">29.	This question need
not detain us any further, as the law in this regard is no more res
integra and stands finally stated by a Constitution Bench of this
Court in Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd. Hidayatullah, J. as His Lordship
then was, while giving his own reasons concurred with other Judges in
allowing the appeal setting aside the order of the Central
Government. While commenting upon the maintainability of the appeals,
he drew a distinction between a "court" and a "tribunal"
and dealt with the question as to whether the Central Government,
while hearing this appeal, was a tribunal and held as under : (AIR
pp. 1680-81, paras 32-33 &amp; 36).
</p> 


<p id="p_941">"32 With the growth
of civilization and the problems of modern life, a large number of
Administrative Tribunals have come  into existence. These tribunals
have the authority of law to pronounce upon valuable rights; they act
in a judicial manner and even on evidence on oath, but they are not
part of the ordinary courts of civil judicature. They share the
exercise of the judicial power of the State, but they are brought
into existence to implement some administrative policy or to
determine controversies arising out of some administrative law. They
are very similar to courts, but are not courts. When the Constitution
speaks of 'courts' in <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_470">Article 136</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_471">, 227</a> or 228 or in Articles 233 to
237 or in the Lists, it contemplates courts of civil judicature but
not tribunals other than such courts. This is the reason for using
both the expressions in Articles 136 and 227.
</p> 


<p id="p_942">	By 'courts' is meant
courts of civil judicature and by 'tribunals', those bodies of men
who are appointed to decide controversies arising under certain
special laws. Among the powers of the State is included the power to
decide such controversies. This is undoubtedly one of the attributes
of the State, and is aptly called the judicial power of the State. In
the exercise of this power, a clear division is thus noticeable.
Broadly speaking, certain special matters go before tribunals, and
the residue goes before the ordinary courts of civil judicature.
Their procedures may differ, but the functions are not essentially
different. What distinguishes them has never been successfully
established. Lord Stamp said that the real distinction is that courts
have 'an air of detachment'. But this is more a matter of age and
tradition and is not of the essence. Many tribunals, in recent years,
have acquitted themselves so well and with such detachment as to make
this test insufficient. Lord Sankey, L.C in Shell Co. of Australia
Vs. Federal Commr. Of Taxation observed : (AC pp. 296-97) 

 


	'The authorities are
clear to show that there are tribunals with many of the trappings of
a court, which, nevertheless, are not courts in the strict sence of
exercising judicial power....
</p> 


<p id="p_943">	In that connection it
may be useful to enumerate some negative propositions on this
subject: 1. A tribunal is not necessarily a court in this strict
sence because it gives a final decision. 2. Nor because it hears
witnesses on oath. 3. Nor because two or more contending parties
appear before it between whom it has to decide. 4. Nor because it
gives decisions which affect the rights of subjects 5. Nor because
there is an appeal to a Court 6.Nor because it is a body to which a
matter is referred by another body. <a href="/doc/1752215/" id="a_472">See R. v. Electricity
Commissioners</a>.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_944">33.	In my opinion, a
court in the strict sense is a tribunal which is a part of the
ordinary hierarchy of courts of civil judicature maintained by the
State under its Constitution to exercise the judicial power of the
State. These courts perform all the judicial functions of the State
except those that are excluded by law from their jurisdiction. The
word 'judicial', be it noted, is itself capable of two meanings. They
were admirably stated by Lopes, L.J. In Royal Aquarium and Summer and
Winter Garden Society Ltd. v. Parkinson in these words:(QB p.452)
 


 


 


	''The word "judicial"
</p><p id="p_945">has two meanings. It may refer to the discharge of duties exercisable
by a judge or by justices in court, or to administrative duties which
need not be performed in court, but in respect of which it is
necessary to bring to bear a judical mind- that is, a mind to
determine what is fair and just in respect of the matters under
consideration.'
 


	That an officer is
required to decide matters before him 'judicially' in the second
sense does not make him a court or even a tribunal, because that only
establishes that he is following a standard of conduct, and is free
from bias or interest.
</p> 


<p id="p_946">	*			*			*
 


 


 


 


 


</p><p id="p_947">36.	Now, in its functions
the Government often reaches decisions, but all decisions of the
Government cannot be regarded as those of a tribunal. Resolutions of
the Government may affect rights of parties and yet, they may not be
in the exercise of judicial power. Resolutions of the Government may
be amenable to writs under Articles 32 and 226 in appropriate cases,
but may not be subject to a direct appeal under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_473">Article 136</a> as the
decisions of a tribunal. The position however changes when Government
embarks upon curial functions and proceeds to exercise judicial power
and decide disputes. In those circumstances, it is legitimate to
regard the office who deals with the matter and even the Government
itself as a tribunal. The officer who decides, may even be anonymous;
but the decision is one of a tribunal, whether expressed in his name
or in the name of the Central Government. The word 'tribunal' is a
word of wide import, and the words 'court' and 'tribunal' embrace
within them the exercise of judicial power in all its forms. The
decision of the Government thus falls within the powers of this Court
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_474">Article 136."</a>
</p> 


 


 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_948">73.	In
light of the examination of provisions of the Lokayukta Act as also
the materials on record and the principles established by the Apex
Court, time and again,it would not be possible to state and hold that
the office of the Lokayukta is either a Court or has trappings of
Court. It has no power to give a definitive judgment attaching
finality and authoritativeness nor does it possess trappings of Court
conferring any power to perform judicial functions. The office of
Lokayukta is an august office envisaging strong and independent
person who acts 'judicially' , having powers of deemed  civil courts
for certain provisions of the Indian Penal code as envisaged under
Section 11 of the Lokayukta Act and yet, considering the discussion
above, it can neither be given the status of Court, let alone of the
highest  Court nor can the concept of trappings of Court be imparted
for evaluating  its functions.      
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_949"> 3rd
Issue: Convention
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_950">74.	On
having held that this office of Lokayukta is neither Court nor having
trappings of Court, question that arises is as to how the
consultation process will have to begin and from where the proposal
for appointment needs to be emanated from.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_951">	The
third point in issue therefore is as to whether there is any role of
conventions in absence of rules or clear guidelines to regulate
exercise of discretion and to solve the problem of filling the gap.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_952">75.	It
was argued by the learned Advocate General that so far in the
appointment of the Lokayukta,  from the time the statute has come
into being in the year 1986 conventionally the proposal, on all
occasions, had emanated from the office of the Chief Minister, where
either the recommendation was made with a request to opine on the
name of the recommandee or the names were called for from the Chief
Justice of the State. But at no point of time, it was the office of
the Governor which had called for any name for such an appointment. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_953">	It
was also pointed out that in this case also, in the year 2005, when
the name of Mr. Justice K.R.Vyas was considered, it had emanated from
the office of the Chief Minster and the proposal was sent to the
Chief Justice who had opined in favour of his appointment. What had
been followed on earlier three occasions, also had continued in case
of Mr. Justice K.R. Vyas and this convention is also followed,
according to him, in other states where such appointments are being
made for the post of Lokayukta. This request was also found in a
letter dated 10.9.2009 addressed to the Government by the Governor
for sending a fresh proposal, he further argued.   
</p>
 


<p id="p_954">	It
was fervently urged that a complete departure was made by the
Governor by calling for the names twice directly from the Hon'ble the
Chief Justice. Not only this was done giving a go by to the earlier
conventions, but, the same was not  an authorized action as urged by
the Advocate General.  It is further urged that this was not an
appointment of a Presiding Officer of the Court nor of a Judicial
Office,therefore,  application of ratio laid down in case of Ashish
Handa, Advocate vs.  High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana and others
(supra) and that of <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_475">N. Kannadasan vs. Ajoy Khose  and others</a> 
(supra) cannot be made applicable in the instant case. While harping
on convention reliance is placed on the following judgments mentioned
hereinunder:-
</p> 


<p id="p_955">1)	In
the case of Supreme Court <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_476">Advocates-on-Record Association and
others vs. Union of India</a> reported in (1993) 4 SCC 441,
following paragraphs are reproduced:-
</p> 


<p id="p_956">"352. The
Constitution of India is an elaborate document consisting of 395
Articles and ten Schedules. Despite that there are Constitutional
provisions - operative in various fields - which are nowhere to be
found in the written text of the Constitution. For instance it is a
fundamental requirement of the Constitution that if the opposition
obtains the majority at the Polls, the Government must tender its
resignation forthwith. Fundamental as it is, this does not form part
of the written law of the Constitution. It is also a constitutional
requirement that the person who is appointed Prime Minister by the
President and who is the effective Head of the Government should have
the support of the House of People. The other Ministers who are
appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister, must
continuously have the confidence of the House of People, individually
and collectively. The powers of the President are exercised by him on
the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers which
may at the said powers are effectively exercised by the Council of
Ministers headed the Prime Minister. None of these and many other
essential rules of the Constitution are found in the Constitution of
India as framed by the Constituent Assembly. It was A.V. Dicey who
for the first time, in the year 1885, identified these unwritten
rules and called them "The Conventions of the Constitution".
What Dicey described under these terms are the rules of responsible
Government which regulate relations between the Crown, the Prime
Minister, the Cabinet and the two Houses of Parliament. These rules
developed in Great Britain by way of precedents during 19th Century
and were inherited by the British colonies as were granted
self-government and independence. This phenomenon is not limited to
Britain and is true of constitutions in general. Conventions are
found in all established constitutions and soon developed even in the
newest.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_957">353. Two sets of
principles, thus, make up the rules of constitutional law. One, set
of rules is contained in the written constitution of a country and
the other set is referred to as the "conventions of the
constitution". Conventions are a means of bringing about
constitutional development without formal changes in the law. K.C.
Wheare in his book "The Statute of Westminster and Dominion
Status" (Fourth Edition) defines the conventions as under:
</p> 


<p id="p_958">"The definition of
conventions may thus be amplified by saying that their purpose is to
define the use of constitutional discretion. To put this in slightly
different words, it may be said that conventions are non-legal rules
regulating the way in which legal rules shall be applied."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_959">354. The conventions grow
up, around and upon principles of the written constitutions.
Necessary conventional rules spring up to regulate the working of the
various parts of the Constitution, their relation to one an other and
to the subject. Sir W. Ivor Jennings. in his book Law and the
Constitution" (Fifth edition) refers to the constitutional
conventions in the following words:-
</p> 


<p id="p_960">"Thus within the
framework of the law there is room for the development of rules of
practice, rules which may be followed as consistently as the rules of
law, and which determine the procedure which the men concerned with
government must follow."
</p> 


<p id="p_961">These rules Mill referred
to as "the unwritten maxims of the constitution". Twenty
years later Dicey called them "the conventions of the
constitution", while Anson referred to them as "the custom
of the constitution". The short explanation of the
constitutional conventions is that they provide the flesh which
clothes the dry bones of the law; they make the legal constitution
work; they keep it in touch with the growth of ideas. A constitution
does not work itself; it has to be worked by men. It is an instrument
of national co-operation, and the spirit of co-operation is as
necessary as the instrument. The constitutional conventions are the
rules elaborated for effecting that co-operation. Also, the effects
of a constitution must change with the changing circumstances of
national life. New needs demand a new emphasis and a new orientation
even when the law remains fixed. Men have to work the old law in
order to satisfy the new needs. Constitutional conventions are the
rules which they elaborate."
</p> 


<p id="p_962">355. The conventions
enable a rigid legal framework - laws tend to be rigid-to be kept up
with changing social needs and changing political ideas. The
conventions enable the men, who govern, to work the machines. Dicey
in his book "Introduction to the Study of the Law of the
Constitution" refers to the conventions in the following words:
</p> 


<p id="p_963">"They are
multifarious, differing, as it might at first sight appear, from each
other not only in importance but in general character and scope. They
will be found however, on careful examination, to possess one common
quality or property; they are all, or at any rate most of them, rules
for determining the mode in which the discretionary powers of the
Crown (or of the Ministers as servants of the Crown) ought to be
exercised; and this characteristic will be found on examination to be
the trait common not only to all the rules already enumerated, but to
by far the greater part (though not quite to the whole) of the
conventions of the Constitution".
</p> 


<p id="p_964">The written constitutions
cannot provide for every eventuality. Constitutional institutions are
often created by the provisions which are generally worded. Such
provisions are interpreted with the help of conventions which grow by
the passage of time. Conventions are vital in so far as they fill-up
the gaps in the Constitution itself, help solve problems of
interpretation, and allow for the future development of the
constitutional frame work. Whatever the nature of the Constitution, a
great deal may be left unsaid in legal rules allowing enormous
discretion to the constitutional functionaries. Conventions regulate
the exercise of that discretion. A power which, juridically, is
conferred upon a person or body of persons may be transferred,
guided, or canalised by the operation of the conventional rule. K.C.
Wheare in his book 'Modern Constitution' (1967 edition) elaborates
such a rule as under:
</p> 


<p id="p_965">"What often happens
is that powers granted in a Constitution are indeed exercised but
that, while they are in law exercised by those to whom they are
granted, they are in practice exercised by some other person or body
of persons. Convention, in short, transfers powers granted in a
Constitution from one person to another."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_966">356. The primary role of
conventions is to regulate the exercise of discretion - presumably to
guard against the irresponsible abuse of powers. Colin R. Munro in
his book "Studies in Constitutional Law" (1987 edition) has
summed up the field of operation of the conventions in the following
words:
</p> 


<p id="p_967">"Some of the most
important conventions, therefore, are, as Dicey said, concerned with
'the discretionary powers of the Crown' and how they should be
exercised. But it is not only in connection with executive government
and legislature-executive relations that we find such rules and
practices in operation. They may be found in other spheres of
constitutional activity too; for example, in relations between the
Houses of Parliament and in the workings of each House, in the
legislative process, in judicial administration and judicial
behaviour, in the Civil Service, in local government, and in the
relations with other members of the Commonwealth."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_968">	Further
relevance is also emphasized in paragraphs 411 and 478 of this
judgment, however,so as not to additionally burden this text, only
reference is given.
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_969">76.	Per
contra, it has been argued by other side that whatever may be the
past practices or convention, in the wake of the judgments of the
Apex Court given case of <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_477">N. Kannadasan vs. Ajoy Khose  and
others</a>  (supra) and in the case of Ashish Handa,
Advocate vs. High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana and others (supra)
that would have no significane. Moreover, as held in case of <a href="/doc/921223/" id="a_478">Justice
K.P.Mohapatra vs. Sri Ram Chandra Nayak and others</a> (supra),
the law of the land would prevail and the convention would have no
relevance as there are explicit guidelines available from the Courts.
It was further contended that considering the importance of the post
and the nature of the functions to be exercised by the Lokayukta, it
is essential for the Chief Justice to recommend a name for such a
post.
</p> 


 

 


<p id="p_970">77.	Before
delving further into the subject,  it is required to be specified, at
this stage, that in both the case laws of Ashish
Handa
(supra)
and that of N.
</p><p id="p_971"><a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_479">Kannadasan vs. Ajoy Khose</a>  (supra),
the Apex Court was considering the appointment of judicial officer,
whereas this Court is confronted with the question of appointment of
Lokayukta. As   has been held hereinabove that the office of
Lokayukta is neither Court nor has the trappings of the Court and,
therefore, it could be said that ratio of  both these judgments, 
would not be made applicable for such an appointment mutatis
mutandis.  
</p>
 


	
 


<p id="p_972">	Reference
is also needed incidentally at this stage to the case of Ajit
Kumar etc. vs. State of Jharkhand and Ors. etc.(supra) where
ratio laid down in case of Ashish Handa(supra) was pressed into
service. High Court of Jharkhand dealt with the same thus:- 
</p>
 


<p id="p_973">"29.	In
the case of  <a href="/doc/1398587/" id="a_480">Ashish Handa vs. Chief Justice, Punjab and
Haryana High</a> Court(supra),
the appointment of the President of the Haryana
State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission was challenged on the
ground that it was not in accordance with <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_481">Section 16</a> of the Consumer
Protection Act,1986. <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_482">Section 16</a> of the Act provides that a sitting or
retired Judge shall be appointed by the State Government as
President. The proviso to the said section says that no appointment
under this clause shall be made except after consultation with the
Chief Justice of the High Court. The ratio decided by the Supreme
Court in this case, in my view does not apply in the facts of the
present case."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_974">	However,
one shall have to essentially keep in mind the pronouncement of the
Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/921223/" id="a_483">Justice K.P.Mohapatra vs. Sri Ram
Chandra Nayak and others</a> (supra), where the question of
appointment of Lokayukta was at large before the Apex Court. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_975">	This
decision clarifies and emphasizes the role of the Chief Justice in
making an appointment of the Lokayukta. For the appointment of
Lokayukta under the Orissa Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 1995, the Chief
Minister of Orissa sent three names to the Chief Justice of Orissa
High Court and the Leader of Opposition and  requested them to convey
their considered view on the subject. The Chief Justice had
recommended,  for the appointment name of  Justice Mohapatra whereas
the Leader of Opposition wished that the person to be appointed
should be a judicial personality with high integrity and professional
maturity  and, therefore, another name was suggested by him.  When
the notification had been issued appointing Justice Mohapatra as
Lokpal, this was challenged by way of public interest litigation. The
Court noted the fact that the Leader of Opposition had not stated
anything against the Lokpal designate and the Chief Justice had
during the consultation, named this person as the person for being
appointed as Lokpal. In this background, the findings of the Apex
Court would be relevant., which state thus:

<p id="p_976">"12. 	In context of
the aforesaid functions of the Lokpal and the required qualification
of a person who is to be appointed to hold such office, the word
'consultation' used in <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_484">Section 3</a> is required to be interpreted. As
provided under<a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_485"> S. 3</a>, a person is not qualified to be appointed as
Lokpal unless he is or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court or of a
High Court. In the context of the functions which are to be
discharged by the Lokpal, it is apparent that they are of utmost
importance in seeing that unpolluted administration of the State is
maintained and mal-administration as defined under<a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_486"> S. 2(h)</a> is exposed
so that appropriate action against such mal-administration and
administrator could be taken. The investigation which Lokpal is
required to carry out is that of quasi-judicial nature which would
envisage not only knowledge of law, but also of the nature and work
which is required to be discharged by an administrator.  In this
context, the word 'consultation' used in Section 3(1) Proviso (a)
would require that consultation with the Chief Justice of the High
Court of Orissa is must or sine qua non. For such appointment, Chief
Justice of the High Court would be the best person for proposing and
suggesting such person for being appointed as Lokpal. His opinion
would be totally independent and he would be in a position to find
out who is most or more suitable for the said office. In this
context, primacy is required to be given to the opinion of the Chief
Justice of the High Court.(emphasis
supplied). It is true that proviso (a) provides that Leader of
the Opposition, if there is any, is also required to be consulted.
Therefore, if there is no Leader of Opposition, consultation is not
required.  This would indicate nature of such consultation and which
is to apprise him of the proposed action but his opinion is not
binding to the Government. At the same time, his views or objections
are to be taken into consideration. If something is adverse against
the person proposed by the Government, he would be entitled to
express his views and point it out to the Government. This, however,
would not mean that he could suggest some other name and the
Government is required to consider it. It would, therefore, be open
to the Government to override the opinion given by the Leader of the
Opposition with regard to the appointment of a Lokpal who is
statutorily required to be a sitting or retired Judge of the Supreme
Court or of a High Court. Under <a href="/doc/1110656/" id="a_487">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act, there is no
question of initiation of proposal by the leader of the Opposition."
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_977">78.	It
 thus clearly states that for such appointment, the Chief Justice of
the High Court would be the best person for proposing and suggesting
such person for being appointed as Lokpal. It also further states
that  opinion  of the Chief Justice  since  would be totally
independent and he would be in a position to find out who is the most
suitable  for such post and considering not only the importance but
the nature of duties of Lokpal,  the primacy requires to be given to
the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court, in this context. 
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_978">79.	This
detail was necessitated on account of two aspects, firstly the
proposal in the case of Justice Mohapatra had emanated from the
office of the Chief Minister and the names of three judges were sent
for consideration to both the Chief Justice and the Leader of
Opposition. While holding that the Chief Justice is the best person
whose views need to be given primacy in the appointment of the
Lokayukta, the proposal in that case which had emanated from the
office of the Chief Minister was sustained. Secondly,  the Court also
needs to record the fact that in this judgment   the Court had in
terms said that the Chief Justice would be the best person for
proposing and suggesting such person for being appointed as Lokpal
and, therefore, it has explicitly though not eliminated  the 
possibility of proposal emanating from the office of the Chief
Minister, the indications are loud and clear as could be appreciated 
while considering the role of the Lokayukta under the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_979">80.	In
light of the discussion held hereinabove,  it can be said  that
though there have been conventions in the past, and as also discussed
by the Apex Court conventions have importance to regulate the
discretionary power and to fill in the gaps where powers are not
specifically worded. In this case conventionally, the proposals with
the names of the retired persons emanated from the office of the
Chief Minister and these proposals were considered  and were acted
upon for, appointment to this post of Lokayukta, the recommendation
and proposal by the Chief Justice for this post would be necessary in
wake of decision of the Supreme Court in Justice Mahapatra's case
(supra) as also the  some being need of an hour considering the
scheme of the Act,  importance of this post and its growing
requirement in the country.
</p> 


<p id="p_980">	It
is necessary  to make a mention here that twice the process was
initiated from the office of the Governor calling for one name
instead of the panel, while insisting to excise her personal
discretion in this appointment. Surprisingly, there was no objection
raised on either of the times. That issue at present, is not to be
gone into in light of anwer given to the 1st issue in this
judgment, but that shall be touched only while deciding whether H.E.
the Governor was empowered to issue the warrant on the basis of
expediency.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_981"> 4 th 
Issue : Consultation in appointment of Lokayukta  

 


 


 


</p><p id="p_982">81.	This
brings to the next vital question as to what is  consultation, nature
of consultation and its extent desirable in such appointment and
whether, in the instant case, consultation was in fact held and
whether the same had been over or not when the act of issuance of the
warrant was made on 25.8.2011.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_983">82.	At
this stage, firstly, it is essential to quote from the judgment of
<a href="/doc/921223/" id="a_488">Justice K.P.Mohapatra vs. Sri Ram Chandra Nayak and others</a>
(surpa), where the Apex Court relying upon the judgment of <a href="/doc/1653533/" id="a_489">The
Indian Administrative Service vs. Union of India</a> reported in
1993 Sup(1) SCC 730 discussed the issue of consultation in the
appointment of Lokayukta in Indian Administrative Service case
(supra), the Court was considering the phrase "after
consultation with the Governments of States concerned" and on
this issue discussed a number of decisions on the word
"consultation". The conclusion that had been arrived at in
that judgment has been reproduced, which reads as under:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_984">"26. The result of
the above discussion leads to the following conclusions :
</p> 


<p id="p_985">(1) Consultation is a
process which requires meeting of minds between the parties involved
in the process of consultation on the material facts and points
involved to evolve a correct or at least satisfactory solution. There
should be meeting of minds between the proposer and the persons to be
consulted on the subject of consultation. There must be definite
facts which constitute the foundation and source for final decision.
The object of the consultation is to render consultation meaningful
to serve the intended purpose. Prior consultation in that behalf is
mandatory.
</p> 


<p id="p_986">(2) When the offending
action affects fundamental rights or to effectuate built-in
insulation, as fair procedure, consultation is mandatory and
non-consultation renders the action ultra vires or invalid or void.
</p> 


<p id="p_987">(3) When the opinion or
advice binds the proposer, consultation is mandatory and its
infraction renders the action or order illegal.
</p> 


<p id="p_988">(4) When the opinion or
advice or view does not bind the person or authority, any action or
decision taken contrary to the advice is not illegal, nor becomes
void.
</p> 


<p id="p_989">(5) When the object of
the consultation is only to apprise of the proposed action and when
the opinion or advice is not binding on the authorities or person and
is not bound to be accepted, the prior consultation is only
directory. The authority proposing to take action should make known
the general scheme or outlines of the actions proposed to be taken be
put to notice of the authority or the persons to be consulted; have
the views or objections, take them into consideration, and
thereafter, the authority or person would be entitled or has/have
authority to pass appropriate orders or take decision thereon. In
such circumstances it amounts to an action 'after consultation'.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_990">	(6) No hard and fast
rule could be laid, no useful purpose would be 	served by
	formulating words or definitions nor would it be 	appropriate to lay
down the 	manner in which consultation 	must take place. It is for
the Court to determine in 	each case in 	the light of its facts and
circumstances whether the action is 'after 	consultation'; 'was in
fact consulted' or was it a 'sufficient 	consultation'."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_991">83.	The
Apex Court in the case of Supreme Court <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_490">Advocates-on-Record vs.
Union of India</a> reported in AIR 1994 SC 268, of course was
considering the consultation for the appointment of judge in the High
Court where the meaning and manner of consultation, nature of
consultation etc. have been deeply gone into by Hon'ble Mr. Justice
Ratnavel Pandian while giving concurrent view with the majority.
Relevant paragraphs of the judgment are as under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_992">"114.	It is
worthwhile to recall the speech of Elimira in 1907 as a prelude for
the discussion to be made in the ensuing part of this judgment. He
stated, "We are under the Constitution, but the Constitution is
what the Judges say it is, and the judiciary is the safe- of our
liberty and of our property under the Constitution."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_993">115. Marshal, CJ with
reference to judicial activism in interpreting has observed thus:
</p> 


<p id="p_994">"We must never
forget that it is a constitution which we are expounding, a
constitution intended to endure for ages, and consequently to be
adapted to the various crises of human affairs. Nor did they image
that it was to be so strictly interpreted that amendments and radical
revisions would be constantly required to keep Government functioning
smoothly."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_995">116. Keeping the above
view, let us examine the relevant constitutional provisions in their
true spirit and without stretching them too far.
</p> 


<p id="p_996">117. Clauses (1) and (2)
with its first proviso of <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_491">Article 124</a> reads thus:
</p> 


<p id="p_997">"124. Establishment
and constitution of Supreme Court- (1) There shall be a Supreme Court
of India consisting of a Chief Justice of India and, until Parliament
by law prescribes a larger number, of not more than seven* other
Judges.
</p> 


<p id="p_998">* Now "twenty-five"
</p><p id="p_999">vide Act 22 of 1966.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1000">(2) Every Judge of the
Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under
his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the
Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the State as the President
may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he
attains the age of sixty-five years :
</p> 


<p id="p_1001">Provided that in the case
of appointment of' A Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief
Justice of India shall always be consulted."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1002">118. <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_492">Article 217(l) '</a>With
regard to the appointment of Judges to the High Courts reads thus:
</p> 


<p id="p_1003">"Appointment and
conditions of the office of a Judge of a High Court-(I) Every Judge
of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under
his hand and sea] after consultation with the Chief Justice of India,
the Governor of the State, and, in the case of appointment of a Judge
other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court,
and Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High
Court, and ..........."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1004">119. Under the above
provisions, it is the President who is vested with the authority of
appointment by warrant and under his hand and seal "after
consultation" with specified constitutional functionaries. The
consultees whom the President may in his discretion consult in case
of appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court are.,
 


(1) Such of the Judges of
the Supreme Court and
 


(2) Such of the Judges of
the High Courts in the States
 


as the President may deem
necessary for this purpose. But the proviso to clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_493">Article
124</a> makes it obligatory on the part of the President to consult the
Chief Justice of India in case of an appointment of a Judge other
than the Chief Justice. Thus, <a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_494">Article 124(2)</a> envisages two kinds of
consultation, one being discretionary on the part of the President
and the other being mandatory, In case of appointment of a Judge of
the High court other than the Chief Justice of the constitutional
functionaries are,
 


(1) Chief Justice of
India
 


(2) The Governor of the
State
 


(3) Chief Justice of the
High Court concerned.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1005">120. It is clear that
under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_495">Article 217(l</a>), the process of 'consultation' by the President
is mandatory and this clause does not speak of any discretionary
'consultation' with any other authority as in the case of appointment
of a Judge of the Supreme Court as envisaged in clause (2) of Article
</p><p id="p_1006">124.  The word ,consultation' is powerful and eloquent with
meaning, loaded with undefined intonation and it answers all the
questions and all the various tests including the test of primacy to
the opinion of the CJI. This test poses many, tough questions,
one of them being, what is the meaning of the expression
consultation' in the context in which it is used under the
Constitution. As in the case of appointment of a Judge of the Supreme
Court and the High Court, there are some more constitutional
provisions in which the expression 'consultation' is used. Those
provisions are:
</p> 


<p id="p_1007">121. Clause (5) of
<a href="/doc/1422498/" id="a_496">Article 148</a> states that subject to the provisions of this
Constitution and of any law made by Parliament, the conditions of
service of persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts
Department and the administrative powers of the Comptroller and
Auditor-General shall be such as may be prescribed by rules made by
the President after consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor
General.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1008">122. In clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/819787/" id="a_497">Article 222</a>, it is stated that the President may, after consultation
with the Chief Justice of India, transfer a Judge from one High Court
to any other High Court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1009">123. Clause (3) of
<a href="/doc/1723820/" id="a_498">Article 320</a> states that the Union Public Service Commission or the
State Public Service Commission, as the case may be, shall be
consulted on matters enumerated under sub-clauses (a) to (e) of that
clause.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1010">124. Clause (9) of
<a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_499">Article 338</a> reads, "The Union and every State Government shall
consult the Commission on all major policy matters affecting
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1011">125. The consultation in
all the above Articles is mandatory in character. Vide Manbodhan Lal
Srivastava v. State of U. P.. 1958 SCR 533 -. (AIR 1957 SC 912).
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1012">126. However, the
question of consultation by the President as in the case of
appointment of a Judge is not constitutionally warranted in respect
of the appointments of some other constitutional appointees by the
President, namely, (1) the Chairman and Members of Finance Commission
under <a href="/doc/559924/" id="a_500">Art. 280(l); (2)</a> the Chairman and Members of Public Service
Commission in the case of Union Commission or a Joint Commission
under <a href="/doc/317644/" id="a_501">Article 316(l); (3)</a> the Chief Election Commissioner and other
Election Commissioners under <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_502">Article 324(2);</a> and <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_503">(4)</a> the Chairman and
other members of the Commission representing the different languages
specified in the Eighth Schedule under <a href="/doc/1877304/" id="a_504">Article 344(l); (5)</a> the
Special Officer for linguistic minorities under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_505">Article 350-B.</a>
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1013">127. The word
'consultation' is a noun whilst the word 'consult' is a verb and
'consultative' is 'an adjective. The meaning of the expression
'consultation' is given in Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as:
</p> 


<p id="p_1014">"Consultation: 1.
</p><p id="p_1015">The action of consulting or taking counsel together; deliberation,
conference; 2. a conference in which the parties, e.g. lawyers or
medical practitioners consult and deliberate. 3. The action of
consulting ........
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1016">128. In Webster's
Encyclopaedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, the
meaning of consultation is given thus:
</p> 


<p id="p_1017">"Consultation: 1.
</p><p id="p_1018">The act of consulting; conference. 2. a meeting for deliberation,
discussion, or decision ......"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1019">129. Black's Law
Dictionary defines the expression as under:
</p> 


<p id="p_1020">"Consultation: Act
of consulting or conferring; e.g. patient with doctor; client with
lawyer. Deliberation of persons on some subject. A conference between
the counsel engaged in a case, to discuss its questions or arrange
the method of conduct in it." 
</p>
 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_1021">84.	The
entire discussion, of course, was in the light of the requirement of
consultation envisaged under the Constitution while appointing the
Judge of the High Court. What culls out from the definitions taken
from various dictionaries and the authorities laid down time and
again by the Apex Court on the subject is that the object of
consultation is to render it meaningful for the purpose of serving
intended object when the opinion finds the proposer it is mandatory
to consult. In substance it is the process to arrive at satisfactory
solution. There must be full and effective consultation and the same
has to be purposeful and meaningful. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1022">85.	Undoubtedly,
here is not the question of consultation under the Constitutional
requirements nor is the consultation for the purpose of appointing
Judges or Presiding Officers for the institute which is either Court
or trappings of the Court. However, as the person to be appointed on
this post requires to possess qualities like integrity and
credentials of impeccable nature and utmost commitment and sincerity
towards the cause, consultation process as contemplated under the
statute is with the Chief Justice of the State and Leader of
Opposition. Considering the very nature of appointment and importance
attached to this post, consultation cannot be merely directory in
nature obviously nor can it be a mere ordeal. It would entail
proposal, placing of fullest possible details, deliberations,
discussions, consideration and decision as a culmination.
</p> 


<p id="p_1023">86.	In
light of the discussion above, endeavour hereinafter would be as to
whether the 'consultation' in the instant case was full and effective
and whether it was meaningful as otherwise envisaged in the case
laws. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1024">	It
was contended by learned Advocate General that the 'consultation'
process was not yet over. It is not the process of thrusting any
person without meaningful deliberation and he also had elaborated the
factual details to support his contention for which reliance is also
placed on the exchange of communication to substantiate this point.
He also forcefully urged that the process cannot be snapped
unilaterally when the Government is in fact contemplated as a
proposer under the statute.
</p> 


 

 


<p id="p_1025">87.	On
the other side, learned advocate Mr. Mehta and learned advocate Mr.
Patel urged that appointment was after the 'consultation' and the
same was meaningful  as was otherwise required before being
concluded.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1026">88.	As
noted, the consultation  has a potency of active consideration
culminating into a fruitful result. If there is a consultation over
more than one names, there would arise a necessity to compare and
choose on evaluation the most suitable person for the purpose of
appointment. In case of one name, effective and purposeful
consultation though may not always result into concurrence, but, the
same to be effective, amongst all the three dignitaries who are part
of this process of  consultation, before appointment to the post of
Lokayukta is must. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1027">	Regard
should be to the fact that recommendation  in question here had been
made by the  Chief Justice and this was in wake of unwillingness
expressed by Mr. Justice S.D. Dave due to his personal reasons. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1028">	In
the aforementioned premise, when the name of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta
was proposed on 7.6.2011 by the Chief Justice, as rightly pointed by
the learned Advocate General, that process of consultation cannot be
said to have dated back to the year 2006 as this recommendation had
been made only in the month of June, 2011 and every time, a new name
is recommended, the process of consultation necessarily shall have to
begin afresh. This is also not to indicate that the length of
consultation would always have bearing while deciding this issue,
nevertheless as discussed earlier, the regard shall have to be of
purposeful  consultation.
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_1029">89.	
Thus, when the name of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta was recommended by the
Hon'ble the Chief Justice,  pursuant to this recommendation dated
7.6.2011, reservation against the name was placed by the Chief
Minister vide his communication dated 16.6.2011 addressed to the
Chief Justice. There were mainly two reservations. Firstly, his
advanced age of 75 years, on comparing the nature of duties and
responsibilities attached to the post of Lokayukta and secondly, his
association with some NGOs and social activist groups and due to this
association, the service rendered by him  as a panelist for them. The
request vide this communication dated 16.6.2011 is to have a relook
at the name proposed vide letter dated 7.6.2011. Reiteration again,
of course, is to the name of Mr. Justice J.R. Vora in this
communication as well. 
</p><p id="p_1030">	After about 6 weeks on 2.8.2011, the reply
of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice is to this communication of
16.6.2011, where the opinion with regard to Mr. Justice R.A.Mehta had
been given in unequivocal terms, wherein it was mentioned that there
was no such activity which would make him ineligible for the
appointment to the post of Lokayukta and he is a man of high repute
and integrity, which he maintained while in service and, thereafter
also. In a concluding paragraph, it was urged to the Chief Minister
in this communication to take up the matter with the Council of
Ministers and then, to forward the name of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta to
Her Excellency for his appointment as Lokayukta of the State of
Gujarat. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1031">	Communication
of the Chief Minister thereafter on 18.8.2011, again raised concerns
and reservations against this name elaborately, placing the details
in the communication as well as substantiating the said details with
various documents on the basis of which it was urged that though
there are no personal reservations of the writer (of the Chief
Minister) against the name but considering pre-conceived opinion of
Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta, he would not be the most suitable choice and
therefore, on that count as well as again referring to his advanced
age it was urged to recommend the name of the Judge who may have
presently retired from the service.  A letter addressed to the
Governor by the chief Minister on 18th August, 2011 itself
also states that due to certain reasons, name lastly recommended was
not acceptable to the State Government.  
</p>
 


<p id="p_1032">	What
emerges thus is that the recommendation made for the said post by the
Chief Justice on 7.6.2011 was not found acceptable by the State
Government.   Therefore,  the  letter dated 16th June,
2011    addressed to the Chief Justice  placing therein reservations
against the name. Reply was given to this by the Chief Justice on
2.8.2011 clarifying the facts concerning reservations.  It can be
gathered from record further that reservations ventilated in the
earlier communication dated 16.6.2011, were again reiterated, with
further materials attempting to substantiate them. Considering the
nature of consultation, even if reservation had no valid basis,
except reflection of different perception, it would not be possible
to conclude that in the reply of 2.8.2011 final words were spoken.
Second communication from the Government  was a clear indication that
the reservations against the name was intense and,this was a request
to review the decision placing additional available materials before
the Chief Justice for his consideration. It would not be feasible to
say that there was no further scope left for any response to the said
urge, more particularly, when this was made to the Chief Justice of
the High Court  who had proposed the name.  Again, if an urge was
made to suggest an alternative, the same cannot be regarded as an end
of process on the name recommended by Chief Justice. It was clear to
one and all concerned importance of view of the Chief Justice is in
this process, however, for meaningful deliberation, there may not be
preclusion to request such a review, nor would this non acceptance of
the State in the letter conclude statement in the process when
otherwise request to review was not yet attended to finally.     
</p>
 


<p id="p_1033"> 	One
 also needs to keep in mind that on earlier occasion on 24.2.2010,
when the recommendation was made of four names by the Chief Justice
at the behest of Government, one of the names recommended was of Mr.
Justice J.R. Vora, which was finalized by the Council of Ministers on
completion of consultation process and pursuant to that,  his name
had been proposed to the Governor for appointment. In this
background, when twice thereafter,  there was recommendation of the
names at the instance of H.E. the Governor, who assumed the role of
an independent appointing authority and  name of Mr. Justice J.R.
Vora was recalled . On his being appointed at the Gujarat State
Judicial Academy and therefore, if the request gets reiterated in
this background with documents and without any further reply from the
Chief Justice. Conclusion of process could not be presumed.
</p> 


<p id="p_1034">	There
is no express suggestion nor any indication of the closure of the
consultation on record, in the pleadings or otherwise in
communication and, therefore, in the light of the discussion made, on
the details which cull out from these communications, and having
regard to the requirement of consultation as elaborated hereinbefore,
I conclude that the consultation was not yet over and, therefore, the
question corollary to the earlier point as to whether there was a
stalemate in the process of consultation shall have to be answered in
negation. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1035">	At
the cost of reiteration, it needs to be mentioned that in such a
selection, the primacy  is to the opinion of the Chief Justice of the
State but, that would not take away the statutory requirement of the
consultation as understood and laid down by the Apex Court. And, even
in the appointment of Judges where the final say is of the judiciary
process, does not rule out the requirement of purposeful and full
consultation, but in fact, insists on such meaningful process. 
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_1036">5th
Point in issue: Expediency in selection -  'Doctrine of Necessity'
 


</p><p id="p_1037">90.	The
last and vital question that necessitates redressal is whether the
Doctrine of Necessity was to be invoked for the appointment of
Lokayukta and whether there existed  such weighty reasons which would
allow and permit discretion of the Governor in issuing the impugned
warrant. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1038">	One
is conscious of the fact that the State does not  have Lokayukta from
the year 2003. The object and reasons for enacting the statute are
also eloquent and illuminating. From time immemorial  corruption in a
public life has perturbed the society  and is a matter of grave
concern for all concerned. The people of this nation have given to
themselves the Constitution with democratic and republican characters
  so that they can grow holistically  live with dignity and attain
social, economic and political justice. It is a reality that the
common man suffers inexplicably, he endures patiently and is
aggrieved boundlessly by many inactions and malaises. In  a
democratic set-up people's concerns and problems against elected
representative and administration required redressal.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1039">91.	Relevant
at this stage is to be alive to the fact that the Administrative
Reforms Commission was constituted in the year 1966 to redress this
perpetual grievance of citizens where issue of corruption in public
life  due to crisis of integrity engaged  intense attention. As a
panacea to this concern, the statute ( The Gujarat Lokayukta Act) has
seen the light of the day. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1040">91.1	The
terms of reference in the notification dated 5.1.1966 issued by the
President of India states that "the Commission will give
consideration to the need for ensuring highest standard of efficiency
and integrity in the public services and for making public
administration a fit instrument for carrying out the social and
economic policies of the Government and achieving social and economic
goals of development as also one which is responsive to the people"
with a specific emphasis on the Problems of Redressal of the
Citizens Grievances. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1041">91.2	Interim
report of this Commission recommended setting up of  institution of
Lokayukta and Lokpal. This report was made by late  Shri Morarjibhai
Desai  and other five committee members, namely, Shri K.
Hanumanthaiya, M.P and Shri Debabrata Mookerjee, Shri Harish Chandra
Mathur, Shri H.V. Kamath and Shri V. Shankar. It says  "
If in the prosperity of the people, lies the strength of
the Government, it is in their contentment that lie the security and
stability of the democracy."
</p> 


<p id="p_1042">91.3	The
Commission took note of " the oft-expressed public outcry
against the prevalence of corruption, the existence of wide-spread
inefficiency the unresponsiveness of administration to popular needs"
and therefore was of the opinion that an institution for  redressal
of grievance must be provided within the democratic system of
Government. "It has to be an institution  in which the
average citizen will have faith and confidence and through which, he
will be able to secure quick and inexpensive justice."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1043">91.4	It
also had drawn its conviction from the fact that the then Chief
Justice of India, Shri P.B.Gajendragadkar in his address to the
Indian Institute of Public Administration supported the establishment
of an institution of this type "on the ground that the
confidence of the public is the main asset to a public administration
and that the establishment of such an institution would create a
sense of confidence in the people that their grievances would be
looked into." 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1044">91.5	Reference
is made of the Late Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru who while
speaking to the All India Congress Committee said that the system of
Ombudsman fascinated him, "for the Ombudsman had overall
authority to deal with charges even against the Prime Minister and
commanded respect and confidence of all. He felt, however, that in a
big country like India, the introduction of such a system was beset
with difficulties."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1045">91.6
	 Reference is also made of say of  Shri M.C. Setalvad, India's first
Attorney-General who referred to the "need for the expeditious
redress of grievances of the people and for rooting out corruption,
if democracy were to survive in India and in this connection
mentioned the institution of the Ombudsman as the one which would go
a long way in providing quick justice. However, he  referred
to the need for care in the selection of the person occupying the
position of Ombudsman so that he should be outside Government's
influence and should also command the respect of the general public"
(emphasis is mine)
 


 


 


91.7	This
report reflects the history of the oldest institution of Ombudsman
that the Chancellor of Justice was established in 1713 in Sweden for
ensuring efficient administration. This report, highlights importance
of this institution to state that the "Ombudsman is
virtually a Parliamentary institution, though he is not and cannot be
a member of Parliament. He is independent of the judiciary,
the executive and the Legislature. His position is analogous to that
of the highest or high judicial functionaries in the country. He is
left comparatively free to choose his own methods and agencies of
investigation."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1046">91.8	The
Committee was convinced of need of such an institution for the
country " to supplement to the Parliamentary control,
independent of any political application, outside the normal
administrative hierarchy, and free from formalism, publicity and
delays associated with the government machinery".
</p> 


<p id="p_1047">91.9	Vastness
of the country and its population also need not deter the Commission
to recommend such an institution. It therefore observed that "
Our administrative system already provides for the functioning of
the judiciary and administrative tribunals and for a hierarchy of
appeals against the orders of subordinate authorities to superior
authorities. We do not intend the system we envisage should clash
with these institutions and wish, therefore, to provide for the
functioning of that institution only in respect of matters for which
such remedies are not available or where, in some cases, it might not
be reasonable to expect a citizen to take recourse to legal
proceedings. This would substantially reduce the number of complaints
eligible for investigation and thus enable the institution to devote
its attention and energies only to those cases in which prima facie
the need for redressing an act of injustice or mal-administration
exits."
</p> 


<p id="p_1048">91.10	
On the basis of the study of the institution of Ombudsman and its
relevance in this country, the Committee reported thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_1049">"We strongly feel
that this malaise in administration mainly arises more from a sense
of frustration or lack of appreciation of good work done and from an
exaggerated image of corruption, inefficiency and lack of integrity
current in the public mind than from actual investigation into
complaints submitted by citizens. We have every reason to believe
that the working of such an institution  will in the long run rectify
and thus restore the correct image of the administration, create
public confidence in its integrity, and there promote, rather than
impede, the progress of our developmental activities. Apart from
this, the informal character of inquiries will save the public
servant from exposure to public gaze during the course of an enquiry,
which often has the effect of condemning him in the public eye before
he is ultimately found guilty or innocent, as the case may be. The
institution will thus be a protection for, and a source of strength
rather than a discouragement to, an honest official, whose
susceptibilities alone are germane in this context."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1050">91.11	Report of this
committee, culminated in recommending two special institutions for
the redressal of the citizens' grievances. In words of this Committee
"There should be
one authority dealing with complaints against the administrative acts
of Ministers or Secretaries to Government at the Centre and in the
States. There should be another authority in each State and at the
Centre for dealing with complaints against the administrative acts of
Ministers  or Secretaries to Government at the Centre and in the
States. There should be another authority in each State and at the
Centre  for dealing with complaints against the administrative acts
of other officials. All these authorities should be independent of
the executive as well as the Legislature and the judiciary." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1051">91.12	They
are designated authority dealing with the complaints against the
Ministers and Secretaries to the Government as "Lokpal"
and the authorities at the Centre and the State empowered to deal
with complaints against other officials may be designated as
"Lokayukta". 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1052">91.13	The
main features of Lokpal and Lokayukta were specified in the report as
under:-
</p> 


<p id="p_1053">"25.	The following
would be the main features of the institutions of  Lokpal and
Lokayukta :-
</p> 


<p id="p_1054">	(a)	They should be
demonstrably independent and impartial.
</p> 


<p id="p_1055">	(b)	Their investigations
and proceedings should be conducted in private and should be informal
in character.
</p> 


<p id="p_1056">	(c)	Their appointment
should, as far as possible, be non-political.
</p> 


<p id="p_1057">	(d)	Their status should
compare with the highest judicial functionaries in the country.
</p> 


<p id="p_1058">	(e)	They should deal
with matters in the discretionary field involving acts of injustice,
corruption or favouritism.
</p> 


<p id="p_1059">	(f)	Their proceedings
should not be subject to judicial interference and they should have
the maximum latitude and powers in obtaining information relevant to
their duties.
</p> 


<p id="p_1060">	(g)	They should not look
forward to any benefit or pecuniary advantage from the executive
Government"
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1061">91.14	For
the appointment of Lokpal suggestion is made that the Lokpal should
be appointed by President on the advice of the Prime Minister, which
would be tendered by him after consultation with the Chief Justice of
India  and the Leader of Opposition. His tenure, jurisdiction and
procedure for dealing with the complaints, powers for carrying out
functions, all had been detailed in the said report. In concluded
with the following note:-
</p> 


<p id="p_1062">"38.	We should like
to emphasise the fact that we attach the highest importance to the
implementation, at an early date, of the recommendations contained in
this our Interim Report. That we are not alone in recognizing the
urgency of such a measure is clear from the British example we have
quoted above. We have no doubt that the working of the institution of
Lokpal and Lokayukta that we have suggested for India will be watched
with keen expectation and interest by other countries.  We hope that
this aspect would also be fully borne in mind by Government in
considering the urgency and importance of our recommendation. Though
its timing is very close to the next Election, we need hardly assure
the Government that this has had nothing to do with the necessity of
making this interim report. We have felt the need of such
recommendation on merits alone and are convinced that we are making
it not a day too soon."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_1063"> The
Gujarat Lokayukta Act
 


</p><p id="p_1064">92.	It
is pertinent that the recommendations made in the interim report of
Administrative Reform  Commission  have been made the basis for
establishing this institution in various parts of the Nation. 
Gujarat Lokapal and Lokayukta Bill, 1975, in its Statement of objects
and reasons  makes this report its base:-
</p> 


<p id="p_1065">" In its interim
report on "The Problems and Redress of Citizens' Grievances "
submitted in 1966,  the Administrative Reforms Commission
recommended, interalia the setting up of an institution of Lokpal to
inquire into the complaints of corruption in administration. To give
effect to this recommendation of the Administrative Reforms
Commission, the State Government had published the Gujarat Lokpal
Bill, 1975 (Guj.Bill 7 of 1975). That Bill was referred to the
Government of India for administrative approval. The Government of
India had made certain suggestions in respect of that Bill. The said
Bill, however, lapsed on account of the dissolution of the Gujarat
Legislative Assembly. The present Bill is on the same lines as the
earlier one and some of the suggestions made by the Government of
India have been incorporated therein. The main object of this Bill is
to provide for appointment of Lokayukta to inquire into the
complaints in respect of actions taken by all public functionaries
viz."
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_1066">93.	People
of this country have given to themselves the Constitution and all the
institutions established under the Constitution or by virtue of the
statutes flowing from this fountainhead, are meant to subserve their
needs and aspirations. Essential attributes of our Democracy are
embodied in the preamble aiming at liberty, equality, justice,
dignity, fraternity and unity .  Transparency  and efficiency of
administration and responsiveness of elected representative members
are some of those fundamental urges interwoven with concept of
justice  which get echoed in the provision of this statute. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1067">94.	In
this background, the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986 and  particularly
some of the provisions of the Act already referred to earlier in this
decision when  closely examined,  they unfailingly reveal  that the
Act is a vital enactment for creating confidence of people by
redressing their cause  to be undertaken by the Lokayukta on
investigating allegations against public functionaries as also for
safeguarding the dignity and prestige of public functionaries against
false and frivolous allegations. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1068">94.1	As
the person to be appointed on the said post has to be a sitting Judge
of the High Court or a retired Judge of the High Court having no
affiliation with any political parties nor having any interest
anywhere, a report prepared by him wold have a vital bearing. He has
tenure of five years unless removed on inquiry by the Chief Justice.
Again,  this report is required to be placed before the Council of
Ministers. For the purpose of investigation, he has wide powers and
for not entertaining frivolous complaints, the powers are also given
to punish such persons also.   He also enjoys immunity from removal
as indicated  and his salary is that of the Chief Justice of the
State.  All these aspects would assume relevance, particularly while 
considering  filling of vacancy in time and filling the same in
consonance with the object of the Act. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1069">95.	No
Court can endorse to the non-appointment or delayed appointment of
Lokayukta in the State which is otherwise booming with economic
growth. It is  peoples' Court. It is a hope of the common man, who
could ventilate his grievances against the corruption of public
functionaries. It would avail him an opportunity to be part of the
cleansing spree in the public domain without being bogged down by the
alien language, inconvenient procedurality and unaffordable cost in
such an endeavour.  The fact is also recognized while dealing with
delay    that with the lapse of time, memory of people may fade and
issues which are otherwise very crucial for people may take a back
seat and fervor over vital issues may die down, thereby, tilting the
balance in favour of those erring whose conduct and actions are to be
investigated by the Lokayukta, particularly considering  <a href="/doc/406500/" id="a_506">Section 8(4)</a>
of the said Act, which excludes investigation of complaints made
after the expiry of 5 years from the date of occurrence.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1070">96.	Considering
thus, the nature of the post as also keeping in mind avowed  objects
of the Act and also aspirations of the people, plea of doctrine of
necessity shall have to be examined and while so doing, it is
required to be addressed in light of the first point in issue which
is answered in affirmation and where it is held  in terms that the
Governor does not have power to act independently in appointing the
Lokayukta under Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act when read with
Articles 163 and 166 of the Constitution of India unless the areas
carved out by the Constitution or by the judgments of the Apex Court
so permit her and  unless the grounds put-forth fall under any of
these exceptions, the issuance of warrant cannot be sustained.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1071">97.	Undisputedly,
the post remained continuously vacant for the period of 8 years as
could also be made out from the materials placed before this Court.
From the year 2003 to 2006, there does not appear to be any move from
the Government for the appointment of Lokayukta. As also indicated by
my brother Judge, for this non-action for all the three years, there
is no material made available to the Court. This none action is of
course  not conforming to the object of the Act. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1072">98.	The
chronological events which have been mentioned at the outset, are
indicative that for the period between 7.8.2006 to 10.9.2009, no
appointment was made though the name of Mr.Justice K.R.Vyas was
considered, consulted and consensus was reached on that name. It
needs to be regarded here that the proposal had emanated from the
office of the Chief Minister in August, 2006 and the same was cleared
at the end of the Chief Justice on 7.8.2006. Thereafter,  the request
of appointment  by Government continued to lie in the office of the
Governor. On 29.12.2009 a letter was addressed to the Registrar
General by the Principal Secretary to the Governor making a request
for sending a panel for consideration as the name of Mr.Justice K.R.
Vyas was dropped on account of his appointment as the Chairman of the
State Human Rights Commissions of Maharashtra.
</p> 


<p id="p_1073">99.	
In the second period between 8.2.2010 to 5.5.2010, the proposal was
sent of four names on 24.2.2010 and out of these four names of
retired Judges of the High Court, Mr. Justice B.C. Patel was already
with the National Human Rights Commission and Mr. Justice
R.P.Dholakia was already working as President,  Gujarat  State
Consumer  Disputes Redressal  Commission and on account of the
advanced age of Mr. Justice P.M. Chauhan ( 82 years) his name was not
considered for the post. Thus, ouf of four names proposed by the  
Chief Justice , for all practical purpose only one name had remained
for consideration and as mentioned earlier in the letter chronology
was not indicative of any preference of the Chief Justice. Although
the request was made after the consultation was over for appointing
Mr. Justice J.R. Vora,  the Governor  instead chose to call for the
opinion of the Attorney General and also requested for the
comparative opinion of the Chief Justice and on getting the same
requested directly to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice to send one name
instead of panel.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1074">100.	Such
proposal was received on 31.12.2010 when name of Mr. Justice S.D.
Dave was recommended. After his withdrawal from the said
consideration on 1.5.2011, fresh name was once again recommended on
7.6.2011. This dissection  is not for any other purpose but to
scrutinize and  consider whether the period of delay could be made a
ground for circumventing the well laid down procedure and the mandate
of the Constitution.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1075">101.	It
needs to be noted and reiterated that though twice after 2006, the
process had been completed, no appointment was made on one or the
other grounds and instead twice Governor initiated independently
steps for appointment and none of them had either constitutional
backing or any statutory force and therefore, the authority which
otherwise preferred to choose its own pace in appointing the
Lokayukta seems to use that very aspect of delay while changing the
mode to fast track.  This selective expediency is required to be
spelt out, particularly, when the same has been linked with the
doctrine of necessity. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1076">102.	Again,
if the authority was with the  the Governor to appoint independently
and also have consultation with the Chief Justice and the Leader of
Opposition, as  has been indicated in the letter dated 3.5.2010, no
delay in that case could be attributed to the Council of Ministers
for non-appointment nor could it be said that the Council of
Ministers could not be Judges in their own cause nor was there any
need for any communication with the Government in this connection. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1077">	However,
as discussed hereinbefore, that is not the interpretation
permissible. Council of Ministers does  have a role in such an
appointment and that is the reason why while mentioning the period
between 2003 to 2005, specific mention is made that there was
absolutely no move nor any action emerging for the appointment on
such a vital post. Again, as indicated in the judgment of the Apex
Court, if Council of Ministers had  no role to play,  that parameter
would equally apply to the Leader of Opposition, who is also a public
functionary.	 Either going by convention or the long drawn
consultative process in the post, it nowhere is indicative of any
doubt in the minds of any of dignitaries that this appointment
required consultation with the Council of Ministers and in the
penultimate stage, Governor was to issue warrant as per advise and an
aid of Council of Ministers and legislature  also has contemplated
that.     
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1078">103.	This
issue of delayed appointment  also requires to take into account
other two grounds,  emphasized for issuance of warrant without the
advice of Council of Ministers, namely, promulgation of ordinance and
appointment made under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_507">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>.
</p> 

<p id="p_1079"> Recommendation
of Promulgation of Ordinance :
</p> 


<p id="p_1080">104.	Emphasis
during submissions was that attempt was made by the Government in the
preceding week of issuance of warrant to change the very nature of
the Act as also adding the number of persons in the team of Lokayukta
and also changing the constitutional committee for appointing
Lokayukta, particularly, when the process of consultation was at a
very active stage which necessitated this appointment.   Mention  is
needed here that the addition to the list of the public functionaries
in <a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_508">Section 2</a> (7) after sub-clause(d) had been made on 30.3.2011 and
this was done in  wake of requirement of 13th  Finance
Commission.
</p> 


<p id="p_1081">	The
note from   H.E. the Governor dated 27.5.2011 is indicative that more
number of Lokayuktas were required to be appointed  considering the
total number of village panchayats, Taluka Panchayats, District
Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipal Corporations in the State 
as also in the wake of addition to the list of elected
representatives of the Local Bodies under the said Act.  Therefore,
in the ordinance  sent for the promulgation on 16.8.2011,  addition
was proposed  where the Lokayukta is made  Chairperson with other
members to be  appointed under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_509">Section 3</a> of the Act. This was added
pursuant to the note of the Governor  that one Lokayukta may not cope
up with the complaints with the addition of more public functionaries
and, therefore, this cannot be surely  indicative of any curtailment
of the power of one person, who was to be appointed as Lokayukta.
However,   the real objection is against the amendment  proposed in 
Section 3 of Lokayukta Act where appointment was required to be made
after obtaining the recommendation of a Committee.
</p> 


	 
<p id="p_1082">As contended by the learned Advocate General  this amendment  was on
the lines of Lokpal Bill, which was to be placed before the
Parliament where also similar such  changes in the formation of
committee have been contemplated. A note of objection of the Governor
is indicative that  the Lokpal Bill introduced in the Parliament  is 
at a discussion stage, the format of  Selection Committee is likely 
to undergo the change and, therefore, the changes proposed in Lok Pal
bill at the Center  should not weigh with the State Government and it
should wait till the proposed Bill is passed and endorsed by the
President of India. Of course, in the newly suggested Committee, as
per the amendment of <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_510">Section 3</a>, there is no role given  to the Chief
Justice directly in the appointment,  but  there is  an addition of
one Judge of the High Court whose name the Chief Justice would
suggest since the Recommendatory Committee is made of 5 members. This
change was contemplated when there was already an active
consideration of the name of Mr. Justice R.A. Mehta and  after the
request  was made to  the Chief Justice by the Chief Minister as head
of the Council of the Ministers  to  review his decision on
18.8.2011.  
</p>
 


	
<p id="p_1083">Thus, the  amendment suggested were more or less  on the pattern of
the Lokpal Bill at the center  which raised grave concern for the
Governor.  In my  opinion, none of the changes proposed in the Act
would attract  Doctrine of Necessity as addition of member was in
compliance with the note of the Governor and formation of Committee
was on the pattern of Lokpal Bill proposed at the center.  If further
delay in appointment of Lokayukta was the concern,  there is no time
limit which would bind the Governor for promulgating the ordinance.
Although sending of ordinance back  within two days  to the Governor
is highlighted, keeping in view the fact that there is no
constitutional mandate requiring the Governor to promulgate such an
ordinance within any time frame and being aware of that it was also
sent back to the Government giving reason of no urgency,  the ground
made out for issuance of the warrant on account of such a move cannot
fall under any of the exceptions, much less the exception contended
of either the doctrine of necessity or the peril to the democratic
set-up.  
</p>
 

<p id="p_1084"> Appointment
under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_511">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>:-
</p> 


<p id="p_1085">105.	Another
ground urged for invoking this doctrine is the appointment of former 
Judge of Supreme Court under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_512">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>  in the
preceding week,  to examine and  to inquire into some of the issues,
which otherwise could have been investigated by the Lokayukta. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1086">	The
primary object of the appointing a Commission  as spelt out by the
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/894748/" id="a_513">State of J &amp; K vs. Bakshi
Gulam Mohammad</a> reported in 1967 AIR 122, is as
under:-	
</p> 


<p id="p_1087">"It is of public
importance that public men failing in their duty should be called
upon to face the consequences. It is certainly a matter of importance
to the public that lapses on the part of the Ministers should be
exposed. the cleanliness of public life in which the public should be
vitally interested, must be a matter of public importance. The people
are entitled to know whether they have entrusted their affairs to an
unworthy man".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1088">	The
nature and scope of inquiry contemplated under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_514">Commissions of
Inquiry Act</a>, is to investigate the facts , record the findings and
submit the report to the Government. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1089">	The
Commission has no power of adjudication. The report of the Commission
is purely recommendatory and cannot be enforced proprio vigore. 
Though they are not binding in nature, if any such matter is before a
judicial side, the Court needs to arrive at its own conclusions after
assessment of evidence. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1090">         As
per the scheme of Lokayukta Act, those matters which are referred for
inquiry under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_515">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a> cannot be investigated
by the Lokayukta but,nothing can prevent the State Government  under
Section 7(2) of the Lokayukta Act  from referring the matter to such
commission if the matter is of definite public importance ,even when
Lokayukta is functioning and even when no recommendation or
concurrance is given by him for such reference.The fact also needs to
be regarded that the appointment under the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_516">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>
is of a former  Judge of the Supreme Court and  the very office is
indicative of  having  utmost integrity and high reputation and,
therefore, that ground is simply not available to circumvent
constitutional mandate by invoking doctrine of necessity.
</p> 


<p id="p_1091">	It
would be necessary to state here that though case of M.P. State
Special Police Case (Supra) is much harped upon, facts in that case
are completely different and can have no application in the present
case by any stretch. In that case, after the report of Lokayukta
indicting  Ministers, when question came up for  the sanction to
prosecute such Ministers, Council of Ministers denied  despite
overwhelming evidence and Governor assented the same. Apex Court in
this background approved the action of Governor. It  raised caution
and clarified that the Governor would not assume appellate powers
over the decision of the Council of Ministers ordinarily and carved
out  the following areas of
exceptions for the Governor to act on its own discretion without aid
and advice of the Council of Ministers :
</p> 


<p id="p_1092">1.	Inherent
or Manifest bias in advice given to the Governor
 


</p><p id="p_1093">2.

Other
authorities pressed into service by the learned counsel Mr. Patel,  
discussed earlier, largely speak of those areas where permission for
prosecution was not granted by the Council of Ministers either to
prosecute the Chief Minister or any other Minister and, thus, such
obvious acts of not sustaining the very faith of the Constitution, 
by shielding  serious acts of corruption, were construed as perilous
to the democracy. None of these authorities can have any
applicability in the present set of facts.

<p id="p_1098">	Ratio
of the Apex Court in case of Rajendra Singh Verma (Dead) through LRS
V/s. I.T.Governor of N.C.T of Delhi and others reported in 2011 (10)
SCALE P.315 &amp;  Election Commissions of India and another V/s.
Dr.Subramanian Swamy and another reported in 1996 (4) SCC 104 will
not come to the rescue for invoking Doctrine of Necessity or
otherwise for substantiating this act of appointment. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1099">	In
case of Rejendra Sing Verma (Supra) it is held that ordinarily
Governor is to act on aid and advice of the Government, but,  when
High Court recommended compulsory retirement of Judicial Officer,
Governor has to  act on such an advice of the High Court as  
Constitutionally, High Court is authorized to supervise District
Judiciary and initiate disciplinary actions. As those powers of
disciplinary control are clearly spelt out under the Constitution, in
such circumstances, Governor's action acting without the aid of
Council of Ministers  was sustained, specifying objective of <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_517">Article
235</a> of the Constitution. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1100">	In
the instant case  the Constitutional mandate is otherwise.  Rules of
business do not authorize Governor to so act . And, even when primacy
is to the opinion of the Chief Justice as held earlier, neither the
consultation process was over nor  were there  any specific
directions for taking  such a step and statute also does not indicate
any departure. This authority cannot help the cause of issuance of
warrant . 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1101">	In
case of Election Commissions of India and another V/s. Dr.Subramaniam
Swamy (Supra). The Apex Court clearly  indicated as to when Doctrine
of Necessity can be invoked.  
</p>
 


<p id="p_1102">"16.	We
must have a clear conception of the doctrine. It is well settled that
the law permits certain things to be done as a matter of necessity
which it would otherwise not countenance on the touchstone of
judicial propriety. Stated differently, the doctrine of necessity
makes it imperative for the authority to decide and considerations of
judicial propriety must yield. It is often invoked in cases of bias
where there is no other authority or Judge to decide the issue. If
the doctrine of necessity is not allowed full play in certain
unavoidable  situations, it would impede the course of justice itself
and the defaulting party would benefit therefrom.
Take the case of a certain taxing statute which taxes certain
perquisites allowed to Judges. If the validity of such a provision is
challenged who but the members of the judiciary must decide it. If
all the judges are disqualified on the plea that striking down of
such a legislation would benefit them, a stalemate situation may
develop. In such cases the doctrine of necessity comes into play . If
the choice is between allowing a biased person to act or to stifle
the action altogether, the choice must fall in favour of the former
as it is the only way to promote decision - making. In the
present case also if the two Election Commissioners are able to reach
a unanimous decision, there is no need for the Chief Election
Commissioner to participate, if not the doctrine of necessity may
have to be invoked."        
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1103"> 	In
this case, <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_518">Article 324</a> of the Constitution necessitated participation
of the Chief Election Commissioner and yet Court opined that if there
was unanimity  of other two Election Commissioner in a meeting ,
Chief Election Commissioner should recuse himself from participation,
whose biased attitude was evident on record. In the case on hand,
there were many avenues open which were not resorted to by the
Governor.  Nor was this an unavoidable situation warranting
invocation of this doctrine of necessity . 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1104">106.	Even
when it is said that under the provisions of Lokayukta Act- like
<a href="/doc/631792/" id="a_519">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1399613/" id="a_520">6</a>, there are attributes for complete independence as
also for protecting independence, even when this office is regarded
as larger part of justice dispensation system, it cannot be said that
the very nature of post indicated inherent bias or apparent bias and
Governor only could act nor would it be feasible to import and apply
any of the above exceptions, constitutionally carved out and as
developed by the decisions of the Apex Court to the facts of the
present case.
</p> 


<p id="p_1105">107.	In
the result, on this point it can be held thus :-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1106">107.1	
Twice the  process of consultation for  appointing Lokayukta was over
and both the times names were either recommended or approved by the
Chief Justice. Absence of any objection against any of the names from
any of the consultees is further indicative of consensus on such
names. Therefore, it cannot be said that Council of Ministers  would 
disentitle itself in having any say or it would become the case of
inherent bias.
</p> 


<p id="p_1107">	Government
could have insisted for appointment both the  times which is not done
except for reiteration in the communication. This may not find favour
with the Court and yet, on the question of permissibility of exercise
of powers under the  constitution or otherwise , this non action
cannot allow the powers to be shifted when there existed none. This
also cannot bring the case under any of the exceptions carved out by
the case laws .
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1108">107.2		As
discussed earlier, with consultation process not being over in case
of appointment of respondent No.1 and  with no communication or
indication to the Governor from the Chief Justice or the Council of
Ministers for  issuance of warrant, and  contrarily , indication in
the letter of18th August, 2011 is of awaiting the reply to
the concern raised in the last communication addressed to the Chief
Justice, act of issuance of warrant  shall have to be held as without
the authority under the law. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1109">107.3	As
indicated there is no time limit to issue ordinance and as has been
done by the Governor, the same could not have been insisted upon .
<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_521">Under the Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, appointment of  former  Judge
of the Supreme Court of India and referring to the commission some of
the matters of public importance could surely not provide the ground
to act independently invoking exceptional clause. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1110">	Thus,
 this is neither case of inherent or apparent bias nor of peril to
the democratic set-up nor covered under any other emergent situation
to fall under any other  exceptions. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1111">108.	One
 must be anxious to ensure that non-appointment on such a vital post
is not allowed on one or the other grounds as expiry of the period of
5 years would take away from the purview of the Lokayukta those
subjects of investigation and, therefore, this is a vital
consideration to be kept in mind while judging the actions of all
functionaries.  But, in that endeavour, the Court cannot permit the
disturbance of vital equilibrium of democratic set up envisaged by
the Constitutional framers and thereby allow any authority to
overreach the mandates of the Constitution. This thin and yet vital
balance needs to be inevitably maintained Neither in the name of
delay nor in the name of growing demand,   nor in an attempt to set
right the lapse of long period of  appointment,  shortcut  made
impermissible by the Constitution can be endorsed by the Court of law
more particularly,  when facts discussed hereinabove indicate no such
necessity to permit such a course otherwise  not allowed.

<p id="p_1112">109.	Apex
Court in case of S.R.Chaudhari V/s. State of Punjab (Supra ), after
referring to Prof. B.O.  Nwabueze from his book "Constitutionalism
in the Emergent States" (1973 Edition) stated thus : 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1113">41. Prof. Nwabueze's
warning has great relevance today in the context under our
consideration. For parliamentary democracy to evolve and grow certain
principles and policies of public ethics must from its functioning
base. Actions such as in the present case, pose grave danger to
foundations and principles of constitutionalism and the same must be
warded off by developing right attitude towards constitutional
provisions. Constitutional restraints must not be ignored or
by-passed if found inconvenient or bent to suit "political
expediency". We should not allow erosion of principles of
constitutionalism."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1114">110.
  	It would be appropriate to quote Nani Palkhiwala here  from  his
book "We the Nation" :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1115">"-----	We have
woefully  failed to build up healthy constitutional traditions and
have proved ourselves alarming inefficient in self discipline as far
that matter in any other type of discipline. The power of self
discipline is the very opposite of the fatal annoyance of power which
 confidently asserts that whatever is technically possible is licit.
We need to build up salutary conventions to preserve our nation from
the tamper which hardens the heart and perverts  the understanding.
Decency in public life is the only solution if we are to preserve 
the true spirit of democracy and not be left mearly with the task of
camatose constitution. We are faced with the stark alternatives of
either 'dharma' in public life or the twilight of Indian democracy "
</p>		
 


 


 


<p id="p_1116">111.	Declaratory
Relief :-	
</p> 


<p id="p_1117">	With
this, the area that needs to be touched is of the relief sought for
in the said petition. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1118">	As
the respondent No.1 has not taken the charge as Lokayukta, as held by
the Apex Court in case of University of Mysore V/s. Govindrao (Supra)
 as well as by  the Bombay High Court in case of Pundlik
Vishwanathan(Supra) , the petition of writ of quo warranto would not
lie where the person concerned has not assumed the office. One is
conscious that there has been a shift in this approach and the
declaratory relief mentioned in the case of  <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_522">N. Kannadasan vs. Ajoy
Khose  and others</a> (supra) is available and the same may suffice in
the instant case. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1119">112.	Before
concluding, it is imperative  to  mention that when the petition of
the State is being allowed, there would arise the question of void as
for all these years, no appointment has been made to the post of
Lokayukta and, therefore, without entering into the technicality and
considering the fact that there is  already a petition in the form of
 Public Interest Litigation pending before this Court,  the direction
for an early appointment would be necessary. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1120">Final
Conclusion : 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1121">113.	Accordingly,
I conclude as under:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_1122">(1)	The
appointment of Lokayukta, as provided under Section 3 of the Gujarat
Lokayukta Act, 1986   requires to be made by the Governor, only  with
the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1123">(2)	Consultation
process, as far as the name of respondent No.1 is concerned,  between
the Chief Justice and the Council of Ministers was not yet over and,
therefore, it cannot be said that there was  a stalemate, which
necessitated any other or further act on the part of the Governor. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1124">(3)	In
consultation process, primacy is always required to be given to the
opinion of the Chief Justice as discussed, Governor could not have
acted independently in overreaching the well laid down constitutional
requirement. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1125">(4)	There
are no exceptional circumstances existed as carved out by the
Constitution or otherwise laid down by the decisions of the Apex
Court , permitting the appointment of Lokayukta  by allowing the
settled principles of Parliamentary democracy to take a back seat. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1126">(5)	The
office of the Lokayukta is neither a Court nor has trappings of the
Court.
</p> 


<p id="p_1127">(6)	Insistence
of only one name instead of panel as made applicable for the judicial
post cannot be made applicable to the post of Lokayukta. However, the
proposal and recommendation shall need to be made by the Chief
Justice whose opinion shall have primacy in the appointment.
</p> 


<p id="p_1128">(7)	The
post of Lokayukta for the State shall be filled up within the period
of 4 months from the date of receipt of the order. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1129">114.	With
this, the petition of the State being SCA No. 12632 of 2011  is
allowed declaring the action of appointment in valid and contrary to
Constitutional mandate with the consequential relief of quashing the
warrant dated 25.8.2010 appointing respondent No.1 as Lokayukta for
the State of Gujarat. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1130">115.
	In the result, Special Civil Application No.13499 of 2011 is also
required to be allowed. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_1131">116.	In
this premise, SCA No. 12632 of 2011 and SCA 13499 of 2011 and other
Civil Applications stand disposed of in light of above declaration .
