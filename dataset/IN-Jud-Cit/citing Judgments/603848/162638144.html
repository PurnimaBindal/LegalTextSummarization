<p id="p_2">                                        This suit is filed by the Plaintiffs inter alia for preventing misuse of
               



               confidential information and also infringement of copyright. The present order
               disposes of the Plaintiffs' ad-interim application for protection pending the hearing

<p id="p_3">               2                        Plaintiff No.1 is a production house engaged in production of
               entertainment content for television including TV serials. Plaintiff Nos.2 and 3 are,
               respectively, the Chairman and Managing Director, and Chief Creative Director of





               Plaintiff No.1.
</p>

<p id="p_4">               3                        The gist of the Plaintiffs' case is this : In or about March 2011,
               Plaintiff No.2 developed a concept for a TV show, which was at that time called
               "Paachva Mausam Pyaar Ka". The concept was reduced to a concept note and
               was also registered with the Film Writer Association on 11 June 2013. The
               concept note registered by the Plaintiffs with the Association is reproduced
               verbatim in the plaint. The Plaintiffs thereafter worked from time to time and

                                                                                                                                          

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 28/03/2015 00:00:46 :::</span>
     sat                                                                              2/17                                               nmsl 785-2015.doc

          developed the concept and fleshed the same out extensively so as to convert it




                                                                                                                                            
          into a full-fledged TV series to be produced by Plaintiff No.3. The title of the
          concept note underwent a few changes and eventually became "Badki Bahu" with




                                                                                                            
          a tag line "aaude main sabse chhoti.. umar main sabse badi... hai toh gharki
          chhoti          bahu          magar            kehlaygi-Badki                    Bahu".           The          various         versions    and
          developments of the concept note are to be found in Exhibits A-1 to A-12, which




                                                                                                           
          are all, according to the Plaintiffs, original literary works developed in various
          forms for a television series planned by the Plaintiffs, and which are themselves
          copyrighted works. It is the Plaintiffs' case that between 11 June 2013 and about




                                                                                     
          March 2014, the Plaintiffs worked on the various versions and presentations of
          the concept notes, which are to be found in Exhibits A-1 to A-12, which contain
                                                      
          the developed concept, story, pitchline, plot, tracks, family, characters, names,
          set design, jewellery design, etc. The Plaintiffs from time to time shared the
                                                     
          concept notes with Defendant No.1. It is submitted that this sharing was in
          circumstances of confidence and was on the basis that Defendant No.1 promised
          the Plaintiffs that the former would telecast a serial based on the Plaintiffs'
          concept notes and that the production of this serial would be entrusted to Plaintiff
            


          No.1. In the course of this period, even a Letter of Intent was executed between
         



          Defendant No.1 and the Plaintiffs for production of the serial "Badki Bahu". It is
          submitted by the Plaintiffs that when the television serial was ready to be
          launched by Defendant No.1, Defendant No.1 insisted that the Plaintiffs take on





          board a co-producer and recommended a few names in this regard. The parties
          discussed the modalities, but the Plaintiffs never accepted the proposal for taking
          a co-producer on board and instead withdrew the concept notes from Defendant
          No.1. It is the Plaintiffs' case that at this stage, Defendant No.1 offered to buy the





          Plaintiffs' concept outright or alternatively, pay the Plaintiffs royalty on a per
          episode basis. Again, none of these two alternatives was accepted by the
          Plaintiffs, who insisted on total withdrawal of the concept notes shared with
          Defendant No.1. It is the Plaintiffs' case that in the course of the correspondence
          in this behalf between the parties, the Plaintiffs proposed that the Plaintiffs'
          concept, story, pitchline, plot, tracks, family tree, characters, names, set design,
          jewellery design, etc., which were developed                                                                 by the Plaintiffs, and
          communicated during the talks between the parties for commissioning the serial

          titled "Badki Bahu", would not be used by Defendant No.1. On this footing, the




                                                                                                                                            
          Plaintiffs even offered to consider transferring the title (only name of the show) to
          Defendant No.1 as desired by the latter. It is the Plaintiffs' case that Defendant




                                                                                                            
          No.1, on its part, was prepared to accept this proposal only with the exception of
          the tag line and the setting of the serial in Kolkata. No agreement could, however,
          be reached between the parties in this behalf. It is the Plaintiffs' case that despite




                                                                                                           
          this correspondence, Defendant No.1 has proceeded to announce a new serial to
          be launched on its new television channel in the name of "Badi Devrani", which
          serial, the Plaintiffs submit, is entirely based on the concept notes prepared by




                                                                                     
          the Plaintiffs and shared with Defendant No.1, as noted above. In the premises,
          the Plaintiffs have applied for an injunction against the telecast of the serial.

          Dwarkadas, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Plaintiffs, that the
          offending serial is being produced by Defendant No.1 through Defendant No.2,
          which is a rival production house, with the use of the information shared by the
          Plaintiffs with Defendant No.1 in the form of the various concept notes, Exhibits A
            


          and A-1 to A-12 of the plaint, in circumstances of confidence, which implied an
         



          obligation on the part of Defendant No.1 to maintain the same as confidential and
          not to use it otherwise than under the authority of the Plaintiffs. It is submitted that
          the serial being produced by Defendant Nos.1 and 2 is made by using the





          concept notes without the authority of the Plaintiffs. It is submitted that the
          various concept notes had already reached the stage of being a saleable
          commodity, namely, material which could be actually used for converting into a
          TV serial. It is also the case of the Plaintiffs that the concept, developed in





          Exhibits A and A-1 to A-12 of the plaint, together with its tag line and the various
          aspects of the TV serial forming part of the concept notes, is copyrighted work
          belonging to the Plaintiffs and that the Defendants' proposed serial is an
          infringement of the Plaintiffs' copyright in it. Learned Counsel relies upon the

<p id="p_6">          5                        Dr.Virendra Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for




                                                                                                            
          Defendant No.1, whilst opposing the Plaintiffs' application for ad-interim reliefs,
          submits that, in the first place, the Plaintiffs have not identified what is the
          confidential material which they seek to protect. It is submitted that anything and




                                                                                                           
          everything which forms part of the concept notes, purportedly shared by the
          Plaintiffs with Defendant No.1, cannot be a subject matter of confidence.
          Secondly, it is submitted that to claim confidentiality, the Plaintiffs have to make




                                                                                     
          out a case of uniqueness of the material shared by the Plaintiffs with Defendant
          No.1. It is submitted that the purported material is not unique in any way. Thirdly,
                                                      
          it is submitted that the concept notes, which are produced as Exhibits A-1 to A-
          12, have all been developed in discussions between the Plaintiffs and
                                                     
          representatives of Defendant No.1 and are based on inputs given by the latter. As
          for the case of the alleged infringement of copyright, it is submitted that there is
          no copyright in an idea or a thought. Learned Counsel for Defendant No.1, in this
          behalf, relies upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1734007/" id="a_4">R.G. Anand
            


          vs. M/s.Delux Films4</a>. Lastly, it is submitted that there is neither a case of breach
         



          of confidentiality nor a case of infringement of copyright, since the Defendants

          producing their serial. It is vehemently urged by Dr.Tulzapurkar that to consider





          whether or not the Defendants have used any material from the concept notes
          shared by the Plaintiffs, it is imperative for this Court to actually see the ten
          episodes of the serial produced by the Defendants and find for itself whether or
          not the spectator or viewer, after seeing the work, is likely to get an unmistakable





          impression that the Defendants' work is a copy of the concept notes of the
          Plaintiffs.

<p id="p_8">                                   Let me first consider the Plaintiffs' claim of breach of confidence,
          which, according to me, is the main plank of the Plaintiffs' case at this stage. It is
                                                     
          now well known that the law of confidence is different from the law of copyright. In
          fact, as observed by various reputed international authors, as also held in various
          pronouncements by Courts in India and abroad, that publication of a work can
          very well be restrained on the basis of a breach of trust or confidence; that
            


          protection of confidence is in fact a broader right than the proprietary right of a
         



          copyright. Whereas there can be no copyright in an idea or information per se, if
          the idea or information has been sufficiently formed and has been acquired by a
          person under such circumstances that it would be a breach of good faith to





          publish or use the same without authority from the person from whom it has been
          so acquired, the Court may in an appropriate case protect the idea or information
          by granting an injunction. The two rights naturally have different incidents.
          Whereas the copyright is good against the world at large, sharing of confidence





          casts a duty only on the recipient of the information or idea to maintain
          confidentiality and not publish or use the same without the authority of the
          originator.
</p>

<p id="p_9">          8                        There are three important elements of such a claim for protection of
          confidence. Firstly, it must be shown that the information itself is of a confidential
          nature. Secondly, it must be shown that it is communicated or imparted to the

          5 584 F.Supp.2d 1288

          defendant under circumstances which cast an obligation of confidence on him. In




                                                                                                                                            
          other words, there is a relationship of confidence between the parties. Thirdly, it
          must be shown that the information shared is actually used or threatened to be




                                                                                                            
          used unauthorizedly by the Defendants, that is to say, without the licence of the
          Plaintiff. Each of these three basic elements involve their own peculiarities and
          sub-elements, which shall be noted presently.
</p>



                                                                                                           
<p id="p_10">          9                        As far as the first element is concerned, namely, confidentiality of
          the information, there are at least three sub-elements, which need to be




                                                                                     
          considered. The first is identification of the confidential information itself. For
          without identification, it will not be possible to hold the information to be
                                                      
          confidential. Secondly, the information shared must be original and not be in
          public domain. The originality itself has some nuances to be considered. Firstly,
                                                     
          the idea, to claim protection, must be sufficiently developed so that it is capable of
          being realised as an actuality. Our Court in the case of Zee Telefilms Ltd.
          (supra) noted in this behalf the observations of the English Court in the case of
          Fraser vs. Thames Television Ltd.6 These observations are quoted below :

                                   which has at least some attractiveness for a television
                                   programme and which is capable of being realized as an
                                   actuality (see per Harris) in Talbot's case (1981) RPC 1 at 9).

                                   full synopsis. In some cases the nature of the idea may require
                                   extensive development of this kind in order to meet the criteria.
                                   But in others the criteria may be met by a short unelaborated
                                   statement of an idea. In Talbot's case itself I do not think the
                                   detailed submission (at 5) added very much of substance to the





                                   idea which is set out in one sentence (also at 5).

                                   knowledge. The originality may consist in a significant twist or
                                   slant to a well-known concept (see Talbot's case). This, I think,
                                   by analogy, consistent with the statements in Saltman's case
                                   and Coco's case that novelty in the industrial field can be
                                   derived from the application of human ingenuity to well-known

          use to which it is to be put, in a given case, an extensive development of the idea

          have an element of originality. It should not be an idea in the realm of public




                                                                                     
          knowledge. But this originality may not be in the sense that it is not derived from
          what is already available as public knowledge. What makes an idea unique so as
                                                      
          to make out a case of confidentiality is the fact that the maker of the work has
          used his brain and, even whilst using what was already in the public domain, has
                                                     
          produced a result which can be produced by somebody who goes through such
          process. The case of Delhi High Court in Anil Gupta (supra) , popularly known as
          the Swayamvar case, and the case of Zee Telefilms Ltd. (supra) are cases in
          point. In the case of Anil Gupta (supra), the idea was of producing a reality TV
            


          programme of match making to the point of an actual spouse selection, in which
         



          real everyday ordinary persons would participate before a TV audience. The
          programme was titled as "Swayamvar", since a large number of people would
          associate the name with the idea of a woman selecting a groom in public fora,





          recalling mythological Swayamvar. In this case, this idea per se with its
          minimalistic details was sufficient to make the same unique and confidential. This
          is what the Delhi High Court said in paragraphs 27 and 29.

                                    novelty and innovation of the concept of the plaintiff resides in
                                    combing of a reality TV show with a subject like match making
                                                      
                                    for the purpose of marriage. The Swayamvar quoted in Indian
                                    mythology was not a routine practice. In mythology, we have
                                    come across broadly understood only two Swayamvars, one in
                                    Mahabharat where the choice as not let on the bride but on the
                                                     
                                    act of chivalry to be performed by any prince and whosoever
                                    succeeded in such performance got the hand of Draupdi.
                                    Similarly, in Ramayana choice was not left to the bride but again
                                    on performance of chivalrous act by a prince who could break
                                    the mighty Dhanusha (Bow). Therefore, originality lies in the
            

                                    concept of plaintiff by conceiving a reality TV programme of
                                    match making and spouse selection by transposing
         



                                    mythological Swayamvar to give prerogative to woman to select
                                    a groom from variety of suitors and making it presentable to
                                    audience and to explore it for commercial marketing. Therefore
                                    the very concept of matchmaking in view of concept of the
                                    plaintiff giving choice to the bride was a novel concept in





                                    original thought capable of being protected."</blockquote>


<p id="p_13">                      In the case of Zee Telefilms (supra), however, it was not the idea which
          was sufficient per se. That was a case, where a unique programme was
          conceived by the name of "Kanhaiyya" which was renamed by the Defendants as





          "Krish Kanhaiyya", which showed a young child "Bal Krishna" residing in a family
          whose life was disturbed, and proceeding to solve all troubles. This idea, though
          novel, was not per se sufficient to lend uniqueness and confidentiality. What was
          important, however, was that it was developed in details as set out in Exhibits
          and C of the plaint in that case. The idea was developed into an expression.
          There were various concept notes, character sketches, detailed plot of the first
          episode and ten episodes. Based on this material, which was shared with the

<p id="p_15">          13                       The next important question is, whether the material shared by the




                                                                                     
          plaintiff with the defendant is actually being used or threatened to be used by the
          defendant unauthorisedly, i.e. without the licence of the plaintiff. Even here a
                                                      
          couple of difficulties present themselves in most cases. There is ordinarily no
          difficulty if one has to compare two completed artistic works or literary works. It is
                                                     
          for the Court then to find out whether the form, manner of presentation or
          expression of the two works display a sufficient and substantial similarity so as to
          form an impression that the offending work is a copy of the original work. The
          difficulty arises when it is not two completed works of art or literary works that we
            


          need to compare. If we were to compare, let us say, a story and a play or movie
         



          which is said to use or plagiaries the story disclosed in confidence, these
          difficulties would ordinarily be presented. For in that case, there will be several
          distinguishing features which set apart a completed work of art, namely, a play or





          a movie, from the story used to create it, which would be dissimilar or which
          would be different from the story per se. There will be different scenes, different
          characters or elements introduced, different dialogues, and yet the play or the film
          may be a complete rip off or a close adaptation of the story. The Courts have





          grappled with such cases in various ways. One of the well known doctrines used
          for the purpose is the "spring board" doctrine. It may well be that the defendant
          uses the plaintiff's idea as a spring board and then devises some additional
          material to produce a work. If the original idea was conveyed by the plaintiff to the
          defendant as a matter of confidence and the defendant uses it as a spring board
          to develop his own work, in an appropriate case, the defendant may still be liable
          for breach of confidence. This was explained by our Court in Zee Telefilms
          (supra), as follows :

                                   (1967) 2 All ER 415. In this case the plaintiff, in the course of
                                   discussion with the defendants of a carpet grip described as
                                   'the germ of the idea' for a different form of carpet grip which
                                   the plaintiff had devised. Later the defendants developed and
                                   marketed the carpet grip which was unwittingly based on the

                                   defendants to devise their own grip and held that the
                                   defendants were liable for breach of confidence. The learned

          In the first place, it is clear from the averments of the Plaintiffs in paragraphs 11
          and 78 of the plaint that the confidential information, which was shared by the





          Plaintiffs with the representatives of Defendant No.1, was in terms of the concept

          sufficiently establish the first two aspects of confidentiality for the purposes of this

          to A-12, prima facie indicate that this information or material is new and not
          already in public domain. Learned Counsel for the Defendants submits that there

          called "Astitva", where a much older girl marries a younger boy and some
          problems ensue as a result. Whilst there is nothing new in this idea or thought or
          indeed in the idea of the Defendants' own TV serial "Astitva", it is the setting in
            


          which the story is cast, the characteristics and backdrop of the family,                                                                   the
         



          characterization of the protagonists and other important characters, the trigger
          points leading to different dramatic situations and the handling of these situations
          by the two protagonists with its accompanying dramatic elements are all matters,





          which lend a certain uniqueness to the material. It is these elements, as may be
          seen from the material produced with the plaint, which are peculiar to the
          Plaintiffs' concept and make it both unique and subject matter of confidence. On
          the other hand, a broad comparison with the Defendants' serial "Astitva" with the





          Plaintiffs' concept notes makes it abundantly clear that the various essential
          elements of the two works, namely, the serial "Astitva" and the concept notes of
          the Plaintiffs, are materially different. All elements of confidentiality of the
          information are, in my opinion, thus, adequately satisfied at least at this prima
          facie stage. There is identification of the confidential material; and this material is
          shown to be original and not already forming part of public domain; and having
          potential uniqueness and attractiveness from the point of view of a new TV serial.

<p id="p_22">          17                       The circumstances of the case, noted above, and particularly
          indicated in paragraphs 11 and 78 of the plaint, clearly imply that the information
            


          was parted with by the Plaintiffs in circumstances of confidence, which cast an
         



          obligation on the Defendants to maintain confidentiality and not use the material
          without the licence of the Plaintiffs.

<p id="p_23">          18                       That brings us to the important topic of whether or not the
          information is actually used or threatened to be used by the Defendants.
          Dr.Tulzapurkar, as noted above, submitted that it was not possible for this Court
          to arrive at any conclusion as to the breach of either confidentiality or copyright





          without first actually seeing the Defendants' material, which is available in the
          form of the first 10 episodes of the serial expected to run about 780 episodes.
          Just as Dr.Tulzapurkar vehemently submitted that I must actually see the
          episodes, I have steadfastly refused to do so. And there is a good reason for
          doing so. We are not, as noted above, comparing here two completed artistic or
          literary works. In the case of two completed works, as noted by me above, what
          we have to see is the form and the manner of presentation or expression, and the
          various actual dramatic features forming part of the two works, to make up our

          case, we essentially deal with the form of expression and the various nuances
          respectively used by the two works to bring out and develop the theme, but in this




                                                                                                            
          case, we are concerned, on the one hand, with a concept note in the form of the
          concept or theme of the serial, the broad story line, pitchline, the plots, tracks,
          family tree, characters, set design, jewellery design, etc. which are all matters of




                                                                                                           
          concept, yet sufficiently developed to lend a certain uniqueness and
          confidentiality to them and on the other, with the completed work of the
          Defendants in the form of first ten episodes of the serial. The elements of the




                                                                                     
          concept notes cannot be appropriately compared against the various nuances
          and elements of detail developed by the Defendants to portray the material. In
                                                      
          fact, if at all, the Defendants' material will have to be stripped of all these nuances
          and embellishments and seen as a conceptual material so far as the theme, the
                                                     
          story, the plots, the characters etc. go and then to compare the two works to see
          if the offending material in fact copies the Plaintiffs' concept notes. And for this
          exercise, there is already adequate material before this Court, placed by both the
          parties. Even if we consider the common material emanating from both the
            


          versions, namely, the version of the Plaintiffs and that of the Defendants, it is
         



          possible to make out a case that the Defendants' work is an imitation or a rip off
          of the Plaintiffs' concept notes. The Defendants no doubt have shown that there
          are several characters in the Defendants' serial, which do not exist in the





          Plaintiffs' work. So also, there are various elements and embellishments, which
          are not to be found in the Plaintiffs' concept notes. For example, it is claimed that
          the characters of the great grandfather or his elder brother, the great
          grandmother, the third son or the third son's daughter-in-law, which exist in the





          Plaintiffs' concept notes of "Badki Bahu", are not there in the Defendants' story of
          "Badi Devrani". So also there are some characters, which are not to be found in
          the Plaintiffs' concept such as the elder son, his son, elder son's daughter-in-law,
          etc. These are insignificant matters. So long as the Defendants' work portrays the
          Plaintiffs' concept notes, additions or deletions of a few characters here and there
          do not really matter. So also, the Defendants tried to make out a case that even
          the characterization of the two protagonists and the other characters in the two
          works are dissimilar. For example, the Defendants point out that whereas the

          and full of energy, but directionless, though joking and playing around, yet
          undecided about what he wants to do in life. The Defendants' male protagonist is




                                                                                                            
          actually mature and sensitive, though his ways are immature. He is very chilled
          out and is not aimless and has new ideas but at his age, his ideas are not crisp
          and clear. The Plaintiffs' protagonist respects his elders a lot, but lives as per his




                                                                                                           
          norms and believes in trying out new things and explores new avenues as he is
          still discovering what he wants to do so in life, whilst not taking any
          responsibilities. The Defendants' protagonist believes in change and accepts the




                                                                                     
          new ways of living, but would also keep the family values in mind. We can go on
          endlessly in this fashion. What is important and clearly emerges is this : The two
                                                      
          characters are essentially similar and portray an identical personality. Not only
          just the male protagonist, but all other important characters including the female
                                                     
          protagonist in the works exhibit uncanny similarities of characteristics and
          mannerisms. So also, if one goes by the essence of the first ten episodes, which
          is described by the Plaintiffs (and even if one were to go by the Defendants'
          overall version of the episodes), what emerges is that the essence of the
            


          Defendants' material is clearly taken from the Plaintiffs' concept notes. Based on
         



          the material, which is produced by both the parties before the Court, I have come
          to a prima facie conclusion that all the important elements from the Plaintiffs'
          concept notes are copied in the Defendants' work. The following makes it clear:

<p id="p_25">          19                       We also cannot loose sight of the fact that all this is in the backdrop
          of the sharing of the concept notes, the joint proposal of making a TV serial, the
          LOI and finally the offer to purchase the concept outright or pay per episode




                                                                                                           
          royalty. Even as entirely independent original works it would be too much to
          believe that these uncanny similarities between the two works are a matter of
          pure chance, but with the back drop of events, it is well neigh impossible to

<p id="p_26">                                   Though the main case of the Plaintiffs, which I have considered for
          the purposes of this ad-interim application, is the case of breach of confidentiality,
                                                     
          there is also an arguable case of there being a copyright in the material of the
          Plaintiffs. Having regard to the particular character sketches in the concept notes,
          the detailed setting of the dramatic material, the overall tracks, plots, family tree,
          etc., the material is sufficiently developed into a concrete literary work capable of
            


          having its own life as a copyrighted materials. It is arguable that the elements of
         



          expression in the Plaintiffs' concept notes which are protectable under copyright
          law are copied into the Defendants' work, and it is not the basic plot idea of the
          story, but actual concrete elements that make up the total sequence of events





          and relationships between major characters that are plagiarized, within the
          meaning of the law as expounded in Livia MILANO's case (supra). It is also
          possible to contend that even as a matter of copyright violation the matter would
          fall within the dicta of R.G. Anand's case (supra). It is possible to say that





          notwithstanding the variety of incidents which give a certain different colour and
          complexion to the Defendants' work than the Plaintiffs' copyrighted work, a totality
          of impression to be gathered is that by and large the former work is a copy of the
          latter. These aspects though will be considered in greater details later, when the
          parties put in their full pleadings and the matter is heard at the interim stage at
          greater length. At this moment, it is sufficient to note that the Plaintiffs have a
          statable case even of a breach of copyright and that at the ad-interim stage, the
          material in which they claim such copyright ought to be protected.

</pre><p id="p_27">          Plaintiffs have not only prepared the first concept note and got the same




                                                                                                            
          registered, but have proceeded to develop this concept note into various
          character sketches, plots and other material, which are reflected in Exhibits A-1 to
          A-12, over about a year. Whilst it is the case of the Defendants that the material




                                                                                                           
          actually belongs to them, the Plaintiffs cannot be presented with a fait accompli
          by letting the Defendants exploit the entire material. The value of the material as
          a novel TV serial material will be completely lost and the Plaintiffs will be




                                                                                     
          effectively rendered unable to use the material for their own sake. On the other
          hand, the Defendants are not likely to suffer any irretrievable damages if the
                                                      
          telecast of the serial is held up for a few days till the Court hears the application
          at a greater length and after allowing the parties to bring in their complete
                                                     
          pleadings. And for the damages suffered by the Defendants in the interregnum,
          there is adequate machinery available within the Code of Civil Procedure for
          compensating the Defendants.
