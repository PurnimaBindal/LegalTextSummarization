ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">	Petitioners
are the original plaintiffs.  They have instituted Special Civil Suit
No.43/98 against the respondent-original-defendant.   In response to
the summons issued by the Civil Court, defendant filed written
statement.  In the written statement, besides other grounds, he  also
urged that the land in question was held by him as tenant.  Possibly
on this very ground,  issue No.5 raised by the Civil Court was
whether the defendant prove that the Court has no jurisdiction to try
the suit in view of section 85A of the Bombay Tenancy and
Agricultural Lands Act.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	In
my view, when 	question of tenancy was raised by the defendant, at
that very stage, the issues should have been referred to the Tenancy
Court and further proceedings of the suit should have been stayed in
terms of the provisions contained in section 85-A of the Bombay
Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act.  Unfortunately, however, neither
the Civil Court adopted nor either sides requested for adopting such
a course.  Issue No.7 was also raised by the Civil Court to the
effect that whether the defendant 

 

proves
 that he is  in legal possession of the suit temple and the land as
Sevayat and tenant.  The suit proceeded and it appears that recording
 of evidence  is also concluded. At that stage, the Civil Court
passed the impugned order  dated 26.5.08 and  referred issue No.7 
for decision by the Tenancy Court and requested the Mamlatdar to
decide  the same within six months and place the decision before the
Court.  The Civil Court was of the opinion that it had no
jurisdiction to decide the issue of tenancy which can be decided only
by the Mamlatdar and ALT.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.	Learned
advocate Shri Kanabar for the petitioners vehemently submitted that
civil court committed a grave error in referring the said issue for
consideration by the Tenancy Court, that too, at a  belated stage. 
He submitted that the entire trial was over and at such a stage to
refer the dispute would cause irreparable harm  to the petitioners. 
It was  contended that in the evidence, the defendant did not set up
any case of tenancy and in that view of the matter,  he should be
treated to have waived the question of tenancy rights.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">	Reliance
was placed on the decision of this Court  in the case of <a href="/doc/1433739/" id="a_1">Hargovan
Keshav  v. Mansing Thakorbhai</a>,
2000(3) GLR 2063 to contend  that merely because a plea of tenancy 
is raised, civil court is not bound to refer the issue to the tenancy
court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">	Reliance
was placed on a  decision of the Apex Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/119495303/" id="a_2">D.M.Deshpande  v. Janardhan Kashinath Kadam</a>, AIR 1999 SC 1464
to contend that in the present case civil court could not have 
referred the dispute to the tenancy court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">	Reliance
was also placed on the decision of Full Bench of the Himachal Pradesh
High Court  in the case of  <a href="/doc/1779256/" id="a_3">Prithvi Raj Jhingta  v. Gopal Singh</a>,
AIR 2007 Himachal Pradesh 11 to contend that civil court was required
to decide all issues raised before it in terms of Order 14 Rule 2 of
Civil Procedure Code.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">4.	On
the other hand, learned advocate Shri M.B.Gandhi for the respondents
opposed the petition and placing reliance on the decision of the Apex
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/975074/" id="a_4">Parmar Kanaksinh Bhagwansinh  v. Makwana
Shahabhai Bhikhabhai</a>, 1994 (0) GLHEL-SC 20785  submitted that  it
was incumbent  on the civil court to refer the issue for decision by
the tenancy court and suspend further proceedings  of the suit.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8">5.	From
the material on record, it can be seen that  at the very outset 
while in the written statement the defendant had  set up a case of
tenancy, he had contended that since the time of his father,  the
land was being cultivated as tenant.  In the deposition also, in
examination-in-chief, it has been  elaborately stated that father of
the defendant was the tenant of the suit land and his tenancy right
was therefore crystallized upon introduction of the Bombay Tenancy
and Agricultural Lands Act.  In that view of the matter, as already
noted at the outset, question of tenancy should have been referred to
the Tenancy Court in terms of the provisions contained in section 85
of the said Act and further proceedings should have been stayed. 
Unfortunately, the Civil Court did not do so at the relevant time.
However, delay in taking such a step by itself would not  permit the
civil court to decide the issues which, as per the mandatory
provisions of section 85 and 85-A of the Tenancy Act, the Civil Court
is not authorized to do.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">6.		I
am unable to accept the contention  of the counsel for the
petitioners that in the oral evidence the defendant gave up the claim
  of tenancy.  My  attention was drawn to the cross-examination of
the defendant. However, effect of the evidence has to be seen by
reading  the entire evidence as a whole and when the Civil Court has
no jurisdiction to decide the question of tenancy, in the facts of
the present case, I do not think that the Civil Court committed any
error in passing the impugned order.  In the facts of the present
case, I do not  find that the civil court can analyze the evidence
threadbare and hold  that the defendant was not the tenancy of the
suit land.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">7.		In
the case of Hargovan Keshav (supra), the learned Judge of this Court
found that the defendant was  taking an inconsistent stand of tenancy
on one hand and ownership on the other.   It was in this background,
that even while observing that on plain reading of section 85, it is
clear that the Civil Court  is bound to refer the issue regarding
tenancy to Mamlatdar and cannot insist  that the party must establish
prima facie case, it was further observed that this does not mean 
that as and when such a plea is raised, the Court without applying
mind must refer the same to the Mamlatdar.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">	In
the case of D.M.Deshpande (supra), the Apex Court was considering a
case wherein in the execution proceedings the case of tenancy was 
set up  without disclosing  how it was created, when it was created
and terms thereof.  The Apex court also found that the land of the
trust was exempted from the operation of the Tenancy Act. The Apex
Court, therefore,  found that the executing court  rightly rejected
the objection of the respondent regarding  their claim of tenancy. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_12">	In
the case of Prithvi Raj Jhingta (supra), Full Bench of the  Himachal
Pradesh High Court was considering the scope of Rule 2 of Order 14 of
the CPC. In the present case, in view of the  order passed by the
civil court, further hearing of the suit is suspended and the stage
of deciding of issues has  not yet arisen. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_13">8.	In
the result, I do not find that the civil court committed any error in
passing the impugned order.  The petition is therefore dismissed. 
Notice is discharged.  Interim relief is vacated.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">9.	The
petitioners are, however,  justified in pointing out that the tenancy
issue should be decided as early as possible.  Mamlatdar and ALT 
therefore shall endeavour to adhere to the time limit provided by the
trial Court in the impugned order.
</p>
