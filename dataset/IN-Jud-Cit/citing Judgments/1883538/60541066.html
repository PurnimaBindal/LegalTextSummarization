and on behalf of the plaintiff No.1 under a non-exclusive license. Plaintiff
No.2 adheres to all strict quality standards stipulated and monitored by the
plaintiff No.1. The products of the plaintiffs under the trade mark DROTIN
were first introduced in the Indian markets in the year 1997. The DROTIN
tablets manufactured by the plaintiff No.2 are marketed by the plaintiff No.1
in India. Plaintiff No.3, Martin and Harris Pvt. Ltd, who are in the business
of pharmaceutical products since 1924 are inter alia manufacturing
injections under the trade mark DROTIN under license from the plaintiff
no.1 and are in the business of buying and selling pharmaceutical goods
manufactured by plaintiff No.2 which are marketed by the plaintiff No.1 in
India.
</p><p id="p_5">4.       It is alleged in the plaint that the Plaintiff No.1 has bonafidely coined
and adopted the trade mark DROTIN and has used exclusively, continuously
and extensively since 1997 in relation to tablets and injections. DROTIN
tablet and injections manufactured and marketed by the plaintiffs is a
schedule 'H' drug which are to be sold on the prescription of a registered
medical practioner. The plaintiff No.1 registered its trade mark DROTIN in
India under registration number 732349 in Class 5 as on 3rd February, 1997
for medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations which is more than 14 years
old and has become conclusive. Therefore, the said registration is valid and
subsisting in accordance with law. Plaintiff No.2 obtained drug license for
the manufacture of pharmaceutical product under the trade mark DROTIN
on 2nd April, 1997.

     i.e. colitis, gastroenteritis, ascariasis etc.
             It is averred in the plaint that on account of prior adoption, long
     and continuous use, extensive sales, sale promotional schemes,
     excellent quality control and marketing through national network of
     stockists and retailers, the trade mark DROTIN has acquired enviable
     goodwill and reputation and has become distinctive of the goods and

pharmaceutical preparations. Defendant no.2 Glare Medicare (P) Ltd. is
engaged in the marketing of the medicines manufactured by defendant no.1
throughout India including Delhi.
</p><p id="p_15">8.     It is stated in the plaint that the plaintiffs came to know about the
adoption and use of the impugned mark DROTAMOL in suspension form
on the part of the defendants in December 2012. The adoption and use by the
defendant of the trade mark DROTAMOL, which is deceptively similar to,
plaintiff's registered trade mark DROTIN in respect of identical/similar
goods in the form of tablets, injections and suspension amounts to
infringement of plaintiff's registered trademark and passing off and the use
by the defendants of the mark DROTAMOL is with a view to exploit the
tremendous and enviable goodwill and reputation that the plaintiffs
commands. The illegal and unauthorized use of the mark is calculated to
deceive the public into believing that defendant's goods and concern are
those of the plaintiff's or are in some way connected or associated with the

 plaintiff. The defendants are selling their goods in the markets at Delhi
without issuance of any cash memo.

</p><p id="p_17">(i)   It is the case of defendants that this court has no territorial jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_18">      The suit has not been properly valued for the purpose of court fees and
      jurisdiction and the plaintiffs cannot invoke the jurisdiction of this court
      as there is no place of business within the local jurisdiction limits of
      this court.
</p><p id="p_19">(ii) The plaintiff No.1 did not use "DROT" in abbreviation form but as
      well- recognized trade mark. There are more than 25 products with the
      marks having prefix "DROT" or any other 4-5 products of DROT
      which are available in the market or are being manufactured by any
      other manufacturer.
</p><p id="p_20">(iii) There are no similarities in DROTAMOL Suspension and DROTIN
      Suspension as "name", "colour" and "packaging" and composition are
      different. It is averred by the defendants that when the composition is
      different, then the user is also different. The only similarity is
      "DROTAVERIN"            in   DROTAMOL        Suspension     and    DROTIN
      Suspension as it is usually common in Schedule 'H' drugs.
      DROTAVERIN is used in DROTAMOL Suspension as 2.5 times more
      than DROTIN Suspension and additional "PCM 125 mg". But in
      DROTIN Suspension, "DROTAVERIN" is used as 10 mg and no
      additional "PCM" and in "SYP" form. It is averred by the defendants
      that DROTIN Suspension is not available in the rural areas as it is very
      costly in the market.

<p id="p_31">11.     In the replication filed it is reiterated by the plaintiffs that they have
place of business within the local jurisdiction limits of this court, thus this
court has got territorial jurisdiction to enter and try the suit which has been
correctly valued for the purpose of court fees and jurisdiction. The trade
mark DROTIN connotes and denotes the medicinal preparations of the
plaintiffs and no one else. The composition, formulation, packing,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">      CS(OS) No.220/2013                                          Page 6 of 24</span>
 combination of colours are immaterial and irrelevant to the determination of
the question of infringement and passing off. The use of impugned mark
DROTAMOL constitutes infringement of the plaintiffs registered mark
DROTIN irrespective of use for suspension, injection or tablet.
</p><p id="p_32">12.    It is also denied in the replication that more than 25 products with the
marks having prefix "DROT" or any other 4-5 products of DROT which are
available in the market or are being manufactured by any other manufacturer
as the list of products mentioned are false, concocted and without any basis.
The plaintiffs are prior in adoption and use of DROTIN which was well
within the knowledge of defendants at the time of adoption of
DROTAMOL. The conduct of defendants is dishonest, malafide and solely
motivates to misappropriate the plaintiff's goodwill and reputation attached
to the trade mark DROTIN. The alleged prior introduction of "Suspension"
under the impugned mark DROTAMOL, for suspension is of no
consequence in law. It is evident that the doctors, chemists, consumers are
likely to get confused or deceived between the plaintiffs and defendants
products on account of phonetic and structural similarity and on account of
imperfect recollection of unwary class of purchases. The chemists are also
likely to get confused or deceived on account of illegible handwriting of the
medicinal practitioners and even the defendant had the knowledge about the
use and registration of the trade mark DROTIN while adopting the
impugned mark. The illegal trade activities of the defendants are causing
irreparable loss, injury and damage to the plaintiffs in its business, goodwill
and reputation. It is denied that goods of defendants are not sold in Delhi, as
alleged or otherwise. The defendants are selling their goods and are working
for gain and carrying on business in Delhi. The class of purchasers for
DROTIN and DROTAMOL are same. The impugned mark is bound to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">      CS(OS) No.220/2013                                       Page 7 of 24</span>
 confuse the unwary class of consumers who hardly see the composition or
price of the products.
</p><p id="p_33">13.      It was alleged in the replication that the defendants have clearly
mentioned that DROTIN Suspension market price is Rs.72/- for 100 ml
whereas DROTAMOL Suspension market price is Rs. 42/- for 50 ml. hence
DROTAMOL Suspension is highly priced as 100/- ml will be available for
Rs.84/- in market. The defendants on one hand states that their products are
sold in rural market and manufacture their products keeping in mind the
lower sections of society where as their products are priced more than
plaintiffs products. The stock room of manufacturer can be located in any
place in India but this doesn't prove that the defendant's sales are confined
to state of UP only, as alleged or otherwise. It is denied that the business of
defendants is confined to few districts of UP or few dealers as alleged or
otherwise. It is specifically mentioned in the plaint that the goods of
defendants are being sold and offered for sale in Delhi. The plaintiffs have
already filed the certificates issued by the chartered accountant reflecting the
sales of DROTIN range of products and have also filed randomly selected
copies of invoices showing the use of the trade mark DROTIN throughout
India.
</p><p id="p_34">14.      The plaintiffs in view of abovementioned facts and circumstances, are
seeking injunction orders against the defendants from manufacturing,
selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in
medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations under the impugned trade mark
DROTAMAL.
</p><p id="p_35">15.      By order dated 5th February, 2013 while issuing the notice, the
defendant No.1 was directed to maintain accounts with regard to
manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical product under the            trade mark


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">      CS(OS) No.220/2013                                        Page 8 of 24</span>
 DROTAMOL. The account was directed to be filed every three months in
the court. Since the said order was not complied with by the defendants, the
plaintiffs filed an application being I.A. No.2706/2014 under Order 39 Rule
2 CPC for non-compliance.
</p><p id="p_36">16.    Though, various defences are taken in the written statement but at the
time of hearing of the injunction application, the defendants' counsel has
argued mainly on two points i.e. territorial jurisdiction and the mark
DROTIN as claimed by the plaintiffs common to the trade. It was argued
that since other parties are using the same, his client cannot be restrained
from using the trade mark in question. The plaintiffs' trade mark is already
become common to the trade. Therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled to
injunction prayed for.
</p><p id="p_37">17.    The defendants have not disputed the facts that the trade mark
DROTIN is registered trade mark in favour of the plaintiff No.1 and the
plaintiffs are carrying on business within the jurisdiction of this Court. There
are no serious arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the defendant
at the time of hearing about the deceptively similarity of the two rival marks.
</p><p id="p_38">18.    Let me now discuss the entire gamut of the matter in view of pleading
and documents placed on record by both parties.
</p><p id="p_39">19.    The first issue is whether the two trade marks used by the parties are
deceptively similar or not.
</p><p id="p_40">INFRINGEMENT
</p><p id="p_41">20.    It is settled law that in order to prove the case for infringement of
trade mark, the plaintiff has to show that the essential features of the
registered trade mark which has been adopted by the defendant has been
taken out from the plaintiff's registration. Only the marks are to be




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">      CS(OS) No.220/2013                                        Page 9 of 24</span>
 compared by the Court and in case the registration is granted in favour of
the plaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason of the said registration.
</p><p id="p_42">21.     In order to understand that what is a mark, one has to read the
definition      of     the   "mark"     and     the     "trademark"       under
<a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_4">Sections 2(1)(m)</a> and <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_5">2(zb)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 together. In
<a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_6">Section 2(1)(m)</a>, the meaning of the "mark" includes the name and word
and/or any combination thereof. Similarly, as per Section2(zb), the
"trademark" means, if the same is used in relation to goods or services for
the purposes of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of
trade between the goods or services, as the case may be, and some person
having the right as proprietor to use the mark. In the present matter, this
court is also dealing with the case of infringement of trade mark. The
plaintiff No.1 is admittedly the registered proprietor of the trade mark.
</p><p id="p_43">22.     The test of comparison of the marks side by side is not a sound one
since a purchaser will seldom have the two marks actually before him
when he makes his purchase. The eye is not an accurate recorder of visual
detail and that marks are remembered by general impression or by some
significant detail rather than by any photographic recollection of the
whole. While judging the question as to whether the defendant has
infringed the trade mark by colourable imitation of the mark or not, the
Court has to consider the overall impression of the mark in the minds of
general public and not by merely comparing the dissimilarities in the two
marks.
</p><p id="p_44">23.     In order to establish infringement, the main ingredients of
<a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_7">Section 29</a> of the Act are that the plaintiff's mark must be registered under
the Act; the defendant's mark is identical with or deceptively similar to the
registered trade mark; and the defendant's use of the mark is in the course


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">      CS(OS) No.220/2013                                         Page 10 of 24</span>
 of trade in respect of the goods covered by the registered trade mark. The
rival marks are to be compared as a whole. Where two rival marks are
identical, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove further that the use of
defendant's trademark is likely to deceive and cause confusion as the
registration shows the title of the registered proprietor and the things speak
for themselves. In an infringement action, once a mark is used as
indicating commercial origin by the defendant, no amount of added matter
intended to show the true origin of the goods can effect the question. If
Court finds that the defendant's mark is closely, visually and phonetically
similar, even then no further proof is necessary. It is not necessary for the
plaintiff to adduce evidence of actual deception in order to prove the case
of infringement. If packaging of two products is different in an action of
infringement, the same is immaterial. Its validity cannot be challenged in
the infringement proceedings under the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_8">Merchandise Marks

mark Glucovita was with reference to Glucose which was registered in

registration of the trade mark Gluvita in respect of the biscuits
manufactured by them. The argument of the other side was that the mark
was coined as biscuit contains glucose mixed with vitamins. In para 17,
the Apex Court held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "17. We think that the view taken by Desai J., is right. It is well
      known that the question whether the two marks are likely to give
      rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression. It is for
      the court to decide that question. English cases proceeding on the
      English way of pronouncing an English word by Englishmen,
      which it may be stated is not always the same, may not be of
      much assistance in our country in deciding questions of phonetic
      similarity. It cannot be overlooked that the word is an English
      word which to the mass of the Indian people is a foreign word. It
      is well recognized that in deciding a question of similarity
      between two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole.
      So considered, we are inclined to agree with Desai J. that the
      marks with which this case is concerned are similar. Apart from
      the syllable `co' in the appellant's mark, the two marks are
      identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as would enable
      the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark from the
      other."

      point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect
      recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic
      similarity of the two names 'Amritdhara' and 'Lakshmandhara'
      is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must
      consider the overall similarity of the two composite words
      'Amritdhara' and 'Lakshmandhara'. We do not think that the
      learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that no
      Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of
      average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the
      High Court supposed, split the name into its component parts and
      consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider
      meanings of the composite words as `current of nectar' or
      'current of Lakshman'. He would go more by the overall
      structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine

    cases should be taken.

<p id="p_58"> 30.     With regard to validity of the trade mark of the plaintiffs is
concerned, the defendants have not alleged that they have challenged the
registered trade mark of the plaintiffs. There is no material on the record to
show that it is a generic name. We must remember that we are dealing
with the case of registered trade mark where exclusive and statutory rights
are granted. In similar circumstances, in the case of <a href="/doc/1221147/" id="a_17">Automatic Electric
Limited v. R.K. Dhawan</a>, 1999 (19) PTC 81 (Del) the aspect of generic
mark has been extensively discussed in para 12-16 of the order, the same
reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "12. There is no dispute to the fact that the trade mark
      "DIMMERSTAT" of the plaintiff is registered in 'PART-A' as is
      evident from the registration certificate dated 14.2.1957 in class
      '9' for variable auto transformers. The said trade mark exists in
      the registration book from the year 1957. The sale invoices
      placed on record indicate that the plaintiff has been carrying on
      the business of manufacturing and marketing and selling variable
      voltage auto transformers of their manufacture and sale in the
      trade name "DIMMERSTAT", immediately after obtaining
      registration thereto.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      13.      <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_18">Section 28(1)</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_19">Merchandise Marks Act</a>
      provides that the registration of a trade mark in Part-A or Part-B
      of the register shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of
      the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in
      relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is

      trade mark in relation to any goods in respect of which the trade
      mark is registered. Thus, the right of exclusive use of the
      registered trade mark which is conferred under <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_21">Section 28(1)</a> of
      the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_22">Merchandise Marks Act</a> shall stand infringed by

<p id="p_59">      14.      The trade mark "DIMMER DOT" of the defendants is
      admittedly not a registered trade mark although the own

 documents of the defendants placed on record indicates that they
are using the trade mark "DIMMER DOT" as a registered trade
mark in advertisements, invoices and pamphlets. Such act on the
part of the defendants of indicating that their product under the
trade mark "DIMMER DOT" as registered amounts to
commission of offence under <a href="/doc/1056818/" id="a_23">Section 81</a> of the Act. No
application has also been filed by the defendants before the
Registrar for cancellation of the registration of the trade mark
"DIMMERSTAT" adopted by the plaintiff and granted as far
back as 1957. These two are very vital issues and speak volume
against the defendants. Counsel for the defendants, however,
tried to overcome the aforesaid shortcomings by submitting that
the word "DIMMER" being a generic and descriptive word in the
context of auto variable transformers, no trader could monopolise
the use of the said word in relation to autovariable transformers.
The aforesaid submission, therefore, is to be scrutinised in the
context of the facts and circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_60">15.     The trade mark "DIMMERSTAT" is registered without
any disclaimer to the exclusive use of the word "DIMMER"
which is part of the composite trade mark "DIMMERSTAT".
The whole of the trade mark as registered including the word
DIMMER is subject matter of monopolistic right of exclusive use
conferred by the Statute upon the plaintiff under <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_24">Section 28(1)</a>.
The validity of the registration of "DIMMERSTAT" cannot be
challenged by the defendants in a proceeding like this for the
defendants have a remedy to file cancellation of the registration
in an appropriate forum. But, the said remedy has not been
resorted to by the defendants till date. The object or the good
involved herein is a variable auto transformer. The word
"DIMMER" as is understood in the common parlance and as
stated in dictionary is connected with an arrangement for
regulating the supply of the electricity, but, the product here is
not a DIMMER, but, a variable transformer. Auto transformers
have several applications including voltage and current control in
experimental and development work in laboratories and R &amp; D
departments testing and calibration of indicating instruments etc.
Thus variable auto transformers cannot be strictly called a
"DIMMER" and both are not interchangeable for autotransformer
has many other functions. The decision of the Supreme Court in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS) No.220/2013                                      Page 18 of 24</span>
       J.R. Kapoor (supra) is also thus distinguishable on facts, for in
      that case micro-chip technology was the base for both the
      products which is not the case of the goods in hand.
</p>
<p id="p_61">      16.     The defendants got their trade mark "DIMMER DOT"
      registered in Australia. The fact that the defendant itself has
      sought to claim trade proprietary right and monopoly in
      "DIMMER DOT", it does not lie in their mouth to say that the
      word "DIMMER" is a generic expression. User of the word
      "DIMMER" by others cannot be a defence available to the
      defendants, if it could be shown that the same is being used in
      violation of the statutory right of the plaintiff. In this connection,
      reference may be made to the decision of this Court in Prakash
      Roadline Ltd. Vs. Prakash Parcel Service (P) Ltd.; reported in
      1992 (2) ALR 174."
</p>
<p id="p_62">31.     The Supreme Court in similar position in the case of <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_25">Milment Oftho
v. Allergan Inc</a>., 2004 (28) PTC 585 (SC) has taken the opposite view.
The facts of the said case are that the plaintiff filed the suit for
infringement on the basis of the trade mark Ocuflox. The word Ocu was
derived from Ocular and Flox from Ciprofloxacin. The Calcutta High
Court Division Bench (comprising Justice Ruma Pal and Justice Devinder
Kumar Jain) passed the interim orders restraining the defendant from using
the trade mark Ocuflox and also came to the conclusion that there cannot
be two medicinal preparations bearing the same name from different
sources. One must go. The judgment of the Division Bench was
challenged by the defendant in the Supreme Court, who after hearing both
the parties dismissed the appeal by following the principles of Cadila's
case. It was observed that Cadila case holds that exacting judicial scrutiny
is required when a court is dealing with medicinal products.
</p><p id="p_63">32.     Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that unless the trade
mark challenged by the defendant in the written statement is cancelled or

 ratified, it is not the practice to infringe the same in an action for
infringement of trade mark.
</p><p id="p_64">PASSING OFF

</p><p id="p_65">33.     The test of confusion and deception in order to prove the case of
passing off has been very well discussed in the case of Laxmikant V. Patel
vs. Chetanbhat Shah and Another, a judgment delivered by the Supreme
Court, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 65, wherein the Apex Court while
considering a plea of passing off and grant of ad interim injunction held in
no uncertain terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services
under a trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire
a reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by the
Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or services in
the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to the business of
one who has the property in that name. It was held that honesty and fair
play are and ought to be the basic policy in the world of business and when
a person adopts or intends to adopt a name which already belongs to
someone else, it results in confusion, has the propensity of diverting the
customers and clients of someone else to himself and thereby resulting in
injury. It was held that the principles which apply to trade mark are
applicable to trade name also.
</p><p id="p_66">        In para 10 of the aforesaid judgment reads as under:-
         "The law does not permit any one to carry on his business in
         such a way as would persuade the customers or clients in
         believing that his goods or services belonging to someone else
         are his or are associated therewith. It does not matter whether
         the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise. The
         reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to
         be, the basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when
         a person adopts or intends to adopt a name in connection with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">      CS(OS) No.220/2013                                        Page 20 of 24</span>
           his business or services which already belongs to someone else
          it results in confusion and has propensity of diverting the
          customers and clients of someone else to himself and thereby
          resulting in injury.
</p><p id="p_67">         In this case, the Apex Court further observed that:
          Where there is probability of confusion in business, an
          injunction will be granted even though the defendants adopted
          the name innocently."
</p><p id="p_68">34.      In view of settled law, a case of passing off is made by the
plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_69">35.      Common to the Trade
         The defendants in the present case even prima facie not able to
establish that the third parties are actually using the similar trade marks as
alleged in the written statement. Nothing has come out of record to show
that any third party has actually used the DROTIN prior to the plaintiffs. A
mere plea, thus raised is not enough as per settled law.
</p><p id="p_70">36.      Law of publici juris has been discussed in various cases and the
Courts have given their respective findings to the effect that a party who
has taken the defence of publici juris has to prove his case. The same has
been dealt with by this Court and Calcutta High Court in the following
cases:

<p id="p_71">a)       <a href="/doc/162093858/" id="a_26">In Rolex Sa v. Alex Jewellery Pvt. Ltd. and Ors</a>., 2009 (41) PTC

         any, of a large number of other persons using the word ROLEX
         as claimed by the defendant. At this stage, this plea will be
         examined believing the same to be true. In my view, the same
         would be immaterial. Firstly, nothing has been shown that any
         of the said users has any significant presence. Secondly, it is

        Shaving Products Ltd. Vs Gift Pack that merely because the
       plaintiff who is otherwise found entitled to the interim
       injunction is shown to have not taken any step against other
       infringers is no ground to deny relief to the plaintiff. It cannot
       also be said that the plaintiff's trademark has lost its
       distinctiveness for the said reason. The reply affidavit of the
       plaintiff lists the orders of the Trade Mark Registry from 1964
       to 2000, where plaintiff's mark has been protected inter alia for
       reason of having great reputation. It also shows that the plaintiff
       has been enforcing its rights. Though the list filed by defendant
       No. 1 in this regard is long but a perusal thereof shows a
       number of applicants to have abandoned or withdrawn their
       applications. This is a vast country. Mere long list of
       applicants/registrants of mark, without any extensive use of the
       mark, cannot dent the distinctive character or repute of the
       mark.

(9) PTC 14 it has been held as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       50. ....To establish the plea of common use, the use by other
       persons should be shown to be substantial. In the present case,
       there is no evidence regarding the extent of the trade carried on
       by the alleged infringers or their respective position in the trade.
       If the proprietor of the mark is expected to pursue each and
       every insignificant infringer to save his mark, the business will
       come to a standstill. Because there may be occasion when the
       malicious persons, just to harass the proprietor may use his
       mark by way of pinpricks.... The mere use of the name is
       irrelevant because a registered proprietor is not expected to go
       on filing suits or proceedings against infringers who are of no
       consequence... Mere delay in taking action against the
       infringers is not sufficient to hold that the registered proprietor
       has lost the mark intentionally unless it is positively proved that
       delay was due to intentional abandonment of the right over the
       registered mark. This court is inclined to accept the submissions
       of the respondent No. 1 on this point...The respondent No. 1 did
       not lose its mark by not proceeding against insignificant
       infringers...

      mark prior in point of time to user by the appellant is irrelevant in
