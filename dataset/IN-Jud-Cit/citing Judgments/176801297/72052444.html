to restrain the defendants from infringing the plaintiffs‟ right in the

restrained   the    defendants   from   using   the   trademark    „GOENKA




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                 Page 1 of 16</span>
 INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL‟ or any other mark which is deceptively
similar to the registered trademark of the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_5">4.    IA No.4583/2018       has been filed by the defendants under Order 39
Rule 4 CPC seeking vacation of the said interim order dated 13.03.2018. On
17.04.2018, this court had partly modified the stay order on the plea of the
learned counsel for the defendants who had submitted that without prejudice
to the defendants‟ rights and contentions, the defendants would apply for
change of name with CBSE. However, until CBSE takes action on the
request of the defendants, it was pleaded that the defendants may be
permitted to continue to take admission in their school in the old name. The
defendants had submitted that they would not advertise the old name of their
school other than in the city of Durgapur. The said plea of the defendant was
accepted and the interim order was partly modified to that extent.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    In the plaint the case of the plaintiff is that in 1994 G.D. Goenka
Group under the leadership of plaintiff No. 1-Mr.Anjani Kumar Goenka set
up its first flagship school „G.D.Goenka Public School‟ in Vasant Kunj, New
Delhi, which currently boasts 2250 students. It is pleaded that with 24 years
of excellence in the field of education, the school has more than 50 branches
in India and is recognized by the public at large for the quality of education
offered. Plaintiff No. 2 Company is said to be engaged in the field of
imparting education and uses the brand name „G.D. GOENKA‟ and other
GOENKA marks with combination of words such as INTERNATIONAL,
GLOBAL, WORLD, LA PETITE, etc. It is pleaded that G.D. Goenka
Schools are synonymous with excellent standards of education and
amenities. The plaintiffs have been using the mark GOENKA and G.D.
GOENKA since 1994 in the field of education continuously and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                Page 2 of 16</span>
 uninterruptedly for over two decades. It is also stated that the plaintiffs‟ prior
adoption, extensive use and promotion of the said trade mark „G.D.
GOENKA‟, „GOENKA‟ „GOENKA SCHOOL‟ and other GONEKA marks
used in combination of words INTERNATIONAL, GLOBAL, WORLD,
LA PETITE, have led to a secondary meaning being attached to the marks
GD GOENKA and GOENKA which is solely associated with the plaintiffs.
Para 9 of the plaint gives a list of trademarks registered under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade
Marks Act</a>, 1999 under Classes 16, 35, 41,42, 43 and 44. It is pleaded that
the schools of G.D.GOENKA have spread over 64 different locations in the
country including in Bengal. The advertisement expenditure for the last five
years are also stated in para 14 of the plaint. In 2016-17 a sum of
Rs.1,49,19,025/- was spent on education. Revenue generated in the year
2016-17 is said to be Rs. 27.79 crores.
</p><p id="p_7">6.     Defendant No. 1-Om Education Trust started operating a school by the
name of GOENKA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL in Durgapur, West
Bengal. In January 2018, it is stated that the plaintiffs received information
that   the    defendant     is   operating    a    school    called     GOENKA
INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL and had advertised the same on an in-flight
magazine of Indigo Airlines. It is pleaded that the defendant‟s advertisement
uses the infringing mark GOENKA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL which is
identical/deceptively similar to the registered mark of the plaintiffs
GOENKA, GD GOENKA, GOENKA SCHOOL and other Goenka marks. It
is also stated that the defendants are carrying on services which are identical
to the services of the plaintiffs being in the field of providing education,
training, cultural activities, etc. It is stated that the plaintiffs‟ are the prior
user of the registered mark GOENKA, etc. and have been using the same




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                     Page 3 of 16</span>
 continuous and uninterruptedly since 1994. It is further pleaded that the
defendants have fraudulently adopted the impugned mark so as to
deliberately mislead and confuse the general public into believing that the
defendants‟ school is somehow associated with the plaintiffs. It is also
pleaded that the use of GOENKA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL by the
defendant for its school is structurally, phonetically and conceptually similar
to the marks of the plaintiffs including GD GOENKA PUBLIC SCHOOL.
Hence the present suit.
</p><p id="p_8">7.    The defendants in their written statement have pointed out that
defendant No.2-GOENKA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL is run by
defendant No.1-Om Education Trust. The trustees are Mr.Rajeev Goenka,
Ms. Poonam Goenka and Mr.Rohit Sahni. The trust was created on
22.05.2014. It is pleaded that the Setllor and the trustees in the year 2014
honestly and bonafidely adopted the mark „GOENKA INTERNATIONAL
SCHOOL‟ as a trade mark which is the surname of the Setllor and the two
trustees. It is pleaded that the trust has been using the mark „GOENKA
INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL‟ bonafidely since 2014. Defendant No.1 is
said to have also applied for trade mark registration of the distinctive
„GOENKA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL (Label)‟. The application was
made on 03.11.2014. Defendant No.2-„GOENKA INTERNATIONAL
SCHOOL‟ has been functioning since 07.04.2015. Reliance is placed on
<a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_2">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act to claim that it protects the proprietor of a
trade mark for the bona fide use of its own name/surname. It is pleaded that
the mark „GOENKA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL‟ is protected under
<a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_3">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act. It is further stated that the defendants are
based in Durgapur, West Bengal. The plaintiffs have no school in the city of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                 Page 4 of 16</span>
 Durgapur, West Bengal. Therefore, the geographic areas of use of the
respective marks of the defendants and plaintiffs are different and distinct
and likelihood of confusion does not arise. It is further stated that
„GOENKA‟ is a common surname and lacks distinctiveness. It is also stated
that „GOENKA‟ is common to trade and is publici juris. A list of 14
institutions is given which are said to be using the phrase „Goenka College‟,
„Goenka School‟, etc. Hence, it is pleaded that the mark/name „GOENKA‟
has become publici juris and the suit is liable to be dismissed. It has also
been pleaded that the plaintiffs have deliberately and malafidely concealed
the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in <a href="/doc/152072993/" id="a_4">Goenka Institute of
Education and Research vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka &amp; Anr</a>., 2009 (40) PTC
393 wherein on similar facts and circumstances of the case, the plaintiff was
declined injunction against the defendant of that case who was also using
„GOENKA‟. It is also pleaded that the plaintiffs have never used the mark
„GOENKA‟ per se.
</p><p id="p_9">8.    I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_10">9.    Learned senior counsel appearing for the plaintiffs has argued
vehemently reiterating the contentions stated in the plaint. He has urged that
the plaintiffs have started use of the mark „GOENKA‟ and „GD GOENKA‟
in the field of education in 1994 and has been continuously and
uninterruptedly using it for two decades. The trademarks of the plaintiffs are
duly registered. The plaintiffs have a Pan India presence and having
excellence in running schools in Tier 1 cities and have gone into smaller
towns. Majority of these schools are operated by third party entities under a
franchise agreement between the plaintiff and such third parties. A list of 64
such schools has been given which are said to be functioning in Delhi,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                Page 5 of 16</span>
 Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Amritsar, Srinagar, Udaipur, Lucknow, Raipur, etc.
Schools are said to be coming up in Raipur, Rudrapur, Aurangabad, etc. It is
pleaded that the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in <a href="/doc/152072993/" id="a_5">Goenka
Institute of Education and Research vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka &amp; Anr</a>.
(supra) has no application to the facts of the present case. In that case on the
facts, the Division Bench had found that the adoption of the word
„GONEKA‟ in the name of the institution of the appellant/defendant was
honest as the trust deed in question of the defendant was of 1990, namely,
before G.D.GOENKA PUBLIC SCHOOL started in 1994. The trustees had
their surname „Goenka‟. The Institution „Mohini Devi Goenka Mahila
Mahavidyalaya‟ was started in 1995 in Rajasthan. Hence, in those facts the
court concluded that the use of the word „Goenka‟ is honest and bona fide.
Hence, it is pleaded that the said judgment has no application to this case. In
the present case it is pleaded that the user of the defendant is not bona fide
and has commenced only in 2015-16. Reliance is placed on the judgment of
this court in the case of <a href="/doc/48216667/" id="a_6">Sh. Pankaj Goel vs. Dabur India Ltd</a>., 2008 (38)
PTC 49(Del.) and the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in
Procter &amp; Gamble Manufacturing (Tianjin) Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs. Anchor
Health &amp; Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd., (2014) 211 DLT 466.
</p><p id="p_11">10.   Learned counsel for the defendants has strongly urged as follows:-
</p><p id="p_12">(i)   There is gross suppression of material facts by the plaintiffs as they
did not disclose the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in the case
of the plaintiff where injunction was declined to the plaintiff on similar facts
i.e. <a href="/doc/152072993/" id="a_7">Goenka Institute of Education and Research vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka &amp;
Anr</a>. (supra). Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                  Page 6 of 16</span>
 <a href="/doc/172073149/" id="a_8">Kishore Samrite vs. State of U.P. &amp; Ors</a>., (2013) 2 SCC 398 to plead that
the act of the plaintiff is an abuse of the process of the court.
</p><p id="p_13">(ii)     It is pleaded that the defendant is running its school way off in
Durgapur where the plaintiffs have no major presence. They have only one
school in Bengal in Siliguri by the name of „GD GOENKA PUBLIC
SCHOOL‟. Hence, the user by the defendants does not harm the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_14">(iii)    It is also pleaded relying upon Section 35 of the Trademarks Act that
the usage and adoption of the trademark by the defendant is protected under
the said provision.
</p><p id="p_15">(iv)     It is also pleaded that the word GOENKA is publici juris. Hence, no
injunction order can be passed against the defendant.
</p><p id="p_16">(v)      Reliance is also placed upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Wander Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. Antox India (P) Ltd., 1991 PTC(11)1 to plead that
no injunction be granted.
</p><p id="p_17">11.      I may at the outset refer to the judgment of the Division Bench of this
court in <a href="/doc/48216667/" id="a_9">Sh. Pankaj Goel vs. Dabur India Ltd</a>.(supra). That was a case in
which the plaintiff was using the mark „HAJMOLA‟ and the defendant was
using the mark „RASMOLA‟ for the same product. The court noted the test
to be applied to see whether there is a similarity in the two trademarks. The
court held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "19. The Supreme Court in the case of AMRITDHARA
        PHARMACY referred to hereinabove, held the mark
        AMRITDHARA to be deceptively similar to the mark
        LAXMANDHARA. The Apex Court in the said Judgment further
        stipulated that the issue was to be examined by applying the test of
        an unwary purchaser having average intelligence and imperfect
        recollection. The Supreme Court in the said case held that even




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                   Page 7 of 16</span>
       though a critical comparison of the two names may disclose some
      points of differences, yet an unwary purchaser of average
      intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived by the
      overall similarity of the two products.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      20. We find in the present case the Appellant's and Respondent/
      Plaintiff's mark are not only similar but their products are identical
      and are purchased by the same class of customers and the said
      goods are sold through the same trading channel. In our view the
      trinity of factors makes for a case for confusion and consequently
      for passing off. Appellant's subsequent adoption of a similar mark
      seems prima facie dishonest and no amount of user can cure it. In
      case the injunction as granted by this Court is not continued, the use
      of the same mark by the Appellant is likely to deceive the public at
      large.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      21. In B.K. Engineering Complaint vs. U.B.H.I. Enterprises
      (Registered) reported in AIR 1985 Delhi 210, a Division Bench
      of this Court has held that trading must not only be honest but must
      not even unintentionally be unfair. <a href="/doc/185380767/" id="a_10">In Laxmikant V. Patel</a> vs.
      Chetan Bhat Shah reported in 2002 (24) PTC 1 (SC), the Apex
      Court has held that where there is probability even in business, an
      injunction will be granted even though the defendants adopted the
      name innocently."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">The Court further held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_19">       "23. ..... we are of the view that use of similar marks by a third
       party cannot be a defence to an illegal act of passing off. ...."
</p>
<p id="p_20">12.    Hence, the accepted test for seeing as to whether the trade mark of the
plaintiffs is being violated is the test of an unwary purchaser having average
intelligence and imperfect recollection. The issue would be as to whether an
unwary purchaser with an average intelligence and imperfect recollection
would be deceived by overall similarity of the two products. In the present
case the registered marks of the plaintiffs are GD Goenka Worlds Institute,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                  Page 8 of 16</span>
 Goenka, Goenka School and GD Goenka Public School, etc. The defendant
is running its school by the name of GOENKA INTERNATIONAL
SCHOOL. The defendant has started running the school from the academic
year 2015-16. Admittedly, CBSE has granted affiliation to the school in
2016 only. In contrast, the plaintiffs have been using the said mark since
1994. Clearly an unwary parent/student of average intelligence and imperfect
recollection can be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names. Both
the plaintiff and defendant are in the same field. This is bound to create
confusion. Hence, unless injunction granted is confirmed the confusion
would continue.
</p><p id="p_21">13.    I may now deal with the contentions of learned counsel for the
defendant. The defendants have strongly pleaded that there is gross
suppression on the part of the plaintiffs in not mentioning about the
judgment of the Division Bench of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/152072993/" id="a_11">Goenka Institute
of Education and Research vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka &amp; Arn</a>. (supra). This
court in the said judgment had noted as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "...
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (vi)     We may incidentally state that the aforesaid ratio of
      Division Bench judgment of this court in the Montari case
      answers one of the contentions raised by the counsel for the
      appellant that the appellant is entitled to use the name "Goenka"
      by virtue of Section 35 of the Trademark Act, 1999. Clearly, the
      arguments of learned counsel for the appellant are not well
      founded because the defence under Section 35 will only apply to
      a full name and that also by a natural person and not by a legal
      entity which can choose a separate name. Also, once
      distinctiveness is achieved or secondary meaning acquired with
      respect to a surname, then, another person cannot use that
      surname for an artificial person or entity. The appellant,
      therefore, only on the strength of Section 35 cannot successfully




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                Page 9 of 16</span>
       contend that it is entitled as of right to use the name "Goenka"
      merely because it happens to be the surname of its original and
      present trustees. Of course, nothing turns strictly on this issue in
      the facts and circumstances of this case, so far as the relief with
      respect to infringement or passing off or prior user issue is
      concerned because, we have otherwise held that appellant is an
      honest concurrent user and we have given later in this judgment
      sufficient directions for bringing about distinction in both the
      trademarks so that there is no confusion in the minds of the
      public.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      xxx

      On the aspect of publici juris however we do not want in any
      manner to pronounce one way or the other because we do not
      think that on the strength of the documents as available at the
      present stage, it can be authoritatively said that the word
      "Goenka" has become publici juris. It will be open to the
      appellant to establish its case at the trial and accordingly, urge at
      the time of final arguments its contention with regard to the word
      "Goenka" having become publici juris. At this stage, one aspect
      of the judgment of the learned Single Judge needs mention where
      the learned Single Judge seems to hold that user of third person is
      not relevant to the issue of ownership of a plaintiff. The
      impugned judgment is incorrect to the extent it holds that user by
      the third party of a trademark prior to the user claimed by the
      plaintiff is not relevant. In fact, in such a case, prior user by third
      parties of the trademark in certain facts and circumstances of a
      case, may throw considerable light on, the existence or not, of
      exclusive ownership claim of a plaintiff/respondent with respect
      to a trademark."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">14.    The observations of the Division Bench in the above judgment do not
help or support the case of the defendants. That was a case as noted above
where the defendant‟s user of the word GOENKA was prior to that of the
plaintiffs‟, namely, of the year 1990 whereas the plaintiffs claim user only




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                     Page 10 of 16</span>
 since 1994. It is clear from the above that the injunction was declined to the
plaintiff in that case on account of the facts and circumstances of that case.
</p><p id="p_23">15.   In my opinion, the plaintiff was obliged to disclose only material facts
while filing the present suit. Not every fact having some remote connection
with the rights of the plaintiff needs to be mentioned. Hence, merely because
no reference was made in the Plaint to the judgment of the Division Bench in
the case of <a href="/doc/152072993/" id="a_12">Goenka Institute of Education and Research vs. Anjani Kumar
Goenka &amp;Anr</a>. (supra) cannot be said to lead to a conclusion that there was
suppression of any material facts.
</p><p id="p_24">16.   Reference in this context may be had to the judgment of the Division
Bench of this Court in Nirbhai singh vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.,
185(2011) DLT 319 where this court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "16... In this context, we may refer with profit to the definition of the
      word „suppression‟ from the Law Lexicon of P.Ramanatha Aiyar
      which reads thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             Where there is an obligation to speak a failure to speak will
      constitute „suppression of a fact‟ but where there is no obligation to
      speak silence cannot be termed „suppression".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      17. In Black‟s Law Dictionary, „suppressio veri‟ has been defined
      thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      Suppression or concealment of the truth. It is a rule of equity, as well
      as of law, that a suppression very is equivalent to a suggestion fasli;
      and where either the suppression of the truth or the suggestion of what
      is false can be proved, in a fact material to the contract, the party
      injured may have relief against the contract."</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">      Hence in my opinion, the plaintiff cannot be said to be guilty of
suppression of material facts.
</p><p id="p_26">17.   I may next deal with the contention raised by learned counsel for the
defendant placing reliance on Section 35 of the Trademarks Act.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(COMM) 725/2018                                                  Page 11 of 16</span>
<p id="p_27"> 18.    <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_13">Sections 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      "35. Saving for use of name, address or description of goods or
      services.--Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a
      registered user of a registered trade mark to interfere with any bona
      fide use by a person of his own name or that of his place of
      business, or of the name, or of the name of the place of business, of
      any of his predecessors in business, or the use by any person of any
      bona fide description of the character or quality of his goods or
      services."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">19.    Hence, to seek protection under <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_14">Section 35</a>, the defendant has to
satisfy the court about the bona fide use or bona fide adoption of the said
mark of its own name. On the facts of this case, I am unable to come to a
conclusion that the use of the mark GOENKA INTERNATIONAL
SCHOOL by the defendant is a bona fide usage. The name of the
defendant‟s trust is OM Education Trust. Hence, „GOENKA‟ is not part of
the name of the Trust. The school has effectively commenced in January
2016. In contrast, the plaintiffs have been using the said GOENKA with its
variants in the same field of school education since 1994. The trademarks of
the plaintiff are registered. The plaintiffs have a PAN India presence with 64
schools. Last years revenue generated was to the tune of Rs.27.79 crores.
Prima facie, it does not appear that the user of the mark by the defendants is
bona fide.

         "It is an elementary rule that a party litigant cannot be
         permitted to assume inconsistent positions in Court, to
         play fast and loose, to blow hot and cold, to approbate
         and reprobate, to the detriment of his opponent. This
         wholesome doctrine applies not only to the successive
         stages of the same suit, but also to another suit than the
         one in which the position was taken up, provided that
         the second suit grows out of the judgment in the first."

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">      13. Reference may also be had to the judgment of this Court in
      the case of <a href="/doc/1221147/" id="a_20">Automatic Electric vs. R.K.Dhawan</a>, (supra). That
      was a case which pertained to a suit for injunction filed by the
      plaintiff for its registered trademark DIMMERSTAT. The
      defendant in that case is said to have adopted the trademark
      DIMMER DOT. The defendants in that case took the stand in the
      said matter that the word DIMMER being a generic word is
      incapable of serving a trademark function. It was urged that the
      said word signifies an auto variable transformer and no trader
      could monopolize its use. The defendants in that case had got
      their trademark DIMMER DOT registered in Australia. In those
      facts this Court did not accept the contention of the defendant in

      this Court held as follows:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">           "16. The defendants got their trade mark "DIMMER
           DOT" registered in Australia. The fact that the
           defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary
           right and monopoly in "DIMMER DOT", it does not
           lie in their mouth to say that the word "DIMMER" is a
           generic expression."

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      14. In view of the said legal position I do not wish to go into the
      submission of the defendant as to whether the word
      "ALLROUND" or "ALLROUND PROTECTION" is a generic
      word. It clearly does not lie for the defendant to raise the said
      submission in the given facts. Their submission about the mark
      being generic has to be rejected."

<p id="p_31">22.    This court in Procter &amp; Gamble Manufacturing (Tianjin) Co. Ltd. &amp;
ors. Vs. Anchor Health &amp; Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. (supra) has already held
that where the defendants have themselves applied for registration of the
mark „All Rounder‟ , it is not permissible for such a defendant to approbate
and reprobate. A litigant cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold at
successive stages of the same litigation or different litigations. The
defendants who have themselves made an application for registration of the
label with the distinctive phrase „GOENKA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL‟
cannot turn around and plead that the word GOENKA is publici juris. There
is no merit in the said plea.

 continues the interim order a loss would be caused to the defendants. The
Supreme Court in the above judgment stated as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">          "9. Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction is at
          a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the
          plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain
          and remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on
          evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well settled
          principles of administration of this form of interlocutory remedy
          which is both temporary and discretionary. The object of the
          interlocutory injunction, it is stated
          "...is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his rights
          for which he could not adequately be compensated in damages
          recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his
          favour at the trial. The need for such protection must be weighed
          against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected
          against injury resulting from his having been prevented from
          exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be
          adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against
          another and determine where the „balance of convenience‟ lies."
          The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the
          rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie. The court also,
          in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his
          legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts
          into the scales, as a relevant consideration whether the defendant
          has yet to commence his enterprise or whether he has already been
          doing so in which latter case considerations somewhat different
          from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to
          commence his enterprise, are attracted."

<p id="p_33">24.    In my opinion, this judgment does not help the defendant in the facts
of this case.
</p><p id="p_34">25.    In view of the above, there is no merit in the contentions of the
defendants. In my opinion, the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case.
Balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiffs.
