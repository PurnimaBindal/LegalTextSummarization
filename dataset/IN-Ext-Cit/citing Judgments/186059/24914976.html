Per: Hon'ble Rajiv Sharma, J

                  This appeal is instituted against the judgment
and order dated 31.01.2011, rendered by learned Sessions
Judge, Pithoragarh in Sessions Trial No.05 of 2010,
whereby the accused namely Ram Singh and Janki Devi,
who were charged with and tried for the offences under
<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_2">201</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_3">120-B</a> of IPC, were acquitted. The
accused Darvan Singh was convicted and sentenced to
undergo life imprisonment under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a> of IPC and to
pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- and in default of payment of fine
to undergo simple imprisonment for two years. The accused
namely Darvan Singh, who was also charged with and tried
for the offences under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">Section 120-B</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_6">201</a> of IPC, was
acquitted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.                The case of the prosecution, in a nutshell, is that
Ram Singh, S/o Ganga Singh lodged a report with Nayab
Tehsildar Gangolihat on 01.11.2009. According to the
averments contained in the report, his daughter Hema Devi
was married to Darvan Singh, S/o Ram Singh. On
17.10.2009, his daughter was beaten by her husband and
she was ousted from the house. Hema Devi lodged a report
on 23.10.2009 with the District Magistrate, Pithoragarh.
Janki Devi (mother-in-law) of Hema Devi came to his house
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>


to take his daughter back, but his daughter was scared.
She did not go with her mother-in-law. On 27.10.2009,
Janki Devi again came to village Bungli with criminal
intention   and   took   his   daughter   after   winning   her
confidence. His daughter was killed by her mother-in-law
Janki Devi, husband Darvan Singh and father-in-law Ram
Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.          It is further averred in the FIR that earlier, on
07.01.2000, his daughter had lodged a report against her
father-in-law and mother-in-law. However, a compromise
took place between them.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.          The FIR was accordingly lodged.       There is no
inordinate delay in lodging the FIR. The incident happened
on 29.10.2009 and the FIR was lodged on 30.10.2009. The
inquest report was prepared. The body was sent for
postmortem examination. The postmortem was conducted
by Dr. M.S. Rajwar on 01.11.2009. The investigation was
completed and the challan was put up after completing all
the codal formalities.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.          The prosecution has examined as many as twelve
witnesses in its support. The statements of the accused
were recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. They denied the
case of the prosecution. The appellant was convicted and
sentenced, as noticed hereinabove. Hence, the present
criminal jail appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.          Learned Amicus Curiae for the appellant has
vehemently argued that the prosecution has failed to prove
its case.    Learned counsel on behalf of the State has
supported the judgment and order dated 31.01.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.          We have heard learned counsel for both the
parties and perused the judgment and record carefully.

<p id="p_9">8.          PW1 Ram Singh, the father of the deceased has
deposed that his daughter was married with the accused
Darvan Singh in the year 1999. He had given dowry to his
daughter as per his capacity. His daughter has lodged the
report against the accused on 07.01.2000. She again
submitted       the   report    to   the   District   Magistrate   on
20.05.2000 naming the accused. His daughter was beaten
up by the accused on 17.10.2009. Hema Devi came to her
parental house along with her children. A report was lodged
by Hema Devi to District Magistrate, Pithoragarh on
23.10.2009. On 25.10.2009, Janki Devi (mother-in-law of
his daughter) came to his house to take Hema Devi back,
however, his daughter being scared, refused to go with her
mother-in-law.        The      mother-in-law    of    his   daughter
persuaded Hema Devi to go to her matrimonial house on
27.10.2009. On 29.10.2009, he came to know that his
daughter was murdered.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.          PW2       Dr.   M.C. Rajwar, has          conducted the
postmortem examination. He noticed the following ante
mortem injuries on the body of Hema Devi:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               (i) 2X2cm. L.W. +nt 2cm about the L+ eye brown,

<p id="p_11">10.       According to postmortem report, the deceased
died due to subdural hematoma + rt. Frontal- rt. Parietal
region scalp &amp; hemorrhagic shock due to ante mortem
injuries. The time lapse between death and postmortem
was 70-84 hours.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.       PW3 Pooran Singh testified that on 28.10.2009,
he had gone to village Pali along with his horses. When he
was coming back to his village Tharadi via Sugdi on
29.10.2009, deceased Hema Devi met him at a distance of
10-15 meters from her house.      He wished her. Then she
started weeping. He has admitted in his cross-examination
that Darvan Singh was residing in the house situated below
the road and accused Ram Singh was residing in the
separate house along with his wife.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.       PW4 Heera Singh is the material witness. He has
deposed that on 29.10.2009, he was posted as a ward boy
in P.H.C. Chaurpal. On that day, the doctor was on leave.
Accused Darvan Singh came to him at 7-7:30 PM and told
him that his wife Hema Devi has received injuries. He went
to village Sugdi along with accused Darvan Singh at about
8:00 PM. He noticed that Hema Devi was lying on the cot
inside the house. He examined her pulse and declared her
dead. He noticed the injuries on the face of the deceased. In
his cross-examination, he stated that on the same day i.e.
29.10.2009, accused Ram Singh came to him in the
hospital in the morning and asked him that his wife was ill
and requested him to administer glucose to her.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.       PW5 Kedar Singh has deposed that he knew the
accused and the deceased. On 27.10.2009, accused Janki
Devi came to village Bungli to take back the deceased Hema
Devi. Ram Singh (the father of the deceased) told him that
Darvan Singh used to beat his daughter. Her mother-in-law
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               5</span>


came to take her back. She also assured that nobody would
give beatings to Hema Devi.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.       PW6 Smt. Geeta Devi testified that she knew the
accused Ram Singh, Darvan Singh and Janki Devi. The
accused came to her house and asked her husband to give
his mobile phone. Her husband handed over the mobile
phone to the accused Darvan Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.       PW7 Mohan Singh is the brother of the deceased
Hema Devi. According to him, on 17.10.2009, his sister
Hema    Devi   was   beaten   and   thrown   out   from   her
matrimonial house. She came back to her parental house.
On 23.10.2009, she lodged a report with the District
Magistrate, Pithoragarh against her husband, father-in-law
and mother-in-law. On 27.10.2009, Janki Devi came to his
house and took his sister along with her. She stated that
Darvan Singh had changed his attitude. She assured her in
the presence of PW5 Kedar Singh that she will be treated
properly. His sister went back. On 30.10.2009 at about
5:00 PM, accused Darvan Singh told him that his sister has
died.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.       PW8 Narayan Singh is also the brother of the
deceased Hema Devi. He resides at Khatima along with his
family. On 30.10.2009, his younger brother Mohan singh
called him on phone and told him that his brother-in-law
has killed his sister. He also reiterated that his sister Hema
Devi was thrown out from her matrimonial house by the
accused Darvan Singh. Accused Janki Devi came to his
village Bungli to call the victim but she refused to go.
Accused Janki Devi again came back on 27.10.2009. His
sister went back with her mother-in-law.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.       PW10 Km. Kavita is the daughter of the deceased
Hema Devi. She has deposed that her mother died nine
months back. She noticed her mother lying dead on the cot.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>


<p id="p_19">She did not see any blood on the body of her mother. She
did not know how she died. She went to the school in the
morning and came back in the evening. She called her
father. Her father called the doctor, who declared her
mother dead. She was declared hostile. She was confronted
with her statement recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_8">Section 161</a> of Cr.P.C.
She replied that her statement was not recorded by Nayab
Tehsildar.
</p>
<p id="p_20">18.          PW11 S.S.I. Umesh Ram Arya was the second
I.O. of the case. He arrested the accused Janki Devi on
27.12.2009 and recorded her statement.
</p>
<p id="p_21">19.          PW12   Bhuwan           Chandra     Pandey,   Nayab
Tehsildar, was the first I.O. of the case. He has admitted in
his cross-examination that on 01.11.2009 he received a
written report from Ram Singh, S/o Ganga Singh. He also
received a report from the office of S.D.M. which was
written by the deceased Hema Devi against her husband
Darvan Singh and which was addressed to the District
Magistrate, Pithoragarh. On 30.10.2009, accused Ram
Singh (father-in-law) of the deceased had informed about
the death of his daughter-in-law. The body was taken into
possession. He noticed injuries on the body of the deceased
Hema Devi. He got the postmortem conducted. He also
recorded the statement of witnesses Jagat Singh, Narayan
Singh and Debuli Devi. He recorded the statement of Km.
Kavita on 10.11.2009. He arrested accused Darvan Singh
on 15.11.2009. He also recorded the statement of Pitamber
Dutt on 27.11.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_22">20.          What emerges from the facts, as enumerated
hereinabove is that the marriage of the appellant Darvan
Singh and Hema Devi was solemnized in the year 1999.
Hema Devi has lodged a report against her husband in the
year   2000.    However,   the       matter    was   compromised.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                7</span>


<p id="p_23">Thereafter, on 17.10.2009, appellant Darvan Singh has
given beatings to Hema Devi.       Hema Devi came back to her
parental house. The mother-in-law came on 25.10.2009 to
bring her daughter-in-law back. Hema Devi refused to go
back with her. On 27.10.2009, again Janki Devi persuaded
Hema Devi to go with her. Hema Devi was killed on
29.10.2009. The FIR was lodged by PW1 Ram Singh, the
father of the deceased. The postmortem was conducted by
PW2 Dr. M.C. Rajwar.
</p>
<p id="p_24">21.       Learned Amicus Curiae appearing on behalf of
the appellant has vehemently argued that Hema Devi was
murdered by the villagers due to enmity. However, the
Amicus Curiae could not point out any evidence to this
effect. Moreover, no suspected villager, behind the murder
of his wife, has been named by the accused. The father of
the appellant has also informed PW12 Bhuwan Chandra
Pandey, Nayab Tehsildar about the death of Hema Devi on
30.10.2009. There is no murmur that Hema Devi was killed
by the co-villagers due to enmity. In case, Hema Devi was
killed by the villagers, the father-in-law of the deceased was
supposed to mention this fact in his report.
</p>
<p id="p_25">22.       In has come on record that PW3 Pooran Singh
has seen the deceased on 29.10.2009. It has come in the
statements of PW5 Kedar Singh, PW7 Mohan Singh and
PW8 Narayan Singh that the appellant's mother had come
twice to the parental house of Hema Devi on 25.10.2009
and 27.10.2009. Hema Devi refused to go with her mother-
in-law on 25.10.2009 but she was persuaded to come back
on 27.10.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_26">23.       PW4 Heera Singh has deposed that he was
informed by the appellant that his wife has received
injuries. He noticed injuries on the face of the deceased. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              8</span>


examined her pulse but there was no response. She was
declared dead.
</p>
<p id="p_27">24.       Hema Devi was seen alive by PW10 Km. Kavita in
the morning in the house of accused. She deposed that she
left for school in the morning and came in the evening. She
saw her mother lying dead on the cot. She informed her
father. Her father called the doctor. She was 9 years old at
the time of incident and 12 years old when her statement
was recorded. Thus, the possibility of her being tutored and
prompted cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_28">25.       Hema Devi was living with her husband along
with the children. It was for the appellant to explain the
circumstances under which she died in his house. It has
come on the record that in the year 2000, Hema Devi has
lodged a report against her husband. The report was also
lodged by Hema Devi against her husband on 23.10.2009.
This fact has been admitted by PW12 Bhuwan Chandra
Pandey.
</p>
<p id="p_29">26.       The conduct of accused-husband in this case
was unnatural and unreasonable. He disappeared from the
scene w.e.f. 29.10.2009. He did not attend the funeral of
his wife. He was arrested on 15.11.2009. In case, he was
innocent, he would not have left his house and absconded.
The accused after killing his wife has cleaned her wounds
and changed her clothes. There is no evidence on record
that the accused has any enmity with co-villagers. Even the
father of the appellant-accused Darvan Singh has not
stated in his report made to the Nayab Tehsildar that his
daughter-in-law was killed by the villagers due to some
enmity.
</p>
<p id="p_30">27.       Their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
2010 (1) SCC 199, in the case of "<a href="/doc/1672414/" id="a_9">Jayabalan vs. Union
Territory of Pondicherry</a>", have held that the conduct of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   9</span>


appellant in scaling up the bathroom wall instead of
opening the bolt and coming out, and leaving for the
hospital for his own treatment without telling anyone as to
what   had     actually      happened,        is    unnatural        and
unreasonable conduct. At the hospital, the appellant
informed the doctor that he had suffered the injuries while
lighting the stove, instead of telling that he had suffered
those injuries while trying to save his wife from burning.
Their Lordships have held as under: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                  "30. The conduct of the appellant in scaling up the
          bathroom wall instead of opening the bolt and coming out,
          and leaving for the hospital for his own treatment without
          telling anyone as to what had actually happened, is unnatural
          and unreasonable conduct. The stand of the appellant that he
          attempted to save the deceased from burning is untenable in
          view of the fact that after coming out from the bathroom by
          scaling the wall, the appellant immediately proceeded to the
          hospital without even making an endeavour to rescue the
          deceased or render help to the people who had gathered there
          at his house to facilitate her rescue.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">          31. At the hospital, the appellant informed the doctor that he
          had suffered the injuries while lighting the stove, instead of
          telling that he had suffered those injuries while trying to save
          his wife from burning. If that were true, the appellant would
          not have hesitated in informing the doctor about the same.
          Hearing the screams of the deceased, PW 1 arrived at the
          scene of occurrence and at that time, he saw the appellant
          scaling the wall for coming out from the bathroom. The
          appellant knew that the deceased was burning inside the
          bathroom. Instead of opening the door of the bathroom so as
          to bring the deceased out from there, the appellant chose to
          scale the bathroom wall despite having sustained burn
          injuries."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">28.       In the instant case, the accused has gone
missing immediately after the death of his wife and was
arrested after 15 days.
</p>
<p id="p_32">29.       Their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
2015 (11) SCC 43, in the case of "<a href="/doc/55608570/" id="a_10">Raja @ Rajinder vs. State
of Haryana</a>", have laid down the following principles, if the
case is based on circumstantial evidence: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                 "10. As the factual matrix would show, the case of
          the prosecution entirely hinges on circumstantial
          evidence. When a case rests on circumstantial evidence,
          the Court has to be satisfied that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                 "(1) the circumstances from which an inference of
          guilt is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly
          established;</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                       10</span>


<p id="p_33">      (2) those circumstances should be of a definite
tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the
accused;
</p><p id="p_34">      (3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should
form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the
conclusion that within all human probability the crime
was committed by the accused and none else; and
      (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain
conviction must be complete and incapable of
explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt
of the accused and such evidence should not only be
consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be
inconsistent with his innocence."
</p><p id="p_35">(<a href="/doc/307495/" id="a_11">See Padala Veera Reddy v. State of A.P</a>.2, SCC pp. 710-
11, para 10.)
</p><p id="p_36">11. <a href="/doc/1150284/" id="a_12">In Balwinder Singh v. State of Punjab3</a> it has been
laid down that: (SCC p. 262, para 4)
              "4. ... the circumstances from which the
      conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully
      proved and those circumstances must be
      conclusive in nature to connect the accused with
      the crime. All the links in the chain of events must
      be established beyond a reasonable doubt and the
      established circumstances should be consistent
      only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused
      and totally inconsistent with his innocence. In a
      case based on circumstantial evidence, the court
      has to be on its guard to avoid the danger of
      allowing suspicion to take the place of legal proof
      and has to be watchful to avoid the danger of being
      swayed by emotional considerations, howsoever
      strong they may be, to take the place of proof."
</p><p id="p_37">12. From the aforesaid it is clear as day that the court is
required to evaluate the circumstantial evidence to see
that the chain of events has been established clearly and
completely to rule out any reasonable likelihood of the
innocence of the accused. Needless to say whether the
chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of
each case emanating from the evidence and no universal
yardstick should ever be attempted (see <a href="/doc/186059/" id="a_13">Ujjagar Singh v.
State of Punjab4</a>, SCC p. 98, para 14).
</p><p id="p_38">13. In the instant case, the circumstances that have been
established by the prosecution are that the deceased had
accompanied the appellant-accused, being called by him,
from his house in the early part of the evening on the
date of occurrence. The mother of the deceased, Kalawati
PW 11, has deposed in that regard. Thereafter, from the
material brought on record, it is clearly revealed that the
appellant was seen at the tea stall with the deceased. The
said fact has been deposed by Mahender PW 10. Thus,
from the aforesaid evidence, two facts are established,
namely, the accused and the deceased had left the house
of the deceased and were seen taking tea together at the
tea stall. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the
appellant that the last seen theory as advanced by the
prosecution is not acceptable inasmuch as the owner of
the tea stall has not been examined. When the testimony
of the aforesaid two witnesses deserve acceptance and

record, no adverse inference should be drawn because of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                       11</span>


non-examination of the tea-stall owner, who, as has been
submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant, is a
material witness. It is well settled in law that non-
examination of a material witness is not a mathematical
formula for discarding the weight of the testimony
available on record, if the same is natural, trustworthy
and convincing (see <a href="/doc/146987/" id="a_14">State of H.P. v. Gian Chand5</a>. That
apart, he was not such a witness who alone was the
competent witness to depose about a fact and his non-
examination would really destroy the version of the
prosecution.
</p><p id="p_39">14. Another reason for acceptance of the last seen theory
is that the brother of the deceased, Subhash PW 8, has
testified that he had enquired from the accused as
regards the whereabouts of the deceased, for the
deceased had accompanied the accused and at that
juncture the accused had replied that at the tea stall a
Sikh boy came and the deceased went with him. As per
the prosecution case, the deceased and the accused are
co-villagers. In his statement recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_15">Section 313</a>
CrPC, the appellant-accused totally denied to have
accompanied the deceased. The learned trial Judge and
the High Court have placed reliance on the evidence of
the mother, Kalawati PW 11; the brother, Subhash PW 8
and Mahender PW 10. The cumulative reading and
apposite appreciation of the said evidence proves beyond
reasonable doubt that the deceased was last seen with
the accused.
</p><p id="p_40">15. Another circumstance that has been proven is about
the recovery of knife, bloodstained clothes and the ashes
of the burnt blanket. The seizure witnesses Sukha PW 7
and Nanak PW 9 have proven the seizure. It is submitted
by the learned counsel for the appellant that the police
had recorded the confessional statement of the appellant-
accused at the police custody and thereafter, as alleged,
had recovered certain things which really do not render
any assistance to the prosecution, for the confession
recorded before the police officer is inadmissible. That
apart, the accused had advanced the plea that the
articles and the weapon were planted by the investigating
agency.
</p><p id="p_41">16. To appreciate the said submission in proper
perspective, we may profitably reproduce a passage from
<a href="/doc/148990448/" id="a_16">State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya6</a>: (AIR p. 1129, para
</p><p id="p_42">7)
              "7. ... The expression, 'accused of any
        offence' in <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_17">Section 27</a>, as in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_18">Section 25</a>, is also
        descriptive of the person concerned i.e. against a
        person who is accused of an offence, <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_19">Section 27</a>
        renders provable certain statements made by him
        while he was in the custody of a police officer.
        <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_20">Section 27</a> is founded on the principle that even
        though the evidence relating to confessional or
        other statements made by a person, whilst he is in
        the custody of a police officer, is tainted and
        therefore inadmissible, if the truth of the
        information given by him is assured by the
        discovery of a fact, it may be presumed to be
        untainted and is therefore declared provable
        insofar as it distinctly relates to the fact thereby
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                       12</span>


       discovered. Even though <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_21">Section 27</a> is in the form
       of a proviso to <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_22">Section 26</a>, the two sections do not
       necessarily deal with the evidence of the same
       character. The ban imposed by <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_23">Section 26</a> is
       against the proof of confessional statements.
       <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_24">Section 27</a> is concerned with the proof of
       information whether it amounts to a confession or
       not, which leads to discovery of facts. By <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_25">Section
       27</a>, even if a fact is deposed to as discovered in
       consequence of information received, only that
       much of the information is admissible as distinctly
       relates to the fact discovered."
</p><p id="p_43">17. <a href="/doc/557368/" id="a_26">In State of Maharashtra v. Damu7</a>, while dealing with
the fundamental facet of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_27">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act,
the Court observed that the basic idea embedded in the
said provision is the doctrine of confession by
subsequent events, which is founded on the principle
that if any fact is discovered in a search made on the
strength of any information obtained from a prisoner,
such a discovery is a guarantee that the information
supplied by the prisoner is true. It further stated that the
information might be confessional or non-inculpatory in
nature, but if it results in discovery of a fact it becomes a
reliable information and, therefore, the legislature
permitted such information to be used as evidence by
restricting the admissible portion to the minimum.
</p><p id="p_44">18. Thus, if an accused person gives a statement that
relates to the discovery of a fact in consequence of
information received from him is admissible. The rest
part of the statement has to be treated as inadmissible.
In view of the same, the recovery made at the instance of
the appellant-accused has been rightly accepted by the
trial court as well as by the High Court, and we perceive
no flaw in it.
</p><p id="p_45">19. Another circumstance which has been taken note of
by the High Court is that the bloodstained clothes and
the weapon, the knife, were sent to the Forensic Science
Laboratory. The report obtained from the laboratory
clearly shows that bloodstains were found on the clothes
and the knife. True it is, there has been no matching of
the blood group. However, that would not make a
difference in the facts of the present case. The accused
has not offered any explanation as to how the human
blood was found on the clothes and the knife. In this
regard, a passage from <a href="/doc/562199/" id="a_28">John Pandian v. State8</a> is worth
reproducing: (SCC p. 153, para 57)
              "57. ... The discovery appears to be credible.
       It has been accepted by both the courts below and
       we find no reason to discard it. This is apart from
       the fact that this weapon was sent to the forensic
       science laboratory (FSL) and it has been found
       stained with human blood. Though the blood
       group could not be ascertained, as the results were
       inconclusive, the accused had to give some
       explanation as to how the human blood came on
       this weapon. He gave none. This discovery would
       very positively further the prosecution case."
       In view of the aforesaid, there is no substantial
       reason not to accept the recovery of the weapon
       used in the crime. It is also apt to note here that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                       13</span>


       Dr N.K. Mittal PW 1, has clearly opined that the
       injuries on the person of the deceased could be
       caused by the knife and the said opinion has gone
       unrebutted.
</p><p id="p_46">       20. Another circumstance which needs to be noted
is that Sukha PW 7, a taxi driver, has deposed that on
18-1-2003 about 11.00 p.m. while he was going to
Fatehabad for taking passengers, he saw a bullock cart
parked in front of the house of the accused and certain
persons were tying a bundle in a "palli". On query being
made by him, the accused persons told him that they are
carrying manure to the fields. Though, this witness has
given an exaggerated version and stated differently about
the time of arrest, yet his testimony to the effect that he
had seen the accused with a bundle in "palli" at a
particular place cannot be disbelieved. The maxim falsus
in uno, falsus in omnibus, is not applicable in India. <a href="/doc/439549/" id="a_29">In
Krishna Mochi v. State of Bihar9</a>, it has been held thus:
(SCC pp. 113-14, para 51)
              "51. ... The maxim falsus in uno, falsus in
       omnibus has no application in India and the
       witnesses cannot be branded as liars. The maxim
       falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus (false in one
       thing, false in everything) has not received general
       acceptance nor has this maxim come to occupy the
       status of the rule of law. It is merely a rule of
       caution. All that it amounts to is, that in such
       cases testimony may be disregarded, and not that
       it must be disregarded."
</p><p id="p_47">       21. <a href="/doc/81452813/" id="a_30">In Yogendra v. State of Rajasthan10</a>, it has
been ruled that: (SCC p. 404, para 13)
              "13. ... The court must assess the extent to
       which the deposition of a witness can be relied
       upon. The court must make every attempt to
       separate falsehoods from the truth, and it must
       only be in exceptional circumstances, when it is
       entirely impossible to separate the grain from the
       chaff, for the same are so inextricably intertwined,
       that the entire evidence of such a witness must be
       discarded."
</p><p id="p_48">       Thus viewed, the version of PW 7 to the extent that
       has been stated hereinabove is totally acceptable
       and credible.
</p><p id="p_49">22. In a case based on circumstantial evidence, motive
assumes great significance as its existence is an
enlightening factor in a process of presumptive reasoning
(see <a href="/doc/1053935/" id="a_31">Kundula Bala Subrahmanyam v. State of A.P</a>.11).
</p><p id="p_50">23. In the case at hand, it had come in the evidence that
the appellant-accused was suspicious of an illicit
relationship between the deceased and his wife. The
accused has taken the plea that he was never married. It
is noteworthy that the materials brought on record go a
long way to show that after the death of his brother he
had entered into the wedlock with his sister-in-law as per
the tradition of the community, that is, "Kareva"
marriage. The said facet of evidence has really not been
assailed or shaken. Thus, it has been established that
there was suspicion by the accused that the deceased
was having relationship with his brother's wife and that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  14</span>


           had aroused his anger. The said motive             further
           strengthens the case of the prosecution."

<p id="p_51">30.        Their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
2015 (11) SCC 178, in the case of "<a href="/doc/85010863/" id="a_32">Kirti Pal vs. State of
West Bengal</a>" and analogous matter, have held that the
theory of "last seen alive" comes into play when the time
gap between the way the accused and the deceased were
last seen together and the deceased was found dead was so
small, the possibility of any other person committing the
murder becomes impossible. Their Lordships have held as
under: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                  "16. From the evidence of PWs 6, 7 and 10, the
           prosecution has thus established that Anjali was last
           seen alive in the company of first appellant Kiriti Pal on
           the evening of 11-11-2008 and that at about 10.00-10.30
           p.m., first appellant Kiriti Pal came alone. The theory of
           "last seen alive" comes into play when the time gap
           between the way the accused and the deceased were last
           seen together and the deceased was found dead was so
           small, the possibility of any other person committing the
           murder becomes impossible. On the next day morning at
           about 9.30 a.m., the body of deceased Anjali was found
           in Babuibona Jungle, an isolated place which is 25 km
           away from her residence. The place where the dead body
           was found was connected with Rajnagar-Suri Road. The
           time when Anjali left with first appellant Kiriti Pal and
           the time she was found dead is so proximate which, in
           our view, points to the guilt of the first appellant.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">           17. Having regard to the time gap being small, it is for
           the first appellant to explain the circumstances how and
           where and in what manner he parted company with
           Anjali. Thus, on the principle that the person who is last
           found in the company of another is dead or missing, the
           person with whom he was last found alive has to explain
           the circumstances in which he parted company. As
           pointed out by the trial court and the High Court, the
           first appellant has failed to discharge the onus and failed
           to offer any explanation as to how, as to when and how
           and in what manner he parted the company of Anjali, is
           a strong militating circumstance against the first
           appellant Kiriti Pal. There is force in the submission of
           the learned counsel for the State that the first appellant
           Kiriti Pal failed to offer any explanation, it must be held
           that he failed to discharge the burden cast upon him by
           <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_33">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">           18. <a href="/doc/1789800/" id="a_34">In State of U.P. v. Satish7</a>, this Court had stated that
           the last seen theory comes into play where the time gap
           between the point of time when the accused and the
           deceased were last seen alive and when the deceased is
           found dead is so small that possibility of any person
           other than the accused being the author of the crime
           becomes impossible. <a href="/doc/116940/" id="a_35">In State of Rajasthan v. Kashi

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">          265)
                     "23. It is not necessary to multiply with
              authorities. The principle is well settled. The
              provisions of <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_36">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act itself are
              unambiguous and categorical in laying down that
              when any fact is especially within the knowledge of a
              person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.
              Thus, if a person is last seen with the deceased, he
              must offer an explanation as to how and when he
              parted company. He must furnish an explanation
              which appears to the court to be probable and
              satisfactory. If he does so he must be held to have
              discharged his burden. If he fails to offer an
              explanation on the basis of facts within his special
              knowledge, he fails to discharge the burden cast upon
              him by <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_37">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act. In a case
              resting on circumstantial evidence if the accused fails
              to offer a reasonable explanation in discharge of the
              burden placed on him, that itself provides an
              additional link in the chain of circumstances proved
              against him. <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_38">Section 106</a> does not shift the burden of
              proof in a criminal trial, which is always upon the
              prosecution. It lays down the rule that when the
              accused does not throw any light upon facts which
              are specially within his knowledge and which could
              not support any theory or hypothesis compatible with
              his innocence, the court can consider his failure to
              adduce any explanation, as an additional link which
              completes the chain. The principle has been
              succinctly stated in Naina Mohamed, In re9."

          in its entirety and keeping in mind the circumstances
          preceding and following the point of having so last seen,
          "the last seen theory", in our view, is a strong
          incriminating      circumstance    in    the    chain     of
          circumstances that would point to the guilt of the first
          appellant with some certainty.

<p id="p_55">           accused had gone to another Village Dahigaon. The
           prosecution has proved presence of the appellant at his

           is duty-bound to explain as to how the death of his father
           was caused. When an offence like murder is committed
           in secrecy inside a house, the initial burden to establish

           view of <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_43">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act, there will be a

when the accused and his father Dashrath were in the

dead, it was for the accused to offer an explanation as to
how his father sustained injuries. When the accused
could not offer any explanation as to the homicidal death

crime.

       with absence of any explanation was held to be
       inconsistent with the innocence of the accused,
       but consistent with the hypothesis that the
       appellant is a prime accused in the commission of
       murder of his wife. <a href="/doc/152464/" id="a_48">In State of U.P. v. Ravindra
       Prakash Mittal5</a> the medical evidence disclosed
       that the wife died of strangulation during late night
       hours or early morning and her body was set on
       fire after sprinkling kerosene. The defence of the
       husband was that the wife had committed suicide
       by burning herself and that he was not at home at
       that time. The letters written by the wife to her
       relatives showed that the husband ill-treated her
       and their relations were strained and further the
       evidence showed that both of them were in one
       room in the night. It was held that the chain of
       circumstances was complete and it was the
       husband who committed the murder of his wife by
       strangulation and accordingly this Court reversed
       the judgment of the High Court acquitting the
       accused and convicted him under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_49">Section 302</a> IPC.
       <a href="/doc/346377/" id="a_50">In State of T.N. v. Rajendran6</a> the wife was found
       dead in a hut which had caught fire. The evidence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                18</span>


                showed that the accused and his wife were seen
                together in the hut at about 9.00 p.m. and the
                accused came out in the morning through the roof
                when the hut had caught fire. His explanation was
                that it was a case of accidental fire which resulted
                in the death of his wife and a daughter. The
                medical evidence showed that the wife died due to
                asphyxia as a result of strangulation and not on
                account of burn injuries. It was held that there
                cannot be any hesitation to come to the conclusion
                that it was the accused (husband) who was the
                perpetrator of the crime."
</p><p id="p_57">                Same view was reiterated by this Court in <a href="/doc/1033401/" id="a_51">State of
          Rajasthan v. Parthu7</a>.

<p id="p_58">34.       Their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
2016 (12) SCC 682, in the case of "<a href="/doc/195713597/" id="a_52">State of Himachal
Pradesh vs. Rajiv Jassi</a>", have held that accused was in the
company of the deceased at the time of occurrence. Various
contusions of big size found on body of deceased including
swelling in womb. Thus, it was for accused to explain
injuries found on person of deceased and the failure of the
accused to explain same coupled with other evidence is a
grave circumstance mitigating against him. Their Lordships
have held as under: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                 "15. In our opinion, the judgment and order of
          conviction passed by the trial court was based upon
          proper appreciation of evidence, the circumstances found
          established by the trial court in the instant case have
          been unnecessarily doubted and brushed aside lightly by
          the High Court. The High Court has unnecessarily
          doubted the post-mortem report which recorded as many
          as aforesaid seven injuries. There were various
          contusions of big size on periorbital area, intraorbital
          area, forehead, upper eyelid, cheek, 8 cm × 7 cm
          contusion over the chin, contusion over the lower lip, 11
          cm × 5 cm multiple small abrasions over neck and upper
          chest, 10 cm × 4 cm contusion in infra-axillary area. The
          aforesaid nature of the injuries indicates that they could
          not have been caused by convulsions. That the accused
          was in the company of the victim in the same room is not
          disputed. Thus, it was for him to explain the injuries
          found on the person of the deceased. Exact number of
          injuries had not been noted by Dr Chaudhary, PW 2 as
          he himself had admitted that he could not examine the
          entire body physically as the condition of the victim was
          precarious and he was busy in giving her treatment then
          referred her to hospital at Shimla. The victim became
          unconscious at the house itself. The High Court has
          unnecessarily doubted the deposition of the autopsy
          surgeon who has clearly opined that the nature of
          injuries indicated positively the administration of poison
          forcibly to the victim. Such injuries could be caused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                    19</span>


             while administering poison forcibly when victim was
             trying to save herself from that. In the cross-
             examination, Dr Choudhary, PW 2, has also stated that it
             could not be a suicidal case. However, on a suggestion
             being made to PW 2 and PW 3 that it could be a case of
             voluntary consumption of poison by the victim to commit
             suicide, obviously the doctors were not able to deny the
             said suggestion as they were not eyewitnesses. Moreover,
             they were not supposed to be an arbiter on this issue
             whether the victim had taken the poison herself. Their
             objective opinion stands writ large that considering the
             nature of injuries it could be a case of forcible poisoning
             and in the process the accused had caused injuries while
             the deceased had struggled. Thus, the approach of the
             High Court cannot be said to be of objective assessment
             of evidence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">             16. The accused was admittedly in the company of the
             deceased. It was for him to explain so many injuries
             found on the person of the deceased as to how they were
             caused including swelling in womb. He has totally failed
             to explain them. It was not stated by him that the
             injuries were caused to the deceased due to convulsions.
             It was not stated by him that she ever fell down during
             convulsions, if any. The injuries on her lips, chin, throat
             and neck, etc. as held by the trial court, were caused
             while administering the poison forcibly is a strong
             circumstance against the accused which cannot be
             brushed aside lightly. More so, in view of the overall
             conduct of the accused to be discussed hereinafter.
             Injuries were on the front part of the body which
             indicates that the deceased was subjected to violence
             before she succumbed due to poisoning. <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_53">Section 106</a> of
             the Evidence Act requires a person having special
             knowledge of the fact to explain the same as required by
             <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_54">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act, and laid down by this
             Court in <a href="/doc/620182/" id="a_55">C.S.D. Swami v. State2</a>, <a href="/doc/38264736/" id="a_56">P.N. Krishna Lal v.

             Delhi</a>)4. Failure to explain that the deceased was in an
             unconscious position coupled with other evidence is a
             grave circumstance which militates against such a
             person."
