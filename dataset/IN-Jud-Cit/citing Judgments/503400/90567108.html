                          when summons and notices were issued to the Defendant. Initially, the
                          Defendant had entered appearance, but thereafter, stopped appearing in the
                          matter. Vide order dated 24th April, 2006, the Defendant was proceeded
                          against ex parte. An application was then moved on behalf of the Defendant
                          seeking the setting aside of the ex parte proceedings. The same was allowed
                          on 25th July, 2006, on which date it was recorded that the non-appearance on
                          behalf of Defendant was not intentional, and therefore, the order dated 24th
                          April, 2006 directing ex parte proceedings against the Defendant was
                          recalled. The amended Plaint was filed seeking enhancement of the
                          valuation of the suit, which was allowed on the same day. Pleadings were
                          completed between the parties.
</p><p id="p_20">                          8.     Thereafter, vide a detailed judgment dated 25th May, 2007, the
                          application for interim injunction was allowed, in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                        &quot;Accordingly, the defendants, its proprietors,

</p><p id="p_44">                          22.    This Court has heard ld. Counsel for the Plaintiff and perused the
                          record. The Defendant is ex-parte. A perusal of the pleadings shows that the
                          case of the Plaintiffs is that the use of the impugned mark &#x27;JAMES
                          BOND&#x27;/&#x27;JAMEY BOND&#x27; and the product packaging bearing the said mark,
                          is infringing its registered trademark &#x27;CADBURY GEMS&#x27;/&#x27;GEMS&#x27;, its
                          copyright registrations featuring the character &#x27;GEMS BOND&#x27; as set out
                          hereinabove, and also constitutes passing off.
</p><p id="p_45">                          23.    The Plaintiff No.1 - Mondelez India Foods Pvt. Ltd. (formerly known
                          as Cadbury India Limited) began its operations in India in the 1947 and has
                          thousands of employees and lakhs of outlets across India. The earliest
                          trademark registration for the &#x27;GEMS&#x27; product in India is for the word mark

                          &#x27;Milk Chocolate&#x27;. Its gross sales value, as depicted above, is more than Rs.
                          1487.56 millions, as in the year 2010.
</p><p id="p_46">                          24.    The Plaintiff&#x27;s product branded as &#x27;CADBURY GEMS&#x27;/&#x27;GEMS&#x27; and
                          the packaging thereof is known to the young and old alike. The packaging of
                          the Plaintiffs&#x27; &#x27;GEMS&#x27; product is very unique with illustrations of colourful
                          button chocolates, on a blue/purple base with the mark &#x27;GEMS&#x27; depicted in
                          a number of colours and a splash in the middle. The Plaintiff&#x27;s GEMS
                          product is one of the most popular and well-recognized chocolate products
                          in India. Almost everyone&#x27;s childhood is associated with the consumption of

                           artistic works set out hereinabove, involving a character referred to as
                          &#x27;GEMS BOND&#x27; and used as an advertisement/promotion. Various
                          advertisements of &#x27;GEMS&#x27; bear the image of &#x27;GEMS BOND&#x27; and some
                          samples of the same have also been placed on record. The Defendant&#x27;s
                          packaging uses the mark &#x27;JAMES BOND&#x27;/ &#x27;JAMEY BOND&#x27; with the same
                          blue/purple base and colourful button chocolates. The mark &#x27;GEMS&#x27; is
                          depicted in a brown background in the Plaintiff&#x27;s product, so also, in the
                          Defendant&#x27;s products. The entire colour scheme of the Defendant&#x27;s product
                          is identical to that of the Plaintiffs&#x27; label and packaging. The marks are also
                          confusingly and deceptively similar.
</p><p id="p_48">                          26.    The Defendant has filed its written statement at an early stage and
                          though the Defendant is ex-parte, the defences raised therein are being
                          considered. In the written statement, the main plank of the Defendant&#x27;s case
                          is that the label and the mark are not identical or deceptively similar. No
                          substantial defence has been taken in the written statement, except for
                          claiming that the Defendant&#x27;s products are different from the Plaintiffs&#x27;
                          products. A perusal of the documents filed by the Defendant shows that the
                          Defendant had filed the Trademark Application bearing No.1124200 dated
                          August, 2002 in Class 30 in respect of goods being all kinds of food
                          products, including confectionary, churan goli, etc. The user claimed in this
                          application is of the year 1979. The search report in respect of the said
                          trademark has also been placed on record. The same is relied upon by the
                          Defendant to contend that the impugned trade mark/label of the Plaintiffs
                          does not find mention in the search report, and therefore, the said trade
                          mark/label of the Defendant cannot be said to be identical with or
                          deceptively similar to the trade mark/label of the Plaintiffs. The product

                          been placed on record to show that the same is deceptively similar to the
                          Plaintiffs&#x27; products. The said label is set out below:

<p id="p_49">                          27.    Insofar as the documents of user filed by the Defendant are
                          concerned, there is not a single advertisement, which has been placed on
                          record. There are only a few kacha invoices, all of which date back to the
                          years 2001-02. No other documents have been placed by the Defendant
                          showing user.

                          by the parties, this Court is of the opinion that the present is a case of res
                          ipsa loquitur. The comparative labels set out hereinabove show that the two
                          products have startling similarities. Some of the features, which are similar,
                          are set out below:

                                    the Defendant has placed a diamond in brown colour at the centre.
                                 C. The Plaintiffs have displayed the origin of the product i.e., the
                                    name of the manufacturer as &#x27;CADBURY&#x27;S&#x27; on the top left corner
                                    of the pillow pack. The Defendant has placed its name &#x27;NEERAJ&#x27;

                                    pillow pack is also bordered with the blue/purple border.
                                 E. The Plaintiffs have inscribed the trade mark &#x27;GEMS&#x27; in the colour
                                    white, and the Defendant has used an identical white for writing

<p id="p_57">                          29.    In two seminal judgements of the Supreme Court, the test of
                          infringement and deceptive similarity of competing marks is well settled.
                          The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_1">Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food
                          Products Ltd</a>., (1960) 1 SCR 968, has observed that the said question has to
                          be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and
                          of imperfect recollection. It was observed that, to such a man, the overall
                          structural and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two
                          marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion between them. The relevant
                          extracts from the judgment in Corn Products (supra) are set out below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                                     &quot;18. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It
                                     is well known that the question whether the two marks
                                     are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of
                                     first impression. It is for the court to decide that
                                     question. English cases proceeding on the English way of
                                     pronouncing an English word by Englishmen, which it
                                     may be stated is not always the same, may not be of much
                                     assistance in our country in deciding questions of
                                     phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that the word
                                     is an English word which to the mass of the Indian
                                     people is a foreign word. It is well recognised that in
                                     deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the
                                     marks have to be considered as a whole. So considered,
                                     we are inclined to agree with Desai, J., that the marks
                                     with which this case is concerned are similar. Apart from
                                     the syllable &quot;co&quot; in the appellant&#x27;s mark, the two marks
                                     are identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as
                                     would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the
                                     one mark from the other.</blockquote>

<p id="p_58">                                     19. We also agree with Desai, J., that the idea of the two
                                     marks is the same. The marks convey the ideas of glucose

                                      and life giving properties of vitamins. The Aquamatic
                                     case (Harry Reynolds v. Laffeaty&#x27;s Ld.) is a recent case
                                     where the test of the commonness of the idea between
                                     two marks was applied in deciding the question of
                                     similarity between them. Again, in deciding the question
                                     of similarity between the two marks we have to
                                     approach it from the point of view of a man of average
                                     intelligence and of imperfect recollection. To such a
                                     man the overall structural and phonetic similarity and
                                     the similarity of the idea in the two marks is reasonably
                                     likely to cause a confusion between them.&quot;

<p id="p_59">                          30.    <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_2">In Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. &amp; Co., Mysore</a> [AIR 1972 SC
                          1359], it was held that the Court has to see similarities and not the
                          dissimilarities. The relevant extracts of the said judgment, which has been
                          followed in innumerable judgments subsequently, are set out hereinbelow:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                                     &quot;According to Kerly&#x27;s Law of Trade Marks and Trade
                                     Names (9th Edition Paragraph 838) &quot;Two marks, when
                                     placed side by side, may exhibit many and various
                                     differences, yet the main idea left on the mind by both
                                     may be the same. A person acquainted with the one
                                     mark, and not having the two side by side for
                                     comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were
                                     allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a
                                     belief that he was dealing with goods which bore the
                                     same mark as that with which he was acquainted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                                     It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with
                                     trademarked goods, and relying, as they frequently do,
                                     upon marks, should be able to remember the exact
                                     details of the marks upon the goods with which they are
                                     in the habit of dealing. Marks are remembered rather by
                                     general impressions or by some significant detail than
                                     by any photographic recollection of the whole.
                                     Moreover, variations in detail might well be supposed
                                     by customers to have been made by the owners of the
                                     trade mark they are already acquainted with for
                                     reasons of their own.

                                      It is therefore clear that in order to come to the
                                     conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to
                                     another, the broad and essential features of the two are
                                     to be considered. They should not be placed side by side
                                     to find out if there are any differences in the design and if
                                     so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one
                                     design from being mistaken for the other. It would be
                                     enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall
                                     similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to
                                     mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the
                                     other if offered to him.&quot;

<p id="p_61">                          31.    Similar is the view taken by the ld. Single Judge of this Court in <a href="/doc/13049170/" id="a_3">ITC
                          Ltd. v. Brittania Industries Ltd</a>. [233 (2016) DLT 259], wherein the
                          Plaintiff sought to restrain the Defendant from violating its rights in the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s packaging/trade dress of &#x27;Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive - All
                          Good&#x27; biscuit by using a deceptively and confusingly similar trade dress for

                          confusion, the Court placed reliance upon Parle Products (supra) and

                                     arranged side by side. Where the product is an eatable
                                     like a biscuit, the colour and the colour scheme of the
                                     packaging plays an important role in the consumer
                                     making an initial choice and in enabling a discerning

                                          folly, but this initial interest being based on
                                          confusion and deception can give rise to a
                                          cause of action for the tort of passing off as
                                          the purchaser has been made to think that
                                          there is some connection or nexus between
                                          the products and business of two disparate
                                          companies.&quot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                                     37. Therefore, when another competing variant of the
                                     biscuit is introduced six months later and a consumer on
                                     the basis of the popularity of a product that has recently
                                     been introduced makes a mistake as to which packet of
                                     biscuit he is picking up, it can be argued that the initial
                                     interest was based on confusion and deception and,
                                     therefore, gives rise to a tort of passing off. In Wal Mart
                                     (supra) it was observed that the product&#x27;s trade dress can
                                     be protected only if it is shown that it had acquired a
                                     secondary meaning &quot;since design, like colour, is not
                                     inherently distinctive.&quot; However, the product in that case
                                     was a certain kind of clothing. In that context, it was said
                                     that the colour by itself does not identify the source of the
                                     product. However, that may not be entirely true when it
                                     comes to products like biscuits. The packaging of a
                                     biscuit does become associated with the manufacturer
                                     or brand. The colour on the wrapper would certainly
                                     play an important part.</blockquote>

                                     collocation of words. The wrapper was of buff colour
                                     and depicted a farm yard with a girl in the centre
                                     carrying a pail of water and cows and hens around her
                                     on the background of a farmyard house and trees. The
                                     Respondent&#x27;s wrapper contained a picture of a girl

                                      supporting with one hand a bundle of hay on her head
                                     and carrying a sickle and a bundle of food in the other,
                                     the cows and hens surrounding her. The trial court
                                     declined the injunction. The High Court looking at the
                                     broad features did not think that they were so similar so
                                     as to deceive an ordinary purchaser. Since it was an
                                     action for infringement, the Supreme Court declined to
                                     treat it as a case of passing off. Nevertheless, it explained
                                     that in order to come to a conclusion whether one mark
                                     is deceptively similar to another &quot;the broad and essential
                                     features of the two are to be considered.&quot; It was further
                                     explained as under:
</p><p id="p_63">                                     &quot;They should not be placed side by side to find out if
                                     there are any differences in the design and if so, whether
                                     they are of such character as to prevent one design from
                                     being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the
                                     impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the
                                     registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person
                                     usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to
                                     him. In this case we find that the packets are practically
                                     of the same size, the colour scheme of the two wrappers
                                     is almost the same; the design on both though not
                                     identical bears such a close resemblance that one can
                                     easily be mistaken for the other. The essential features
                                     of both are that there is a girl with one arm raised and
                                     carrying something in the other with a cow or cows near
                                     her and hens or chickens in the foreground. In the
                                     background there is a farm house with a fence. The word
                                     &quot;Gluco Biscuits&quot; in one and &quot;Glucose Biscuits&quot; on the
                                     other occupy a prominent place at the top with a good
                                     deal of similarity between the two writings. Anyone in,
                                     our opinion who has a look at one of the packets to-day
                                     may easily mistake the other if shown on another day as
                                     being the same article which he had seen before. If one
                                     was not careful enough to note the peculiar features of
                                     the wrapper on the plaintiffs goods, he might easily
                                     mistake the defendants&#x27; wrapper for the plaintiffs if
                                     shown to him some time after he had seen the
                                     plaintiffs&#x27;. After all, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted

                                      with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Holmes.
                                     We have therefore no doubt that the defendants&#x27; wrapper
                                     is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs&#x27; which was
                                     registered.&quot;
</p><p id="p_64">                                     (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_65">                          32.    In the background of the legal position captured above, it is to be
                          noted that in the present case, the products in question are chocolates which
                          may be consumed by young and old alike. The &#x27;GEMS&#x27; product is also
                          usually consumed by small children, both in urban and rural areas. The test
                          in such a matter is not that of absolute confusion. Even likelihood of
                          confusion is sufficient. A comparison of the Defendant&#x27;s infringing product
                          and the packaging thereof leaves no manner of doubt that the same is a
                          complete knock-off, of the Plaintiffs&#x27; &#x27;CADBURY GEMS&#x27;. The significant
                          fact is that these products are sold not only in bigger packs, but also in
                          smaller pillow packs, due to which the mark may not even be fully visible.
                          The smallest selling unit of the Plaintiffs&#x27; product i.e., the pillow pack, is
                          even available for 1 rupee to 5 rupees. Hence, the product&#x27;s get up, layout,
                          as also, the colour combination of the packaging plays a significant role at
                          the point of purchase. Moreover, chocolates are sold not merely in big retail
                          stores or outlets, but also, in road side shacks, paan shops, patri vendors,
                          kirana stores and stalls outside schools, etc. Thus, there is an immense
                          likelihood of confusion, particularly considering the class of consumers that
                          the product is targeted at, that is, children.
</p><p id="p_66">                          33.    In view of the foregoing factors and the resemblance in the product
                          packaging, as also, the phonetic similarity between the marks used in respect
                          of the Plaintiffs&#x27; and Defendant&#x27;s products, the issues framed by the Court in
                          the present suit are answered as below:

                           Issue No.1. Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief of permanent
                          injunction as prayed in prayer clause &#x27;A&#x27; of the Plaint? (OPP)
                          Issue No.2. Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief of mandatory
                          injunction as prayed in prayer clause &#x27;B&#x27; of the Plaint? (OPP)
                                 Issue Nos.1 and 2 are taken together. In view of the evidence led by
                          the Plaintiffs and the foregoing discussion as to the blatant infringement of
                          the Plaintiffs&#x27; trademark and copyright, the present two issues are answered
                          in the affirmative. Accordingly, Issue Nos.1 and 2 are decided in favour of
                          the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.

                          extent? (OPP)
                                 In view of the contumacious conduct of the Defendant in infringing
                          the well-known mark, label and packaging of the Plaintiffs, this Court is
                          convinced that the present is a fit case for the award of damages.
                          Accordingly, Issue No.3 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the
                          Defendant.

                          trademarks as mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Plaint in India? (OPP)
                                 The Plaintiffs have placed on record the certified copies of the legal
                          proceeding certificates relating to the trade mark registrations in respect of
                          its &#x27;GEMS&#x27; product obtained in India. The same are exhibited as Ex.PW 1/3
                          (Colly). A perusal of the same establishes that the Plaintiffs are the
                          registered proprietor of the marks as mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Plaint.
                          Accordingly, Issue No.4 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the

                                 The Plaintiffs have placed on record the certified copies of the

                          After perusing the said copyright registrations, the present issue is answered
                          in the affirmative. Accordingly, Issue No.5 is decided in favour of the

                          Issue No.7. Whether the acts of the Defendant constitute passing off its
                          goods as and for the goods of the Plaintiffs? (OPP)
                                 Issue Nos.6 and 7 are taken together. This Court has perused the ex
                          parte evidence filed on behalf of the Plaintiffs. The discussion above clearly
                          shows that the acts of the Defendant constitute infringement of registered
                          trademarks of the Plaintiffs, as also, passing off. Accordingly, Issue Nos.6
                          and 7 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.

                                 The packaging/mark/label of the Defendant are a substantial imitation
                          and similar to the Plaintiffs&#x27; mark/label/packaging. The onus to prove the

                          has been taken by the Defendant in its written statement, except for claiming
                          that the Defendant&#x27;s products are different from the Plaintiffs&#x27; product. No

                          &#x27;CADBURY GEMS&#x27;/&#x27;GEMS&#x27; is common to trade. The present issue is
                          answered in the negative. Accordingly, Issue No.9 is decided in favour of
                          the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.

                          the year 2005. The Defendant has been irregular in its appearance before the
                          Court and has contributed to the delay. Even otherwise, the Defendant has
                          been proceeded against ex parte and has not led any evidence. The defence
                          of the Defendant did not stand proved, especially in view of the competing
                          packagings which have been exhibited and placed on record. The Defendant
                          has also not denied having sold chocolates under the infringing packaging.
                          The search report of the Defendant placed on record shows that the
                          Defendant had adopted a packaging with the same illustrations and
                          blue/purple colour as that of the Plaintiffs&#x27; product. Therefore, the impugned
                          packaging of the Defendant&#x27;s product sold under the mark &#x27;JAMES
                          BOND&#x27;/&#x27;JAMEY BOND&#x27; has clearly infringed the Plaintiffs&#x27; rights in the
