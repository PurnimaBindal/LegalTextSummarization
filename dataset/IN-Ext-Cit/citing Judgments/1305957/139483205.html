              against the Universities. The High Court notes that as




                                                        
              there were no posts the employees could not be made
              permanent. Once it comes to the conclusion that for lack
              of posts the employees could not be made permanent,

              permanent employees?  To be noted that the complaint
              was not against the State Government. The complaint
      

              was against the Universities. The inaction on the part of
              the State Government to create posts would not mean
   



              that an unfair labour practice had been committed by
              the Universities. The reasoning given by the High Court





              to conclude that the case was squarely covered by Item 6
              of Schedule IV of the MRTU and PULP Act cannot be
              sustained at all and the impugned judgment has to be





              and  is   set   aside.  It is however  clarified that the High
              Court was right in concluding that, as per the law laid
              down by this Court, status of permanency could not be
              granted. Thus all orders wherein permanency has been
              granted (except award dated 1-4-1985 in IT No.27 of
              1984) also stand set aside."

      that   unlike   other   statutes,   employer   before   it   did   not   have

      completion of period specified. The said judgment of the Hon.

      practice was upon workmen and there was a finding that the
                             
      breaks given were not artificial.        Looking   to   the   nature   of
                            
      establishment   and  its  activity,   the  Hon'ble  Apex   Court   found

      that   requirement   of   engaging   employees   on   temporary   basis
      


      was writ large. The nature of work/activity of that employer
   



      was   engineering   and   field   service,   undertaking   jobs   of

      industrial   project   installation,   erection,   commissioning   of





      electrical   /   electronic   equipments   supplied   by   it   or   then

      purchased by clients on various projects and sites. Observations





      in paragraph 27 also show that period of employment had all

      along been commensurate with the period of work undertaken

      by   employer   under   respective   contracts.   The   object   behind

      granting   temporary   employment   was,   therefore,   found   to   be

      bona   fide   and   not   actuated   with   any   intention   to   deprive

                Order 503 applicable to MSRTC services is contractual
                in nature and does not have any statutory force. It has

      only in cases where the concerned duly qualified person was

      appointed   in   accordance   with   the   rules   and   so   long   as   a

      permanent post exists. The right conferred by M.S.O. 4-C is not

      absolute. Clause 4-C does not operate either independently or

      Workers  Union   contended that his employment  on  probation




                                                                             
      for   six   months   was   in   contravention   of   the   Standing   Order




                                                    
      which provided only a two month probation period and that he

      automatically became   permanent thereafter. According to the




                                                   
      Standing   Order,   the   workman   could   not   to   be   kept   on

      probation for more than two months. If he had worked during




                                       
      it to the satisfaction of the Company, he became permanent.

      expiry of two months",   the agreement stated, "no, wait till the

      expiry   of   six   months." There  was  thus  a conflict   between  the
      


      agreement and the Standing odder. The Hon'ble Apex   Court
   



      held  that  the  two could not  co-exist and that the  agreement

      was   inconsistent   with   the   Standing   Order   to   the   extent   of





      prescription   of   an   additional   four   months   of   probation.   The

      Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the terms of the employment





      specified in the Standing order prevail over the corresponding

      terms in the contract of service in existence on the date of the

      enforcement of the Standing order. It was however, held that

      while   the   Standing   orders   were   in   force,   it   would   not   be

      permissible to the employer to seek statutory modification of
