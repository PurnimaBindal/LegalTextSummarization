                          These applications have been filed to vacate the order of

                 injunction granted by this Court in O.A.Nos.470 and 471 of 2018 in

                 Plaintiff is from Karnataka and is not at all working for gain in Chennai

                 within the jurisdiction of the Hon'ble Court. The Defendants are from

                 Gujarat and interior Tamil nadu and are not doing business within

                 Chennai jurisdiction of this Court. The suit is fraudulently framed as

                 though to suggest that the Plaintiff commercially deals in safety

                 matches where as in reality Plaintiff are manufacturer and trader in

                 Agarbathi alone. The Plaintiff wantonly played fraud on the Defendant

                 and this Court by suppressing and withholding their clause 34

                 Registration Certificate for the Cycle Brand which expressly shows that

                 the Plaintiff does not commercially manufacture or sell safety matches.

                 The Plaintiff offers safety matches as a compliment to the buyers of

                 cycle brand Agarbathi and has no independent commercial use of Cycle

                 Brand for safety match. The Order has been obtained without placing

                 the registration for cycle brand in Class 34.

                 engaged in the trade of manufacturing and sale of safety matches. The

                 mark "Thilak" and "CHIDYA". Apart from these two Trademarks, the

                 other trademark under brand name "CYCLE" has been adopted in the

                 year 2003 for the goods "SAFETY MATCHES" and hence filed

                 Trademark application in Application No.1386815 under Class 24 on

                 22.09.2009 with user date as 01.05.2003 for sale in the state of

                 Gujarat. The applicants honestly adopted the said Trademark "Cycle"

                 in the year 2003 in respect of Safety Matches. There was none using a

                 similar trademark in respect of the said goods for commercial sale. The

                 applicant application was consciously filed with an area and territorial

                 restriction in order to safeguard their legitimate interests, without any

                 business jealousy.      It is also stated that the applicants are the

                 trading and manufacturing the product "SAFETY MATCHES' under the

                 brand name Cycle since 2003. The Plaintiff has not filed any evidence

                 to show the quantified profit gained by them by using the mark "Cycle"

                 for their complimentary product.       The Plaintiff are not in commercial

                 sale and restricted their mark "Cycle" in respect of safety matches to

                 complimentary       purpose   only.     In   the    absence      of   commercial

                 participation of the Plaintiff in respect of their product "Safety Matches"

                 under the trade mark "Cycle" the Plaintiff cannot assert continuous

                 cause of action.      Hence prayed for vacating the order of injunction

                 have a reputed Trademark "Cycle" and the Cycle Logo with the device

                 of CYCLE in respect of safety matches.        The Plaintiff is a pioneer in the

                 industry of fragrances i.e., incense sticks and other allied products

                 including pooja oil and safety matches. It is only common knowledge

                 that goods such as Agarbathies and safety matches have an

                 inextricable connection and are therefore allied in nature.                Further

                 apart from being separately registered under various classes including

                 in respect of Agarbathies and safety matches, the word mark CYCLE

                 and CYCLE logo with the device of cycle is a house mark of the plaintiff

                 penchant to monopolies the mark CYCLE and CYCLE logo with the

                 knowledge of the Plaintiff's use and reputation. They are aware as to

                 how the Plaintiff uses the mark CYCLE. The use of impugned mark with

                 malafide intention to take undue advantage over the Plaintiff's prior

                 established trademark CYCLE and the CYCLE logo. Hence, prayed for

                 Nos.7501 and 7502 of 2008 vehemently contended that the Plaintiff

                 product safety match with Cycle Brand is not being marketed at all. In

                 fact the Plaintiff has given an affidavit of undertaking before the

                 Trademark Registry to the effect that he had granted certificate "safety

                 matches for complimentary purposes only".             Without being in the

                 market as a product, the plaintiff cannot claim monopoly as it would be

                 trafficking of Trade Mark.     The Plaintiff has knowledge of document

                 using the mark as early as 2007 and sitting quiet. The conduct of the

                 Plaintiff     amounts    to   acquisance      and      suffers      from      the

                 vice of delay and latches. In the said matchbox business Defendant is

                 a prior user. The mark Cycle brand used by the Plaintiff only in respect

                 to Agarbathi business whereas the Defendant is dealing with the Safety

                 Matches. The trade mark for Safety Matches the Defendant is the prior

                 user. The Plaintiff had never sold any Match Box.             The defendants

                 using the trade mark safety matches from 31.5.2003 and the safety

                 matches sale would only in the State of Gujarat. The Application was

                 opposed by the Plaintiff as early as 24.01.2007. The above makes it

                 Agarbathies not regard to the Safety Matches. The Plaintiff themselves

                 admitted that the safety matches with Trade mark cycle are being

                 given as gift along with Three in One Agarbathies Packet. Based on the

                 affidavit,the    Registrar     of    Trade     Mark   passed     an    order    dated

                 07.02.2011 restricting the applicant to use the safety matches for

                 complimentary purpose only. No appeal whatsoever filed against that

                 order.     Therefore, it is very clear that Trade Mark is not for sale or

                 commercial      exploitation    of    safety    matches     which     are   only    for

                 complimentary purposes so has to enhance the marketability of the

                 principal goods namely Agarbathies. The Plaintiff filed present suit and

                 proceeded to plead as if registration has granted for cycle mark for

                 commercial purposes. Therefore, it is his contention that the cycle is

                 not a coined invented word and one cannot claim monopoly or

                 exclusive right on the trade mark 'cycle'.                 In relation to safety

                 matchbox there are already registered trade mark owners with the

                 mark cycle. When the plaintiff is not commercially selling the match

                 boxes he cannot be allowed to enjoy monopoly. Only the persons who

                 purchase the Agarbathies have the notice of the match box of the

                 plaintiff. Safety matches were        only complimentary use which would

                 registered in the name of the Plaintiff. For the Safety Matches also for

                 complimentary purpose, cycle brand was registered.           The Agarbathy

                 Brand has not been used till now. The above judgment also came to

                 be passed on the ground that though the Petitioner has registered the

                 Trade Mark under Class 21 the same was seen in the said class and

                 held that the Petitioner cannot claim monopoly or exclusive right on

                 the Trade Mark Cycle and his right on the ownership of the mark for

                 goods other than Agarbathies is doubtful. In the above judgment the

                 Divsion Bench is also held that the Plaintiff in the present suit has not

                 established the well known trade mark.                 Challenging the above

                 judgment the Plaintiff preferred SLP before the Honourable Supreme

                 Court in SLP(C) No.26979 of 2018 and the same was dismissed by the

                 Honourable Supreme Court. While dismissing the SLP the Honourable

                 Apex Court has held as follows:

                          Trade Mark Act, 1999, will not bind in any other case as the
                          Division Bench is not correct in stating that no evidence was
                          produced in this behalf."

                 Plaintiff mark has reputation.      Such being the position when they

                 acquired     the   mark   and   gained   reputation,    the    defendant who

                 deceptively adopted such mark,       now cannot contend that he is the

                 prior user of the mark as far as the Safety Matches is concerned. As

                 already indicated whether or not he is the prior user is the matter of

                 evidence. It cannot be decided at this stage. Once it shown that the

                 defendant mark is identical and used in respect of similar goods and

                 services the mark is similar to the registered mark of the Plaintiff and

                 there is an identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by

                 the trade mark, the plaintiff is certainly entitled to protect his mark. It

                 is also to be noted that <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_14">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act makes it clear that

                 when the registered trade mark is infringed by a person if uses the

                 mark as identical or similar to the trade mark, but goods or services

                 which are not similar, provided the registered Trade Mark has

                 reputation in India and use of mark without due cause who take unfair

                 advantage of distinctive character       or repute of the registered trade

                 mark. As already indicated the sale of Agarbathi is always go together

                 with complimentary match box. The Plaintiff's mark is also in existence

                 from the year 1954, they have also reputation in the filed of Agarbathi

                 business and allied products. If the defendant is allowed to ride on the

                 reputation of the plaintiff, the same will lead to undue advantage to

                 the Defendants. Therefore, this court is of the view that whether or not

                 the plaintiff is the prior user can be gone only at the stage of trial and

                 not at this stage.     Accordingly, the applications filed to vacate the

                 interim injunction is dismissed and the Interim Injunctions already

                 passed by this Court are made absolute.
