CORAM:-
HON'BLE MR JUSTICE MANMOHAN SINGH

MANMOHAN SINGH, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.         By this common order I propose to dispose of two pending
applications filed by the parties i.e. application being I.A. No.
15532/2011 which has been filed by the plaintiffs under Order XXXIX
Rules 1 &amp; 2 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 read with Section 151 of
CPC and the defendants‟ application being I.A. No. 18390/2011 under
Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC for vacation of ex-parte interim order
granted by the court on 26.09.2011.
</p><p id="p_2">2.          The case of the plaintiffs is that plaintiff No.1 is the
registered proprietors of the trade name/trademark RASNA and its
variants in India in various classes under the provisions of The Trade
marks Act,1999 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) the details of which
are given in para 5 of the plaint. It is also stated that apart from over

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                             Page 1 of 27</span>
 100 registrations of the mark RASNA in India, the plaintiff No.1 is
also holding the registration of the trade mark RASNA and its variants
in many foreign countries as the plaintiffs have also been marketing
and exporting goods under the said Trade Mark. The details of these
trademarks have been provided in para 6 of the plaint.
</p><p id="p_3">3.            The said trade mark RASNA is being used since 1972 in
respect of soft-drink concentrates which is            popular among all
classes of consumers which has acquired            unique   goodwill and
reputation.     The Trade Mark RASNA is a rare word which was
adopted honestly.
</p><p id="p_4">4.            Thus, the plaintiffs are the proprietors of the Trade Mark
and also the owner of copyright of the title RASNA represented in the
style which is unique and amounts to original artistic work within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_1">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright, Act 1957.
</p><p id="p_5">5.            The case of the plaintiffs‟ against the defendants is that in
2011 the plaintiffs came to know that the defendants are selling their
tobacco products under the trademark PAN RASNA which is
deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟ well known mark RASNA. The
mark RASNA is also registered in favour of the plaintiffs for the same
products in which the defendants are         dealing   and therefore also
amounts to infringement of the plaintiffs‟ trademark. According to the
plaintiffs, the defendants are doing so, with mala fide intentions to cash
upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_6">6.            It is stated by the plaintiffs that the use of the trademark
RASNA for selling tobacco products is against the public policy as it
would mislead the young generation who is used to buying RASNA

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                              Page 2 of 27</span>
 products to buy tobacco products which are harmful for health and
would also affect the distinctiveness of the trade name/trademark of the
plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_7">              Therefore the plaintiffs have no option but to file the present
suit for permanent injunction restraining infringement of trade
name/trademark, passing off, delivery up, rendition of accounts of
profit and damages etc. Alongwith the suit, the plaintiffs also filed an
application     under Order XXXIX Rule 2 CPC seeking ad-interim
injunction restraining the defendants.
</p><p id="p_8">7.            The present suit along with the instant application under
Order XXXIX Rules 1 &amp; 2 read with Section 151 of CPC was listed
before the court of 26.09.2011 and on that the court granted ex parte
ad interim injunction in favour of the plaintiffs. The relevant portion of
the said order dated 26.09.2011 reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "Heard counsel for the plaintiffs and also perused the
       plaint, application and the documents filed along with the
       plaint. I am satisfied that it is a fit case for grant of ex
       parte ad interim injunction. Accordingly till the next date
       of hearing, the defendant, their proprietors, partners,
       principal officers, servants, agents are restrained from
       manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising,
       directly or indirectly dealing in tobacco products, edible
       products and related cognate or allied goods using the
       trade mark PAN RASNA or any mark/name, which is
       deceptively similar to the plaintiffs trade mark/trade name
       RASNA."
</blockquote><p id="p_9">8.          The court further appointed local commissioners to visit the
premises of the defendants and seize and seal all the infringing goods.
The Local Commissioners visited the premises of the defendants at
Mumbai and in Delhi on 04.10.2011 and seized impugned products of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                                Page 3 of 27</span>
 the defendants.
</p><p id="p_10">9.         On 21.11.2011 the defendant Nos. 1 to 3 filed I.A.
No.18390/2011 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 for vacation of the order
dated 26.09.2011 of interim injunction. In the application it is stated by
the defendants that they are a well established group of companies
since over five decades they have been exporting un-manufactured leaf
tobacco to over 75 countries. The defendants have pioneered hookah
retailing in India with defendant No.3 providing a wide array of
hookahs sourced from around the world and a variety of assorted
flavours of tobacco molasses under the brand name „AFZAL‟.
According to the plaintiffs, for the past several years, the brand name
„AFZAL‟ has been registered as a trademark in various classes
including class 34 by M/s Sopariwala Exports Group of Companies,
which has not been made a party to this suit.
</p><p id="p_11">10.        As per the defendants, „PAN RASNA‟ is not a trademark
and is only one of the many flavoured tobacco being sold under the
trademark „AFZAL‟ in the showrooms of defendant No.3, hookah bars
and other specified outlets where only tobacco, hookah/shishah and
other related products.
</p><p id="p_12">11.        The said tobacco related products and the packaging bear
the mark „AFZAL‟ in larger font than the term PAN RASNA. The
plaintiff is not using the said goods. The alleged registration obtained
by the plaintiff No.1 in the same class is bad and is liable to be
rectified under <a href="/doc/232464/" id="a_2">Section 47</a> of the Act on account of non user, therefore,
no case of infringement of trade mark or passing off is made out.
</p><p id="p_13">12.        It is further stated by the defendants that they are engaged

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                             Page 4 of 27</span>
 in the manufacturing/selling of tobacco products. „PAN RASNA‟ is
one of the many quality mark manufactured/sold by the Defendants.
Use of their packaging of the product, it is evident that the term „PAN
RASNA‟ is being used alongwith the brand name "Afzal". The
labelling, packaging and the entire trade dress of their products is under
the trademark „AFZAL‟ which is prominently indicated.                The
consumers and public at large are well aware of the products of the
defendants and identify the same as AFZAL being fully conscious of
the fact that the additional terms used such as apple/strawberry/mint
/"PAN RASNA" only describe and indicate the flavour. Hence there is
no confusion and deception in the market with the products of the
Plaintiff as two channels are totally different.      The Plaintiffs are
primarily into food/beverages related products whereas the Defendants
are engaged in manufacturing of tobacco related products. The product
having the flavour „PAN RASNA‟ is being sold at retail item in the
shops/outlet of the Defendants. Hence it cannot be said that the product
of the Defendants „PAN RASNA‟ can in any manner is passed off as
the product of the Plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_14">13.         Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior counsel appearing on
behalf of the defendants also argued that defendants are not using
„PAN RASNA‟ as a trade mark at all, but are only using it as a
flavour. Reliance in support has been placed on <a href="/doc/75117161/" id="a_3">Nestle India Limited
v. Mood Hospitality Private Limited</a>; 2010 (42) PTC 514
(paragraphs 29 - 34), wherein the expression „Yo!‟ was held not as a
trade mark but only as a descriptive term and therefore the necessary
ingredient of <a href="/doc/202028/" id="a_4">section 29</a> (1) is missing.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                             Page 5 of 27</span>
<p id="p_15"> 14.        According to Mr. Chandra, term "RASNA" is descriptive as
„Rasna‟ means (1) tongue; (2) taste; (3) to feel delight, or ecstasy
(Oxford Hindi - English dictionary). Hence, the term „PAN
RASNA‟ describes the liking towards the flavour of Pan. The use of
the term is, therefore, descriptive within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_5">Section 35</a> of
the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (Act) as the use of the Defendants is a
bonafide which describes the character or quality of its goods.
</p><p id="p_16">           Further, as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_6">Section 30</a> (2)(a) of the
Act, a registered mark is not infringed where the use in relation to
goods indicates the kind, quality or other characteristics of the goods.
The Plaintiff cannot therefore claim proprietary rights over a term
which is descriptive and indicative of characteristic, nature or attribute
of the product and which has become common to the trade. The
Defendants rely on <a href="/doc/204866/" id="a_7">Cadila Healthcare Ltd v. Gujarat Co-operative
Milk Marketing Federation Limited and Ors</a>. 2008 (36) PTC 168 -
paragraph 54.
</p><p id="p_17">15.        It is further argued by Mr. Chandra that the plaintiffs just
have a mere registration for the trade mark „Rasna‟ in Class 34 in
relation to tobacco and related products. The said registration is under
challenge as the defendants have filed rectification proceedings to
rectify the same on the basis of non-use and which is likely to be
allowed, therefore, the plaintiffs is not entitled for any protection or
have any right to claim monopoly of the word RASNA and the ex-parte
order is liable to be vacated.
</p><p id="p_18">16.        The defendants are using the term „PAN RASNA‟
bonafidely for at least last 3 years continuously, openly and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                             Page 6 of 27</span>
 uninterruptedly. The plaintiff is not entitled to interfere with the
bonafide and continuous and prior use of the defendants‟ product with
the term „PAN RASNA‟ as stipulated under <a href="/doc/1695816/" id="a_8">Section 34</a> (a) of the Act.
The law on superiority of prior adoption and use of a trade mark viz-a-
viz prior registration has been discussed in <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_9">Century Traders v. Roshan
Lal Duggar &amp; Co</a>. AIR 1978 Delhi 1978 250 at paragraph numbers
10 to 14.
</p><p id="p_19">17.         Lastly it was argued by Mr. Chandra that the balance of
convenience is in their favour because they are exporting un-
manufactured leaf tobacco to over 75 countries since over five decades.
The defendants are suffering on a day to day basis by operation of the
order dated 26.09.2011. The goods worth as about 500 samples of the
goods have been seized and goods worth about Rs 1.65 crore are held
up as the same cannot be sold by operation of the order dated
26.09.2011. The plaintiffs on the other hand are in no way effected by
the sale of the defendants‟ products bearing „PAN RASNA‟ and no
prejudice, harm, loss and injury is being caused to the plaintiffs in case
the interim order is vacated.
</p><p id="p_20">18.         The following are the points under consideration in order
to decide the pending applications :
</p><p id="p_21">(a)   Whether by use of mark PAN RASNA/RASNA in relation to
      tobacco product, the defendants are committing infringement of
      plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark which was admittedly not used
      by the    plaintiffs   in relation to the similar products of the
      defendants and whether the defendants are guilty of passing off
      their goods as that of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                             Page 7 of 27</span>
<p id="p_22"> (b)   Whether the defendants      are using the mark RASNA in the
      manner which can be considered as such use is merely to
      describe as one of their flavours.
</p><p id="p_23">(c)   Whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of the
      defendants in view of submissions made by defendants and
      which party will suffer incase the interim order granted would
      continue.
</p><p id="p_24">19.       In order to determine the controversy raised, the specimen
of user made by the defendants of their products are reproduced
herebelow :

<p id="p_25"> 20.         Admittedly, PAN RASNA is one of the flavours of the
defendants. The details of 47 flavours in relation to their products are
given as under :

defendants are using one of flavours PAN RASNA. They are also
using the word ROOH AFZA which is mentioned at Item No.xxxi as
one of the flavours which is not the subject matter of the present suit.
Infringement of Trade Marks

</p><p id="p_27">22.          As already stated, the trade mark RASNA is being used by
the plaintiffs for the last 40 years in respect of soft drink concentrates.
It is a registered trade mark in relation to various goods other than
concentrates included Pan Masala and tobacco, though the plaintiffs
have not used the mark in relation to goods tobacco products as used
by the defendants. The following rights are conferred by means of

      relation to goods they are regarded, by a substantial

      coming from a particular source, known or unknown;
      it is not necessary that the name of the plaintiff‟s firm
      should be known .....The plaintiff must further prove
      that the defendant‟s use of name or mark was likely
      or calculated to deceive, and thus cause confusion
      and injury, actual or probable, to the goodwill and the
      plaintiff‟s business, as for example, by depriving him
      of the profit that he might have had by selling the
      goods which ex hypothesis, the purchaser intended to
      buy. Thus, the cause of action involves a combination
      of distinctiveness of the plaintiff‟s name or mark and
      an injurious use by the defendant of the name or
      mark and an injurious use by the defendant of the
      name or mark or a similar name or mark, sign, picture

the Bench are reproduced as follows :

            identical with the registered mark of the plaintiff.
            If the mark is found to be identical, no further
            question arises, and it has to be held that there
            was infringement. If the mark of the defendant is
            not identical, it has to be seen whether the mark
            of the defendant is receptively similar in the sense
            I hat it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in
            relation to goods in respect of which the plaintiff
            got his mark registered. For that purpose, the two
            marks have to be compared, 'not by placing them
            side by side. but by asking itself whether having
            due regard to relevant surrounding circumstances,
            the defendant's mark as used is similar to the
            plaintiff's mark as it would be remembered by
            persons possessed of an average memory with its
            usual imperfections', and it has then to be

             "Taw". The device comprised of a representation

             eyes were drawn in. the form of a motor ear
             headlamps and the whole was superimposed upon

             manner as to substitute the cat's head for She

             that was the subject matter of challenge consisted
             of a square panel with informative particulars

              associated therewith. It does not matter whether
              the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise.
              The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play
              are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the
              world of business. Secondly, when a person adopts
              or intends to adopt a name in connection with his

far as the provisions referred by the defendants are concerned, no doubt
incase the defendants are using the term or word which is descriptive
and the defendants describe the same in the nature or attribute the

Healthcare Ltd. v. Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation
Ltd. and Ors</a>. (supra), do not help the case of the defendants. In the
first case, the learned Division Bench in para 40 of the judgment has
clearly come to the conclusion that there is nothing on record to
establish, even prima facie, that the latter trade mark has been so
continuously or extensively used that it has developed a reputation in
India. In para 41, there is also finding given by the learned Division
Bench that there is a plausible explanation given by the appellant,
therefore, it cannot be said that the mark „Yo‟ was used without due
cause and mere use of the word „Yo‟ would not bring it within the
mischief of clause (c) of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_33">section 29(4)</a>.
</p><p id="p_44">38.        In the second case, the mark Sugar Free was used by the
plaintiff for the products which substitutes sugar free and the defendant
was allowed to use the word "Sugar Free" only in its descriptive sense
and not as a trade mark. The said situation is missing in the present
case.
</p><p id="p_45">39.        In the present case, the mark RASNA is a registered trade
mark of the plaintiffs which is being used by them for the last forty
years and it has acquired goodwill and reputation as per the material
placed on record. The said trade mark has also been protected from
time to time. After having examination of defendants‟ products which

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                           Page 23 of 27</span>
 are   scanned   and are shown in para 19 of my order, prima facie
establishes that the defendants intend to use it as a sub brand and not in
descriptive sense. Thus, the present case and the cases referred to by
the defendants are materially different.
</p><p id="p_46">40.        From the above, it is clear that the use of the mark RASNA
by the defendants as a name or sub-mark amounts to infringement even
if the registered trade mark is not used by the plaintiffs as there is no
requirement of user under the provisions of infringement of trade mark
or conferring the exclusive rights granted by virtue of registration,
non user is a one of the defence which may be considered by the
courts while deciding the interim application. It is a practice in law
that till the time the registered trade mark is entered in the register, no
one is entitled to infringe the same unless the court comes to the
conclusion the mark adopted and used by the defendants is covered
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_34">Section 30</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_35">35</a> of the Act and such user is not
made in bad faith.
</p><p id="p_47">41.        In the present case, RASNA is prima facie cannot be said
to be descriptive mark in view of the averments made by the plaintiffs
in the plaint and documents placed on record. At the most the word
RAS in relation to soft drink concentrates can be suggestive word
which describe the character and quality of the goods. Mr. Praveen
Anand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs          gave
proposal to settle the matter and his clients have no objection if the
defendants may amend the use of mark PAN RAS instead of RASNA.
The suggestion given by the plaintiffs was not acceptable to the
defendants.

<p id="p_48"> Conduct of the defendants

</p><p id="p_49">42.         It is not understood as to why the defendants have chosen
the mark RASNA in relation to tobacco products when the defendants
have already had the mark BOMBAY PAN as one of the flavours. It
is also surprised to note that the defendants are using the name Rooh
Afza which is the known Trade Mark of Hamdard Dawakhana. It
appears to the court that these names are used by the defendants in
order to impress the    customers    that the   defendants have some
association with these companies. Incase the defendants are allowed
to use the name RASNA, tomorrow they will use the name PAN
PEPSI/PAN LIMCA/PAN AQUAFINA etc. as other flavours. The
products in question already contain the warning that "it is injurious to
health" and it causes cancer.    The mark which has already acquired
residual goodwill and reputation if used by another party other than real
owner, there would be fair chances of danger of tarnishment and
dilution of the same, otherwise, Hukkah tobacco manufactured by the
defendants do not have either the PAN RAS ingredient or any content
which can cure the soul as the defendants are using the expression
ROOH AFZA. The said claim of the defendants in nature of flavour
gives in the indication of False Trade Description and is untrue within
the knowledge of the defendants.
</p><p id="p_50">43.        In my view that there is        hardly any hardship to the
defendants incase the interim order granted would continue. The
balance of convenience also does not lie in favour of the defendants. If
the defendants are allowed to use the name RASNA or part of PAN
RASNA, no doubt the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm not only

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">C.S.(OS) No.2397/2011                                           Page 25 of 27</span>
 financially but also to their goodwill and reputation. Thus, the adoption
of the said name is not with bonafide intention but it appears that it
was deliberate with malafide intention on the part of defendants in
order to take the advantage of known trade mark in the market.
</p><p id="p_51">44.         As far as the existence of stock is concerned as well as the
goods seized by the Local Commissioner which are               given on
superdari, the defendants are allowed to sell the same after deletion or
obliteration of the mark RASNA from them, they are also entitled to
export the same. The defendants are also entitled to use the mark
PAN RAS or any other expression except the word RASNA on their
products.
</p><p id="p_52">45.         For the aforesaid reasons, the application of the defendants
under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC is dismissed as there is no merit. On the
otherhand the plaintiffs‟ application under Order 39 R 1 and 2 CPC
being IA No.15532/2011 is allowed. The defendants during the
pendency of the suit are restrained to use the mark RASNA in relation
to Tobacco products including Pan Masala.         Both applications are
accordingly disposed of.
