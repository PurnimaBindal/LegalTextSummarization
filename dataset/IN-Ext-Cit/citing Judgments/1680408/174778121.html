     No.7481/2009 &amp; WP (S) No.1159 of 2010, respectively, by

     which the appointment of the petitioners on the post of

     Shiksha Karmi Grade - III has been cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.   The brief facts of the case, as projected by the
petitioners, are that the petitioners were appointed on
the post of Shiksha Karmi, Grade III after due selection
process and after due verification of the documents. The
selection process of the petitioners was conducted in
accordance with the provisions as enshrined in
Chhattisgarh Panchayat Shiksha Karmis (Recruitment and  
Conditions of Service) Rules, 1997 (for short `the
Rules, 1997'). Thereafter, some complaints were received
by the Collector, Raipur preferred by some unsuccessful
candidates who had participated in the selection
process. The Sub Divisional Officer conducted an enquiry
on the basis of the aforestated complaints and submitted
an enquiry report to the Collector. Thereafter, the
Collector, cancelled the appointment of the petitioners
to the post of Shiksha Karmi Grade III by
the orders as stated in para 2 of this judgment.  Thus,
these         petitions.
</p><p id="p_7">4.   Shri Manoj Paranjape, Ms Sharmila Singhai, Shri
Jitendra Pali, Shri Varun Sharma and Shri Sunil Sahu,
Advocates, learned counsel appearing for the respective
petitioners, would submit that while passing the
impugned orders, the Collector has acted with material
irregularity and illegality.  The Collector has not at
all appreciated the provisions of Section 85 of the
Chhattisgarh Panchayat Raj Adhiniyam, 1993 (for short
"the Adhiniyam, 1993") in its true perspective.  The
enquiry proceedings have been initiated behind the back
of the petitioners and the copy of enquiry report has
not been supplied to the petitioners. The impugned
orders have been passed without following the basic
principles of natural justice, which is not at all
sustainable in the eyes of law.
</p><p id="p_8">5.   Learned counsel would further submit that the
impugned orders have been passed on the allegations that
the petitioners have obtained the appointment by playing
fraud and stigmatic order has been passed without
holding proper enquiry.  The Director Panchayat has also
passed the impugned order without appreciating the
grounds raised in memo of appeal and has further upheld
the order of the Collector in holding that the Collector
has exercised the power under Section 85 (1) of the
Adhiniyam, 1993 rightly.
</p><p id="p_9">6.   On the other hand, Shri M.P.S. Bhatia, Deputy
Government Advocate for the State, Shri Arun Sao, Shri
Pankaj Shrivastava and Shri Dinesh RK Tiwari, Advocates
for the respective respondents, would submit that the
after receipt of the complaints with regard to some
illegalities at the time appointment of Shiksha Karmis,
the enquiry committee was constituted and during the
course of enquiry proceedings, the Tahsildar recorded
the statements of the petitioners in which they
categorically stated that they have not submitted any
forged documents and their appointment was in accordance 
with law.  In the meanwhile, the enquiry committee
ascertained about the veracity of documents from the
concerned institutes from where it was found that the
documents produced by the petitioners were forged one.
After completing all the process, the enquiry report was
prepared and submitted before the authorities.  On the
basis of the enquiry report, proper show cause notices
were issued to the petitioners, after receipt of their
reply, recorded the statements of the petitioners and
after going through all the aspects of the matter, the
cancellation of appointment of the petitioners was
passed.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the impugned
action has been taken behind the back of the
petitioners.  Thus, the petitioners are not entitled to
any relief and the petitions may be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_10">7.   I have heard learned counsel appearing for the
parties, perused the pleadings and the documents
appended thereto.
</p><p id="p_11">8.   The Collector by order dated 27-11-2007 (Annexure -
R4/6) directed the Sub Divisional Officer (Revenue),
Baloda Bazar, District Raipur, to hold an enquiry on the
complaint made by one Dinesh Kumar Chandrakar regarding   
irregularities and illegalities, as under :

2008 (Annexure - R4/8) the Sub Divisional Officer came
to the conclusion holding that out of 133 Shiksha
Karmis, information could be received in case of 97
candidates.  In all the 97 cases, the documents
submitted by them were found forged, as the said
documents were not issued by the concerned departments/  
institutions.  It was held that since the testimonials
submitted by them were forged/false and, as such, they
were not eligible for selection.

     suo  motu  in revision and reversed the  order  of

     appointment after affording proper opportunity  of

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">15.  Contention of learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners that a show cause notice, after preliminary
enquiry, without supplying a copy of the preliminary
enquiry report was violative of basic principles of
natural justice, as the petitioners were not in a
position to respond to the report when on the basis of
the said report final order was proposed to be passed,
cannot be countenanced. 
</blockquote><p id="p_18">16.  In support of the contention, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioners placed reliance upon
several decisions of the Supreme Court as well as this
Court.
</p><p id="p_19">17.  The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1590667/" id="a_9">State of U.P. v. Mohammad  
Nooh1</a>, held that "it cannot then be laid down as an
inflexible rule of law that the superior court must deny
the writ when an inferior Court or tribunal by
discarding all principles of natural justice and all
accepted rules of procedure arrived at a conclusion
which shocks the sense of justice and fair play merely
because such decision has been upheld by another  
inferior court or tribunal on appeal or revision."
</p><p id="p_20">18.  The facts of Mohammad Nooh (supra) are not 
applicable to the instant case, as the basic requirement
of natural justice to afford an opportunity of hearing
in the preliminary enquiry and thereafter, second show
cause notice before passing the impugned order was 
afforded to the petitioners and this is also not a case
where the writ Court has declined to entertain this
petition on the ground that the order of Collector has
been affirmed by the Director Panchayat.
</p><p id="p_21">19.  The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1470339/" id="a_10">Union of India &amp; Ors. V. S.K.
Kapoor2</a>, held that copy of the report has to be supplied
in advance to delinquent employee.  This is a case where
the enquiry was conducted in absence of the delinquent
employee whereas in the instant case the delinquent
employees were afforded full opportunity of hearing.
</p><p id="p_22">20.  The case of <a href="/doc/1831036/" id="a_11">Mohinder Singh Gill and another v. The
Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi</a> and others3, is
not applicable to the facts of the present case.
</p><p id="p_23">21.  The case of <a href="/doc/165105/" id="a_12">Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v.
Darius Shapur Chenai</a> and others4, which was the case of 
land acquisition, is not applicable to the facts of the
present case.  The other decision cited by the
petitioners i.e. <a href="/doc/76884/" id="a_13">Hukum Chand Shyam Lal v. Union of India</a>
and others5, is also not applicable.
</p><p id="p_24">22.  The decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1896849/" id="a_14">U.P. State
Road Transport Corporation and another v. Mohd. Ismail</a>
and others6 deals with the exercise of discretion by the
holder of a public office.  The exercise should be
judicious and in furtherance of accomplishment of the
purpose of power.
</p><p id="p_25">23.  In  the  instant  cases, I  have  not  found  that

     exercise done by the Collector was in any way deficient

     or irregular, as contended by the learned counsel for

     the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_26">24.  Reliance of the petitioners upon the decision of
this Court in Durgesh Prasad Sinha v. State of
Chhattisgarh7 and other connected matters, is not
relevant in this case, as the petitioners were granted
proper opportunity of hearing before the orders were
passed.

                         justice  is  not   unruly
                         horse. The principles  of
                              natural justice  are
                         required  to be  complied
                         with,  having  regard  to
                         the    facts    situation
                         obtained  therein.  Thus,
                         the principles of natural
                         justice   may   not    be
                         required  to be  followed
                         in  the cases, where  the
                         facts    are    admitted.</blockquote>

<p id="p_32">26.  The   contention  of  the  petitioners  that   the

     Collector ought not to have exercised his power to

     cancel the appointment under the provisions of <a href="/doc/138486/" id="a_24">Section

     85</a> (1) of the Adhiniyam, 1993, as it deals with only

     suspension, does not merit acceptance.
</p>
<p id="p_33">27.  So far as power of the Collector is concerned,
there is no gainsaying that the Collector has no power
to set aside the order of appointment.  The Collector in
exercise of his revisionary power under Rule 5 of the
Rules, 1995 can take up the matter suo motu and take 
final decision to reverse the order of appointment after
affording proper opportunity of hearing to the
petitioners.
</p><p id="p_34">28.  Admittedly, the petitioners were afforded an
opportunity of hearing during enquiry and thereafter
show cause notice was issued before passing the order of
cancellation of appointment.  Even it is stated, at the
bar, by the respondents that after show cause notice the
petitioners were afforded an opportunity of hearing and
got their statements recorded, before the Collector.
From the said facts, it is crystal clear that the
principles of natural justice was complied with full
force.  There was no violation of fair play-in-action.
</p><p id="p_35">29.  So far as power of the Collector is concerned, it
is well established that "when there are two sources of
power, even if one is not applicable, the order will not
become invalid if the power of the statutory authority
can be treated to another source."  (See : High Court of
<a href="/doc/1046518/" id="a_25">Gujarat and Another v. Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor Panchayat  
and Others22</a>).

                    well-settled principle of  law
                         that mentioning of a wrong
                    provision or non-mentioning of
                    any provision of law would, by

                    a  court  if  it is  otherwise
