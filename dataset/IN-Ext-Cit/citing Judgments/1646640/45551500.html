                   public, for the control of the production, supply and distribution of, and

                   trade and commerce in certain commodities.        Section 2(e) of EC Act

                   defines sugar to mean (i) any form of sugar containing more than 90%

                   of sucruose, including sugar candy; (ii) khandsari sugar or bura sugar or

                   the purposes of the EC Act, “essential commodity” means a commodity

                   specified in the schedule.     <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> deals with power to control

                   2009, the Central Government amended the provisions of the EC Act, to

                   make provision for validation of certain orders issued by the Central

                   Government determining the prices of levy sugar and actions taken

                   under those orders and for matters connected therewith.                The

                   Amendment and <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_9">Validation Act</a>, came to be passed on account of the

                   conflicting decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as to the factors to

                   be taken into consideration in determining price of levy sugar.

                   Accordingly, <a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> of the Act was amended and Explanation II was

                   taken etc., under specified orders issued under sub-section (3C) of the

                   General Clauses Act, 1897, since it applies only to enactments and

                   power of the Government of India under Section 3 of the EC Act, will not

                   fall within the definition of enactment under the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_14">General Clauses Act</a>. It

                   is further submitted that a regulation may be a Rule, but not vice versa

                   and in the present case, the Control Order is neither an Act nor a

                   is presently passing through one of the most challenging times, with

                   National Sugar Production a out striping the domestic consumption for

                   the fourth year in a row. This position is further worsened by the glut in

                   equilibrium in the domestic market by resort to export. It is stated that

                   the domestic sugar price has registered a steep fall during 2012-13,

                   crushing season from Rs.3600/- per quintal in September 2012 to

                   Petition was filed, it was around Rs.2500/- per quintal.     Thus, all the

                   private sector Sugar Mills are suffering huge losses, which has crossed

                   Rs.15,000 crores as of 28.02.2015 and despite the huge interest free

                   loan of Rs.6600 crores made available by the Government of India. This

                   has lead to a situation where financing banks were averse to extending

                   further working capital finances to sugar industries. It is further

                   submitted that the Government of India has fixed provisional “L” factor

                   only for Tamil Nadu &amp; Pondicherry zone and not for any other State and

                   this is discriminatory. It is submitted that as on date, clause (5A) and

                   Second Schedule to the Control Order have been omitted and the “L”

                   factor cannot be fixed without violating the Control Order and as on

                   date, there is no power to determine “L” factor much less provisional “L”

                   factor.   It is submitted that even when clause (5A) and the Second

                   Schedule were there in the Control Order, “L” factor can be fixed by

                   taking note of empirical data of the entire country and not two States

                   alone.    Further, it is submitted that even assuming, there is power to

                   determine the “L” factor, the private Sugar Mills are entitled to plead set

                   off, since they have made payments to the cane growers namely, the

                   payments made on the state advisory price, which is over the price fixed

                   under clause 3 of the Control Order.

                   report on or before 18.03.2052.           The second communication dated

                   13.03.2015 is in continuation of first communication dated 11.03.2015

                   calling upon the officers of various sugar mills to attend a meeting to

                   meet    the   Chief   Accountant/Accounts     Officer   along    with   relevant

                   particulars as mentioned in the said communication.             Thus, what has

                   been questioned in the writ petition are not orders passed by the

                   authorities but the communication sent to them for computing the

                   additional cane price. Thus, the learned Additional Solicitor General is

                   right in his submission that the writ petitions are premature. However, I

                   do not propose to non-suit the petitioner on the said ground because

                   elaborate arguments were advanced by the learned counsels on either

                   side and therefore, proceed to consider the plea raised by the petitioner

                   and countered by the respondents.

                   10A of the Central Excise Rules.     Before the High Court one of the

                   contentions raised on behalf of the appellants before the Hon'ble

                   Supreme Court was that the said Rule stood deleted and new Rule 10

                   deletion and introduction of a new provision was that the old Rules

                   application in the case because it does not apply to the repeal of

                   statutory rules and also because it applies only where there is a repeal

                   by a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_51">Central Act</a> whereas in the said case, repeal was by a notification.

                   After noting the definitions of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_52">Central Act</a> as defined under <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_53">Section 3(7)</a>,

                   Enactment as defined in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_54">Section 3(19)</a>, Regulation as defined in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_55">Section

                   held that <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_57">Section 6</a> of the General Clauses Act only applies to repeals

                   and not to omissions and applies when repeal is of a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_58">Central Act</a> or

                   Regulation and not of a Rule. Further it was pointed out that when the

                   legislature by clear and unambiguous language extended the provision

                   of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_59">Section 6</a> to cases of repeal of a “<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_60">Central Act</a>” or “Regulation”, it is not

                   possible to apply the provision to cases of repeal of a “Rule”. Further it

                   was held that the position will not be different even if the Rule has been

                   framed by virtue of the power vested under an enactment; it remains a

                   “Rule” and takes it colour from the definition of the term in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_61">Act

                   (General Clauses Act</a>). It was pointed out that in such cases, the Court

                   is to look to the provision in the Rule which has been introduced after

                   omission   of   the   previous   Rule     to   determine   whether   pending

                   proceedings will continue or lapse. If there is a provision therein that

                   pending proceedings shall continue and be disposed of under the old

                   Rule as if the Rule has not been deleted or omitted, then such

                   proceedings will continue. Further if the case is covered by <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_62">Section 6</a> of

                   the General Clauses Act or there is a pari materia provision in the

                   statute under which the Rule has been framed, in that case also pending

                   proceedings will not be affected by the provision of the Rule.         It was

                   further held that in the absence of any such provision in the statute or in

                   the Rule, the pending proceedings would lapse on the Rule under which

                   the    notice   was   issued   or   proceedings   were    initiation   being

                   deleted/omitted. It was further held that the normal effect of repealing

                   a statute or deleting a provision is to obliterate it from the statute book

                   as completely as if it had never been passed and the statute must be

                   considered as a law that never existed. To this Rule, an exception was

                   engrafted by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_63">Section 6(1)</a> of the General Clauses Act.

                   It was pointed out that if a provision of a statute is unconditionally

                   omitted without a saving clause in favour of pending proceedings, all

                   actions must stop where omissions finds them and if final relief has not

                   been granted before omission goes into effect, it cannot be granted

                   afterwards. Further it was pointed that when a particular provision in a

                   statute is omitted and in its place another provision dealing with the

                   same contingency is introduced without a saving clause in favour of

                   pending proceedings, then it can be reasonably inferred that the

                   intention of the legislature is that the pending proceedings shall not

                   the repeal of an enactment effaces the repealed statute from the statute

                   book abinitio thereby creating a fiction in law that such a statute never

                   the    question   which   was   considered   is   whether   omissions   of   a

                   compounded levy scheme in 2001 wipes out the liability of the assessee

                   for the period during which the scheme was in operation. In the said

                   case, the High Court had held that on omission the liability of the

                   assessee was not wiped out. Before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it was

                   argued that omission would amount to a repeal for the purposes of

                   would therefore include within it the omissions made by legislature.

                   While answering the question, it was held that on a conjoint reading of

                   the three expressions “delete”, “omit” and “repeal”, it becomes clear

                   that “delete” and “omit” are used interchangeable, so that when the

                   expression “repeal” refers to delete it would necessarily take within its

                   ken an omission as well. It was pointed out that there is no substance

                   in the argument that “repeal” amounts to an obliteration from the very

                   beginning whereas omission is only in futuro.      Thus, it was held that

                   omission being tantamount to a deletion as a form of repeal.

                   consequently omission of second schedule with effect from 22.10.2009

                   leads to a situation where the first respondent has no jurisdiction to

                   determine the "L" factor for the sugar seasons 2004-05 to 2008-09.

                   The argument is further supplemented by contending that the omission

                   of second schedule with effect from 22.10.2009 is a deletion and no

                   true that the Central Government thought fit to introduce a different

                   price called as a fair and remunerative price, wherein several factors

                   were to be taken note of while fixing the price. This was to ensure that

                   the interest of agriculturist is protected. The agriculturist get a fair deal

                   for their produce. The fixation had to be on scientific terms taking into

                   consideration all relevant parameters. Thus, sufficient thought process

                   has gone into to determine as to what are the factors which are to be

                   taken note of for arriving at the FRP.              Admittedly, prior to the

                   introduction of FRP, SMP was the price payable to the cane growers.

                   of sugarcane is made to the sugar mills.            Though subsequently the

                   determining fair price and brought about FRP that would not in any

                   manner affect the rights of the cane growers to be entitled to SMP, as it

                   was very much available in the Sugarcane (Control) Order at the

                   relevant time during which supply of sugarcane has been done.

                   retrospectively unless any power in that regard has been specifically

                   Central Government as on date could not have fixed "L" factor or

                   provisional "L" factor after 2009 amendment. As pointed out earlier, the

                   rights have accrued with the cane growers and this right which has

                   accrued for all the relevant years upto the year 2009 cannot be

                   obliterated or wiped away by virtue of the amendment introducing a

                   in my considered view, the question of going into as to what is the effect

                   of repeal or omission or deletion becomes entirely academic in the facts

                          Tobacco Co. Ltd. vs. CTO, (1975) 3 SCC 512, held that
                          repeal is not a matter of mere form but is of substance,
                          depending on the intention of the legislature.           If the
                          intention indicated either expressly or by necessary
                          implication in the subsequent statute was to abrogate or
                          wipe off the former enactment wholly or in part, then it
                          would be a case of total or pro tanto repeal. If the
                          intention was merely to modify the former enactment by
                          engrafting an exception or granting an exemption, or by
                          super-adding conditions, or by restricting, intercepting or
                          suspending its operation, such modification would not
                          amount to a repeal. Broadly speaking, the principal object
                          of a repealing and amending Act is to 'excise dead matter,
                          prune off superfluities and reject clearly inconsistent
                          enactments'.

                   decision is that the substance depending on the intention of the

                   legislature has to be borne in mind. As pointed out earlier, the right to

                   be entitled to a fair SMP accrued in favour of the cane growers and it

                   became vested right and merely because, a new type of procedure was

                   prescribed to determine the fair price payable to the cane growers, it

                   cannot destroy the accrued and vested rights and by introducing a new

                   procedure after 2009, the Government was clear in its intention to

                   preserve      all   rights   and   liabilities   under    the   earlier    Control

                   profits made from that business in future years. The right of carrying

                   forward and set off accrued to the assessee under the Act of 1922. It

                   was held that a right which had accrued and had become vested

                   continued to be capable of being enforced notwithstanding the repeal of

                   the statute under which the right accrued unless the repealing statute

                   took away such right expressly or by necessary implication.



</p><p id="p_114">                          43.Nowhere in the amendment which came into force in 2009

                   there is any such intention to obliterate or to deny the benefit which has

                   accrued in favour of the cane growers.   The Central Government is right

                   in its stand in contending that the Sugarcane Control Amendment Order,

                   2009 dated 22.10.2009 is prospective in effect from the date of its

                   publication in the official gazette and as said, the Sugar mills are

                   required to pay additional cane price as determined by the State

                   Government under Clause 5A of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 upto

                   sugar season 2008-09.     Further, it is to be noted that nowhere in the

                   Control Order there is any time limit fixed for arriving at the "L" factor.

                   Therefore, such a ground cannot be canvassed by the petitioner to deny

                   and defeat the vested rights of the cane growers.       Furthermore, the

                   petitioner Association as well as its members have stated that they have


http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                         58</span>

                   paid the cane growers more than what they are required to pay.           In

                   otherwords contending that if at all any additional cane price is to be

                   determined, then it would be a case where excess payment has already

                   been made and the members of the petitioner Association would be

                   entitled to plead set off.       Thus, the members of the petitioner

                   Association were clear in their mind that this statutory liability cannot be

                   avoided, it is a vested right of the cane growers and the present plea

                   before this Court citing the amendment of the Control Order in the year

                   2009 is a far fetched plea and liable to be rejected. Financial hardship

                   and difficulties can hardly be a mitigating factor in the case on hand.

                   The cane growers is pitted against the sugar manufacturers. If both are

                   put on a scale, undoubtedly the scale will tilt in favour of the cane

                   growers/agriculturists. Thus, financial hardship or difficulties can hardly

                   be a reason to avoid the liability.

                   growers are entitled to additional cane price.      One of the factor for

                   determining the additional cane price is the "L" factor and the

                   been questioned on any other ground except on the ground that after

                   2009, i.e. after the amendment such power cannot be exercised. This

                   argument has been rejected by holding that whatever is the law

                   applicable for the period in question would apply. Thus, in the absence

                   of any other challenge to the power of the Central Government to fix the

                   "L" factor, it hardly matters whether it is the provisional "L" factor or a

                   final "L" factor, after getting the empirical data the amount will be

                   calculated and that power is delegated by the Government under

                   <a href="/doc/1006024/" id="a_109">Section 5</a> of the Act and the competent authority is the second

                   respondent.    Therefore, the contention advanced by the petitioner on

                   this ground also does not merit acceptance.

</p><p id="p_119">                          46.An argument was advanced that "L" factor has not been

                   determined or fixed by the Central Government for any other State in

                   the Country except in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and therefore, it is

                   discriminatory and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_110">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. I

                   do not agree with the said submission for more than one reason. Firstly,

                   action was taken by the Government to determine the "L" factor

                   pursuant to the direction issued by this Court in W.P.Nos.531, and 532 of

                   2015 and 2369 of 2015 filed by the third respondent Association.

                   Therefore, the Central Government has complied with the direction

                   issued by the Court and proceeded to fix the "L" factor. Secondly there

                   is no restriction or embargo in the Act or in the Control Order that 'L'

                   factor has to be fixed at the same time throughout the Country.     The 'L'

                   factor having been deferred for the State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Puducherry

                   there is no discrimination.   Therefore, the plea of discrimination can

                   never be raised by the petitioner.
