</p><p id="p_2">1.      This is a composite appeal preferred by the appellants/plaintiffs
challenging the order dated 27.08.2013 (hereinafter referred as the 'second
impugned order') passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court in an
application filed by the appellant under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC being
I.A. No.13434/2013 which in turn was filed in CS(OS) No.1588/2013. The
appellant also challenges the order dated 27.08.2013 rejecting the Review
Petition, being R.P. No.424/2013 filed under Order 47 Rule 1 read with
Sections 114 and 151 of the CPC, seeking review of the order dated
21.08.2013 passed by the learned Single Judge in I.A. No.12818/2013. The
learned Single Judge has, by the second impugned order, directed issuance




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                            Page 1 of 51</span>
 of notice to the respondent in I.A.13434/2013, thereby not granting the
prayer for an ad-interim injunction restraining publication and telecast of
the printed and television commercial respectively, which are alleged to
disparage the products, goodwill and reputation of the appellants. The
present appeal also impugns the order dated 21.08.2013 passed by a learned
Single Judge of this Court in I.A. No.12818/2013 filed under Order 39 Rule
1 &amp; 2 of the CPC (hereinafter referred to as the ‗impugned order'), whereby
the said application for grant of interim injunction was dismissed by
holding that the said advertisements in question did not disparage or
denigrate the product of the appellants/plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.      The controversy in the present case relates to an advertisement
campaign pursued by the respondent/defendant to advertise its product - a
Toothpaste which is sold as ―Pepsodent Germicheck Super Power‖
(hereinafter referred to as ‗Pepsodent GSP'). The advertisement campaign
includes a television commercial as well as advertisements in the print
media. An advertisement in the print media appeared in the front page of
the newspaper ―Hindustan Times‖, New Delhi edition on 11.08.2013. The
said advertisement in print media has also appeared in several national
dailies, including in modified forms. The commercial on television has also
been repeated on several occasions. Both the Television commercial as well
as the advertisements in the print media seeks to convey that Pepsodent
GSP is 130% better than the product of the appellant namely ―Colgate
Dental Cream Strong Teeth‖ (hereinafter referred to as ‗Colgate ST'). The
Television commercial is hereinafter referred to as ‗impugned TVC' and
the advertisement that was published in Hindustan Times on 11.08.2013 is

 hereinafter referred to as ‗impugned print advertisement'. The said
advertisements are collectively referred as the ‗impugned advertisements'.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.      The appellants/plaintiffs have filed the suit CS(OS) No.1588/2013,
inter-alia, seeking a permanent injunction restraining the respondent from
publishing and/or telecasting the impugned advertisements or any other
similar advertisement or in any other manner disparaging the goodwill and
reputation of the plaintiffs and their products sold under the trade mark
'COLGATE'. The appellants/plaintiffs also filed an application (I.A.
No.12818/2013 under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of the CPC) along with the suit
for granting ad-interim injunction against the impugned advertisements and
the same was dismissed by the learned Single Judge of this Court on
21.08.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.      The      appellants/plaintiffs   preferred   an   appeal    (FAO(OS)
No.381/2013) before a Division Bench of this Court challenging the
impugned order dated 21.08.2013 and the Division Bench of this Court, on
23.08.2013, permitted the appellants/plaintiffs to withdraw the appeal with
liberty to file a fresh application for injunction before the learned Single
Judge and place on record such new material to establish that the impugned
advertisements were disparaging the products of the plaintiffs. The relevant
extract of the order dated 23.08.2013 is quoted as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               ―During the course of submissions, learned counsel for
        the appellants stated that new material in the form of
        newspaper articles, letters from dentists and information from
        consumers has been made available to establish disparagement
        in the minds of the consumers. He seeks liberty to approach

         the learned Single Judge with a fresh application for injunction
        and place on record such new material.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              Liberty granted. All rights and contentions of the parties
        are reserved. It is open to the appellant to impugn the
        correctness of the order which may be made in the fresh
        application and also if necessary, impugn the order which is
        the subject matter of the present appeal.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed as
        withdrawn.‖
</blockquote><p id="p_6">5.      The appellants/plaintiffs immediately filed a fresh application (I.A.
No.13434/2013) under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 read with Section 151 of CPC
bringing on record new facts and documents before the learned Single
Judge and also filed a Review Petition (R.P. No.424/2013) seeking review
of the order dated 21.08.2013 on account of certain alleged errors which
were contended to be apparent in the order dated 21.08.2013. By the second
impugned order, the Review Petition was dismissed by the learned Single
Judge holding that no ground for review of the order dated 21.08.2013 was
made out. In respect of the application under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC
(I.A. No.13434/2013), the learned Single Judge did not grant the ad-interim
injunction as sought for by the plaintiffs and issued notice to the respondent
for filing their response. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the Review Petition
and non grant of the ad-interim injunction, the appellants have preferred the
present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Submissions on behalf of the Appellants

</p><p id="p_8">6.      The appellant has contended that the claim made by the respondent,
regarding its product Pepsodent GSP, in the impugned advertisements is




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                               Page 4 of 51</span>
 based on denigration of the plaintiffs product and malicious falsehood in
common law and under Sections 29(8) and 30(1) of the TradeMark Act,
1999. The impugned advertisements are contended to be detrimental to the
distinctive character and reputation of the trademark of the petitioner. It is
further contended that the impugned advertisements cannot be construed as
mere puffery in respect of the respondent's product Pepsodent GSP but
constitute untrue statements of facts in relation to Colgate ST as well as
Pepsodent GSP.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.      It is contended that the learned Single Judge has erred in concluding
that the impugned advertisements neither disparage nor denigrate the
product Colgate ST. The counsel for the appellant has placed the impugned
advertisements and has made submissions thereon pointing out certain
aspects, which we shall advert to later, which according to him clearly
indicate that the impugned advertisements are disparaging of the product of
the appellant. It is also urged that the impugned advertisements constitute
malicious falsehood, inasmuch as, the essential message conveyed by the
impugned advertisements is false and the impugned advertisements are
designed to falsely show that the product of the respondent is superior to
that of the petitioner in respect of its anti-bacterial/germ qualities and in
respect of preventing tooth decay.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.      It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the learned Single
Judge has erred in examining the impugned advertisements as may be
viewed by a discerning viewer. According to the appellant, the correct test
that needs to be applied is to determine as to how the impugned
advertisements would be viewed by average consumers with imperfect



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 5 of 51</span>
 recollection. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that even
though the impugned advertisements may be construed as not disparaging
of the products of the appellant by some viewers, nonetheless, the court
would interdict such advertisements, if the advertisements were capable of
being construed differently by other consumers. In other words, it is
contended that if an advertisement or an expression is capable of two
meanings, one of which is disparaging while the other is not, the court will,
nonetheless, issue an injunction restraining the dissemination of the same as
disparaging the product or reputation of the concerned party. This
proposition has been referred as the ―multiple meaning rule‖. According to
the appellant, the impugned advertisements must be tested on the anvil of
the multiple meaning rule. It is submitted that this rule is well accepted and
applied by courts in various cases and the learned counsel has referred to
Ajinomoto Sweeteners Europe SAS v. Asda Stores Ltd.: [2011] Q.B. 497,
Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Limited and Others v. Heinz
India Private Limited and Another: I.A. No.15233/2008 in CS (OS)
No.2577/2008, Decided on 12.11.2010, <a href="/doc/62246857/" id="a_1">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. v.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd</a>.: 2008 (5) R.A.J. 664 (Del.) and <a href="/doc/62246857/" id="a_2">Reckitt
Benckiser (India) Ltd. v. Hindustan Unilever Ltd</a>.: 200 (2013) DLT 563
in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.      The learned counsel for the appellant has also submitted that the
entire claim as made in the impugned advertisements is based on an alleged
study done where it has been found that, after four hours of brushing, the
retention of Triclosan in the dental plaque on usage of Colgate ST is 37.1
ppm and on usage of Pepsodent GSP is 48.8 ppm. On the basis of this




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 6 of 51</span>
 study, the impugned advertisements profess a higher efficiency in dealing
with dental cavities as compared with Colgate ST. The correlation which is
sought to be portrayed between higher levels of Triclosan and cavities is
contended to be malicious and misleading insofar as it indicates that
Colgate ST is in any manner inferior in respect of preventing cavities
compared to Pepsodent GSP. This according to the appellant is for two
reasons:-
</p>
<p id="p_12">   (a)     It is contended that a minimum level of Triclosan that is required
           for killing oral bacteria or in combating its growth (referred to as
           Minimum Inhibitory Concentration - MIC) for plaque bacteria is
           in the range of 0.2-0.3 ppm. It is contended that as long as this
           minimum level is maintained there would be no additional benefit
           even if a higher level of Triclosan are delivered. The learned
           counsel sought to draw our attention to various documents in
           support of this contention. Viewed in this perspective, the
           impugned advertisements would be misleading, inasmuch as, the
           advertisement conveys a higher efficiency in dealing with oral
           bacteria/germs in comparison with Colgate ST.
</p>
<p id="p_13">   (b)     It was further urged on behalf of the appellant that there are
           several reasons of tooth decay and plaque bacteria by itself does
           not cause cavities. The appellant's product also has additional
           ingredients, to combat cavities which prevent tooth decay,
           including fluoride which is one of the most vital ingredient for
           prevention of tooth decay. If the impugned advertisements are
           viewed in this factual backdrop, it would be apparent that the same



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                Page 7 of 51</span>
            are false and misleading inasmuch as they seek to correlate
           Triclosan with cavities and profess that Pepsodent is superior in
           combating cavities in comparison with Colgate ST.
</p>
<p id="p_14">10.     The learned counsel for the appellant has also contended that the
learned Single Judge has erred in proceeding on the basis that Colgate ST
contained only 0.2% Triclosan as compared to Pepsodent GSP. It is
contended that this is erroneous as, admittedly, Colgate ST also contains
0.3% Triclosan and this fact is not disputed. The learned counsel has drawn
our attention to Para 6 of the reply filed by the respondent wherein it has
been stated that Colgate ST has the same level of permissible Triclosan
(0.3%). This was also one of the grounds for review in R.P. No.424/2013.
It is further contended that the claim of 130% germ attack power has been
erroneously held by the learned Single Judge to be puffing up of Pepsodent
GSP in comparison with Colgate ST. According to the appellant, it is only
the humorous and hyperbolic claims that can be considered as exaggeration
or puffing. It is contended that all claims which would be taken seriously by
a reasonable man cannot be overlooked as puffery. It is contended that a
claim of 130% better germ killing quality is a serious claim and is liable to
be viewed as such by any reasonable viewer and thus, the same cannot be
considered as mere puffery or exaggeration and, as such, the claim would
fall foul of the ASCI Code.
</p>
<p id="p_15">11.     The appellant has also seriously disputed the claim of the respondent
that Pepsodent GSP has the quality of sustained release of retained
Triclosan. It is contended that only Colgate Total (which is another product
manufactured by the plaintiffs) contains ‗Gantrez' which permits sustained



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 8 of 51</span>
 release of Triclosan. In addition, the learned counsel for the appellant also
submitted that the ‗Super', (i.e. the string of textual messages which are
placed at the bottom of the screen during certain portions of the impugned
TVC) which is considered by the learned Single Judge, is not visible when
impugned TVC is viewed on a normal TV. The said Super which reads as
under is thus not visible to a average viewer:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        ―Creative visualisation of the action of triclosan on cavity and
        causing germs. New Pepodent Germicheck enhances delivery
        of triclosan in the mouth. Claim based on the In-Vivo study
        where Germ Attack Power refers to amount of Triclosan
        remaining in the mouth 4 hours after brushing where Colgate
        Strong Teeth is indexed at 100% and Pepsodent GSP 130%.</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">        Brush twice daily.‖

It is contended that the learned Single Judge, thus, erred in relying on the
same and failed to consider that as per the ASCI Code, the ‗Supers' are
required to be legible on a standard television set.
</p>
<p id="p_17">12.     It is contended by the appellants that the appellants had established a
good prima facie case and the learned Single Judge erred in not considering
the balance of convenience and the irreparable loss to the reputation and
goodwill of the appellants that would be caused if the ad-interim injunction
as prayed for was not granted.
</p>
<p id="p_18">Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

</p><p id="p_19">13.     The respondent has raised a preliminary objection with respect to
maintainability of the present appeal. It is contended on behalf of the
respondent that the present appeal is a composite appeal against three
orders including the order dated 27.08.2013 dismissing the review petition,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                Page 9 of 51</span>
 R.P. No. 424/2013. It is submitted that an appeal against an order rejecting
the application for review was barred under provisions of Order 47 Rule 7
of CPC. In support of this contention, the respondent has relied upon the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Shanker Motiram Nale v.
Shiolalsing Gannusing Rajput: (1994) 2 SCC 753.
</p>
<p id="p_20">14.     It is further submitted on behalf of the respondent that by virtue of
the second impugned order, the Court has issued notice in IA
No.13434/2013 and has not rejected the said application. Thus, the second
impugned order would not be an appealable order as no appeal has been
provided under CPC. The same could also not be construed as a
―Judgment‖ and, consequently, an appeal under <a href="/doc/1617497/" id="a_3">Section 10</a> of the Delhi
High Court Act, 1966 would also not lie against the second impugned
order. In support of his contention, the respondent has relied on the decision
of this Court in <a href="/doc/540967/" id="a_4">Nisha Raj and Anr. v. Pratap K. Kaula and Ors</a>.: 57
(1995) DLT 490. The respondent has also placed reliance on the decision
of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1820934/" id="a_5">Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D.
Kania &amp; Anr</a>.: (1981) 4 SCC 8. It is submitted that for an interlocutory
order to qualify as a judgment, the same must have a element of finality. It
is submitted that the second impugned order does not have any trappings of
finality attached and thus, no appeal would lie against the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_21">15.     The learned counsel for the respondent has also submitted that an
appeal against the impugned order was also not maintainable at this stage in
view of the earlier order passed by a Division Bench in FAO(OS)
No.381/2013. It is contended that the order dated 23.08.2013 passed in
FAO(OS) No.381/2013 granted liberty to the appellant to impugn the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                               Page 10 of 51</span>
 correctness of the order which may be passed in the fresh application as
also the order impugned therein (i.e. the impugned order in the present
appeal). According to the learned counsel for the respondent, the appellants
are at liberty to challenge the impugned order, however, the same could
only be done after the fresh application filed by the appellant before the
learned Single Judge had been considered and decided. Since, in the present
case, IA No.13434/2013, which was filed pursuant to the liberty granted by
the Division Bench by the order dated 23.08.2013, is still pending, the
appellant is not at liberty to file the present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_22">16.     It has been contended on behalf of the respondent that the impugned
advertisements are comparative advertisements which are permissible. The
learned counsel for the respondent has supported the finding of the learned
Single Judge that the impugned advertisements do not disparage the
products of the appellant nor denigrate the goodwill and reputation of the
appellants in any manner. It is, thus, contended that the said advertisements
are not proscribed. The learned counsel relied on the decision of a Division
Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_6">Dabur India Ltd. v. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd.
&amp; Anr</a>.: 167 (2010) DLT 278 (DB), in support of his contention.
</p>
<p id="p_23">17.     It has been contended on behalf of the respondent that
advertisements are to be viewed as a whole and the respondent place
reliance on the decisions in <a href="/doc/131750016/" id="a_7">Marico Limited v. Adani Wilmar Limited</a>: 199
(2013) DLT 663, Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Limited and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 11 of 51</span>
 counsel has relied on the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/62246857/" id="a_9">Reckitt Benckiser (India)
Limited v. Hindustan Unilever Limited</a>: 2008 (5) R.A.J. 664 (Del.), and
contended that the test of an average person with imperfect recollection is
applied for determining disparagement.
</p>
<p id="p_24">18.     It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the advertisement is a
form of commercial speech and as such is protected under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_10">Article 19(1)(a)</a>
of the Constitution of India. Thus, the impugned advertisements cannot be
interdicted by any law unless the same falls within the exception of <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_11">Article
19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. In support of this contention, the
respondent has relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/752455/" id="a_12">Tata Press
Ltd. v. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd</a>.: (1995) 5 SCC 139.
</p>
<p id="p_25">19.     The learned counsel for the respondent has controverted the
contention that the ‗multiple meaning rule' should be applied to the facts of
the present case. It is contended that the learned Single Judge has rightly
applied the test as to how the impugned advertisements would be viewed by
a discerning viewer. It is contended that the multiple meaning rule as
canvassed by the appellant has no basis in law and the said rule has not
been accepted in India. It is further contended that this rule is also not
accepted in the United Kingdom. The learned counsel has sought to
distinguish the case of Ajinomoto Sweeteners Europe SAS (supra) by
contending that the said case did not relate to grant of interim relief but
related to the instructions given to a Jury and, as such, the said rule could
not be applied in the present case. The learned counsel also relied on the
decision in the case of Tesla Motors Ltd, Tesla Motors Inc. v. British




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                               Page 12 of 51</span>
 Broadcasting Corporation: [2013] EWCA Civ 152 to contend that even in
United Kingdom, the test of multiple meaning rule has not been followed.
</p>
<p id="p_26">20.     The respondent further contended that the impugned advertisements
were truthful and the claims made in the impugned advertisements were
substantiated by the In vivo and In vitro tests carried out by two
independent laboratories. The respondent further supported the findings of
the learned Single Judge and contended that the same were neither perverse
nor against any settled principle of law and thus, could not be interfered
with by an appellate court. With regard to the appellants contention that
additional Triclosan concentration did not in any manner provide additional
protection against dental cavities as conveyed by the impugned
advertisements as also the contention that better efficiency of protection
against tooth decay and cavities could not be projected on the basis of a
higher concentration of triclosan, the respondent pointed out, at the close of
the arguments, that the said contentions were not urged before the learned
Single Judge and also before this Court in the opening arguments. It was
submitted that as there was no occasion for the respondent to deal with the
said contentions, the same could not be entertained by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_27">Re: Preliminary objection regarding maintainability of the appeal

</p><p id="p_28">21.     The present appeal is a composite one whereby the appellants have
challenged three orders. Insofar as the challenge to the impugned order is
concerned, there can be no dispute that in the normal course an appeal

of the appellants under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 being IA No.12818/2013 has




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 13 of 51</span>
 been finally rejected. The controversy regarding maintainability of the
appeal against the impugned order is premised only on the interpretation of
the order dated 23.08.2013 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in
FAO(OS) 381/2013. According to the respondent, the appellants having
withdrawn their earlier appeal (FAO(OS) 381/2013) are precluded from
filing a fresh appeal against the impugned order save as except in
accordance with the liberty granted by the Division Bench in their order
dated 23.08.2013 passed in the said FAO(OS) 381/2013. Considerable
amount of time has been consumed by the respondent in attempting to
interpret the said order dated 23.08.2013 as having not granted the
appellants the liberty to file a fresh appeal to challenge the impugned order
before the fresh application under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 contemplated
therein (which subsequently came to be filed and numbered as IA No.
13434/2013) had been finally heard and decided. A plain reading of the
order dated 23.08.2013 indicates that all rights and contentions of the
parties were reserved and the Court expressly recorded that it was open for
the appellants to impugn the correctness of the order which may be made in
the fresh application and also if necessary impugn the order which was
subject matter of that appeal (i.e the impugned order herein). We are unable
to read any restriction in this order which would prevent the appellant from
preferring an appeal against the impugned order prior to the decision in the
fresh application that was filed pursuant to the liberty granted by the Court
by virtue of the order dated 23.08.2013. It is apparent that the appellants
desired to place certain material before the Single Judge in order to
persuade the learned Single Judge to grant an ad-interim injunction against
the impugned advertisements and had, accordingly, withdrawn the earlier



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 14 of 51</span>
 appeal with liberty to file a fresh appeal, if necessary. The appellants were
not successful in persuading the learned Single Judge for an ad-interim
order and have thus, found it necessary to file a fresh appeal challenging
not only the impugned order but also the non grant of relief as prayed for in
the fresh application (I.A. 13434/2013 filed by them). As we are unable to
read in the order dated 23.08.2013 any restriction as to the liberty granted
to the appellants, we reject the preliminary objection raised by the
respondent in respect of the challenge to the impugned order. We are also
persuaded by the fact that although, admittedly, the appellants have the
right to appeal against the impugned order, their earlier appeal had,
indisputably, not been heard and decided. We find no reason to deprive the
appellants of their right to challenge the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_29">22.     Insofar as, the present appeal challenges the second impugned order,
it is to be noted that IA No.13434/2013 has not been disposed of.
However, according to the appellants non grant of an ad-interim order itself
has wide ramifications as far as the business of the appellants is concerned.
It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that while the appellants
have more than 50% market share of the total market relating to dental
creams, the respondents market share is less than 6%. It is the case of the
appellants that the impugned advertisements are disparaging and
impermissible in law. Thus, insofar as the appellants are concerned, if they
are correct in their claim, a denial of an ad-interim injunction would,
undoubtedly, affect their valuable rights. An advertisement by a party
which disparages the goods of its competitors, indisputably, must be
interdicted at the earliest. The non grant of ad-interim relief in such cases




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 15 of 51</span>
 would tantamount to permitting a party to continue to slander, disparage
and denigrate the goods of its competitor and it could not be disputed that
from the standpoint of a party complaining against such disparagement, a
denial of non grant of an ad-interim order would cause serious injustice to
the party concerned. The decision of the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal
Khimji (supra) also explains that although every interlocutory order cannot
be recorded as a judgment but those orders which decide the ―matter of
moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work
serious injustice to the party concerned‖ would be considered orders in
respect of which an LPA would lie.
</p>
<p id="p_30">23.     The question whether an order issuing notice would be appealable
was considered by a division bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/540967/" id="a_13">Nisha Raj v. Pratap K
Kaula</a> (supra). In that case, a Division Bench of this court held that Order
43 Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides for an appeal
against an order passed under Order 39 Rule 1, Rule 2 or Rule 2A, Rule 4
or Rule 10, however, an order issuing notice is an order under Order 39
Rule 3 and no appeal has been provided against an order passed under order
39 Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Thus, an appeal against an
order issuing notice would not lie under the provisions of the Code of Civil
Procedure. In regard to the question whether an order issuing notice would
amount to a judgment under <a href="/doc/1617497/" id="a_14">section 10</a> of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966,
the Court held that certain interlocutory orders which are not covered by
Order 43 Rule 1 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 will, nonetheless, be
appealable under <a href="/doc/1617497/" id="a_15">section 10</a> of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 provided the
orders possess the characteristics and trappings of finality. It was further




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                             Page 16 of 51</span>
 explained by the Division Bench of this Court that directing issuance of a
notice may indeed be a final order in the rarest of rare cases where there is
no possibility of restitution. The illustrations of the rarest of rare cases that
were cited by the Court included cases where goods were in the process of
being exported beyond the territorial waters or where the case pertained to
execution by a death sentence. In such cases, restitution was clearly not
possible and there was no chance of any kind of retrieval. The Court held
that in such category of cases the impact of issuing a notice would be direct
and immediate.
</p>
<p id="p_31">24.     Taking a cue from the aforesaid judgments in <a href="/doc/540967/" id="a_16">Nisha Raj v. Pratap K.
Kaula</a> (supra) and Shah Babulal Khimji (supra), we must apply the tests
whether the second impugned order irretrievably prejudices the rights of the
appellant or whether it decides a matter of moment or affects vital and
valuable rights of the parties which work serious injustice to the party
concerned. In our view, the answer to this must be in the negative,
particularly, in the light of the fact that the earlier interim application
seeking similar reliefs had been heard and decided by the learned Single
Judge by the impugned order. Accordingly, the present appeal is restricted
to challenging the impugned order and on the material placed and the
contentions advanced before the learned Single Judge in respect of I.A.
13434/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_32">25.     Insofar as, the challenge to the order dated 27.08.2013 is concerned
inasmuch as it rejects the Review Petition (R.P. No.424/2013), the same is
clearly not maintainable in view of the express language of Order 47 Rule
7(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 which provides that an order of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                 Page 17 of 51</span>
 the Court rejecting an application for review shall not be appealable.
Accordingly, the challenge to the order rejecting the review petition cannot
be considered.

<p id="p_33">Discussion as to law on disparagement

</p><p id="p_34">26.     Before proceeding further to address the controversy involved in the
present proceedings, it would be apposite to bear in mind the meaning and
import of the expressions ―disparagement‖ and ―puffing‖ and similar
cognate expressions. The Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition, defines
―Disparagement‖ to inter-alia mean:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        ―A derogatory comparison of one thing with another; the act or
        an instance of castigating or detracting from the reputation of,
        esp. unfairly or untruthfully; a false and injurious statement
        that discredits or detracts from the reputation of another's
        property, product or business.‖
Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition, defines ―Trade Disparagement‖ to
inter-alia mean:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        ―The common-law tort of belittling someone's business,
        goods, or services with a remark that is false or misleading but
        not necessarily defamatory. To succeed at the action, a
        plaintiff must prove that; the defendant made the disparaging
        remark; the defendant intended to injure the business, knew
        that the statement was false, or recklessly disregarded whether
        it was true; and the statement resulted in special damages to
        the plaintiff, by passing off.‖

Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition, defines Puffing as under: -
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        ―The expression of an exaggerated opinion - as opposed to a
        factual misrepresentation - with the intent to sell a good or



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                               Page 18 of 51</span>
         service; Puffing involves expressing opinions, not asserting
        something as a fact. Although there is some leeway in puffing
        goods, a seller may not misrepresent them or say that they
        have attributes that they do not possess.‖

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">27.     The law relating to disparaging advertisements is now well settled.
</blockquote><p id="p_35">While, it is open for a person to exaggerate the claims relating to his goods
and indulge in puffery, it is not open for a person to denigrate or disparage
the goods of another person. In case of comparative advertisement, a
certain amount of disparagement is implicit. If a person compares its goods
and claims that the same are better than that of its competitors, it is implicit
that the goods of his competitor's are inferior in comparison. To this
limited extent, puffery in the context of comparative advertisement does
involve showing the competitor's goods in a bad light. However, as long as
the advertisement is limited only to puffing, there can be no actionable
claim against the same. In the case of White v. Mellin,: (1895) A.C. 154,
the House of Lords while rejecting the contention of disparagement
observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        ―The allegation of a tradesman that his goods are better than
        his neighbour's very often involves only the consideration
        whether they possess one or two qualities superior to the other.
        Of course ―better‖ means better as regards the purpose for
        which they are intended, and the question of better or worse in
        many cases depends simply upon one or two or three issues of
        fact. If an action will not lie because a man says that his goods
        are better than his neighbour's, it seems to me impossible to
        say that it will lie because he says that they are better in this or
        that or the other respect. Just consider what a door would be
        opened if this were permitted. That this sort of puffing
        advertisement is in use is notorious; and we see rival cures
        advertised for particular ailments. The Court would then be



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                   Page 19 of 51</span>
         bound to inquire, in an action brought, whether this ointment
        or this pill better cured the disease which it was alleged to cure
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        - whether a particular article of food was in this respect or that
        better than another. Indeed, the Courts of law would be turned
        into a machinery for advertising rival productions by obtaining
        a judicial determination which of the two was the better.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_36">28.     The above decision was further explained by the Chancery Division
in the case of De Beers Abrasive Products Ltd. and Others v.
International General Electric Co. of New York Ltd. and Another: 1975
(2) All ER 599, wherein while considering an allegation of false
advertising causing injury to a rival traders group, the court observed as
under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">               ―the law is that any trader is entitled to puff his own
        goods, even though such puff must, as a matter of pure logic,
        involve the denigration of his rival's goods........ ―The best
        tailor in the world,‖ ―The best tailor in this town,‖ and ―The
        best tailor in this street,‖ none of the three committed an
        actionable wrong ...... Where, however, the situation is not that
        the trader is puffing his own goods, but turns to denigrate
        those of his rival, then, in my opinion, the situation is not so
        clear cut. Obviously the statement: ―My goods are better than
        X's‖ is only a more dramatic presentation of what is implicit in
        the statement: ―My goods are the best in the world.‖
        Accordingly, I do not think such a statement would be
        actionable. At the other end of the scale, if what is said is: ―My
        goods are better than X's, because X's are absolute rubbish,‖
        then it is established by dicta of Lord Shand in the House of
        Lords in White v. Mellin [1895] A.C. 154, 171, which were
        accepted by Mr. Walton as stating the law, the statement
        would be actionable.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_37">29.     Thus, as long as claims made in an advertisement are considered
only as puffery, no interference with the same by the courts would be




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                 Page 20 of 51</span>
 warranted. This is for a simple reason that puffing involves expressing
opinions and are not considered as statements of fact which can be taken
seriously. As puffery is neither intended to make a representation as to facts
nor is considered as such by the target audience. The advertisement
involving puffery, thus, cannot be stated to be misrepresenting facts. It is
common for advertisements to make extravagant and exaggerated claims in
relation to goods and services. It is expected that an advertiser would
embellish the goods and services that are advertised and such puffery is
neither expected to be nor is taken seriously by any average person. This
was also observed by the Chancery Division in De Beers Abrasive
Products Ltd. (supra) as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">              ―In other words, in the kind of situation where one
        expects, as a matter of ordinary common experience, a person
        to use a certain amount of hyperbole in the description of
        goods, property or services, the courts will do what any
        ordinary reasonable man would do, namely, take it with a large
        pinch of salt.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_38">30.     Having stated the above, it is equally well settled that a trader is not
entitled to denigrate or defame the goods of his competitor's, while
comparing his goods with that of the other traders. In comparative
advertising, the comparing of one's goods with that of others and
establishing the superiority of one's goods over that of others is permissible,
however, while doing so, one is not allowed to make a statement that the
goods of others are bad, inferior or undesirable as that would amount to
defaming or denigrating the goods of other's, which is actionable. In the
case of <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_17">Dabur India Ltd. v. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.: 167

 propositions on comparative advertisement as held by the Calcutta High
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_18">Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. v. M.P. Ramchandran

        referred to for the following propositions relating to
        comparative advertising:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             (a)      A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be
                      best in the world, even though the declaration is
                      untrue.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">             (b)      He can also say that his goods are better than his
                      competitors', even though such statement is untrue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">             (c)      For the purpose of saying that his goods are the
                      best in the world or his goods are better than his
                      competitors' he can even compare the advantages
                      of his goods over the goods of others.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">             (d)      He however, cannot, while saying that his goods
                      are better than his competitors', say that his
                      competitors' goods are bad. If he says so, he really
                      slanders the goods of his competitors. In other
                      words, he defames his competitors and their goods,
                      which is not permissible.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">             (e)      If there is no defamation to the goods or to the
                      manufacturer of such goods no action lies, but if
                      there is such defamation an action lies and if an
                      action lies for recovery of damages for defamation,
                      then the Court is also competent to grant an order
                      of injunction restraining repetition of such
                      defamation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">        These propositions have been accepted by learned Single
        Judges of this Court in several cases, but in view of the law

         misleading, unfair or deceptive advertising is not protected
        commercial speech, we are of the opinion that propositions (a)
        and (b) above and the first part of proposition (c) are not good
        law. While hyped-up advertising may be permissible, it cannot
        transgress the grey areas of permissible assertion, and if does
        so, the advertiser must have some reasonable factual basis for
        the assertion made. It is not possible, therefore, for anybody to
        make an off-the-cuff or unsubstantiated claim that his goods
        are the best in the world or falsely state that his goods are
        better than that of a rival.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_39">31.     There is no dispute as to the principles as enunciated in Dabur India
Limited (supra) and it is common ground between the appellants as well as
the respondent that the present case must be adjudged on the principles as
referred in that case.
</p>
<p id="p_40">Discussion regarding multiple meaning rule

</p><p id="p_41">32.     Although, there is no controversy regarding the law on
disparagement, there has been much debate with respect to the applicability
of multiple meaning rule to the facts of the present case. The learned
counsel for the appellants has relied upon the decision in Ajinomoto
Sweeteners Europe SAS (supra). In that case, the claimant company
manufactured and sold aspartame, an artificial sweetener. A super market
chain selling its own brand of health foods packaged some of its products in
packaging which carried the following message ―no hidden nasties‖
together with a legend reading ―no artificial colours or flavours and no
aspartame‖. The claimant therein contended that the message on the
packaging indicated that aspartame was potentially harmful or unhealthy
and was something which health conscious consumers would avoid.
Tugendhat J (Trial Court) considered the meaning of the words used on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                Page 23 of 51</span>
 packaging and concluded that the following meanings were possible A:
That aspartame is harmful or unhealthy. B: That there is a risk that
aspartame is harmful or unhealthy. C: That aspartame is to be avoided. D:
That these foods were for customers who found aspartame objectionable.
The meaning A was rejected outrightly. Meaning C was found to add
nothing to meaning B and was also, therefore, not relevant. After having
concluded that meanings B and D were both plausible, the Judge applied
the single meaning rule and meaning D was adopted as the same was
inoffensive while meaning B would convey a message disparaging
aspartame. The said decision was carried in an appeal which was
considered by the Court of Appeal in Ajinomoto Sweeteners Europe SAS
(supra). The Court traced the development of law in this regard. Earlier, the
view held was that words were always to be construed in the most
inoffensive sense reasonably possible. However, this practice subsequently
gave way to the rule that the words and expressions were to be understood
―according to the general and natural meaning, and agreeable to the
common understanding of all men‖. The Court of Appeal also noted that
Levinz J in Naben v. Miecock: (1683) Skin. 183, explained this rule by
holding that the words must be understood ―in their natural, genuine and
usual sense and common understanding, and not according to the witty
constructions of lawyers, but according to the apprehension of by-
standers‖. The Court of Appeal held that the single meaning rule is not to
be imported into the tort of malicious falsehood and further held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        ―33. But where it is capable of being applied, as it is in the
        present claim, the rule is productive of injustice. On the judge's
        unchallenged findings, the meanings which reasonable



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                 Page 24 of 51</span>
         consumers might put on the claimant's health-food packaging
        include both the damaging and the innocuous. Why should the
        law not move on to proof of malice in relation to the damaging
        meaning and (if malice is proved) the consequential damage
        without artificially pruning the facts so as to presume the very
        thing -- a single meaning -- that the judge has found not to be
        the case?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">        34. I do not accept that doing this will make trials of malicious
        falsehood claims unwieldy or over-complex. This is not
        because these claims are always tried by a judge alone: the
        experience of common law judges is that juries are on the
        whole very good at assimilating and applying sometimes
        complicated directions. It is because it makes the trial of the
        issues fairer and more realistic. Instead of (as here) denying
        any remedy to a claimant whose business has been injured in
        the eyes of some consumers on the illogical ground that it has
        not been injured in the eyes of others, or alternatively (and Mr
        Caldecott's case necessarily involves this) giving such a
        claimant a clear run to judgment when in the eyes of many
        customers the words have done it no harm, trial of plural
        meanings permits the damaging effect of the words to be put in
        perspective and both malice and (if it comes to it) damage to
        be more realistically gauged.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">        35. For these reasons I would hold that the single meaning rule
        is not to be imported into the tort of malicious falsehood.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_42">33.     The multiple meaning rule by itself is not determinative in a case of
malicious falsehood. The multiple meaning rule has to be applied in
conjunction with determining the intent of the person against whom a claim
of malicious falsehood is launched. If the statements made are honest and
without any malintent then it is obvious that a single meaning rule would be
applicable and the meaning which is inoffensive would be considered over
offensive ones. This was also held in the case of the Lait v. Evening
Standard Ltd.: [2011] 1 W.L.R. 2973, wherein it was held as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">                ―52. The first question is whether the single meaning
        rule, as explained by Diplock LJ in Slim v Daily Telegraph
        Ltd [1968] 2 QB 157 , 171-174, and as discussed more
        recently by Sedley LJ in Ajinomoto Sweeteners Europe SAS v
        Asda Stores Ltd [2011] QB 497, applies where the defence is
        one of honest comment. In my view, it does. First, given the
        rationale for the rule in the field of defamation (which has
        been affirmed in Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd.
        [1995] 2 AC 65 , 71-72), it is a little hard to see why, as a
        matter of principle, it should not apply when the court is
        assessing a defence of honest comment. Secondly, it appears to
        me that it would be inconvenient, particularly if the case was
        being tried by a jury, if the single meaning rule applied in a
        defamation trial for some purposes, but not for others. Thirdly,
        a number of authorities support this conclusion: see Merivale v
        Carson 20 QBD 275 , 279, 281 and 282, and Burstein v
        Associated Newspapers Ltd [2007] 4 All ER 319, paras 7-8. I
        also agree with Laws LJ that the approval in the Charleston
        case [1995] 2 AC 65 of Diplock LJ's judgment in the Slim case
        appears to support this conclusion.‖

the meaning which is disparaging then merely because an innocuous
meaning is available, the action by an aggrieved party would not be
frustrated. Thus, if a person wilfully and intentionally uses a disparaging
expression and puts out an advertisement which can, plausibly, be
construed as disparaging the goods and services of the other and the
intention of putting out that advertisement is to seek benefit from making
disparaging statements against competitor's goods, it would hardly be just
or fair to afford such party the defence that the advertisement could also,
possibly, be construed in an innocuous manner which is not harmful.

<p id="p_44"> 35.     The learned counsel for the respondent has advanced his contentions
in respect of the multiple meaning rule on the fundamental premise that it is
mutually exclusive to the test, as to the inference drawn by an average
reasonable man reading or viewing the advertisement. However, this in our
view is erroneous as applying the multiple meaning rule does not, by
implication, exclude the need to examine as to how the advertisement is
viewed by an average reasonable person. It is now well settled that in order
to examine the question, whether an advertisement is misleading or whether
the same disparages the goods/services of another or leads a viewer to
believe something which is not true, it must be examined as to how the
same is perceived by an average reasonable man. But we do not think that
in order to examine how a reasonable man views an advertisement, all
perceptions except one must be discarded. While determining how an
advertisement is viewed by a reasonable person, in some cases, it may be
necessary to examine whether an average reasonable person could view the
advertisement in a particular manner, even though another reasonable view
is possible. We do not think, it is necessary that all reasonable views except
one must be discarded while determining the question as to how an
advertisement is perceived. The presumption that there must be a single
reasonable man militates against the principle that two or multiple
acceptable views may be adopted by different persons who are fully
qualified to be described as reasonable persons.

<p id="p_45">36.     The decision in Tesla Motors (supra) also does not support the view
that multiple meaning rule has not been followed in United Kingdom as
was contended by the learned counsel for the respondent. The facts in that




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 27 of 51</span>
 case related to an action that was instituted for claiming damages for libel,
for malicious falsehood and for an injunction to prevent further publication
of statements which was a subject matter in those proceedings. Tesla
Motors Limited and Tesla Motors Inc. (referred to as ‗Tesla') were
manufacturers of motor vehicles and had made available two vehicles for a
review by a well-known television programme ―Top Gear‖ which was
broadcast by the respondent. In one episode of the programme that was
telecast, the cars (Roadsters) that were made available by Tesla were shown
to be tested. The tests were designed to push the car to the limits of their
performance in terms of acceleration, straight-line speed, cornering and
handling. The presenter of the programme, a well-known personality
Jeremy Clarkson, who was filmed as driving one of the cars around the
track, made various comments regarding the motor vehicle. Some of which
were complementary, however, some of the comments were not. Tesla took
an exception to two portions of the film including one portion which is
described as under:-
</p>
        ―..begins with Mr.Clarkson praising the car and saying:

<p id="p_46">        ‗This car, then, really was shaping up to be something
        wonderful. But then....'At this point there is the artificial sound
        of a motor slowing down and stopping, followed by a shot of
        Mr. Clarkson sitting in what has become a stationary vehicle
        saying: ‗Oh! ... Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we
        worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55
        miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up
        again.' There follows a shot of people pushing one of the
        Roadsters into the hangar and Mr. Clarkson plugging in the
        cable in order to re-charge it.‖




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                  Page 28 of 51</span>
 It was contended on behalf of the Tesla that the statement, ―although Tesla
say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out
after just 55 miles‖, was defamatory as it meant that Tesla had, recklessly,
grossly mislead potential purchasers by claiming that its vehicles had a
range of 200 miles, while in fact, the range of the vehicle was only about 55
miles. This contention was not accepted as the Court of Appeal held that
the statement made by the presenter in the programme related to the range
of the vehicle in test conditions. The Court further viewed the film to
ascertain the impression that it conveyed and held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">        ―21. For the purposes of the appeal I have watched the whole
        of the film a number of times. In my view it was important to
        do so because, although the transcript with which the court
        was provided is a helpful reminder of what was said and
        shown, it does not convey the same impression as the film
        itself. One important matter which is vividly conveyed by the
        film is the nature of the testing that was carried out by the ‗Top
        Gear' team, which involved violent acceleration (described as
        a ―drag race‖), continuous high-speed driving at or near the
        limits of the car's capability and heavy cornering. Testing of
        this kind is typical of ‗Top Gear', as most viewers of the
        programme would know, but even a person viewing the
        programme for the first time would immediately realise that
        the style of driving bears no relationship to that which could be
        engaged in on a public road, even if the car were to be driven
        quickly by normal standards. It was for this reason that Mr.
        Caldecott Q.C. submitted that no reasonable person could
        draw the inference that the car's range undernormal, albeit
        quick, driving conditions was only 55 miles or that in claiming
        that it had a range of 200 miles Tesla had dishonestly set out to
        mislead the public.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">        22. At the heart of this part of the case is the allegation that
        the statement contained in the film meant that the true range of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                 Page 29 of 51</span>
         the Roadster was in the order of 55 miles. That is important,
        because it is the extent of the discrepancy between the claimed
        range of 200 miles and the alleged true range of about 55 miles
        that supports what is said to be the implied assertion of
        dishonesty. Indeed, so great is the discrepancy that, if it were
        true, it is difficult to see what other inference could reasonably
        be drawn. However, it is clear from what the viewer sees of
        the tests carried out on the car that they bear no relationship to
        driving on public roads, or at any rate to the kind of driving on
        public roads of a kind on which a manufacturer could possibly
        base an estimate of range. It would be obvious to a reasonable
        viewer, therefore, that the range derived from track testing was
        not in any meaningful sense the car's ―true range‖ and he
        would therefore have no reason to infer that by claiming a
        range of 200 miles Tesla had set out to mislead.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_47">37.     It is apparent from the above that this was not a case where the Court
was presented with a set of facts where two meanings were possible. The
multiple meaning rule is applied only in cases where two meanings are
plausible and thus there was no scope of applying multiple meaning rule in
Tesla Motors (supra).

        EMLR 278 and Jeynes v News Magazines Ltd [2008] EWCA

            lawyer and may indulge in a certain amount of loose
            thinking. But he must be treated as being a man who is not
            avid for scandal and someone who does not, and should
            not, select one bad meaning where other non-defamatory
            meanings are available. (Emphasis added.)

            (3) While limiting its attention to what the defendant has
            actually said or written the court should be cautious of an
            over-elaborate analysis of the material in issue.
            (4) The reasonable reader does not give a newspaper item
            the analytical attention of a lawyer to the meaning of a

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">39.     We do not think that there is any quarrel with the principles as

 meaning where other simple non-disparaging meanings are available.
</blockquote><p id="p_49">However, in cases where the advertisement presents an impression which
any reasonable person could perceive as being derogatory or defamatory or
disparaging, the goods/services of another person then certainly it would
not be reasonable to discard that view only because certain other meanings
are also possible. The aid to the multiple meaning rule must be taken only
in such circumstances where two plausible meanings are possible and it is
probable that certain viewers (readers) would adopt a view which is
disparaging. In the present case, it is not necessary for us to delve into these
contentions much further as, in our view, the facts of the present case do
not suggest the dilemma of two divergent plausible views.

<p id="p_50">Impugned TVC

</p><p id="p_51">40.     Having briefly outlined the principles of law that are applicable, we
may proceed to examine the impugned advertisements.
</p>
<p id="p_52">41.     The impugned TVC starts with a close up of a signage which reads
as ―PREVENTIVE CAVITY TEST‖. The font size of the word
―PREVENTIVE‖ is significantly smaller than the font size of the words
―CAVITY TEST‖. The advertisement thereafter shows two children with
their respective mothers standing behind them. The children are shown
brushing their teeth. While one child is shown to be brushing with Colgate
ST (hereinafter referred to as ‗Colgate child'). The other child is shown to
be brushing with Pepsodent GSP (hereinafter referred to as ‗Pepsodent
child'). The children seem to be participating in some sort of an experiment
which relates to the effectiveness of the two Toothpastes. The packaging of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                Page 32 of 51</span>
 both Colgate ST and Pepsodent GSP are clearly visible in the TV
Commercial. After the children finish their brushing, the Colgate child
shows his teeth to the dentist and invites him to test his teeth. In conformity
with the storyline, this can only mean the Preventive Cavity Test which was
indicated at the commencement of the commercial. The dentist does not
conduct the test and asks the Colgate child to go, on which the Colgate
child shows his surprise and states ―Aapne hi to bola tha, Cavity Test
Hoga‖ (freely translated means ―you only said that there would be a Cavity
Test‖). The dentist then explains to the Colgate child ―Asli Test Ab Nahi,
Tab Karenge Jab Cavity Ka Khatra Zyada Ho‖ (freely translated means
―the real test would not be now, but would be done subsequently when the
danger of cavity is higher').
</p>
<p id="p_53">42.     The next shot of the commercial depicts the children four hours later
and this is indicated by a Super appearing on the left hand side of the frame
simultaneously on the right hand side of the frame a clock is seen rapidly
moving from 8 to 12. This clearly depicts the passage of time of four hours.
The next set of frames depict both the 'Colgate' and 'Pepsodent' children
with their respective lunch boxes and at that moment, the dentist appears
alongwith the respective mothers of the two children. The dentist takes out
some sort of hand held scanning device which is depicted as a tool to
examine the teeth of the two children. The next frame is a split frame
where the light emanating from the scanning device is shown to pan on the
teeth of the two children. On the left hand side (Colgate Child's side of the
screen) the product Colgate ST is clearly visible and which identifies that
the Colgate child has used Colgate ST. Similarly, on the right hand side

 (Pepsodent Child's side of the screen) Pepsodent GSP is visible. A screen
shot of this frame is reproduced herein below:-
</p>



<p id="p_54">43.     The next frame is again a split screen where alien looking creatures
depicting Triclosan as soldiers are shown. The Triclosan soldiers pertaining
to Colgate are shown in red and Triclosan soldiers pertaining to Pepsodent
are shown in blue. The right hand side frame also bears the caption 100%
germ attack power, below the Pepsodent GSP tube. The expression
"INDEX 100%" is indicated at the bottom of both the split frames. A screen
shot of the frames is reproduced herein below:-

<p id="p_55">         The right hand side split screen expands rapidly and the term 100%
in the caption "100% germ attack power" is also shown increasing to 130%.
Simultaneously, the Colgate side of the screen diminishes in proportion. A
screen shot of the frames is reproduced herein below:-
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                           Page 35 of 51</span>
<p id="p_56"> At this stage, the following super appears at the bottom of the screen:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">        ―Creative Visualization of the Action of Triclosan on Cavity
        causing Germs. New Pepsodent Germicheck enhances delivery
        of Triclosan in the mouth. Claim based on In-Vivo study
        where Germ Attack Power refers to amount of Triclosan
        remaining in mouth, 4 hours after brushing, where COLGATE
        STRONG TEETH is indexed at 100% and PEPSODENT
        GERMI CHECK is 130%. Brush twice daily.‖

The impugned TVC then ends with a statement ―Naya Pepsodent
Germicheck Colgate Ke Mukable 130% Germ Check Power‖ (freely
translated means ―new Pepsodent Germ check gives 130% germ check
power in comparison with Colgate‖).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_57">44.     It is contended on behalf of the appellants that the impugned TVC is
per se disparaging the product and goodwill of the appellants. The test
which is shown to be conducted is a cavity test and it is contended that no
such test, in fact, exists. The impugned TVC is stated to depict the mother
of the Colgate child as wearing a worried and a concerned look in
contradiction to the mother of the Pepsodent child who appears as being
confident and satisfied. The expression of the Pepsodent Child's mother
indicates superiority, which it is contended, is meant to show the
superiority of Pepsodent GSP. It is contended that the impression that is
conveyed is that Colgate child's mother is circumspect about Colgate ST.
Much emphasis was laid by the learned counsel for the appellants on the
depiction of the triclosan soldiers, while triclosan soldiers in blue, which
pertain to Pepsodent GSP, are shown to be increasing and subsequently



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 36 of 51</span>
 occupying the entire screen, the triclosan soldiers shown in red, pertaining
to Colgate, are shown to be diminishing. It is contended that this depiction
is mischievous as Triclosan is not a live organism and does not multiply.
The learned counsel for the appellants has also sought to attribute meaning
to the word ―ATTACK‖ which is exclaimed by the child after the cavity
test.
</p>
<p id="p_58">45.     The examination of the impugned TVC frame by frame and its
detailed analysis of the words used or the expressions of the mothers and
attributing a message to them, is in our opinion, not the correct way to view
any advertisement. The advertisement must be viewed in its entirety and it
is not necessary to dissect each word or expression. In the case of
McDonald's <a href="/doc/28580737/" id="a_20">Hamburgers Ltd v. Burgerking (UK) Ltd</a>.: [1986] F.S.R. 45,
the Chancery Division stressed that the advertisement should be considered
as a whole in the case of disparagement and held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">        ―Advertisements are not to be read as if they were some
        testamentary provision in a will or a clause in some agreement
        with every word being carefully considered and the words as a
        whole being compared.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_59">46.     The relevant question to be asked is what is the story line of the
impugned TVC, the intent of the advertiser and the message that it leaves
with the consumers/prospective consumers. In the case of <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_21">Pepsi Co., Inc.
and Ors. v. Hindustan Coca Cola Ltd. and Anr</a>.: 2003 (27) PTC 305
(Del.), a Division Bench of this Court had held that factors which are
required to be considered while deciding the question of the disparagement
are (1) Intent of the commercial (ii) Manner of the commercial (iii) Story
line of the commercial and the message sought to be conveyed by the

 commercial. These factors were further clarified by a Division Bench in the
case of <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_22">Dabur India Ltd. v. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>. (supra)
wherein the court held as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">        (2)     The overall effect of the advertisement -- does it

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">                In this context it must be kept in mind that while
                promoting its product, the advertiser may, while
                comparing it with a rival or a competing product, make
                an unfavourable comparison but that might not
                necessarily affect the story line and message of the
                advertised product or have that as its overall effect.

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">        (3)     The manner of advertising -- is the comparison by and
                large truthful or does it falsely denigrate or disparage a

                permissible,     untruthful    disparagement      is   not
                permissible.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_60">47.     The learned Single Judge has examined the impugned TVC in detail
and has come to a conclusion that the impugned TVC does not depict the
Colgate child in any bad light or points out any defect in Colgate ST.
Although, it had been contended on behalf of the appellants that the mother
of the Colgate child looked worried and concerned and the teeth of the
Colgate child did not look as well formed as that of the Pepsodent child, the
learned Single Judge after examining the frames has not found any such
derogatory representation and has come to a conclusion that impugned
TVC cannot be held to be disparaging Colgate ST. A comparative

 advertisement is permissible and it is open for a trader to compare his
goods and services with that of his competitors and, if true, also proclaim
his goods/services as better than those of competitors. However, he cannot
proclaim that the goods of competitors are bad or make any disparaging
statements about the goods/services of his competitors. We have also
viewed and examined the impugned TVC and, without going into the
truthfulness and accuracy of the message conveyed by the impugned TVC,
it is not possible to conclude that the advertisement per se denigrates or
slanders Colgate S.T. It is not possible to come to a conclusion that the
Colgate child has been shown in a bad light or to be suffering from any
dental ailment and in that view of the matter while the impugned TVC does
proclaim Pepsodent GSP to be 130% better than Colgate, it cannot be stated
that the impugned TVC per se denigrates Colgate ST.
</p>
<p id="p_61">48.     Having stated the above, it would also be necessary to examine the
intent and the overall effect of the advertisement. Following the decision in
<a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_23">Dabur India Ltd. v. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>. (supra), it is
also important to examine the storyline and the message that the impugned
TVC conveys to an average person who is a consumer or a prospective
consumer of the products that are advertised. An average person cannot be
assumed to be gullible and is presumed to have the ability to ignore puffery.
However, an average viewer is likely to accept the factual representations
that are conveyed by an advertisement if the same are conveyed as serious
statements of fact and not as hyperbole. An average viewer does not
analyse an advertisement and is likely to be receptive to the message that
the advertisement projects. A similar view has been articulated by a Single

No.15233/2008 in CS (OS) No.2577/2008, Decided on 12.11.2010,
wherein this court held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">               ―An application of the principles discussed previously in
        this judgment, would mean that the Court has to, as far as
        possible, consider the overall effect of the advertisements; a
        minute dissection of each term, or phrase is uncalled for, and
        the stand point from where the Court should judge the nature
        of the alleged disparagement should be not of the aggrieved
        trader, but the reasonable, or average consumer, who is
        conscious of trading rival's propensities to puff and exaggerate
        their products. At the same time, this reasonable or average
        consumer is likely to be influenced by factual assertions made
        in such advertisements. Specific assertions, or claims, in
        advertisements are more likely impact directly, as contrasted
        with vague and general claims.‖
</blockquote><p id="p_62">49.     If one considers the question, what is the message that is conveyed
by the impugned TVC, we have little doubt that any reasonable person who
views the impugned TVC would receive the message that Pepsodent GSP is
130% more effective than Colgate ST insofar as combating cavities is
concerned. Certain consumers who are not aware of the appellants products
in premium segment are also likely to conclude that Pepsodent GSP is
better than the Colgate toothpastes in view of the voice-over at the end of
the impugned TVC. The entire theme of the impugned TVC is conduct of a
cavity test (the expression ―preventive‖ only appears, in a smaller font size,
on the banner at the commencement of the impugned TVC and is not
referred to thereafter). While the Pepsodent child clears the test with flying
colours apparently the Colgate child does not fare that well. Any reasonable



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                               Page 40 of 51</span>
 person viewing this advertisement would take with him the message that
Pepsodent GSP is significantly better in combating tooth decay and oral
germs/bacteria than Colgate/Colgate ST. A scientific basis is sought to be
supplied for the expression ―130% better‖, thus this cannot be ignored as
hyperbole. The erroneous usage of percentage as a measure may be ignored
but the statement that Pepsodent is better that Colgate in respect of
combating cavity causing germs is, undoubtedly, a statement of fact. The
message that Pepsodent GSP is better than Colgate ST in combating tooth
decay (cavities) is the message that the impugned TVC delivers and this is
a serious representation of fact. Thus, the question that requires to be
addressed is whether this claim by the respondent is truthful or not.
</p>
<p id="p_63">50.     The entire basis of the claim being made by the respondent is that the
In vivo and In vitro test conducted by independent laboratories have found
that concentration of triclosan in dental plaque, after four hours of brushing,
is higher where Pepsodent GSP has been used in comparison with cases
where Colgate ST is used. These findings are also disputed. However,
notwithstanding the dispute, the question which arises is, does this
parameter by itself lead to an inference that Pepsodent GSP is more
efficient in combating tooth decay and cavities in comparison with Colgate
ST. The co-relation between higher concentration of Triclosan after four
hours of usage of Pepsodent GSP as claimed by the respondent and cavity
prevention qualities of the two compared products is vital to determine the
truthfulness of the impugned TVC. In the event, it is found that this co-
relation is illusory and a higher concentration of Triclosan in dental plaque
does not have a proportionate impact in combating tooth decay or germ




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                               Page 41 of 51</span>
 build up or that Colgate ST has certain other ingredients in addition to
Triclosan which also prevent tooth decay then clearly the message sent out
by the impugned TVC would be untruthful and thus impermissible. To
illustrate this point, let us take a hypothetical case of comparison between
two motor vehicle manufacturers. While one manufacturer may use an
engine of a higher cubic capacity, the other manufacturer, while using an
engine of a lower capacity may tune it differently and employ a better fuel
injection system which, in fact, leads to delivering more power to the
wheels in comparison to the vehicle employing the larger capacity engine.
While it would be appropriate for the car manufacturer using a larger
engine to put out a comparative advertisement indicating that the engine
used in vehicles manufactured by him were of a higher capacity than the
engine used by other car manufacturer, it would be completely misleading
if the former car manufacturer would on the basis of a higher capacity
engine proclaim that the vehicles manufactured by him were more powerful
and faster than that of his competitor. The essential message conveyed by
the advertisement must be truthful and given the fact that in a case of
comparative advertisement where the reputation of the products/services of
another dealer/person is at stake, the truthfulness of the essential message
should be strictly tested.

<p id="p_64">51.     In the case of <a href="/doc/1013540/" id="a_24">Lakhanpal National Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. Commission</a>:
(1989) 3 SCC 251, the Supreme Court explained that an advertisement may
contain inaccurate facts yet convey an essentially truthful message. On the
other hand, an advertisement may be entirely accurate on facts but convey a
completely misleading message. In that case, advertisements were issued




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                             Page 42 of 51</span>
 by a dry cell battery manufacturer who was manufacturing and dealing in
power cells under the brand name ―Novino‖. The advertisements
announced that Novino batteries were manufactured in collaboration with
National Panasonic of Japan using National Panasonic techniques. In fact,
there is no company known as National or Panasonic. The same were
brands names of Mitsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. Technically viewed,
the advertisement contained inaccurate facts, however, the Supreme Court
held that viewed from the perspective of the message that was being
communicated, the same could not be held to be untrue. This was explained
by the Supreme Court in the context of unfair trade practice as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">               ―7. However, the question in controversy has to be
        answered by construing the relevant provisions of the Act. The
        definition of ―unfair trade practice‖ in <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_25">Section 36-A</a> mentioned
        above is not inclusive or flexible, but specific and limited in its
        contents. The object is to bring honesty and truth in the
        relationship between the manufacturer and the consumer.
        When a problem arises as to whether a particular act can be
        condemned as an unfair trade practice or not, the key to the
        solution would be to examine whether it contains a false
        statement and is misleading and further what is the effect of
        such a representation made by the manufacturer on the
        common man? Does it lead a reasonable person in the position
        of a buyer to a wrong conclusion? The issue cannot be
        resolved by merely examining whether the representation is
        correct or incorrect in the literal sense. A representation
        containing a statement apparently correct in the technical sense
        may have the effect of misleading the buyer by using tricky
        language. Similarly a statement, which may be inaccurate in
        the technical literal sense can convey the truth and sometimes
        more effectively than a literally correct statement. It is,
        therefore, necessary to examine whether the representation,
        complained of, contains the element of misleading the buyer.
        Does a reasonable man on reading the advertisement form a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                  Page 43 of 51</span>
         belief different from what the truth is? The position will have
        to be viewed with objectivity, in an impersonal manner. It is
        stated in Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn., paras 1044
        and 1045) that a representation will be deemed to be false if it
        is false in substance and in fact; and the test by which the
        representation is to be judged is to see whether the discrepancy
        between the fact as represented and the actual fact is such as
        would be considered material by a reasonable representee.
        ―Another way of stating the rule is to say that substantial
        falsity is, on the one hand, necessary, and, on the other,
        adequate, to establish a misrepresentation‖ and ―that where the
        entire representation is a faithful picture or transcript of the
        essential facts, no falsity is established, even though there may
        have been any number of inaccuracies in unimportant details.
        Conversely, if the general impression conveyed is false, the
        most punctilious and scrupulous accuracy in immaterial
        minutiae will not render the representation true‖; Let us
        examine the relevant facts of this case in this background.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_65">52.     The disclosure of the basis on which the message of the impugned
TVC is predicated (i.e. the Super indicating that basis to be In vivo study)
would not be an adequate defence if the message conveyed by the
impugned TVC advertisement is found to be untruthful.
</p>
<p id="p_66">53.     We find that this aspect of the matter has not been considered by the
learned Single Judge. Even before us, arguments on this aspect were also
advanced at the stage of rejoinder and the respondent did not have an
occasion to contest the same. In these circumstances, we consider it
appropriate if the matter is remanded to the learned Single Judge for
considering this aspect of the matter afresh, based on the material that may
be produced by the appellant in support of its contentions.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                                Page 44 of 51</span>
<p id="p_67"> 54.     We have refrained from examining whether the essential message
which is conveyed by the impugned TVC is untruthful or inaccurate as the
same had not been placed before the learned Single Judge. However, we
must add that in the event the learned Single Judge, on the basis of the
material placed by the parties, comes to a conclusion that the appellant's
contention that higher concentration of Triclosan as claimed by the
respondent does not, prima facie, establish that Pepsodent GSP is superior
in its efficacy to combat tooth decay in comparison with Colgate ST then in
such event the telecast of the impugned TVC would be liable to be
interdicted as the balance of convenience is squarely in favour of the
appellants. In the event that impugned TVC is found to be, prima facie,
misleading and inaccurate, it would follow that the appellant's contention
that they must be protected against the injury being caused to their
reputation and goodwill is liable to be accepted. Restraining the telecast of
the impugned TVC would not result in any significant damage or injury to
the respondent even if, subsequently, the claim against them is not
established. As indicated earlier, in our view, the balance of convenience
in this case would lie squarely in favour of the appellants provided they are
able to, prima facie, establish that the message of the impugned TVC, as
discussed hereinbefore, is not accurate or is misleading or untruthful.
</p>
<p id="p_68">55.     We may add that the appellants have a product in their portfolio,
Colgate Total, which, admittedly, delivers a sustained release of triclosan.
Admittedly, the concentration of triclosan in dental plaque, after four hours
of brushing with Pepsodent GSP, does not exceed the concentration of
Triclosan where Colgate Total is used. The learned counsel for the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                               Page 45 of 51</span>
 respondent has explained that Colgate Total is a product in the premium
segment and the comparative advertisement is not in respect of Colgate
Total. In this view of the matter, the voiceover at the end of the impugned
TVC which proclaims Pepsodent GSP to be better than Colgate is
indisputably inaccurate and prima facie mischievous. In this view of the
matter, this voiceover is liable to be deleted altogether or modified. The
Super in the impugned advertisement which explains the basis of indexing
of 130%, is alleged to be not visible when the advertisement is viewed on
an ordinary Television Set, this aspect has not been seriously contested by
the respondent. In the event, the super is not visible on ordinary television
sets, the impugned TVC would also require to be modified to ensure that
the super is clearly visible to all viewers including those that view the
impugned TVC on ordinary television sets.

<p id="p_69">Impugned print advertisement

</p><p id="p_70">56.     A full page advertisement that was published in the Hindustan Times
showed a hand gripping a product Pepsodent GSP and below which was a
caption ―IT'S TIMES TO ATTACK‖. The lower half of the page of the
impugned print advertisement depicted a comparison between Colgate ST
and Pepsodent GSP and the caption boldly stated read as ―PEPSODENT -
NOW BETTER THAN COLGATE STRONG TEETH. DELIVERS 130%
GERM ATTACK POWER.‖ Lower half of the impugned print
advertisement is split in two parts, one part is the Pepsodent side which is
in a blue background. The other part is the Colgate side which is in a red
background. Each part has picture of a child. The child on the Pepsodent
side (referred to as the ―Pepsodent Child‖) is depicted holding a spoon and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 46 of 51</span>
 is in the process of consuming a visibly appetising dessert (a slice of cake
or pastry which has a liberal dose of chocolate syrup) which is placed
before him. The product Pepsodent GSP is clearly visible on the Pepsodent
side of this advertisement. On the Colgate side, the child (referred to as the
―Colgate Child‖) is shown to be unhappy. Although, a plate of dessert is
before him, he is not shown to be consuming the same but is shown as
having placed his clenched fist on his jaw clearly depicting certain amount
of discomfort, obviously, on account of a dental problem. The dessert
placed before the child is also not as appetising. On the centre of the lower
half of the page is a depiction of a tooth, which on the Pepsodent side is
shown as covered in green spots barring one spot which is shown in white.
The Colgate side of the tooth is depicted having red and white spots. The
caption on the tooth states ―4 Hours After Brushing‖. On the lower portion
of the impugned print advertisement, a picture of Pepsodent GSP alongwith
the caption ―Non-Stop Attaaaack! on cavity causing germs‖ is printed. The
advertisement contains a Super which is in fine print and reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">        ―Creative Visualization of the Action of Triclosan on Cavity

        where Germ Attack Power refers to amount of Triclosan
        remaining in mouth, 4 hours after brushing, where COLGATE
        STRONG TEETH is indexed at 100% and PEPSODENT

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 47 of 51</span>
<p id="p_71"> 57.     The tests to determine whether an advertisement is disparaging or
misleading as are discussed in respect of the impugned TVC are equally
applicable to the impugned print advertisement. One has to only look at the
advertisement to realise that the visual story that is conveyed is that while
the Pepsodent child is happy, healthy and can enjoy his dessert, the child
using Colgate is uncomfortable and clearly unable to consume the dessert,
presumably on account of a dental ailment toothache which is depicted by
the child holding his jaw on a clenched fist.
</p>
<p id="p_72">58.     The learned counsel for the appellants has made submissions as to
how the colour scheme and certain finer aspects of the advertisement are all
designed to disparage Colgate ST and has also handed over a glossy print




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 48 of 51</span>
 of the advertisement alongwith comments pointing out as to how the
Pepsodent GSP is shown not only to be superior than Colgate ST but also
depicting that use of Colgate would cause discomfort to its user. We do not
find it necessary to examine each of those comments separately, as in our
view, an advertisement must be viewed in the perspective of the impression
that is obtained by an average consumer/prospective consumer who
views/reads the advertisement. Viewed from the perspective of an average
person with imperfect recollection, we are in no manner of doubt that the
advertisement not only conveys an impression that use of Colgate would
not be as effective as Pepsodent but also conveys an impression that use of
Colgate ST instead of Pepsodent GSP would result in causing harm and
discomfort to its consumers. This is clearly the essential message of the
visual story depicted by juxtaposing the two children, one happy and
enjoying his dessert and the other who is in discomfort and unable to
consume the dessert placed before him on account of a dental ailment.
Given the fact that advertisements are not analysed carefully but are usually
glanced over by most readers. It is apparent that a consumer who glances at
this advertisement would, surely carry the impression as stated above.
Thus, in our view, the impugned print advertisement is prima facie
disparaging of the appellant's goodwill and its product Colgate ST.
</p>
<p id="p_73">59.     In our view, even if, we assume that the representation that
Pepsodent is more effective in combating germs, 4 hours after brushing, in
comparison with Colgate ST, is correct even then, prima facie, the
advertisement would be disparaging as it also conveys the message that
Colgate is ineffective and lacks the requisite quality to maintain oral




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">FAO(OS) No.396/2013                                              Page 49 of 51</span>
 hygiene and combat tooth decay and its usage, as depicted by the Colgate
child, would result in the user ending up with a tooth related ailment. As
explained in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_26">Dabur India Ltd. v. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.
(supra) a trader cannot, while saying that his goods are better than his
competitors', say that his competitors' goods are bad. If he says so, he
really slanders the goods of his competitors. In other words, he defames his
competitors and their goods, which is not permissible. In our view, this is
precisely what the impugned print advertisement conveys by its
advertisement theme and the visual story.
</p>
<p id="p_74">Conclusion

</p><p id="p_75">60.     To sum up, in our view, the impugned TVC cannot be stated to be
per se disparaging Colgate ST. However, the voice over at the end of the
impugned TVC which states ―Naya Pepsodent Germi Check Colgate Ke
Mukable 130 pratishat Germ Attack Power‖ (freely translated means ―in
comparison to Colgate New Pepsodent Germi Check has 130% Germ
Attack Power‖) is misleading and inaccurate. Thus, this statement in the
voiceover is directed to be deleted from the impugned TVC or at the option
of the respondent, may be suitably modified to refer only to Colgate ST
(Colgate Strong Teeth). The respondent is further directed to ensure that the
Super which reads as ―Creative Visualization of the Action of Triclosan on
Cavity causing Germs. New Pepsodent Germicheck enhances delivery of
Triclosan in the mouth. Claim based on In-Vivo study where Germ Attack
Power refers to amount of Triclosan remaining in mouth, 4 hours after
brushing, where COLGATE STRONG TEETH is indexed at 100% and
PEPSODENT GERMI CHECK is 130%. Brush twice daily.‖ is clearly

 visible when the impugned TVC is viewed on any television set. The
matter is remitted to the learned Single Judge to consider afresh the aspect
whether the essential message conveyed by the impugned TVC is prima
facie truthful or misleading in the light of the observations made
hereinbefore.

disparages Colgate ST (Colgate Strong Teeth) or any other product of the
