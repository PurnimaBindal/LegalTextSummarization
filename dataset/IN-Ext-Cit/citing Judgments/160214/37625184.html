<p id="p_2">        2.      The factual matrix, as have been unfolded

in the writ petition as well as in this appeal, are the

appellant was elected as Pramukh of Fatuha Block under

the provisions of Bihar Panchyat Raj Act, 2006 (for

brevity `the Actâ€Ÿ).    While she was functioning as the

Pramukh, the members of the Panchayat Samiti sent a

requisition on 05.12.2009 for convening a special meeting

for No Confidence Motion against her. On the basis of the

said requisition, the Block Development Officer-cum-
</p>
<p id="p_3">Executive Officer issued notice for convening a special

meeting on 12.12.2009.        On the date fixed, a No

Confidence Motion after being mooted was passed against

the appellant. The appellant, as is evident, participated in

the No Confidence Motion, which was passed against her

and she became unseated. After the post fell vacant, the

State Election Commission communicated to the District

Magistrate-cum-Election Officer, Patna fixing 11.01.2010

for the date of election of new Pramukh.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        3.            Being dissatisfied with the aforesaid

action, the appellant invoked the jurisdiction of this Court

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India contending,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                    3</span>




inter alia, that the notice that   was issued by the Block

Development      Officer-cum-Executive    Officer   of   the

Panchayat Samiti fixing the meeting on 12.12.2009 does

not meet the requirement as postulated under Section

46(4) of the Act as the said provision provides that there

must be a clear seven days notice for convening a special

meeting for consideration of No Confidence Motion.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Structuring the said stand it was urged that the date the

notice was issued, that is, 05.12.2009, was to be included

and the day of meeting, that is, 12.12.2009, has to be

excluded and on such exclusion, the notice period would

stand reduced to six days which vitiates the mandatory

provision as engrafted under Section 46(4) of the Act, and

therefore, the vote of No Confidence passed against her is

null and void and, therefore, in the ultimate eventuate, the

Notification issued by the State Election Commission to

fill up the post treating the same to be vacant is

unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         4.      The learned single Judge took note of the

statutory provisions, the pleadings in paragraph 6 of the

writ petition by which the appellant had fixed the date for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                   4</span>




convening the meeting in the Register of        Panchayat

Samiti and her participation in the special meeting wherein

the vote of No Confidence was passed and the result of the

meeting to the effect that out of 16 elected Members, three

votes were found unmarked, one was found invalid and 12

Members voted against her and the conduct of the

appellant which invited the wrath of the principle of

approbate and reprobate expressed the view that the

resolution passed against the appellant did not deserve to

be interfered with. It is apt to note the learned single

Judge has also referred to the concept of democratic

process of adult franchise and the concept of loss of

confidence of the House to bolster his view.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        5.            Mr. Shambhu Prasad Singh, learned

counsel appearing for the appellant assailing the

pregnability of the order of the learned single Judge has

raised the following contentions:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">        (a)   The order passed by the learned single Judge

is totally indefensible inasmuch as after recording a

finding there has been no seven clear days notice, he has

declined to interfere with the resolution passed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                    5</span>




Panchayat Samiti by which the appellant was unseated.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         (b)     The learned single Judge has erroneously

applied the principle of approbate and reprobate which is

not applicable to the case at hand and the reliance placed

by him on the decision <a href="/doc/652255/" id="a_2">Sanjay Singh Som v. The State of

Bihar &amp; Ors</a>., (2002) 3 PLJR 589 is absolutely misplaced

and thereby the order passed by him becomes vulnerable.
</p>
<p id="p_10">         (c)   When the meeting itself is illegal because of

violation of the mandatory provisions of the Act, the result

of meeting would not rectify the defect and attracting the

concept of democratic process and the loss of confidence

of the House in an elected candidate is wholly

unwarranted inasmuch as an act unless done in accord

with the requirement of the statute is fundamentally null

and void.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         (d)     If the order of the learned single Judge is

appositely scrutinized it would be clear as day that he has

not adverted to the statutory spectrum in proper

perspective and has entered into the realm of adult

franchise to incorporate a new concept which only the

legislature can do. In essentiality, the learned single Judge
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                   6</span>




has entered into the realm of legislation which is

impermissible in law.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        (e)     The learned single Judge should have been

guided by the decision rendered in Jai Lal Yadav &amp; Anr.
</p>
<p id="p_13">v. The State of Bihar &amp; Ors., (2004) 2 PLJR 468 which

is a binding precedent in the field of notice and the

resultant concomitant and should not have opined that the

appellant is precluded to challenge her own action.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        Mr. Singh, learned counsel for the appellant, to

buttress his submissions has placed reliance on <a href="/doc/1437424/" id="a_3">Ahmed

appearing for the 3rd respondent resisting the aforesaid

submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant has

canvassed the following proponements:-
</p>
<p id="p_18">            (i)     The order passed by the learned single

Judge is impeccable since the appellant on her own

showing had fixed the date of the meeting to 12.12.2009

and taken a chance to participate in the meeting, she

cannot take a summersault to challenge the same.
</p>
<p id="p_19">            (ii)    The decision rendered in Jai Lal Yadav

&amp; Anr. (supra) is not applicable to the factual scenario

and is distinguishable.
</p>
<p id="p_20">            (iii)    Though there is mandatory requirement

for giving seven clear days notice, yet the appellant by her

own conduct has waived the same and, hence, the order

passed by the learned single Judge withstands studied

scrutiny.
</p>
<p id="p_21">            Mr. Mauli, learned counsel, to bolster his

submissions, has placed reliance on the decision in <a href="/doc/1924975/" id="a_6">Bibi

<p id="p_22">            8.          To appreciate the rival submissions

raised at the Bar it is seemly to refer to Section 44 of the

removal of Pramukh and Up Pramukh. Sub-section (3) of

</p>
<p id="p_32">         9.              Section 46 of the Act deals with

convening of meeting of Panchayat Samiti. Sub-section

(4) of Section 46 of the Act being relevant for the present

purpose is reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              "46(4) Ten clear daysâ€Ÿ notice of an
              ordinary meeting and seven clear daysâ€Ÿ
              notice of a special meeting specifying the

<p id="p_33">         10.          On a reading of the aforesaid provision

there can be no scintilla of doubt that the said provision is

mandatory. There has to be notice of seven clear days.
</p>
<p id="p_34">         11.             The fulcrum of the matter is whether

the appellant by her own conduct has waived the

mandatory requirement commanded by the Statute. Before

we dwell upon the factual arena we may refer to the

citations upon which reliance has been placed by Mr.

Singh. Learned counsel has drawn inspiration from

paragraph 22 of the decision rendered in Ahmed Hussain

Khan (supra).       In the said case, their Lordships were

dealing with the right to receive pension under the Pension

Rules and, in that context, their Lordships expressed the

view that the right to receive pension in the facts of the

said case had not been waived as the same having not been

established. Thus, the said decision does not render any

assistance to the proposition put forth by Mr. Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_35">         12.               In Swaran Singh &amp; Ors. (supra),

their Lordships have held to construe a statute, the scheme
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                   12</span>




of the Act has be taken into consideration and, for the said

purpose, it has to be read as a whole and then chapter by

chapter, section by section and word by word. In the

present case we are concerned with the proposition

whether a mandatory provision can be waived. Therefore,

we are disposed to think the said decision does not aid or

assist the stand put forth by Mr. Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_36">         13.           <a href="/doc/1056962/" id="a_7">In Jogindra Singh Sodhi v. Amar

Kaur</a>, (2005) 1 SCC 31, a two-Judge Bench of the Apex

Court was dealing with the stand taken as regards waiver

on the part of the landlady by her own conduct. Their

Lordships expressed the view that waiver is a question of

fact which must be expressly pleaded, clearly proved and

no such plea had been raised by the tenant or by the sub-
</p>
<p id="p_37">tenant. Their Lordships further held a bald plea of waiver

cannot defeat statutory provision made in larger interest.
</p>
<p id="p_38">In that context their Lordships referred to the earlier

decisions rendered in Shalimar Tar Products Ltd. v.
</p>
<p id="p_39">H.C. Sharma, (1988) 1 SCC 70 and Pulin Behari Lal v.
</p>
<p id="p_40">Mahadeb Dutta &amp; Ors., (1993) 1 SCC 629.                  In

Shalimar Tar Products Ltd. (supra) the Apex Court has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                       13</span>




expressed the views as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                "13. Everyone has a right to waive and to
                agree to waive the advantage of a law
                made solely for the benefit and protection
                of the individual in his individual capacity.
                We are, however, in this case unable to
                agree. Firstly, in this case there was no
                case of waiver. Waiver is a question of fact
                which has to be tested by facts and
                evidence. There was no conscious
                relinquishment of the advantage of any
                statute. No court has gone into this fact. It
                does not seem to have been urged before
                the High Court also. Apart from this, in
                this requirement of the statute which is in
                the public interest there cannot be any
                question of waiver of a right, dealing with
                the rights of the tenants or the landlord.
                ...."</blockquote>

<p id="p_41">            In Pulin Behari Lal (supra) it has been held as

follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                "6. ... ... ... Waiver is a question of fact
                which depends on the facts and
                circumstances of each case. In the case of
                waiver of any provisions of the statute it is
                necessary to prove that there was
                conscious relinquishment of the advantage
                of such provisions of the statute. ... ... ..."</blockquote>

<p id="p_42">          14.          In this regard we may fruitfully refer to

the decision in Bibi Amna Khatun &amp; Ors. (supra)

wherein the majority speaking through Hari Lal Agrawal,

J.   (as His Lordship then was), expressed the view as

under:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">       14</span>




<p id="p_43">"8. In my opinion, simply because the
second part of Section 11A is mandatory
in nature, will not rule out the application
of the principle of â€žwaiverâ€Ÿ, if once the
correct scope of this maxim is appreciated
and understood. Although the desired
assistance was not rendered at the Bar, I
have taken some pains to examine the
proposition in its true perspective with
reference to the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_44">9. The essence of waiver is â€žestoppelâ€Ÿ and
where there is no â€žestoppelâ€Ÿ, there can be
no â€žwaiverâ€Ÿ, the connection between
â€žestoppelâ€Ÿ and â€žwaiverâ€Ÿ being very close.
But in spite of that, there is an essential
and fundamental difference between the
two and that is that whereas estoppel is a
rule of evidence, waiver is a rule of
conduct. The accepted connotation of
â€žwaiverâ€Ÿ is that to constitute waiver there
must be an intentional relinquishment of a
known       right   or     the   voluntary
relinquishment or abandonment of an
existing legal right and a conduct which
warrants      an    inference    of     the
relinquishment of a known right or a
privilege (see AIR 1959 SC 149).

<p id="p_45"> There is, however, a tendency to mix up
â€žwaiverâ€Ÿ and â€žestoppelâ€Ÿ, as a single idea,
although the one has apparently reference
to a manâ€Ÿs conduct and the other to the
legal consequence of that conduct. The
principle underlying both these maxims is
the same, namely, that a party will not be
permitted to approbate and reprobate or, in
other words, to blow hot and cold, in
respect of the same matter. This is the
underlying principle behind the maxim
â€žwaiverâ€Ÿ.
</p>
<p id="p_46">I may now refer to a few authorities
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                     15</span>




              where the application of waiver has been
              considered, in order to bring home my
              point of view. The principle that has been
              decided by those authorities, if I may
              briefly put it here, is that where a right or
              privilege guaranteed by law rests in the
              individual and is primarily intended for his
              benefit and does not infringe the right of
              others, it can be waived provided such
              waiver is not forbidden by law and does
              not contravene any public policy. This
              principle was recognized by this Court also
              in the case of Sashibhusan Prasad Singh v.
              Dalip Narain Singh (AIR 1936 Pat 75) and
              then again in the case of <a href="/doc/1943102/" id="a_8">Jogendra Missir v.
              Ramnandan Singh</a> (AIR 1968 Pat 218).
              The Supreme Court also in the case of
              <a href="/doc/761967/" id="a_9">Basheshar Nath v. Commr. of Income-tax,
              Delhi and Rajasthan</a> (AIR 1959 SC 149)
              made a similar observation. Maxwell in his
              interpretation of Statutes, 11th Edition
              (1962) at page 376, has also enunciated the
              same principle for applying this principle
              of estoppel."

<p id="p_47">        15.           In this context we may profitably refer

to <a href="/doc/760851/" id="a_10">Krishna Bahadur v. Purna Theatre</a>, (2004) 8 SCC

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              "9. The principle of waiver although is
              akin to the principle of estoppel; the
              difference between the two, however, is
              that whereas estoppel is not a cause of
              action; it is a rule of evidence; waiver is
              contractual and may constitute a cause of
              action; it is an agreement between the
              parties and a party fully knowing of its
              rights has agreed not to assert a right for a
              consideration.

the view as follows: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">            "20. Having seen the pronouncements of
            judicial fora, we can now inform ourselves
            as to the view of the reputed authors on
            interpretation of statutes as well as
            administrative law. We may start with
            what has been stated in Maxwellâ€Ÿs The
            interpretation of Statutes. This aspect has
            been dealt at pages 328-330 (12th Edn.)
            and it has been stated that if the benefit be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">       18</span>




for the protection of an individual in his
private capacity the same can be waived.
</blockquote><p id="p_53">To illustrate, reference has been made
about waiver of the benefit of the
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_15">Limitation Act</a>. This is on the maxim of
law ""Quilibet potest renunciare juri pro se
introducto", meaning "an individual may
renounce a law made for his special
benefit". Maxwell then says that if the
benefit be one which has been imposed in
public interest there can be no waiver of
the same."
</p>
<p id="p_54">"21. Craies in his Statute Law has opined
the same, as would appear from what has
been stated at page 269 of 7th Edn. By
drawing attention to the aforesaid maxim,
it has been observed that if the object of a
statute is "not one of general policy, or if
the thing which is being done will benefit
only a particular person or class of
persons, then the conditions prescribed by
the statute are not considered as being
indispensable". To illustrate this principle,
it has been stated that if the statutory
condition be imposed simply for the
security or the benefit of the parties to the
action themselves, such condition will not
be considered as indispensable and either
party may waive it."
</p>
<p id="p_55">"22. Crawford in his Interpretation of
Laws takes the same view as would appear
from pages 540-542 (1989 Reprint). The
learned author while quoting the aforesaid
maxim states at page 542 that requirement
like giving of notice may be waived as the
same is intended for the benefit of the
person concerned."
</p>
<p id="p_56">"23. We may also refer to the views
expressed by Francis Bennion in his
Statutory Interpretation (1984), wherein
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                   19</span>




            this aspect has been dealt with at pages 27
            et seq and it has been stated that if the
            performance of statutory duty be one
            which would come within the aforesaid
            maxim, the person entitled to the
            performance can effectively waive
            performance of the duty by the person
            bound. As an illustration mention has been
            made (at page 29) of decisions in Toronto
            Corpn. V. Russell and Stylo Shoes Ltd. v.
            Prices Tailors Ltd. wherein it was held that
            a duty to give notice of certain matters can
            be waived by the person entitled to notice,
            if there is no express or implied indication
            that absence of notice would be fatal "
</p>
<p id="p_57">            "24. H.W.R. Wadeâ€Ÿs name is well known
            in the world of administrative law. He has
            dealt with this aspect at page 267 of the 6th
            Edn. of his treatise wherein he has quoted
            what Lord Denning, MR said in Wells v.
</p><p id="p_58">            Minister     of    Housing     and     Local

                 irregularity can be waived, even
                 by a public authority, so as to
                 render valid that which would
                 otherwise be invalid."
</p>

<p id="p_60">           19.            In this context we may refer with

profit the decision in    Indira Bai (supra) wherein the

Apex Court while drawing a distinction between private

and public interest has expressed thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">        "5. ................... The test to determine the
        nature of interest, namely, private or public
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                   20</span>




         is whether the right which is renunciated is
         the right of party alone or of the public also
         in the sense that the general welfare of the
         society is involved. If the answer is latter
         then it may be difficult to put estoppel as a
         defence. But if it is right of party alone
         then it is capable of being abnegated either
         in writing or by conduct. ........."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                                 [Emphasis supplied]
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">          20.          The present factual expose has to be

appreciated on the touchstone and anvil of aforesaid

pronouncements.     As is demonstrable, the petitioner in

paragraph 6 of the writ petition has stated as follows;-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">            "6. That the petitioner has fixed the date
            for    convening      the   meeting     for
            consideration of no confidence against her
            in the Register of the Panchayat Samiti for
            issuing the notice by the Executive Officer
            for 12.12.09."</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">            From the aforesaid it is perceived that she

herself had fixed the date of meeting. The meeting as

fixed was held on 12.12.2009. She participated in the

meeting and took a chance. Thus, fixing of the meeting by

the appellant and participation in the meeting would

tantamount to waiver by express conduct. If the provisions

contained in <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_16">Section 44</a> and <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_17">46(4)</a> of the Act are read
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                   21</span>




appositely there can be no shadow of doubt that they

provide a protective umbrella to the elected Pramukh.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_61">Thus, the same does not contravene any public policy. It

does not involve any public interest. As we perceive the

scheme and anatomy of the provisions of the Act, it is, in

fact, basically a protection to the elected candidate. In this

regard a Full Bench decision of the High Court of Madhya

Pradesh in Smt. Bhulin Dewangan Vs. State of M.P. &amp;

Ors., 2000 (4) M.P.H.T. 69 (FB), is apposite to refer. The

Full Bench while dealing with the validity of notice calling

a meeting of no confidence under M.P. Panchayat (Gram

Panchayat Ke Sarpanch Tatha Up-Sarpanch, Janpad

Panchayat Tatha Zila Panchayat Ke President Tatha Vice

President Ke Virudh Avishwas Prastav) Niyam, 1994

speaking through D.M. Dharmadhikari, J. (as His Lordship

then was) held as follows:-
</p>
          "15. The general rule is that non-
<p id="p_62">         compliance of mandatory requirement
         results in nullification of the Act. There are,
         however, several exceptions to the same. If
         certain requirements or conditions are
         provided by statute in the interest of a
         particular person, the requirements or
         conditions, although mandatory, may be
         waived by him if no public interest are
         involved and in such a case the act done will
         be valid even if the requirements or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">          22</span>




conditions have not been performed. This
appears to be the reason for learned C.K.
Prasad, J. in Dhumadhandin Vs. State of
M.P. (1997 (1) Vidhi Bhasvar 49) which
was followed by R.S. Garg, j., in Mahavir
Saket Vs. Collector, Rewa (1998 (1) JLJ
</p><p id="p_63">113) for holding that mere non-compliance
of first part of the rule in fixing a meeting
beyond the prescribed days of the motion of
no-confidence would not invalidate the
whole proceedings.             In case of
Dhumadhandin (supra), the Sarpanch did not
question the validity of the notice calling the
meeting of no-confidence and in fact had
taken chance by facing the motion. R.S.
Garg, J. in Mahavir Saket (supra) placed
reliance on the decision of C.K. Prasad, J.,
in Dhumadhandin (supra) to up-hold the
passing of the no-confidence motion in the
adjourned meeting as in the meeting called
within the prescribed fifteen days the
Presiding Officer was not available. Sub-
section (4) of <a href="/doc/1772105/" id="a_18">Section 21</a> permits reference
of a dispute to the Collector by Sarpanch or
Up-Sarpanch against whom a notice of no
confidence motion had been passed. The
proceedings of the no-confidence motion or
other proceedings under the Act are also
assailable in this Court as Constitutional
Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_19">Article 227</a> of the Constitution
of India. As has been construed by us, even
though second part of the rule requiring
dispatch of notice of the meeting to the
member is mandatory, yet in every case of
challenge to the proceeding of no-
confidence motion either before the
Collector or this Court, it would still be open
to the Collector or his Court to find out
whether in a given case non-compliance of
any part of the rule has in fact resulted in
any failure of justice or has caused any
serious prejudice to any of the parties. The
general rule is that a mandatory provision of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">          23</span>




law requires strict compliance and the
directory one only substantial. But even
where the provisions is mandatory, every
non-compliance of the same need not
necessarily result in nullification of the
whole action. In a given situation even for
non-fulfillment of mandatory requirement,
the authority empowered to take a decision
may refuse to nullify the action on the
ground that no substantial prejudice had
been caused to the party affected or to any
other party which would have any other
substantial interest in the proceeding. This
Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_20">Article 227</a> of the Constitution
has also a discretion not to interfere even
though a mandatory requirement of law has
not been strictly complied with as thereby
no serious prejudice or failure of justice has
been caused. This is how various Single
Bench decisions in which even after finding
some infraction of the second part of Rule
3(3) of the Rules of 1994, the resolution of
no-confidence motion passed was not
invalidated on the ground that no substantial
prejudice thereby was caused to the affected
parties. The intention of the legislature has
to be gathered from the provisions contained
in <a href="/doc/1772105/" id="a_21">Section 21</a> and the Rule 3(3) framed
thereunder. The provisions do evince an
intention that a meeting of the no-confidence
motion be called within a reasonable period
of not later than 15 days and every member
has to be informed of the same seven days in
advance. A notice of no-confidence motion
is required to be moved by not less than
1/3rd of the total number of elected members
as required by first Proviso to sub-rule (1) of
Rule 3 and can be lawfully carried by a
resolution passed by majority of not less
than 3/4th of the Panchas present and voting
and such majority has to be more than 2/3rd
of the total number of Panchas constituting
the Panchayat in accordance with sub-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">          24</span>




<p id="p_64">section (1) of <a href="/doc/1772105/" id="a_22">Section 21</a> of the Act. This
being the substance of the provisions under
the Act and the rules, a mere non-
</p><p id="p_65">compliance of second part of sub-rule (3)
would not in every case invalidate the action
unless the Collector while deciding the
dispute under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1772105/" id="a_23">Section 21</a>
or this Court in exercise of its supervisory
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_24">Art.227</a> of the constitution
comes to the conclusion that such non-
compliance has caused serious prejudice to
the affected office bearer or has otherwise
resulted in failure of justice."
</p>
<p id="p_66">16. We get some support in our conclusion on
the construction of the provisions contained in
the Rule from Statutory construction by
Francis J. Mc. Caffrrey, 1953 Edition, <a href="/doc/1205651/" id="a_25">Article
52</a>, Page 110 where it stated:
</p>
<p id="p_67">                    "Where        a      statute
      regulates the time at or within which
      an act is to be done by a public officer
      or body, it is generally construed to be
      permissive only as to the time, for the
      reason "that the public interests are
      not to suffer by the laches of any
      public officer" (Looney Vs. Hughes,
      26 N.Y., 514). While the Courts are
      inclined to hold such provisions to be
      directory only as to time, they will be
      read as mandatory if the nature of the
      act to be performed or the
      phraseology of the statute indicates an
      intention on the part of the legislature
      to exact a literal compliance with the
      requirement of time. The Courts seek
      to achieve a just result in not ascribing
      an invalidating effect to the failure of
      public officers to observe the time
      provisions of statutes; a contrary rule
      would operate unfairly in prejudicing
      the rights of persons who have no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                   25</span>




                control over the conduct of the public

         and from the following passage in Statutory
         Interpretation by Francis Bennion, Second
         Edition, Part I <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_26">Section 10</a> Page 34:

                purely formal or technical defect.
                This may be described as a defect
                that does not materially impair the
                remedy intended to be provided by

<p id="p_69">          21.           Applying the aforesaid principle to

the facts of the present case there can be no room for

doubt that the right could be waived by the elected

candidate and she has done so by her express conduct.
</p>
<p id="p_70">Quite apart from the above this Court cannot be oblivious

of the fact that the appellant had participated in the

meeting by taking a chance and 12 members voted against

voted against her. Ergo, there is no justification or warrant

Samiti had issued notice about the meeting which was

scheduled prior to the statutory period. The learned single

Judge in paragraph 4 has held as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">             "4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of
             the petitioners has raised several points to
             assail the notice and ultimate resolution
             carrying out the no-confidence motion but
             as the writ application is to succeed on a
             very short point, I do not consider it
             expedient either to incorporate or answer
             the same. Undisputedly the Executive
             Officer had issued the notice on 5.12.2001
             and the date of the meeting fixed is
             12.12.2001. The meeting to consider the
             no-confidence motion has to be considered
             in a special meeting. Section 44(4) of the
             Bihar Panchayat Raj Act clearly stipulates
             that seven clear days notice of a special
             meeting has to be given. In the present
             case seven clear days notice of the special
             meeting has not been given and thus the
             notice is vitiated on account of infraction
             of section 44(4) of the Bihar Panchayat
             Act. Consequently the resolution passed on
             such an illegal notice cannot be allowed to
             stand. The view which I have taken finds

           support from an unreported decision of this
           Court dated 20.11.2003 passed in C.W.J.C.
           No.5326 of 2003 (Arun Kumar Singh vrs.
           The State of Bihar and others) [reported in
           2004 (2) PLJR 367] wherein this Court has
           held as follows: -

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">                 "Having answered this, the next
                 question     which     falls    for
                 determination is as to how the
                 period of seven clear days notice
                 is to be calculated. It is well
                 settled that when a statute
                 provides for stated period of
                 notice to be given, this
                 requirement must be met,
                 otherwise the meeting will be
                 invalid. In the present case,
                 <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_27">section 44(4)</a> of the Act had in no
                 uncertain term provided for
                 seven clear days notice, which
                 would obviously mean that the
                 notice should be exclusive of the
                 day on which it is issued and of
                 the meeting. Applying the
                 aforesaid principle, I am of the
                 opinion that the notice to hold the
                 meeting is invalid in the eye of
                 law as seven clear days notice
                 was not given."

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">          23.           The legal proposition enunciated

therein cannot be doubted but, a significant one, the

factual matrix has to be scanned. In the said case the

petitioner had filed the writ for quashment of notice

whereby date and time to consider the No Confidence

Motion against him was placed. The matter was subject to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                     28</span>




                 result of the writ petition. The said decision does not show

                 that the petitioner himself had issued the notice or had

                 participated in the election process without any protest.
