</p><p id="p_5">2.      It is averred that Plaintiffs are part of the renowned Indiabulls Group
of Companies and have an established presence in India as well as
internationally, since 1994, as a financial services conglomerate. Combined
revenue of the Indiabulls Group for the year 2017-2018 was over Rs. 22,000
Crores, of which Plaintiffs No. 1 and 2 contributed to more than Rs. 16,000
Crores.
</p><p id="p_6">3.      It is further averred that Plaintiffs No. 1 and 3 are the registered
proprietors of the trademark &#x27;INDIABULLS&#x27; in various classes including
Class 36. Plaintiff No. 2 is the registered proprietor of the trademark
&#x27;DHANI&#x27; and its variations in several classes, including classes 9 and 36, as



well as registered proprietor of the trademark (device) &#x27;                      &#x27; in class 9.
The trademark &#x27;DHANI&#x27; was conceptualised and coined by Plaintiff No. 2
for launching personal loans, finance and services application on the website
www.indiabullsdhani.com and through a mobile application. Trademark



&#x27;DHANI&#x27;, with/without                       device is the essential part of various
registered trademarks of the Plaintiffs and has been extensively and
continuously used since 2017. Details of Plaintiffs&#x27; registrations for



&#x27;DHANI&#x27; and/or bearing the                     device mark are furnished in the plaint.

extensively used since then. &#x27;INDIABULLS&#x27; is not only a trademark but a
brand identity of the Plaintiffs and has been used with respect to financial
and other services since inception of the Plaintiffs&#x27; companies. Plaintiffs
have extensively promoted and advertised their trademarks. Promotional
expenses for the years 2017-2019 are as under:

</pre><p id="p_9">5.      It is averred that Plaintiffs make their services available online
through the website having the domain name www.indiabullsdhani.com,
which has been registered since 2017 and is fully operational. The domain
name is exclusively associated with the Plaintiffs and the services provided
by them and no other party has a right to adopt or use the same as a domain
name or trademark in any manner, which is identical or deceptively similar
to that of the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have been vigilant in protecting their
registered trademarks against third parties and have an ex parte ad interim
injunction in CS(COMM) 626/2019 as well as a decree in CS(COMM)
590/2017, in their favour.
</p><p id="p_10">6.      It is further averred that Defendant No. 1 is operating a fake and
fraudulent website under the domain name www.dhanifinance.in, through
which it is offering financial services, similar to those of the Plaintiffs, to the
consumers, under the Plaintiffs&#x27; trademarks &#x27;INDIABULLS&#x27;, &#x27;DHANI&#x27;,

in order to mislead customers into believing that the said website is of the
Plaintiffs. Defendant No. 1 displays &#x27;info@dhanifinance.co&#x27; on its website
and also provides an address which is, a few feet away from Plaintiffs&#x27;
registered offices.
</p><p id="p_12">7.      It is averred that in late November 2019, Plaintiffs came across the
impugned domain name, as registered on 28.10.2019. The domain name
used by Defendant No. 1 is identical/deceptively similar to that of the
Plaintiffs and there is every likelihood of confusion amongst the unwary
public. The mala fide intention of Defendant No. 1 is evident from the fact
that not only is the domain name identical/deceptively similar, but the
website&#x27;s get-up and layout is identical to that of the Plaintiffs, wherein
Defendant No. 1 is using the trademark &#x27;DHANI&#x27; and the Potli device mark,
in order to encash on the enormous goodwill and reputation of Plaintiffs.
This apart, the website also contains a small write-up on &#x27;Indiabulls
Consumer Finance&#x27;, thereby ensuring that anybody visiting the website has
no doubt that Defendant No. 1 is Plaintiffs&#x27; company or is in some way
associated with it. Moreover, Defendant No. 1 had been contacting existing
and prospective customers of the Plaintiffs, seeking payments and/or issuing
employment and engagement letters, bearing trademarks of the Plaintiffs,
thereby misleading the recipients into believing that they are corresponding
with the Plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_13">8.      It is further averred that Defendant No. 2 is the Domain Name
Registrar, which has unscrupulously registered the impugned domain name
of Defendant No. 1. Defendant No. 2 has aided and abetted Defendant No. 1
in committing the acts of infringement and passing off by enabling
Defendant No. 1 to register a domain name that is infringing the trademarks

No. 2 earns profit by registering domain names such as those of Defendant
No. 1 and its acts amount to infringement of Plaintiffs&#x27; trademarks and
copyright.
</p><p id="p_15">9.      On 10.12.2019, this Court had granted an ex parte ad interim
injunction in favour of the Plaintiffs, restraining Defendant No. 1 from using
the Plaintiffs&#x27; trademarks and the domain name, as aforementioned, as well
as directing Defendant No. 2 to suspend the operation of the website.
Summons were issued to the Defendants, however, despite service there was
no appearance on their behalf. On 29.01.2020, the right of the Defendants to
file the written statements was closed. Subsequent thereto, there was no
appearance on behalf of the Defendants and vide order dated 06.04.2022,
Defendants were proceeded ex parte. Vide the same order, the matter was
directed to be listed for hearing, exempting the Plaintiffs from filing
evidence by way of affidavit, relying on the judgment in <a href="/doc/115210925/" id="a_1">Aktiebolaget Volvo

trademark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the
trademark, in the manner provided by the Act.

is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person
using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is
likely to cause confusion on the part of the public, or likely to have an
association with the registered mark, in any of the eventualities mentioned in
clauses (a), (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_3">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act. While clause (a)
envisages a situation where there is an identity of the registered trademark
and similarity of goods/services; clause (b) contemplates a situation where
the registered trademark is similar and the goods/services covered by the
mark are identical or similar and clause (c) deals with identity of the
registered trademark as well as the goods/services covered by the said
trademark. Where the registered marks and the goods have an identity,
Legislature provides that Courts shall presume confusion under <a href="/doc/1646788/" id="a_4">Section

</p><p id="p_23">14.     This Court finds merit in the contention of the Plaintiffs that
Defendant No. 1 by using the trademarks &#x27;INDIABULLS&#x27;, &#x27;DHANI&#x27; and


       (device), which are identical to the Plaintiffs&#x27; registered trademarks as
well as by creating and operating the impugned domain name
www.dhanifinance.in, which is deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs&#x27; domain
name, is infringing the statutory rights of the Plaintiffs. Defendant No. 1,
under the aforesaid trademarks is providing services relating to financial
transactions, personal loans etc., which are similar to those of the Plaintiffs
and the consumer base is also the same. Therefore, in my view, the triple
identity test of identical/deceptively similar trademarks, identical services
and     trade      channels         stands   satisfied   and     use    of      the   impugned

Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>, AIR 1965
SC 980 has held that once there is imitation, no further evidence is required
to establish that the Plaintiffs&#x27; rights are violated. Relevant passage from the
said judgment is as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        &quot;28. ........
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        While an action for passing off is a common law remedy being in
        substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of
        his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action
        for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy
        conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark
        for the vindication of &quot;the exclusive right to the use of the trade
        mark in relation to those goods&quot; (vide <a href="/doc/1614468/" id="a_6">Section 21</a> of the Act). The
        use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not
        essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the
        case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence
        in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a
        registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions
        might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable
        imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be
        such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But
        there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an action for
        infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of
        the defendant&#x27;s mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity
        between the plaintiff&#x27;s and the defendant&#x27;s mark is so close either
        visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the
        conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is
        required to establish that the plaintiff&#x27;s rights are violated.
        Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade
        mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact
        that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods
        or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show
        marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different
        from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be
        immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may
        escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to
        distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.&quot;

</p><p id="p_27">15.      Insofar as the common law remedy of passing off is concerned, useful
it would be to allude to the judgment in Erven Warnink B.V. v. J. Townend
&amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd., 1980 RPC 31, wherein Lord Diplock enunciated the
essential characteristics of a passing off action as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         &quot;(1) misrepresentation, (2) made by a person in the course of
         trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of
         goods or services supplied by him (4) which is calculated to injure
         the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is
         a reasonably foreseeable consequence and (5) which causes
         actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the
         action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so.&quot;

<p id="p_28">16.      <a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_7">In Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Khushalani</a>, 1998 SCC OnLine
Del 481, this Court has elaborately explained the concept of passing off as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         &quot;58. In order to determine whether the plaintiffs have established
         the ingredients for successfully bringing an action for passing off
         it will be appropriate to advert to the broad principles of the law
         of passing off. In &#x27;Kerly&#x27;s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names&#x27;-
         Supplement-pages 42 and 43, paragraph 16-02, the concept of
         passing off is stated thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         The law of passing-off can be summarised in one short general
         proposition-no man may pass off his goods as those of another.
         More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements
         which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to
         succeed. These are three in number.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         Firstly, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the
         goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing
         public by association with the identifying &#x27;getup&#x27; (whether it
         consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the
         individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his
         particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that
         the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of
         the plaintiff&#x27;s goods or services.</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">         Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the

        defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or
        likely to lead the public to belief that the goods or services offered
        by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_31">        Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quick time
        action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the
        erroneous belief engendered by the defendant&#x27;s misrepresentation
        that the source of the defendant&#x27;s goods or service is the same as
        the source of those offered by the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_33">        66. From the analysis of the above decisions it is apparent that a
        plaintiff in an action for passing off must establish the following
        elements:
</p><p id="p_34">        1. The plaintiff has acquired a reputation or goodwill in his goods,
        name or mark;
</p><p id="p_35">        2. A misrepresentation, whether intentional or unintentional,
        which proceeds from the defendant by the use of the name or mark
        of the plaintiff or by any other method or means and which leads
        or is likely to lead the purchaser into believing that the goods or
        services offered by the defendant are the goods and services of the
        plaintiff, or that the goods and services offered by the defendant
        are the result of its association with the plaintiff;
</p><p id="p_36">        3. The plaintiff has suffered or is likely to suffer damage due to the
        belief engendered by the defendant&#x27;s representation.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_37">17.     From the plaint and the documents placed on record, it is evident that
impugned marks are similar to Plaintiffs&#x27; trademarks/device mark and are
indubitably used with an intent to misrepresent, exploit and encash the
formidable goodwill as well as reputation of the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have
been continuously and extensively using the trademarks for their financial
services, which is evident from the combined revenue of over Rs.14,640
crores as on 31.03.2019 of Plaintiff No. 1 and over Rs.1650 crores as on
31.03.2019 in respect of Plaintiff No. 2. Promotional and advertisement

website as displayed is likely to lead the unwary consumers to assume a
business connection between Defendant No. 1 and the Plaintiffs. Documents
further evidence that Defendant No. 1 has been sending messages/e-mails to
potential customers, portraying itself as a part of Plaintiffs&#x27; companies and
was also sending links for payments for loan applications with bank account
details. In light of the said facts and the settled law, this Court finds that
Defendant No. 1 has committed the tort of passing off.
</p><p id="p_39">18.     Plaintiffs have claimed copyright in their logo comprising of the
combination of the Potli device mark, the words &#x27;INDIABULLS&#x27; and

&#x27;DHANI&#x27; i.e.                            . Plaintiff No. 2 is the registered copyright owner
of the said logo bearing registration no. A-130733/2019 dated 02.09.2019 in
&#x27;original artistic work&#x27; under <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_8">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 and
the copyright subsists in the said artistic work under <a href="/doc/196539054/" id="a_9">Section 13(1)</a> of the
Copyright Act. Plaintiffs have copyright ownership in get-up, look, layout
and arrangement on their websites and Defendant No. 1 is using the
copyrighted logo of the Plaintiffs with a similar layout etc., thereby
infringing on the Plaintiffs&#x27; copyright.
</p><p id="p_40">19.     Learned counsel for the Plaintiffs has also pressed for punitive
damages and cost. Insofar as the award of punitive damages is concerned, I
may only refer to a passage from the judgment by a Co-ordinate Bench of
this Court in <a href="/doc/59326898/" id="a_10">Proctor &amp; Gamble Company v. Joy Creators &amp; Others</a>, 2011
SCC OnLine Del 929, as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        &quot;27. <a href="/doc/103723268/" id="a_11">In Larsen and Toubro Limited v. Chagan Bhai Patel</a>: MIPR
        2009 (1) 194, this Court observed that it would be encouraging
        the violators of intellectual property, if the defendants
        notwithstanding having not contested the suit are not burdened
        with punitive damages.

</p><p id="p_43">        28. Also, the Court needs to take note of the fact that a lot of
        energy and resources are spent in litigating against those who
        infringe the trademark and copyright of others and try to encash
        upon the goodwill and reputation of other brands by passing of
        their goods and/or services as those of that well known brand. If
        punitive damages are not awarded in such cases, it would only
        encourage unscrupulous persons who actuated by dishonest
        intention, use the well-reputed trademark of another person, so as
        to encash on the goodwill and reputation which that mark enjoys
        in the market, with impunity, and then avoid payment of damages
        by remaining absent from the Court, thereby depriving the
        plaintiff an opportunity to establish actual profit earned by him
        from use of the infringing mark, which can be computed only on
        the basis of his account books. This would, therefore, amount to
        putting premium on dishonesty and give an unfair advantage to an
        unscrupulous infringer over those who have a bona fide defence to
        make and therefore come forward to contest the suit and place
        their case before the Court.&quot;
</p><p id="p_44">20.     This Court is in agreement with the submissions of learned counsel
for the Plaintiffs that in the instant case, punitive damages must be awarded
against Defendant No. 1, who has infringed the trademarks as well as the
copyright of the Plaintiffs and has attempted to pass off its services as that of
the Plaintiffs and has chosen to stay away from the proceedings of the Court,
despite service. It has been held in various judgments that a Defendant who
chooses to stay away from the Court proceedings, should not be permitted to
escape the liability when found guilty of committing a wrongful act. It
would be in public interest if parties indulging in acts of deception are
penalised by punitive damages, in order to discourage such acts. As a result,
the Court awards damages to the tune of Rs. 3,00,000/- in favour of the
Plaintiffs.
