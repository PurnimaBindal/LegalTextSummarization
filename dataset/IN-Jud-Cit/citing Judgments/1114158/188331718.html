No.1 - Curewell Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Private Limited and Plaintiff
No.2 - Horizon Bioceuticals Pvt. Ltd. seeking protection of the trademark
and packaging in relation to their product 'BEVITAL' which is a
multivitamin supplement. The Defendant - Ridley Life Science Private
Limited had adopted an identical mark with identical packaging. This Court
on 14th August, 2018 had granted an interim injunction. A Local

 Commissioner was also appointed to prepare an inventory of the infringing
products. Defendant No.1 had initially entered appearance and on 20th
November, 2018 had placed on record a new carton, which it intended to
adopt. The carton was acceptable to the Plaintiffs and after taking the new
carton and packaging on record, a decree of permanent injunction was
passed in terms of paragraph 28 (i) to (v) of the plaint vide order dated 20th
November 2018.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     The sales of the Defendant no.1 were not on record and an affidavit
was called from Defendant No.1 in respect of the following facts:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "2. An affidavit shall be filed of the Managing Director
           of the Defendant No.1 placing on record the following
           information: -

                General of India (DCGI) or any other State FDA.

                Lysine) on an annual basis."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">3.     Defendant No.1 has now placed on record an affidavit of its
Managing Director stating that the approval for the product was given by the
State FDA on 4th August, 2017 and Defendant No.1 commenced
manufacturing of the product from 31st January, 2018. The affidavit also
states that out of the total 2020 boxes that were manufactured, only 1385
boxes were finally sold. This position is disputed by the ld. counsel for the
Plaintiffs. Ld. Counsel for the Plaintiffs submit that Defendant No.1 being a
habitual violator of various trademarks as observed in the order dated 3rd
October, 2018 by a Ld. Single Judge of this Court in CS (COMM)

</blockquote><p id="p_3">4.     Considering the facts in the present case and the further undertaking
given by Defendant No.1 at the initial stage of the suit itself, insofar as
damages and costs, is concerned, it is directed that the Defendant No.1 shall
pay to the Plaintiffs a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- within three weeks from today.
The Plaintiffs shall be, in addition, entitled to refund of the court fee to the
extent of 50% under <a href="/doc/138097064/" id="a_1">Section 16A</a> of the Court Fee Act. If the Defendant
No.1 is found to be in violation of any of the Plaintiffs' trademarks in future,
Defendant No.1 would, without disputing the liability, be liable to pay a sum
of Rs.10,00,000/- to the Plaintiffs. Such an order is being passed in the
unique facts and circumstances of this case as the Defendant No.1 has not
only been found to be violating the trademarks of third parties but this is the
second occasion where the Plaintiffs have had a grievance against the
Defendant's adoption of an identical mark. The suit is, accordingly, decreed
in the above terms against Defendant No.1 - Ridley Life Science Private
Limited.
</p><p id="p_4">5.     In addition to the disputes between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants
no.1, this Court had also taken notice of the fact that in the present case, the
Drug Authorities had approved the Defendant's mark 'BEVITAL‟ though it
was identical to the Plaintiff's pre-existing mark 'BEVITAL‟, both for multi-
vitamin supplements. The competing product labels are set out below:

           Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, the DCGI is the
           licensing authority in respect of new drugs and the state
           FDAs are the licensing authorities in respect of drugs
           which are more than four years old. It is noticed that the
           Defendant in the present case has a state FDA
           registration, issued to them by the Delhi Government. At
           the time of registration, there needs to be a check to
           ensure that an identical name is not registered. Such a
           procedure is also encapsulated at the time of allowing
           registration of names of Companies, under <a href="/doc/1688413/" id="a_3">Section 20</a>

           Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceutical Ltd</a>. (2001) 5 SCC 73, the

                of the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_7">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 which inter
                alia indicates that an imitation or resemblance of
                another drug in a manner likely to deceive being
                regarded as a spurious drug it is but proper that
                before granting permission to manufacture a drug
                under a brand name the authority under that Act is
                satisfied that there will be no confusion or
                deception in the market. The authorities should
                consider requiring such an applicant to submit an
                official search report from the Trade Mark Office
                pertaining to the trade mark in question which will
                enable the Drug Authority to arrive at a correct
                conclusion."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           16.       As per the above dictum of the Supreme Court,
           authorities ought to demand from applicants who seek
           drug approvals to submit a search report issued by the
           trademark authorities prior to giving them registration.

            there is no mechanism in place to implement the decision
           of the Supreme Court, given as far as back in 2001. It is
           gainsay that all authorities have to implement the
           directions of the Supreme Court and all Courts have to
           ensure that such directions, are given effect to and take
           strict action against authorities not giving effect to them.
           Moreover, the DCGI has an obligation under the statute
           to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines
           and if products are sold with identical brand names, that
           basic purpose stands defeated. The authorities ought to
           bear in mind that if identical brand names are used,
           especially for different pharmaceutical compositions, the
           results could be life threatening to a patient who may
           consume a drug with an identical name but with a
           different composition.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">           18.        In the opinion of this Court, the DCGI and the
           state FDAs ought to implement an action plan in which
           drugs with identical or near identical brand names or
           marks are not given licenses, so as to ensure that no
           confusion is created amongst doctors, chemists and
           patients. Moreover, the manner in which identical
           packaging is also being used is a cause for concern.

           shall hold an inter-se consultation amongst themselves
           and also take suggestions from other stake holders, if
           needed, as to the manner in which the approval of
           identical brand names for medicinal preparations can be
           avoided and the process of granting approval is
           streamlined. The DCGI may also call the officials of the
           Controller General of Trade Marks for the said
           consultation. A responsible officer shall be deputed by
           Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to
           ensure that an action plan is prepared in consultation
           with the Central Government and the relevant state
           authorities. An affidavit shall be filed as to in what
           manner the directions given by the Supreme Court can be
           immediately implemented so as to ensure that identical
           brand names are not allotted to multiple parties and such
           confusion is avoided.

                                 AGENDA NO.15
           CONSIDERATION OF THE PROPOSAL TO DEVISE
           A MECHANISM UNDER THE DRUGS AND
           COSMETICS RULES, 1945 TO AVOID SAME
           TRADE NAME FOR DIFFERENT DRUGS
              The Hon‟ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of M/s
           Curewell Drugs &amp; Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs
           Ridley Sciences Pvt. Ltd., CS (COMM) 1071/2018, has
           issued order dated 14.08.2018 that the DCG(I) and the
           state FDAs ought to implement an action plan in which
           drugs with identical or near identical brand names or
           marks are not given licenses, so as to ensure that no
           confusion is created amongst doctors, chemists and
           patients. Moreover, the manner in which identical
           packaging is also being used is a cause for concern.
              The court has also highlighted the judgment of the
           Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_15">Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila
           Pharmaceutical Ltd</a>. (2001) 5 SCC 73, in which the
           Supreme Court had directed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                 "34.       Keeping in view the provisions of
                 <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_16">Section 17-B</a> of the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_17">Cosmetics Act</a>,
                 1940 which inter alia indicates that an
                 imitation or resemblance of another drug in a
                 manner likely to deceive being regarded as a
                 spurious drug it is but proper that before
                 granting permission to manufacture a drug
                 under a brand name the authority under that
                 Act is satisfied that there will be no confusion
                 or deception in the market. The authorities
                 should consider requiring such an applicant to
                 submit an official search report from the
                 Trade Mark Office pertaining to the trade
                 mark in question which will enable the Drug
                 Authority to arrive at a correct conclusion."
</blockquote><p id="p_11">              Accordingly the court has directed the Government to
           ensure that an action plan is prepared to ensure that
           identical brand names are not allotted to multiple parties
           and such confusion is avoided.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS (COMM) 1071/2018                                                     Page 10 of 15</span>
<p id="p_12">               Subsequently, in compliance with the order / direction
           of the Hon‟ble High Court of Delhi, a meeting was held
           under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary &amp;
           Director General (CGHS), Ministry of Health &amp; Family
           Welfare on 13.11.2018.
</p><p id="p_13">              During the meeting it was discussed that the brand
           name/trade name in case of pharmaceuticals is neither
           controlled by the Licensing Authority under the Drugs
           and Cosmetic Act 1940 &amp; Rules 1945, nor the
           Trademarks office at present which leave scope for
           having same trade names for different drugs
           manufactured and sold in the Country, which may create
           a situation which is very detrimental to patients safety
           and the trade names which are not registered and
           repeated for different drugs can create confusion.
           Therefore, the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules 1945 may be
           amended to include the provisions for regulating brand
           names / trade names by the Central and State Licensing
           Authorities.
</p><p id="p_14">              Accordingly, the matter was deliberated by DTAB in
           its 81st Meeting held on 29.11.2018. The Board has
           recommended for devising a mechanism under the Drugs
           and Cosmetic Rules 1945 to include provisions for
           regulating the brand names/ trade names of
           Pharmaceutical products. Accordingly draft rules were
           prepared and forwarded to the Ministry. The copy of the
           draft is placed as ANNEXURE-6.
</p><p id="p_15">           DCC may deliberate on the matter and give its
           recommendation."
</p>
<p id="p_16">9.     A perusal of the minutes of the DTAB meeting shows that an in-
principle decision has been taken to recommend draft Rules to be notified
under the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_18">Cosmetics Act</a> to deal with the regulation of identical
brand names. The DCC was to meet on 1st February, 2019 as per the
agenda. However, the outcome thereof is not known.
</p><p id="p_17">10.    Mr. Rishi Kant, ld. counsel appearing for the DCGI submits that the
draft Rules have, in fact, been circulated and forwarded to the Ministry and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS (COMM) 1071/2018                                                    Page 11 of 15</span>
 the matter is currently being discussed internally.
</p><p id="p_18">11.    The issue of pharmaceutical preparations and medicines being sold
under identical brand names has been a concern in a large number of
disputes. The said issue is not just one which concerns statutory rights or
trademark rights of a particular IP owner, but has a larger impact on the
health of the patients. Stringent quality control mechanisms ought to be put
in place and implemented in the manufacture and sale of medicines. If
medicines are allowed to be sold with identical brand names and that too in
identical packaging, it is not just violative of the rights of IP owners but
dangerous for consuming patients.
</p><p id="p_19">12.    The Supreme Court had taken serious note of this and had held almost
18 years ago, in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_19">Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.
(2001) 5 SCC 73 (hereinafter, „Cadila Health Care‟) that there ought to be
some coordination between the Trademark registry and the drug authorities.
In Cadila Health Care (supra), the Supreme Court had observed that
"Drugs are poisons, not sweets". The observations of the Supreme court
have been set out in the order dated 14th August, 2018 extracted above.
</p><p id="p_20">13.    Under the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_20">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 (`DC Act'), the DCGI and
the State FDAs are vested with powers to supervise and overlook the
manufacture and sale of drugs. <a href="/doc/115093058/" id="a_21">Section 17</a> and Section 17A of the DC Act
deal with misbranded and adulterated drugs. The Central and State
Governments are empowered to appoint inspectors who have vast powers as
stipulated under <a href="/doc/1839440/" id="a_22">Section 22</a>. They have powers to inspect any premises, take
samples, search any premises, search any vehicle, seek production of
records. In fact, the powers are extremely wide so as to ensure that sub-
standard medicines are not manufactured and sold. Such inspectors,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS (COMM) 1071/2018                                                Page 12 of 15</span>
 therefore, ought to keep regular supervision on all the manufacturing units
falling within their territories, to ensure maintenance of the quality of
medicines. The draft rules which are under consideration ought to take into
consideration the situation of the ground and ensure that medicines with
identical brand names and identical packaging are not allowed to be
manufactured or sold.
</p><p id="p_21">14.    Apart from the draft Rules, the following directions are issued for
consideration by the authorities in order to regulate and better supervise the
quality of medicines being manufactured and sold.
</p><p id="p_22">       i)     Creation of a secured platform, to be under the supervision of
              the DCGI, which is accessible to all State FDAs, both for
              access of data and for uploading of data;
</p><p id="p_23">       ii)    Creation of a `master electronic database' of all the approved
              brand names for manufacture and sale of drugs issued both by
              the DCGI and the State FDAs and making the same available to
              all state FDAs and Drug controllers through a secured platform.
              The list to be maintained and made available both brand wise
              and manufacturer wise, on the secured platform;
</p><p id="p_24">       iii)   List of registered trade marks under Class 5 for pharmaceutical
              and medicinal preparations be obtained from the Controller
              General of Patents, Trade marks and designs and be made
              available to the approving authorities at the Central level and
              State level. The said list ought to be updated bi-annually i.e., on
              1st January and 1st July every calendar year;
</p><p id="p_25">       iv)    Access to the data be given to Drug Inspectors/Drug
              Controllers across the country;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS (COMM) 1071/2018                                                   Page 13 of 15</span>
<p id="p_26">        v)     Drug Inspectors/Drug Controllers to conduct regular and
              periodic inspections as per the Act and the Rules to ensure that
              the drugs that are being manufactured in a particular unit are
              duly licensed for. The reports of the said inspections to be
              submitted through the secured platform;
</p><p id="p_27">       vi)    Periodic and regular reports of drug inspectors should be
              compulsorily submitted to the respective licensing authorities
              on the secured platform and a mechanism be set up for review
              of the said reports at the State level;
</p><p id="p_28">       vii)   Periodic meetings ought to be held at the central level, to
              review the status of manufacture and sale of drugs across the
              country, under the aegis of the DCGI;
</p><p id="p_29">       viii) Strict action in accordance with law ought to be taken against
              those manufacturers who manufacture drugs without licences,
              who indulge in adulteration or contamination of drugs etc. A
              periodic report as to the number of actions taken, ought to be
              uploaded on the secured platform of the DCGI.
</p><p id="p_30">15.    It is clarified that the above directions are not exhaustive in nature.
</p><p id="p_31">16.    The DCGI/DCC/DTAB and the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, to take a comprehensive decision in respect of the draft rules and
