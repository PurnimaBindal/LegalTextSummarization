SUBHASH CHANDRA V. THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN</a>.

DATE: 07-08-2008

            HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C. M. TOTLA

Mr. Rakesh Matoria, for Applicant (s).
Mr. S.K.Vyas, PP, for the State.



      Heard learned counsel for the petitioner (s), as well as
learned Public Prosecutor for the State and also perused the
impugned order.
      On behalf of the accused-petitioner, it is contended that
the petitioner lodged a criminal case against the SHO and then,
thereafter, applicant implicated in cases alleged to be registered
in the year, 2007 - in two other cases FIR         Nos.149/07 and
261/07, he is granted bail by this Court vide orders dated
07.07.2008 and 09.07.2008.
      Learned P.P. Opposed the bail application.
      Considering the rival contentions of the parties and taking
into consideration the entire facts and circumstances of the case,
I am inclined to grant bail to the petitioner (s) under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_2">Section 439</a>
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
      It is, therefore, ordered that the accused - petitioner
Subhash Chandra s/o. Shri Mati Ram be released on bail,
provided he       furnishes a   personal bond in the sum of
Rs.20,000/- (Rupees twenty thousand only) with two sound
sureties of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand only) each to the
satisfaction of the concerned trial Court, with the stipulation to
appear in that Court as and when called upon to do so, during
the pendency of the trial against him in this case.


                                              (C. M. TOTLA), J.
