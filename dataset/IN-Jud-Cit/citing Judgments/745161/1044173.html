     and Kashmir has filed this appeal before this

     Court seeking to impugn the judgment of Jammu

     and Kashmir High Court, dated 2nd of June 2009.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              1</span>
     The High Court dismissed both the writ petitions

     which     raised      identical          questions.           They       were

     heard together and disposed of by the impugned

     judgment.

<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">3.   The main thrust of the challenge before the High

     Court, as well as before this Court is on the

     following question: whether or not the action of

     the government in postponing the delimitation of

     territorial        constituencies                of       the         State

     pertaining to the Legislative Assembly until the

     relevant     figures         published           after        the     first

     census taken after 2026 is legally sustainable?

     the   sub-section   3       of   Section   47     of    the

     Constitution   of   Jammu        and   Kashmir,        1957,

     "47(3) Upon the completion of each census,
     the number, extent and boundaries of the
     territorial   constituencies    shall   be

     State and the division of the State into
     territorial constituencies under this sub-
     section}."
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">6.   The main grievance of the appellant seems to be

     that    in     view     of        the    postponing      of     the

     delimitation of the constituencies as a result

     of     the    aforesaid       amendments,         the    growing

     imbalance      in     the    matter      of    composition       of

     various      constituencies         would     continue   despite

     the census operation being carried out. It has

     been argued before this Court that normally the

     delimitation        exercise        is   consequent      upon     a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   4</span>
     census    operation.     As       a   result    of    the   census

     operation the composition of the population is

     reflected. That gives rise to an exercise in

     delimitation     for     a    proper        representation       of

     rights of the people in a democratic polity. The

     further    contention          is     that      without       these

     demographical changes being properly reflected

     in the composition of constituencies by way of a

     delimitation exercise, the essence of democracy

     will be defeated in the election. The appellant,

     therefore,     urge    that       without      an    exercise    in

     delimitation immediately upon the completion of

     census operation, the election in the State of

     Jammu    and   Kashmir       will     not   reflect     the    true

     voice of democracy and the popular view would,

     therefore, be gagged and would not find a proper

     representation.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">7.   In this case we are not concerned much with any

     factual controversy. In this case the Court has

     been called upon to decide the correctness or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   5</span>
     otherwise of contention of the appellant in the

     context    of      the        relevant      laws     and   the

     constitutional provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">8.   Admittedly, in the State of Jammu and Kashmir,

     the census operation was completed in 2001, but

     the delimitation was done in 1995.



</p><p id="p_23">9.   At present in the State of Jammu and Kashmir

     there are 87 constituencies. Out of that 46 are

     in Kashmir Valley, 37 in Jammu and 4 are in

     Ladakh    region.    Under        Section    47(1)    of   the

     Constitution of      J &amp; K, it is provided that the

     Legislative     Assembly          shall    consist    of   111

     members    chosen        by       direct     election      from

     territorial constituencies of the State. Under

     proviso to Section 47 of the Constitution of J &amp;

     K, it is provided that if the Governor is of the

     opinion     that     women         are      not    adequately

     represented in the assembly, he may nominate not

     more than two women members.                 However, it is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   6</span>
      provided in <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_6">Section 48</a> of the Constitution that

      until the area of the State which is under the

      occupation of Pakistan ceases to be so occupied

      and the people residing in that area elect their

      representatives,        those         24     seats         in      the

      Legislative     Assembly        shall      remain    vacant        for

      Pakistan occupied Kashmir and will not be taken

      into account for counting the total membership

      of the assembly. The said area would be excluded

      in delimiting the territorial constituencies of

      the state.

<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">10.   The   learned     Counsel,        Professor         Bhim        Singh,

      appearing for the appellant submits that of the

      37 constituencies in Jammu, some are reserved

      for   Scheduled       Castes         and    Scheduled           Tribes

      whereas   of    the   46    constituencies           in     Kashmir

      valley,   not    a    single         one    is   reserved          for

      Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. But if

      the   census    operation       is    properly      perused,        it

      becomes clear that some of the constituencies in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  7</span>
      the   Kashmir      valley       should     also      have   been

      reserved     for   Scheduled          Castes   and    Scheduled

      Tribes,    had     a   delimitation            exercise     been

      conducted on the basis of census operation. The

      impugned     amendment          is,     therefore,      unfair,

      undemocratic and unconstitutional as it seeks to

      defer the delimitation exercise only upon the

      declaration of census results after 2026.



</p><p id="p_26">11.   In the writ petition filed before the High Court

      no substantial challenge has been made to the

      amendment of the Constitution of the J &amp; K. In

      the writ petition in paragraph 16, very vaguely

      this challenge has been made and which is set

      out below:
</p>
<p id="p_27">      "16. If no Delimitation Commission is
      constituted till 2026, it would mean that
      there will be no rotation of the Assembly
      constituencies till the census in 2031. It
      would   mean    that   reserved   Assembly
      constituencies shall not be rotated from
      1996 to 2031 i.e. for 35 years reserved
      seats shall not be changed. This is an
      unparallel (sic) instance of the massacre
      of the rule of law, the principles of the
      natural justice and of course, denial of
      justice and equity guaranteed by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_7">Article

</p><p id="p_28">12.   In       the   prayers      made      in   that   Writ    Petition,

      prayers B and C have become infructuous. Prayer

      D is aimed at Section 47 of the Constitution of

      J    &amp;    K    but   we    do   not    find   adequate     pleading

      challenging the amendment to Section 47 of the

      Constitution of J &amp; K.

<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">13.   Professor        Bhim      Singh      submitted    that    he   was

      arguing this case on behalf of about 10, 143,

      700 people (as per 2001 Census) of Jammu and

      Kashmir. He stated that on 27th October 1947,

      Jammu and Kashmir became a part of India and on

      26th January 1957, the Constitution of Jammu and

      Kashmir was adopted. He also urged that in view

      of <a href="/doc/666119/" id="a_11">Article 370</a> of the Constitution of India,

      autonomy has been granted to the State of Jammu

      and       Kashmir.        The   learned     counsel      repeatedly


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       9</span>
      harped on the question that not holding of a

      delimitation        exercise      immediately            after     the

      completion of the census as a result of the

      aforesaid     amendment        is    unconstitutional.              In

      fact, the learned counsel argued that the said

      amendment     to    the    Constitution        of    J    &amp;    K   was

      itself violative of the Basic Structure of the

      Constitution of India as applicable to the State

      of    Jammu    and        Kashmir,        as     well      as      the

      Constitution of J &amp; K.

<p id="p_31">14.   Dealing    with     the     aforesaid      arguments          of   the

      appellant (petitioner before the High Court),

      the   Division      Bench    of     the   High      Court,       inter

      alia, held that delimitation for the purpose of

      dividing      the      State        into       single         member

      territorial constituency maybe a Basic Feature

      of democracy contemplated in the Constitution.

      However, High Court opined that the readjustment

      of the extent and boundaries of such territorial

      constituency upon completion of each census was

      neither a mandate of the Constitution, nor the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   10</span>
      essence of democracy as per the Basic Structure

      doctrine of the Indian Constitution.



</p><p id="p_32">15.   The High Court dealt with the decision of the

      Supreme Court of the United States of America in

      the case of Charles W. Baker vs. Joe C. Carr

      reported in 369 US 186. In this decision, the

      plaintiffs who were entitled to vote to elect

      members of Tennessee legislature filed a class

      action    for     a        declaration         that      Tennessee

      Apportionment Act of 1901 was unconstitutional

      as   it   violated         the    14th     Amendment        of   the

      Constitution      of       the    United       States.      It   was

      alleged that the impugned act sought to bring

      about a gross disproportion of representation to

      the members of the public in respect of their

      voting    right.          Thus,    the        Act     placed     the

      plaintiffs   in       a    position      of    constitutionally

      unjustifiable equality. Initially the District

      Court, where the case was filed, held that it

      lacked    jurisdiction            to     decide       the    issue.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   11</span>
      Thereupon, on appeal the Supreme Court reversed

      the    judgment     and      remanded          the    case        to     the

      District    Court      holding,         inter    alia,       that        the

      District    Court      has     the       jurisdiction             in     the

      matter and also held that the plaintiffs had the

      locus to challenge the Tennessee Apportionment

      act.

<p id="p_33">

      dissented     and       held        that        the      nature           of

      controversy       is    unfit           for    federal        judicial

      action, and that the existing apportionment was

      not so unreasonable so as to offend the equal

      protection clause. The majority opinion in that

      case was, however, based on the principle of

      approximate    equality            in    the     voice       of        every

      voter.

<p id="p_35">

</p><p id="p_36">17.   In the judgment impugned herein, the High Court

      held that our Constitution never contemplated

several other provisions of the Constitution.

Supporting the judgment, the learned Solicitor

General    of   India      drew   the   attention      of    this

Court     to    the       various    provisions        of    the

Constitution of India namely, Articles 81, 82

</p><p id="p_37">18.   While deciding the said issue, this Court took

      into consideration the decisions of the Supreme

      Court of the United States in Charles W. Baker

      [supra], and B. A. Reynolds etc. vs. M. O. Sims

</p><p id="p_38">      - 377 US 533.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">19.   This     Court   relied   on   the   opinion    of   Chief

      Justice Earl Warren in B.A. Reynolds (supra). At

      page 536 of the report the learned Chief Justice

      held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_41">      "......We realize that it is a practical
      impossibility       to   arrange    legislative
      districts      so   that  each   one   has   an
      identical       number   of    residents,    or
      citizens,        or    voters.     Mathematical
      exactness      or   precision   is   hardly   a
      workable constitutional requirement."


</p><p id="p_42">20.   The    learned    Chief    Justice    also     relied   on

      historical factors in support of his opinion and

      held:-
</p>
<p id="p_43">      "History indicates, however, that many
      States have deviated, to a greater or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                14</span>
      lesser degree, from the equal-population
      principle in the apportionment of seats in
      at least one house of their legislatures.
      So long as the divergences from a strict
      population    standard   are    based   on
      legitimate considerations incident to the
      effectuation of a rational state policy,
      some deviations from the equal-population
      principle are constitutionally permissible
      with respect to the apportionment of seats
      in either or both of the two houses of a
      bicameral state legislature." (page 537 of
      the report)


</p><p id="p_44">21.   After   relying   on   the    aforesaid   judgments   and

      noticing the position in Australian Constitution

      the majority opinion of this Court was rendered

      by Justice Venkatachaliah (as His Lordship then

      was).    By a remarkably erudite formulation of

      principles, His Lordship held:-

      "It is true that the right to vote is
      central to the right of participation in
      the democratic process. However, there is
      less consensus amongst theorists on the
      propriety of judicial activism in the
      voting area. In India, the Delimitation
      Laws made under <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_21">Article 327</a> of the
      Constitution of India, are immune from the
      judicial test of their validity and the
      process   of   allotment   of   seats  and
      constituencies is not liable to be called
      in question in any court by virtue of
      <a href="/doc/602602/" id="a_22">Article 329 (a)</a> of the Constitution."
      (Para 119, page 383 of the report)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                               15</span>
</p><p id="p_45">22.   It was repeatedly held in Poudyal (supra) that

      "a perfectly arithmetical equality of value of

      votes      is     not      a    constitutionally              mandated

      imperative of democracy and, secondly, that even

      if the impugned provisions make a departure from

      tolerance         limits       and    the     constitutionally

      permissible         latitudes,         the        discriminations

      arising     are    justifiable        on    the    basis       of   the

      historical        considerations            peculiar          to    and

      characteristic          of     the   evolution         of     Sikkim's

      political institutions."
</p>
<p id="p_46">

</p><p id="p_47">23.   In this case the same is true of the evolution

      of   the    political          institutions       of        Jammu   and

      Kashmir. This position has been again reiterated

      in para 126 in Poudyal's case in the following

      words:
</p>
<p id="p_48">      "An examination of the constitutional
      scheme would indicate that the concept of
      `one person one vote' is in its very
      nature considerably tolerant of imbalances
      and   departures   from  a   very   strict
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                      16</span>
      application and enforcement. The provision
      in      the       Constitution       indicating
      proportionality      of    representation    is
      necessarily a broad, general and logical
      principle but not intended to be expressed
      with arithmetical precision...The principle
      of    mathematical       proportionality     of
      representation is not a declared basic
      requirement in each and every part of the
      territory of India. Accommodations and
      adjustments,      having    regard     to   the
      political maturity, awareness and degree
      of political development in different
      parts    of    India,     might    supply   the
      justification      for     even     non-elected
      Assemblies wholly or in part, in certain
      parts   of    the   country.    The   differing
      degrees    of   political     development   and
      maturity of various parts of the country,
      may   not    justify    standards    based   on
      mathematical accuracy." (Page 385 of the
      report)


</p><p id="p_49">24.   Even Justice S.C. Agrawal, who partly dissented

      with   the   majority,   agreed   with   the   majority

      opinion on this aspect of the matter by holding

      as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_50">      "The principle of one man one vote
      envisages that there should be parity in
      the value of votes of electors. Such a
      parity though ideal for a representative
      democracy is difficult to achieve. There
      is   some   departure  in   every  system
      following this democratic path. In the
      matter of delimitation of constituencies,
      it often happens that the population of
      one constituency differs from that of the
      other   constituency  and  as   a  result
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                               17</span>
      although both the constituencies elect one
      member, the value of the vote of the
      elector in the constituency having lesser
      population is more than the value of the
      vote of the elector of the constituency
      having a larger population...". (para 182,
      page 402 of the report)


</p><p id="p_51">25.   On a perusal of the aforesaid principles as laid

      down by this Court in the Constitution Bench

      judgment, we are of the opinion that a right to

      caste vote is a valuable right but to demand any

      uniform value of one's voting right through the

      process        of   delimitation,       disregarding            the

      statutory and constitutional dispensation based

      on     historical     reasons   is     not     a    justiciable

      right.
</p>
<p id="p_52">

</p><p id="p_53">26.   In the context of this question we must keep in

      mind     the    constitutional       scheme        in    Part   XV

      relating       to   election.        <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_23">Article       327</a>    of    the

      Constitution empowers the Parliament to make a

      law relating to delimitation of constituencies.

      The mandate of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_24">Article 329A</a> is that any law

      relating to the delimitation of constituencies

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 18</span>
      or the allotment of seats to such constituencies

      shall not be called in question in any Court.

      Identical provisions have been made in Section

      142 of the Constitution of J &amp; K. <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_25">Section 142(a)</a>

      is set out below:-
</p>
<p id="p_54">      "142. Bar to interference by courts in
      electoral   matters.   -   Notwithstanding
      anything in this constitution-

</p><p id="p_55">      (a) the validity of any law relating to
      the     delimitation    of     territorial
      constituencies for the purpose of electing
      members of the Legislative Assembly or the
      allotment of seats to such constituencies,
      made or purporting to be made under
      <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_26">section 141</a>, shall not be called in
      question in any court;"
</p>
<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">27.   It is, therefore, clear that there is an express

      constitutional bar to any challenge being made

      to   the   delimitation    law      which   is   made   under

      Constitutional      provisions.         Therefore,       the

      substantial challenge of the appellant in this

      proceeding    is   not    to   be    entertained    by   any

      Court, including this Court. The other aspect of

      the question is that the amendment to Section

      47(3) of the Constitution of J &amp; K violates

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                19</span>
      Basic    Structure         of    the    Constitution.             This

      challenge       is     also      not     based        on     a    sound

      principle.

<p id="p_58">

</p><p id="p_59">28.   The    judgment       of   this      Court       in   <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_27">His    Holiness

      Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of

      Kerala   and        another</a>,     (1973)      4    SCC      225,   which

      introduced the concept of Basic Structure in our

      constitutional jurisprudence is the spontaneous

      response of an activist Court after working with

      our Constitution for about 25 years.                       This Court

      felt that in the absence of such a stance by the

      constitutional Court there are clear tendencies

      that     the        tumultuous         tides      of       democratic

      majoritarianism of our country may engulf the

      constitutional values of our nascent democracy.

      The judgment in Kesavananda Bharti (supra) is

      possibly       an    "auxiliary        precaution          against    a

      possible tidal wave in the vast ocean of Indian

      democracy".

      Basic Structure is. It is hazardous to define

      what is the Basic Structure of the Constitution

      as what is basic does not remain static for all

      time to come. However, the basic features have

      been culled out from various pronouncements of

      this   Court.    In   the     14th   Edition    of     Shorter

      Constitution    of    India     by    D.D.     Basu,    these

      is not a constitutionally mandated imperative of

      dispensation.          Therefore, the argument on the
