JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Alleging negligence against the defendant, the plaintiffs have 

propounded their cause of action on the following bundle of facts:­ 

</p><p id="p_2">       (i)     The   plaintiffs   are   individuals   and   the   defendant   bank 

       (Bank of Madura Ltd) is a body corporate incorporated under 

       the   Banking   Companies   (Acquisition   and   <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_1">Transfer   of 

       Undertakings) Act</a> 1970.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       (ii)    The plaintiffs had deposited a sum of Rs.8,00,000/­ in the 

       fixed deposit account of the defendant bank for which a receipt 

       bearing no. 445466 was issued to the plaintiffs by the defendant. 

       The said FDR was in the joint names of the plaintiffs and the 

       maturity date of the said FDR was 3rd August 1998. On 11th 

       December, 1998 the plaintiffs called on the defendant bank to 

       check up the accrued interest figure for advance tax, when to 

       their shock they were informed that their above said FDR had 

       already been en­cashed on 14th September, 1998 purportedly on 

       the authority of a letter dated 13th September, 1998 alleged to 

       have been signed by the plaintiffs.   Immediately on the same 

       day, the plaintiffs wrote a letter to the defendant bank informing 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">C.S. No. 564/08,  Smt. Geeta Kathuria Vs. Bank of ICICI Ltd.         Page 2 of 32</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                      3</span>

       them   about   the   fraud   and   forgery   committed.   They   denied 

       having   en­cashed   the   above   said   FDR   or   having   authorized 

       anyone to get the same en­cashed.   The plaintiffs accordingly 

       called upon the bank to immediately make the payment of the 

       maturity value of the said FDR.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       (iii)   The defendant bank vide its letter dated 13th December, 

       1998   informed   the   plaintiff   that   the   payment   of   the   maturity 

       value of the FDR had already been made by means of a pay 

       Order no. 644385 dated 14th September, 1998 for Rs.8,17,753/­ 

       in terms of the letter dated 13th September, 1998 purportedly 

       signed   by  the  plaintiffs.   The said letter of  authorization is a 

       forged document, as it was never issued by any of the plaintiffs. 

       Signature   of   the   plaintiff   on   the   FDR   is   also   forged.     The 

       defendant   bank   has   been   negligent   in   not   verifying   the 

       signatures of the plaintiffs both on the FDR as well as the above 

       said   letter   with   the   specimen   signature.   The   amount   of   Rs.

       8,17,753/­   is   a   large   sum   and   as   such   the   bank   should   have 

       shown due care and diligence before issuing the said Pay Order.

</p><p id="p_5">       (iv). On   the   plaintiffs'   representations   defendant   made 

       enquiries from the RBI clearing list from where it discovered 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">C.S. No. 564/08,  Smt. Geeta Kathuria Vs. Bank of ICICI Ltd.             Page 3 of 32</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                         4</span>

       that the said pay order was deposited in Punjab &amp; Sind Bank, 

       Delhi Cantonment Extn. Counter in the saving bank account by 

       one Ms. Geeta Kathuria.  An FIR was lodged by the defendant 

       bank with the Kalkaji Police Station, Nehru Place, Delhi on 14th 

       December, 1998 bearing no. 1105/98.  Thereafter a charge sheet 

       was   filed   on   28.1.1999   under   <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_2">Section   419</a>/<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">420</a>/<a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_4">468</a>/<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_5">471</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">34</a>   of 

       I.P.C.   The investigation agency arrested three people, one Ms. 

       Neelam who impersonated as Ms. Geeta Kathuria, and the other 

       two are  Shri Sanjay Kumar and Sandeep. The police recovered 

       Rs.50,000/­ from the above said accused persons.   It was also 

       found   that   the   accused   persons   had   in   connivance   with   each 

       other opened a saving bank account in the Punjab &amp; Sind bank, 

       Delhi   Cantonment   Extn.   Counter.   The   said   charge   sheet   was 

       based on the finding of the investigation that the signatures on 

       the   FDRs   as   well   as   the   letters   were   forged.     It   was   further 

       discovered   that   out   of   the   total   amount   of   FDRs   which   was 

       deposited by a pay order in the Saving Bank Account in Punjab 

       &amp;   Sind   Bank,   a   sum   of   Rs.5,00,000/­   had   already   been 

       withdrawn.   Thereafter the said account was frozen containing 

       Rs.3,00,000/­ by the bank.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">C.S. No. 564/08,  Smt. Geeta Kathuria Vs. Bank of ICICI Ltd.                Page 4 of 32</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                   5</span>

</p><p id="p_7">       (v).    The plaintiffs have made umpteen written representations 

       to various Authorities but to no avail.   The payment on forged 

       signature of the drawer is a payment without authority and the 

       banker has no mandate from its customer to pay the money; the 

       relationship between the bank and its customers requires that the 

       banker   should   be   able   to   identify   the   signatures   and   detect 

       imitation   while   making   payments   in   the   ordinary   course   of 

       business.  The defendant bank was accordingly bound to refund 

       the   money   to   the   plaintiffs.     The   defendant   bank   has   been 

       negligent and has instead of acknowledging its liability to pay to 

       the plaintiffs has instead put the blame on to the plaintiffs.

</p><p id="p_8">       (vi). The plaintiffs were left with no other remedy but to make 

       a   complaint   to   the   Banking   ombudsman   on   13th   May,   1999. 

       The Banking Ombudsman has closed the case on the ground that 

       the   said   complaint   was   outside   the   ambit   of   Banking 

       Ombudsman Scheme 1995.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       (vii). The bank was required under the law to act legally, fairly 

       and impartially towards people depositing their monies with the 

       defendant bank and the bank is under legal obligation to pay 

       back the amount due to the plaintiffs along with the interest.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                                      6</span>

</p><p id="p_10">       (viii) The defendant's action is clear violation of the principle of 

       natural justice. Though the forgery and fraud of the document 

       was detected in the month of December, 1998 but the bank and 

       its officers refused to make the payment of the matured FDR, 

       despite numerous representations and personal meeting with the 

       bank   officials.     This   behavior   of   the   bank   shows   not   only   a 

       lackadaisical   approach   but   also   carelessness   and   negligent 

       behavior by the defendant bank.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       (ix). The   said   inaction   on   the   part   of   the   defendant   bank   is 

       perverse on the face of  it for the reason that a document which 

       has   a   customers   name   as   drawer   if   forged   or   placed   thereon 

       without authority is a nullity.  The manner in which the bank has 

       handled the encashment of FDR forging is, not a remote, but a 

       very natural consequence of gross negligence of this description. 

       The plaintiffs have been deprived of their own money which had 

       been entrusted to the defendant bank and as such the defendant 

       bank has been guilty of criminal breach of trust.   Parting with 

       the plaintiffs' money to an outsider without ensuring the checkes 

       and balances of verification by the defendant bank in its normal 

       course   of   business   would   make   the   defendant   bank   liable   of 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">C.S. No. 564/08,  Smt. Geeta Kathuria Vs. Bank of ICICI Ltd.             Page 6 of 32</span>

       being prosecuted against.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       (x).    The   defendant   has   failed,   neglected   and   defaulted   in 

       making   payment   of   the   principal   amount   of   the   FDR   of   Rs.

       8,00,000/­. The plaintiff's are entitled to claim and the defendant 

       is   liable   to   pay   the   above   said   amount.     Plaintiffs   are   also 

       entitled to interest on Rs.8,00,000/­ form 3rd August 1998, till 

       the filing of this suit at the rate of 18%. The amount for a period 

       of two years and seven months works out to Rs.3,71,995.20/­ as 

       interest   due.     The   said   amount   of   Rs.3,71,995.20/­   has   also 

       become and payable by the defendant for the period of August 

       1998   to   March,   2001.     Accordingly   the   total   amount   of   Rs.

       11,71,995.20/­ has become due and payable by the defendant to 

       the plaintiff. Furthermore, the plaintiffs are entitled to damages 

       for the harassment caused to them and the false aspersions cast 

       upon them by the defendant bank and they thus reserve their 

       right to file appropriate application/suit for damages.

</p><p id="p_13">2.     The suit was earlier filed against Bank of Madhura as defendant 

no. 1 and Punjab &amp; Sind Bank as defendant no. 2.  Subsequently, Bank 

of Madhura has been substituted by ICICI Bank Ltd on account of the 

merger of former into the latter.

preliminary objection that the conduct of the plaintiff himself has been 

fraudulent and dishonest.   On the other hand the defendant­bank has 

acted diligently and with due care that is expected of a prudent man, 

therefore, it is not liable for any damages.
</p>
<p id="p_16">4.     On merits, the factual position as pleaded by defendant no. 1 is 

as under:­ 

</p><p id="p_17">       (i).    The   plaintiffs   had   a   joint   saving   account   bearing   no. 

       57690 held on either or survivor basis.  On 05.05.1998 a cheque 

       no. 087151 dated 05.05.1998 in the sum of Rs.8 lacs drawn on 

       the   Indusind   Bank,   New   Delhi   was   deposited   in   the   said 

       account, which as per instructions of plaintiff was put short in 

       term deposit for two months 29 days carrying interest @10% 

       per annum maturing on 03.08.1998.     The FDR continued to 

       remain in the possession of the defendant no.1 even after the 

       date   of   maturity   without   any   further   institutions   from   the 

       plaintiff.       On   13.09.1998   the   defendant   no.   1   received 

       instructions   from   the   plaintiff   no.   2   in   the   form   of   a   letter 

       written on the letter head of plaintiff no.1 for braking the FDR 

       and handover the pay order to one Mr. Satish Kumar, bearer of

       the said letter.     The signatures of said Sh. Satish Kumar was 

       attested   by   the   plaintiff   no.1.   The   said   letter   along   with   the 

       original FDR was given to the defendant no.1 by said Sh. Satish 

       Kumar.

<p id="p_18">       (ii).  On December 1998, the aforesaid saving account lying in 

       the joint name of the plaintiffs were closed by the plaintiffs.

</p><p id="p_19">       (iii).  On 11.12.1998 the plaintiff no.1 came to the defendant  

               no.  1 and asked for payment under the aforesaid FDR. 

       The defendant no. 1 was surprised at the request and told the 

       plaintiff  no.  1  that the monies were already paid in terms or 

       instructions   under his  letter  dated 13.09.1998. The said letter 

       was also shown to the plaintiff no.1.   Upon showing the said 

       letter, the plaintiff no. 1 got agitated and said that he had never 

       issued the said letter and that it was forged.  On hearing this, the 

       concerned officer of the defendant no.1 became alert and started 

       making inquires about the pay order of Rs.8,17,753/­ to find out 

       as to where the same was deposited.  The defendant no. 1 came 

       to know through the Reserve Bank of India, Inward Clearing 

       List, dated 15.09.1998, that the said pay order was deposited in 

       Punjab   &amp;   Bank   Delhi,   Cantonment   Extn.   Counter   Branch.

       Manager of the concerned branch of Punjab &amp; Sind Bank and 

       was   informed   that   a   saving   bank   account   had   been   recently 

       opened in the month of September, 1998 in the name of Geeta 

       Kathuria.     The defendant no. 1 was further informed that the 

       said pay order was deposited in the said account.  The defendant 

       no. 1 was also told that Rs.5 lacs had already been withdrawn 

       and there was a balance of only Rs. 3 lacs and odd amount.  On 

       the request of the defendant no.1 the Manager of the Punjab &amp; 

       Sind Bank froze the said saving account.

       of   the   answering   defendant   and   inquired   as   to   the   further 

       developments in the matter.  Thereafter the plaintiff no.1 handed 

       over a letter to the defendant no. 1 dated 11.12.1998 bearing 

       both   the   plaintiffs'   signatures   where   it   was   stated   that   the 

       signatures were forged in the letter dated 13.09.1998 and asked 

       the defendant no. 1 to make payment of the fixed deposit value. 

       Thereafter,   the  then  Manager  of   the  defendant   no.  1,  Mr.  K. 

       Chidambaran   lodged   a   written   compliant   before   the   SHO, 

       Kalkaji Police Station, New Delhi on the bases of which an FIR

       cannot  be held  responsible for losses, if any, suffered by the 

       plaintiffs as alleged. On the other hand, it cannot be said that the 

       plaintiffs acted with due diligence and care and in fact are guilty 

       of negligence.  Assuming but not admitting, that the said letter 

       dated 13.09.1998 was forged as alleged by them, it cannot be 

       forgotten   that   the  said  letter  was  accompanied  with  the FDR 

       which was duly discharged by the plaintiff no.1 at the back.  If 

       the   said   letter   was   forged   as   alleged,   then   the   FDR 

       accompanying it must certainly have been stolen, and therefore 

       it is difficult to understand as to why the plaintiffs did not lodge 

       a complaint before the police and the bank about if being stolen 

       or lost.   The plaintiffs waited for the three whole months before 

       they came to the bank to ask for payment and that too without 

       the FDR.   It is pertinent to note here that even after knowing 

       that   fact   that   the   money   has   been   taken   out   by   the   bank

       that the letter was forged and asking it to pay the value of the

plaintiff has established beyond doubt the negligence on behalf of the 

defendants   and   the  plaintiffs  have been successful  in proving their 

case.  The payment made by the defendant no. 1 on a forged letter is 

of no consequence as the forgery does not give any mandate to make 

payment and thus the payment by the defendant no. 1 is without any 

authority. Thus the entire transaction is vitiated and the plaintiffs are 

entitled to their suit being decreed.

absolve the bank of its liability.

<p id="p_38">15.    Ld.   Counsel   for   the   defendant   no.   1   has   argued   that   the 

plaintiffs' cannot escape their liability which has been occasioned on 

account of their own negligence. On the other hand the defendant no. 

1   has   acted   with   due   diligence   which   is   of   a   prudent   man   in   the 

ordinary course of banking business and no liability can be fastened

no value.

has admitted in his cross examination that the FDR had matured on 

03.08.1998 and that he visited the bank on or about 11th  or 12th  of 

December 1998.   PW1 has also admitted that he did not carry the 

original FDR with him on that day. PW1 took an oscillating stand as 

to   whether  the  original   FDR  had  been  lying in  his  drawer  or was 

stolen. PW1 has admitted that the Manger concerned had shown him 

the original FDR.   Thus his falsehood is very much apparent on the 

record. In fact for their lapses and negligence the plaintiffs are trying 

to   saddle   the   defendant   with   liability.   It   was   the   liability   of   the 

plaintiffs to keep the FDR in safety. The bank has acted in a regular 

and careful manner. The original FDR had accompanied the letter for 

payment; the payment was made by an account payee cheque in the 

name of one of the holders. On the detection of fraud, the defendant 

no. 1 acted with due promptitude to stop the payment which resulted 

that a part of amount was freezed. The defendant no. 1 also acted with 

diligence to lodge the FIR.

advance tax. He did not carry the original FDR with him on that day 

as it was supposed to be lying in his drawer with other papers. He 

further volunteered to state that the FDR in question was stolen. In his 

further cross examination he stated that at that time he was of the view 

that the FDR was lying in his drawer with other papers and he could 

not say whether the same was stolen or not. The witness admitted that 

the Manger concerned had shown him the original FDR. The witness

signs   in   the   same   style   as   per   his   letter   dated   11.12.1998.   In   Ex.

referred to as Specimen Signatures. This implies that for all mandates

are to be referred to for tallying with the signatures appended on the 

instrument of instructions/mandate.

no attempt to confront the witness that his signatures on Ex. PW1/2

on this aspect has remained un­impugned. The bank on its part has no

<p id="p_75">46.     The   discussion   of   evidence   which   has   been   done   while 

examining the issue no.   1 is not been discussed herewith to avoid 

prolixity.   Examining   the   entire   evidence   that   has   been   led   in   this

<p id="p_76">47.     The relationship  between a banker and customer  has various 

facets--that   of   a   debtor and creditor, or  of  sacred  trust  or akin to 

landlord or tenant (in case of safe deposit vault) etc. 

</p><p id="p_77">48.     A banker is bound to know the signatures of its customer.  The

an instrument is the legal authority or mandate to bank to make the 

payment. An instrument with the drawer signatures forged is a mere 

nullity. Unless the bank can establish adoption or estoppels, it cannot 

debit it's customer's account with a forged instrument.

Canara Sales Corporation</a> (1987) 2 SCC 666 squarely applies to the 

facts and circumstances of this case. Similar law has been laid down

</p><p id="p_79">50.    The defendant no. 1 has only a bald statement that it has acted 

with due care and circumspection while giving the payment of FDR 

on   the   basis   of   letter   dated   13.09.98   but   there   is   no   evidence   to 

manifest this fact.  There is no evidence of the official concerned that 

he duly compared the signatures on the letter and the FDR with the 

specimen signatures available with the banker. It was incumbent on 

the part of the defendant no. 1 to prove the same as a matter of fact. 

Of course, on the plaintiff no.  1 making hue and cry when he visited 

the  bank   on  11th  or  12th  of  December 1998 and a factum  of  fraud

promptitude.   It   made   inquiries   from   RBI   and   approached   the 

defendant no. 2 so that the money is saved. However, by that time a 

sum of Rs. 5,00,000/­ had already been swindled. The defendant no. 2 

also  promptly lodged the FIR into the matter. However, the future 

good   conduct   cannot   wash   out   the   consequences   of   past   conduct 

which lacked diligence.

<p id="p_80">51.    Thus   on   the   material   on   record,   the   finding   on   this   issue   is

have been able to establish their case. Now the aspect as to whether 

there had been a contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs 

and, if so, what is the effect of the same is to be examined.  

</p><p id="p_83">53.    In the case relied upon by the plaintiffs  viz. <a href="/doc/1838427/" id="a_13">Canara Bank vs. 

Canara   Sales   Corporation</a>   (1987)   2   SCC   666  estoppel   and 

acquiescence have been held as defences available to a banker in a 

case of negligence in making payment in making payment on forged 

signatures of the customers.

it has been held that acquiescence is nothing but on facet of delay. 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">C.S. No. 564/08,  Smt. Geeta Kathuria Vs. Bank of ICICI Ltd.               Page 26 of 32</span>

</p><p id="p_85">55.    If the plaintiff stands by knowingly and let the wrong happen, 

the plaintiff would be stopped by acquiescence. As per the settled po­

sition of law acquiescence  means something more than mere silence 

on the part of the plaintiffs.  Acquiescence  means encouragement or 

some overt act on the part of the plaintiff to perpetuate the wrong. Ac­

quiescence may be express or implied consent. In law, care must be 

taken to distinguish between mere knowledge of a situation and posi­

tive consent to it. For example, in the defence of volenti non fit injuria  

an injured party will not be regarded as having consented to a risk 

simply because he knew that the risk existed. Thus acquiescence is a 

positive act and must show consent. 
</p>
<p id="p_86">56.  Para 30 of the judgment <a href="/doc/1838427/" id="a_15">Canara Bank vs. Canara Sales Corpo</a>­

ration (1987) 2 SCC 666  it has been held that in order to sustain a 

plea of acquiescence, it is necessary to prove that the party against 

whom the plea is raised had remained silent about the matter even af­

ter knowing the truth of the matter. 
</p>
<p id="p_87">57.    On examining the matter on record, it is clear that the plaintiffs 

did not remain silent on discovery of the payment of their FDR with­

out their mandate. The plaintiff no. 2 immediately made hue and cry 

and even accompanied the bank manager when he went to make the

complaint   and   thereafter   made   repeated   reminders   to   agitate   his 

grievance is self­speaking of the matter. Thus the plea of acquiescence 

cannot stand against the plaintiffs. 
</p>
<p id="p_88">58.    Estoppel is a rule of evidence and has its genesis in equity. It is 

a conclusive statement which cannot be denied by the person whom it 

affects. If a person makes a statement and the other person changes his 

position relying upon the truth of that statement changes his position 

and the truth of that statement cannot be denied by the former to the 

detriment of the latter. As per para 43 of the judgment <a href="/doc/1838427/" id="a_16">Canara Bank 

vs. Canara Sales Corporation</a> (1987) 2 SCC 666 negligence, which 

can sustain the plea of estoppel must be in the transaction itself and it 

should be so connected with the result to which it led that it is impos­

sible to treat the two separately. 
</p>
<p id="p_89">59.    In this case, by necessary implication it is manifest on record 

that the loss or theft of FDR has taken place while it was in possession 

of the plaintiffs. Thus the negligence of the plaintiffs in securely keep­

ing the FDR is a foregone conclusion. However the payment has to be 

made by the banker on the strength of the signatures on the instrument 

of instructions of payment matching with the specimen signatures of 

the customer maintained by the banker. The obligation to make pay­

ment only on the verification of signatures does not in any way get 

whittled down by the factum that the original FDR has accompanied 

the letter for payment of FDR. The bank's obligation to compare the 

signatures does not get waived merely for the reason that the original 

FDR has been produced before it for payment. The  condition prece­

dent for making payment on an instrument is tallying of the signatures 

of the customer with the specimen signatures kept by the bank.  Thus 

no case of estoppel against the plaintiffs is also made out, albeit the 

FDR has been stolen due to their own negligence.  

</p><p id="p_90">60.    Finding on this issue is returned in favour of the plaintiffs. 

Issue no. 4. Whether plaintiff is entitled to interest, if yes, at what 
rate and from when?  
</p><p id="p_91">61.    In view of the findings on the issue nos. 1, 2 and 3 the plaintiff 

is entitled to interest for the reason that it has   been deprived of its 

legitimate money on account of the acts and omissions on the part of 

the defendant no. 1.

<p id="p_92">62.    The plaintiff has claimed interest @ 18% per annum.

more than 13 years the plaintiff has been denied the use of the sum of

plaintiffs are only directed to be paid Rs. 8,17,753/­ it would not mean 

complete   justice.   The   purchasing   power   of   money   has   diminished 

during these more than thirteen years, on account of the toll taken by 

the inflation. The money has an opportunity cost. Had the plaintiffs 

invested their money elsewhere they would have earned returns on the 

same by way of profits, dividends, interest or rent depending upon the 

type   of   saving.   Though   the   court   cannot   speculate   about   what   the 

money would have earned in alternative investment avenues, award of 

a  reasonable   rate  of   interest   is  a  logical  corollary  in  the  facts  and 

circumstances of the case. 
</p>
<p id="p_95">65.    When the plaintiff's subscribed to the FDR with the plaintiff 

bank, the contractual rate of interest had been 10% per annum. After 

that, in the last more than 13 years, the interest rates have seen both 

the   southward   and   northward   movements.   Presently   the   rate   of 

interest in banking circle hovers about 9% approximately for deposits 

above one year or so with some extra 0.5% to senior citizens. 

</p><p id="p_96">66.    Taking a collective assessment of these factors, in my view the 

interest of justice would be served if the plaintiffs are awarded interest 

@ 10% per annum compounded annually on the sum of Rs. 8,17,753/­ 

i.e. the maturity value of the FDR on 14.09.1998. The interest shall be

amount has to be considered as Rs. 8,17,753/­ i.e. the sum due as on
