with its registered office at New Delhi ,by this application under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section
9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 ('Act'), seeks interim
reliefs against the Respondent Takii and Co. Ltd. ('Takii') having its
registered office in Japan. The interim reliefs are sought in the context of
disputes that have arisen between them while running a joint venture
company for the production and marketing of agricultural and
horticultural seeds.

<p id="p_3">Factual Background
</p><p id="p_4">2. PSPL states that it operates commercially in various fields of the seed
industry, inter alia, in the production, processing, marketing and selling
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                  Page 1 of 30</span>
 of high varieties of seeds for various plantation crops, flower,
horticulture, etc. PSPL states that it had been importing seeds since 1989
and that Takii was one of the PSPL's main suppliers. PSPL claims that it
is one of the first companies in the country to have shifted from open
pollinated varieties of seeds to hybrid varieties. It is claimed that due to
extensive research work undertaken by it as well as extensive sales, PSPL
enjoys a huge market share in the seeds market and is among the top five
companies in India in the field. Takii is a company incorporated under
the laws of Japan and operates in the same field as PSPL. According to
PSPL, with a view to gaining an opening in the Indian market, Takii
approached PSPL. Takii was selling seeds in bulk to PSPL and about
90% of the said purchase was sold by PSPL under its own brand name.
Upon Takii approaching PSPL both parties entered into a Joint Venture
('JV') Agreement dated 23rd September 1996 ('Agreement') whereby
both agreed to develop and sell seeds in the Indian market. The JV came
to be known as Pahuja Takii Seeds Limited ('PTSL'). Certain relevant
clauses of the JV Agreement between PSPL and Takii dated 23rd
September 1996 reads as under:

                  are performing. In addition, as per certain legal

<p id="p_7">7. In response, Mr. Sugimura of Takii informed PSPL that "the audit of
PTS will begin sometime in the week of September 19th". However, on
the same date i.e. 14th September 2011, PSPL wrote to Takii stating that
since the auditors were conducting tax audit under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_17">Income Tax Act</a>,
the Accounts Department would not be in a position to devote time to
"outside auditors" and that "it will be desirable to depute your auditors
from 15th October onwards." However, Mr. Sugimura sent an email to
PSPL on 16th September 2011 explaining the urgency for the conduct of
the audit "in the next three weeks so that we have enough time for
consolidation purposes." This request was rejected by PSPL stating that
Takii's auditors should schedule their work around 15th October 2011.
On 3rd October 2011, an email was sent by PSPL to Takii stating that its
auditors could begin the audit."

accounting auditors, M/s. KPMG and its Indian Lawyers, Amarchand &amp;
Mangaldas and Suresh A. Shroff &amp; Co. ("AMSS") to start the audit
process. After coordinating with Mr. Ishwar Pahuja, Managing Director
("MD") of PTSL, the representative of KPMG and AMSS arrived at the
office of PTSL on 10th October 2011. According to Takii "to the utter
shock of the representatives of the applicant/respondent i.e. KPMG and
AMSS, Mr. Ishwar Pahuja on arrival suddenly asked for written
confirmation with respect to the scope of the audit and the appointment
of KPMG and AMSS to conduct a third party audit by Takii's

<p id="p_9">9. Takii on 11th October 2011 had sent an email setting out detailed
scope of audit. Takii also stated in the said email "for a complete audit, as
in the international practice, we need audit of statutory (legal)
compliances such as Registrar of Companies (ROC) filings as well and
hence they are accompanied by representatives from Amarchand &amp;
Mangaldas, our Indian lawyers. The period of review will cover last three
financial years (FY 2008-09 to FY 2010-11)."

                  From the latest mail dated 27/9/2011 you had pointed
                  out that we need to start immediately for the
                  consolidation purpose that clearly meant financial
                  data required for consolidation. Your today's mail
                  providing scope of audit is entirely different and has
                  no connection whatsoever with consolidation at Takii
                  in Japan.

                   have any objection to the extensive management audit
                  as suggested by you. However, since it involves
                  appraisal of management decision, procedures and
                  controls it is likely to take more time than expected
                  and we will have to be involved in this process. As
                  you know this is the peak season for all the items after
                  extended rainy season hence it will be difficult for us
                  to devote time for such an exercise which we feel can
                  be undertaken later.

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">                  From the scope of audit now suggested and the
                  questioning by the visiting KPMG and your Indian
                  lawyer official there appears to be some hidden
                  agenda at your end. For the last fifteen years our
                  relation with Takii has been cordial like a family. We
                  hope we are meeting in November at APSA and can
                  discuss all these things in detail."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">11.    According to Takii, the above allegations were "frivolous and
uncalled for." Further, according to Takii "the said excuse was not a
bona fide one and was aimed to avoid audit or to buy time." PSPL's
contention, on the other hand, was that they were not told that Takii's
lawyers would be accompanying their auditors and that the lawyers
further created an atmosphere of mistrust and questioned Mr. Ishwar
Pahuja with respect to the business dealings of PSPL other than PTSL.
Apart from alleging that Mr. Pahuja was carrying on his own business
under the banner of PSPL, thereby violating the JV Agreement, "the
lawyers were raising questions that had nothing to do with the audit and
stating things contrary to the agreement." It is stated that this led to the
PSPL stating in its email dated 12th October 2011 to Takii that even
though it had no objection to the extensive management audit, "there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                       Page 9 of 30</span>
 appeared to be some hidden agenda."
</p>

<p id="p_12">12. The relationship between the parties further broke down when on
20th October 2011, Takii sent PSPL a notice under <a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_18">Article 24</a> of the
Agreement in which, after detailing events that had transpired till then,
Takii stated as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                  "18. The aforesaid conduct of PSPL leaves no room
                  for doubt that PSPL seeks to avoid Takii from
                  conducting a third party audit of PTS's accounts and
                  its statutory compliance.       This gives rise to
                  apprehension and doubts as to the JV partner's
                  conduct and credibility. Further, the non-cooperation
                  amounts to a breach not only as an implied term of the
                  JVA but also because of the shareholders and
                  Directors' right under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_19">Indian Companies Act</a>,
                  1956.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">                  19. The excuse given that the present period was peak
                  season making it difficult for PTS to devote such time
                  for audit and that it could undertaken later is simply
                  unacceptable to Takii. It would not require more than
                  one or two persons' involvement from the JVC to
                  assist representatives of KPMG and AMSS in their
                  audit process. Such persons would not be marketing
                  persons or sales persons but from the finance and
                  corporate side and there is no possibility of any such
                  conflict.    Further, there are several statutory
                  documents not available with the ROC records and
                  compliance of which can only be determined from the
                  JVC's records.

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">                  20. Takii being the Joint Venture Partner, that too a
                  majority shareholder has every right to a legal and
                  financial compliance audit of the Joint Venture
                  Company. Further, the management including PTS
                  must cooperate to make available all necessary
                  data/documents for a third party audit as requested by
                  its Joint Venture Partner. The conduct of PSTL
                  constitutes a material breach of the JVA thereby
                  entitling Takii to terminate the JVA unless the same is
                  remedied within a period of 60 days as provided for in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                      Page 10 of 30</span>

                  flow equally from the statutory right of Takii as a
                  majority shareholder and its Directors being on the
                  Board of the JVC were and are entitled to access to all
                  such documents through their representatives and on
                  behalf of whom also this demand is being made.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">                  21. Takii hereby issues this notice calling upon PSPL
                  to cause PTS to immediately allow Takii through its
                  representatives being those from KPMG and AMSS
                  to carry out an audit of the JVC in terms of what has
                  already been communicated commencing no later
                  than 27 October 2011 (taking into consideration the
                  ensuring Diwali holidays) so that the audit exercise
                  can be completed within 60 days period. Take notice
                  further that if the breach is not remedied within 60
                  days from today (i.e. receipt of the scanned copy of
                  this email/notice), the JVA would stand automatically
                  on the expiry of the said 60 days i.e. on and from 21st
                  December 2011."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">13. PSPL by its reply dated 25th October 2011 denied that there had been
any breach of the Agreement and in turn stated that it was Takii which
was in breach as PSPL had information that Takii was doing business
with competitors in the market in violation of <a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_21">Article 8</a> of the Agreement.
A reply was sent by Takii on 1st November 2011 reiterating its earlier
contentions. Nevertheless, according to Takii, it accepted PSPL's
invitation in its reply dated 25th October 2011 to commence audit from 1st
November 2011 and informed PSPL that the representatives from KPMG
and AMSS would be visiting PSPL to commence the audit.
</p>

<p id="p_14">14. According to Takii, its representatives from KPMG and AMSS
arrived at PTSL's office at 11 am on 1st November 2011 to commence
the audit but were prevented by Mr. Pahuja who stated that he was yet to
receive a reply to the email that he had sent to Takii on 1st November
2011. PSPL of course denies this.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                      Page 11 of 30</span>
<p id="p_15"> 15. On 2nd November 2011, Takii sent Mr. Pahuja another email asking
for permission to commence the audit. It stated that it would no longer
send its representatives to PTSL's office "but it is now upon PSPL to
cause PTSL to provide all books of accounts, ledgers and all documents
required by KPMG and AMSS to carry out the referred scope of work to
the respective offices of AMSS (attention of Ms. Maureen Ralte and Mr.
Omar Ahmad) and KPMG (attention of Mr. Gagan Deep and Mr. Rajat
Vig) at least 3 weeks before the 60 day period expire to enable them to
complete the audit within the 60 day period, failing which the JVA will
stand automatically terminated with effect from 26th December 2011
without further notice."
</p>

<p id="p_16">16.    On 28th November 2011, PSPL wrote to Takii denying the
allegations of having committed breach of the Agreement. It pointed out
that M/s. Sumer Garg &amp;Co. had been appointed in accordance with
<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_22">Article 15</a> of the agreement and that in case Takii was not satisfied with
them, it should move a resolution in accordance with the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_23">Companies Act</a>, 1956.       Takii was requested to communicate a
convenient date for convening a board meeting. It was also asked to
provide details of its business dealings with other Indian companies since
January 2002 to enable PSPL to take proper legal proceedings.
</p>

<p id="p_17">17. According to Takii, PSPL was at all times aware that Takii was
doing business with other seed purchasers in India and on many
occasions discussions took place between Mr. Ishwar Pahuja and Mr.
Akshay Pahuja with Takii's representatives including Mr. Sugimura in
relation to seed production contracts given to other Indian companies. It
is stated that employees of PTSL often travelled with the representatives
of Takii to visit various other Indian companies with the knowledge of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                 Page 12 of 30</span>
 Mr. Ishwar Pahuja between 2002 and 2004, long after signing of the
Agreement.
</p>

<p id="p_18">18. On 3rd December 2011, PTSL sent a notice to Takii about a Board
meeting to be held on 12th December 2011 at Delhi and that the
provisional agenda of the meeting was to discuss and finalize the
appointment of an independent firm of Chartered Accounts to conduct a
special audit of the accounts of PTSL. On 10th December 2011, Takii
replied to the said notice stating that there was no reason for PTSL to
carry out any special audit.     Takii asserted its independent right to
nominate its own representative to carry out an audit of PTSL on its
behalf since it was the majority shareholder of PTSL. Further, since the
time was too short for Directors of PTSL who were residents of Japan to
attend the meeting on 12th December 2011, Takii requested that the
proposed meeting may be held in Japan on 17th January 2012 or that
Board meeting may be held by way of video conferencing.
</p>

<p id="p_19">19. It appears that a Board meeting of PTSL was nevertheless held on
12th December 2011 with the quorum of Mr. Ishwar Chand Pahuja,
Chairman, Ms. Chanchal Pahuja, Director and Ms. Charu Pahuja,
Director. Inter alia, the minutes of the said meeting, a copy of which
have been placed on record by PSPL, show that it was decided to invite
"quotations from three audit firms of international repute (other than
KPMG)" and that the decision to appoint one of them was deferred to the
next meeting which was decided to be held on 16th December 2011 at
Delhi. It was stated that Directors who were not in a position to attend the
meeting could do so by video conferencing. On the same date, a letter
was written to Mr. Sugimura on behalf of PTSL to the same effect. On
14th December 2011, Takii wrote to PTSL stating that the Board meeting

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                  Page 13 of 30</span>
 held on 12th December 2011 was invalid as the quorum had to be "one
half of the total strength or three Directors whichever is higher." Since
PTSL had seven Directors i.e. four nominees of Takii and three of PSPL,
which fact had been admitted by PSPL's email dated 20th April 2011, the
alleged Board meeting was ex facie void. Takii further noted that the
minutes of the meeting dated 12th December 2011 purported to state that
Takayuki Yui was not a Director of PTSL and that PTSL had only six
Directors. It was stated by Takii that if this was to be the position, then
PSPL was in breach of the agreement which required Takii to have
majority Directors.
</p>

<p id="p_20">20. PTSL replied on 15th December 2011 stating that it had only six
Directors and that "the name of Mr. Takayuki Yui as a director of PTS as
reflected in company's email of 20th April, 2011 was a result of an
inadvertent mistake made by an employee of the company due to
misconception of DIN obtained for Mr. Takayuki Yui. The said mistake
was later clarified vide company's email dated 11/7/2011."            It was
informed that the Board meeting would be held as scheduled on 16th
December 2011. The minutes of the Board meeting of PTSL held on 16th
December 2011 again showed that only three Directors attended and that
Price Waterhouse &amp; Coopers (PWC) were appointed as special auditors.
</p>

<p id="p_21">21. On 17th December 2011, PSPL wrote to the Indian Council for
Arbitration (ICA) referring to <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_24">Article 29</a> of the Agreement and requesting
that an arbitral tribunal be constituted by the ICA in terms thereof. PSPL
also informed ICA in the said letter of the name of its arbitrator.

                  between the parties is essentially about the

                  special audit as suggested by the Respondent covering
                  the period of three years. He refers to the minutes of

<p id="p_25">24. On receipt of notice, Takii filed IA No.869 of 2012 on 12th January
2012 seeking vacation of stay. In it, Takii stated that it was yet to receive
a copy of the letter dated 17th December 2011 purportedly written to the
ICA by PSPL.           From the records of the ICA inspected by Takii, it
appeared that the letter was received by ICA only on 23rd December
2011.    On 3rd January 2012, Takii sent a detailed letter to the ICA
objecting to its jurisdiction. It was maintained that it was only when the
ICC Court of Arbitration (COA) failed to appoint the Presiding Arbitrator
that the role of the ICA would come to play. Takii contended that the JV
Agreement stood automatically terminated on 26th December 2011 in
view of the failure of PSPL to approach the Court within the 60 day
period, as required by the notice of termination dated 20th December
2011. It was pointed out that this Court's order dated 21st December
2011 did not operate as a stay of the notice of termination. The order only

 directed Takii not to take any precipitate action. Since the JV Agreement
stood automatically terminated on 26th December 2011 there was no
question of Takii taking any precipitate action after the order passed by
this Court. Takii maintained that since the agreement was terminable, no

<p id="p_27">26. Meanwhile, on 31st January 2012, PSPL filed contempt petition CCP
No.11 of 2012 in which it was stated that Takii had disobeyed the order
dated 21st December 2011since it had proceeded to initiate arbitration
before the ICC by filing a statement of claim a copy of which was sent to
ICC on 15th January 2012. It was alleged that ICA had also replied to
Takii on 12th January 2012 rejecting its contention regarding the
interpretation of <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_28">Article 29</a> of the Agreement and had invited Takii to
nominate its arbitrator by 14th January 2012. PSPL further stated in its
contempt petition that Takii had filed a civil suit in the District Court,
Delhi against the ICA seeking to restrain it from proceeding with the
constitution of the arbitral tribunal.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                      Page 18 of 30</span>
<p id="p_28"> 27. When the said contempt petition was listed before this Court on 3rd
February 2012 it was directed to be listed along with the main petition
on 15th February 2012.
</p>

<p id="p_29">28. An affidavit was filed by Takii on 14th February 2012 detailing what
according to it had transpired on 12th February 2012. This Court was
informed on 15th February 2012 that its order dated 17th January 2012
could not be worked out. Counsel for Takii informed the Court that PSPL
had insisted on having the inspection of the accounts of PTSL recorded
on video to which Takii had objected.        He stated that there was a
complete breakdown of trust between the parties and, therefore, Takii
was pressing for vacation of stay. On its part, PSPL had filed an affidavit
on 22nd February 2012 placing on record the transcript of the meeting
held on 12th February 2012. PSPL also placed on record a copy of the
proceedings dated 16th January 2012 passed by the learned Additional
District Judge in Takii's Suit No.41 of 2012 declining the prayer of Takii
for an ex-parte ad interim injunction against the ICA.
</p>

<p id="p_30">Submissions of counsel
</p><p id="p_31">29. Mr. H.S. Phoolka, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of
PSPL submitted that Articles 8 and 9 read collectively with the
Agreement constitute a negative covenant which restrained Takii from
dealing with any other Indian entity during the subsistence of the
Agreement. As on the date this Court heard the present petition on 21st
December 2011, the Agreement had not been terminated. On account of
the interim order passed by the Court on that date, the termination of the
Agreement could not have resulted thereafter even by efflux of time. It
was submitted that if Takii was not restrained from dealing with other
Indian companies and in any event from directly selling in Indian

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                 Page 19 of 30</span>
 markets, it would completely ruin the business of PSPL and therefore the
balance of convenience lay in the Takii being restrained as prayed for
during the pendency of the arbitral proceedings. It was submitted that
Takii's actions were mala fide and the irreparable harm that would result
to PSPL could not be compensated in damages. In any event if PTSL
continued it would not cause any prejudice to Takii which was the
majority shareholder and would be entitled to profits and dividends of the
JV.
</p>

<p id="p_32">30. Mr. Phoolka submitted that the purported letter of termination was
not in accordance with <a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_29">Article 24</a> at all since there was no written notice
of breach of the contract. The so called breach complained of was
regarding the audit of the accounts of PTSL which, in fact, PSPL had
agreed to and, therefore, even that breach had been remedied. He
submitted that lack of trust could not possibly be and in fact was not the
stated ground for terminating the Agreement.         This was also not
mentioned in any of the letters sent by Takii. With the same auditor
having continued for PTSL for over 15 years, there was no occasion to
ask for a separate audit. It was submitted that if there was a dispute
among shareholders of PTSL, that could be examined in terms of the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_30">Companies Act</a>, 1956 which provided for such a
remedy. Even the appointment and removal of the auditor was governed
by <a href="/doc/545576/" id="a_31">Sections 224</a> and <a href="/doc/912590/" id="a_32">225</a> of the Companies Act, 1956. On the other hand,
Takii had refused to participate in the meeting of the Board of Directors
of PTSL and, therefore, was deliberately seeking to kill the business of
the PTSL and thereby PSPL in a mala fide manner. On its own, Takii had
stopped attending board meetings of PTSL in India after 2005. Finally, it
was submitted that PSPL was not seeking any specific relief to compel
Takii to comply with the obligations under the Agreement but was only

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                Page 20 of 30</span>
 seeking an injunction against Takii from selling seeds in India. Mr.
Phoolka relied upon a number of judgments, including <a href="/doc/1050877752/" id="a_33">Suresh Dhanuka

149 Comp Cas 689 (Madras). Mr. Phoolka sought to distinguish the
judgments relied upon by counsel for Takii.
</p>

<p id="p_33">31. On behalf of Takii, Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior counsel and
Mr. Akhil Sibal, learned counsel submitted that Articles 8 and 9 of the
Agreement contained no express or implied negative covenant restraining
Takii from dealing with Indian companies indefinitely. It was pointed out
that long after the period of expiry of five years from 23rd September
1996, the date of the Agreement, Takii had been dealing with other
Indian companies to the knowledge of PSPL which had raised no
objection. Therefore, there was no such negative covenant either implied
or in practice. It is pointed out that Takii did have four Directors on the
Board of PTSL and, therefore, any Board meeting held without the
participation of the majority of the directors would be invalid. As a
major shareholder of PTSL Takii had a right to have the audit and
accounts of PTSL done, particularly when it was answerable to its
shareholders internationally and since PTSL was one of its subsidiaries.
It is submitted that the audit had to be by a firm of Takii's choice and not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                  Page 21 of 30</span>
 either of PSPL or PTSL. On three occasions i.e. 10th October, 12th
November 2011 and 12th February 2012 when attempts were made to
have accounts of PTSL inspected by KPMG in the presence of Takii's
lawyers, AMSS, PSPL had raised all kinds of objections and refused to
permit the audit to go on. Secondly, Board meetings were held by PTSL
with only the Directors of PSPL despite knowing fully well that it did not
have the necessary quorum and ignoring Takii's request for postponing
date of the Board meeting which as a majority shareholder it was entitled
to ask for.
</p>

<p id="p_34">32. Thirdly, PSPL had also resiled from the fact of there being on the
Board of PSPL, four nominee Directors of Takii. It is submitted that in
the face of this conduct of the Directors of the PSPL it was impossible for
the JV to proceed as such. The Agreement was by its nature terminable
and, in fact, it came to an end by the efflux of time on 26th December
2011. There was a statutory bar under <a href="/doc/865734/" id="a_40">Section 14</a> read with Section 41
SRA to PSPL seeking the specific relief of continuation of the
Agreement. Relying on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1313207/" id="a_41">Indian Oil Corporation v.

Limited v. FTV BVI</a> 2011 IX AD (Delhi) 517, it is submitted that there
was no question of enforcing any negative covenant after the period of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                 Page 22 of 30</span>
 agreement had come to an end. It was submitted that the reliefs prayed
for could not be granted and the petition had to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_35">Is there prima facie an implied negative covenant in Articles 8 and 9?
</p><p id="p_36">33. The first issue that requires to be considered is whether prima facie
Articles 8 and 9 of the Agreement contain a negative covenant, either
express or implied, which restrains Takii from dealing with Indian
companies and doing business on its own in India as long as the
Agreement subsists. Articles 8 and 9 of the Agreement are in Chapter 6
titled 'Takii's existing business with other Indian companies.' At the time
of the Agreement entered into on 23rd September 1996 the parties
intended that PSPL could continue its own business with a decision in
that behalf to be taken later. Takii could continue its business with other
Indian companies for the time being with the rider that it 'shall terminate
it in five years after the establishment of PTS'. It does appear, therefore,
that the understanding was that Takii's existing business at that time with
the other Indian companies would stand terminated five years after the
establishment of PTS. However, there is no clause in the Agreement that
states that Takii cannot thereafter ever do business with other Indian
companies. It is difficult to imply such a negative covenant in the plain
reading of Articles 8 and 9. In any event there is in fact no clause which
states that Takii cannot do business on its own in India after the
establishment of PTS or that it should continue to do business only
through the JV.
</p>

<p id="p_37">34.   That the parties themselves proceeded on this understanding is
apparent when understood in the background of the assertion of Takii
that to the knowledge of PSPL it had, in fact, been doing business with
the other Indian companies from 2002 onwards. This assertion has not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                  Page 23 of 30</span>
 been countered by PSPL. It prima facie bears out Takii's contention that
the intention of the parties was not that Takii would never ever do
business with any Indian company at any time or that it would never
directly sell seeds in India. There is therefore not even a prima facie case
in favour of PSPL for grant of the interim relief of restraining Takii from
selling seeds directly in India. There also is no prima facie case made out
to restrain Takii from terminating the Agreement or dealing with other
Indian companies since prima facie it appears that there is no negative
covenant in the Agreement, either express or implied, restraining Takii
during the subsistence of the Agreement.
</p>

<p id="p_38">Law concerning enforcement of negative covenants
35.1 The leading decision in regard to the law concerning enforcement
of negative covenants is that of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_48">Gujarat Bottling
Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Co. The</a> facts were that the Parle Group held
trademarks in beverages including Thumbs up, Limca, Maza, certain
beverages, which were being bottled by Gujarat Bottling Company
('GBC'). The Parle Group assigned the trademarks in those beverages in
favour of Coca Cola on 12th November 1993. In anticipation of the said
assignment, Coca Cola on 20th September 1993 ('the 1993 Agreement')
entered into an agreement with whereby Coca Cola authorized GBC to
bottle, sell, distribute, beverages under the some of the aforementioned
trademarks The said agreement was to operate till November 1998 unless
earlier terminated. Paragraph 14 of the agreement contained a negative
covenant that GBC would not manufacture, bottle, sell, deal or otherwise
be concerned with the products, beverages of any other brands or
trademarks/trade names during the subsistence of the agreement
including the period of one year's notice as contemplated in paragraph 21.
Under paragraph 19 Coca Cola had the right to discontinue supplying to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                  Page 24 of 30</span>
 GBC the essence/syrup and/or other materials on the happening of any of
the events mentioned in clauses (a) to (e) of the said paragraph. Clause
</p><p id="p_39">(b) of paragraph 19 related to transfer of stock, share or interest or other
indicia of ownership of GBC resulting in effective transfer of control
without the prior express written consent of Coca Cola.
</p>

<p id="p_40">35.2 On 30th April 1994 Coca Cola entered into another agreement
whereby it granted GBC a non-exclusive licence to use the trademarks.
With the shareholding in GBC being transferred to concerns closely
associated with PepsiCo Inc. ('Pepsi') and PepsiCo Food Limited, a
subsidiary of PepsiCo, GBC issued a notice to Coca Cola on 25th January
1995 terminating the agreements. Coca Cola then filed a suit in the
Bombay High Court in which an interim order was passed restraining
GBC from manufacturing, bottling, selling or dealing with the project of
any brand or trademark owned by the Respondent other than Coca Cola.
A Division Bench modified the injunction by restraining GBC and all
those to whom it may have sold its shares from using the plants of GBC
for manufacturing, bottling or selling beverages. In effect, the Division
Bench gave effect to the negative stipulation in para 14 of the agreement.
GBC then appealed to the Supreme Court.
</p>

<p id="p_41">35.3 One of the contentions advanced by GBC was that clause 14 was an
agreement in restraint of trade and hit by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_49">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act,
1872. After referring to the decision of the House of Lords in Esso
Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Harper's Garage (Stourport) Ltd. (1968) AC 269,
it was observed by the Supreme Court: "Except in cases where the
contract is wholly one sided, normally the doctrine of restraint of trade is
not attracted in cases where the restriction is to operate during the period
the contract is subsisting and it applies in respect of a restriction which

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                  Page 25 of 30</span>
 operates after the termination of the contract." Reference was made to the
decision in <a href="/doc/452434/" id="a_50">Niranjan Shankar Golikari v. The Century Spinning and
Mfg. Co. Ltd., AIR1967 SC</a> 1098 where it was held that "considerations
against restrictive covenants are different in cases where the restriction is
to apply during the period after the termination of the contract than those
in cases where it is to operate during the period of the contract. Negative
covenants operative during the period of the contract of employment
when the employee is bound to serve his employer exclusively are
generally not regarded as restraint of trade and therefore do not fall under
<a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_51">Section 27</a> of the Contract Act." Consequently, it was held that since the
negative stipulation in para 14 of the 1993 agreement was "confined in its
application to the period of subsistence of the agreement and the
restriction imposed therein is operative only during the period the 1993
Agreement is subsisting, the said stipulation cannot be held to be in
restraint of trade so as to attract the bar of <a href="/doc/755407/" id="a_52">Section 27</a> of the contract
Act."
</p>

<p id="p_42">35.4 Thereafter the Court discussed the clauses of the agreement and the
facts of the said case in great detail and held that no interference was
called for with the interim order passed by the High Court restraining
GBC and the entities other than Coca Cola from bottling in beverage or
drinks till 25th January 1996 which was the original term of the
agreement. As far as the case on hand is concerned the facts do not
indicate there being a clear negative covenant in the Agreement between
PSPL and Takii as existed in the above decision in the agreement
between Coca Cola and GBC.
</p>

<p id="p_43">36. The above law has been followed in several subsequent decisions of
the Supreme Court and this Court, which do not, therefore, require

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                   Page 26 of 30</span>
 discussion. Suffice it to hold that at this stage this Court is prima facie
satisfied in light of the above law that there is in fact no negative
covenant in the Agreement in question to restrain Takii and therefore the
question of enforcing such negative covenant does not arise.
</p>

<p id="p_44">37. Even assuming that there is a negative covenant, its enforcement
cannot be sought by PSPL after the expiry of the Agreement. PSPL
however asserts that at the time it approached this Court, the Agreement
was subsisting while Takii contends that it stood terminated by the efflux
of time on 26th December 2011. This is what requires to be examined
next.
</p>

<p id="p_45">The Agreement stood terminated by efflux of time
</p><p id="p_46">38. The termination clauses of the Agreement envisage 60 days' notice
having to be given by one party to the other alleging breach of the
contract. The notice dated 20th October 2011 by Takii to PSPL was, in
fact, a notice in terms of <a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_53">Article 24</a> of the Agreement. It does appear
prima facie that the breach alleged by Takii regarding PSPL, the minority
shareholder, not permitting Takii, the majority shareholder, to inspect the
accounts of PTSL through Takii's own auditors was not remedied within
a period of 60 days from the period of that notice. The requirement for
the breach to be considered as being complete on account of the failure
by PSPL to remedy it within the period of 60 days appears prima facie to
be satisfied. There is merit in the contention that even while this Court on
21st December 2011 restrained Takii taking from precipitate action, it did
not prevent the Agreement coming to an end by efflux of time on the
expiry of 60 days after the notice dated 20th October 2011.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                  Page 27 of 30</span>
<p id="p_47"> Takii cannot be compelled to continue the JV
</p><p id="p_48">39. This Court did attempt by the order dated 17th February 2012 to get
the parties to sort out their differences by allowing the audit of PTSL's
accounts by Takii's auditors to proceed. However, that could not happen
for a variety of reasons which the Court does not consider necessary to
examine at this stage. The fact remains that the disputes between the
parties have become further irreconcilable and it does appear that there is
a breakdown of trust between them. The Court cannot in the
circumstances by an interim order possibly compel Takii to continue the
JV or restrain it from not selling seeds on its own or through another
Indian entity.

<p id="p_49">40. The facts in <a href="/doc/1050877752/" id="a_54">Suresh Dhanuka v. Sunita Mohapatra</a> were that there
was an assignment of the trademark whereby 50% of the right, title and
interest in the trademark "Naturoma Herbal" with proportional goodwill
stood assigned to the appellant forever. In the present case, there is no
assignment of the trademark or other intellectual property right by Takii
in favour of PSPL or PTSL. Again in <a href="/doc/1847057/" id="a_55">Adhunik Steels Ltd. v. Orissa
Manganese and Minerals (P) Ltd</a>. there was a negative covenant which
was sought to be enforced. It is not possible to read any such implied or
express covenant in the present case. For the same reason, the decision in
<a href="/doc/1354416/" id="a_56">Dirk India Private Limited v. Mahagenco</a> is distinguishable on facts.
Even in <a href="/doc/1356541/" id="a_57">Modi Rubber Ltd. v. Guardian International Corp</a>., on which
extensive reliance was placed by Mr.Phoolka there clearly was a negative
covenant.
</p>

<p id="p_50">41. Also prima facie this Court is not at this stage, on the basis of the
documents placed on record, persuaded by the submission on behalf of
PSPL that the termination of the Agreement by Takii was malafide and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">O.M.P. 947/2011                                                 Page 28 of 30</span>
 that the resultant breach of the contract cannot be compensated by way of
damages. The Agreement in the present case was by nature determinable.
The bar under <a href="/doc/865734/" id="a_58">Section 14</a> (1) SRA against enforcement of the Agreement
stood attracted. Even assuming that the Agreement was illegally
terminated by Takii, the remedy for PSPL lay only in a claim for
damages. The law in this regard stands settled in <a href="/doc/1313207/" id="a_59">Indian Oil Corporation
v. Amritsar Gas Service</a> in which the Supreme Court disapproved of an
arbitral Award that restored a gas distributorship on the ground that the
procedure for its termination was not followed. It was observed (SCC, p.
</p><p id="p_51">542):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">        "The finding in the award being that the Distributorship
        Agreement was revokable and the same being admittedly for
        rendering personal service, the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_60">Specific
        Relief Act</a> were automatically attracted. Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/124747/" id="a_61">Section
        14</a> of the Specific Relief Act specifies the contracts which cannot
        be specifically enforced, one of which is 'a contract which is in its
        nature determinable'. In the present case, it is not necessary to
        refer to the other clauses of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/865734/" id="a_62">Section 14</a>, which
        also may be attracted in the present case since clause (c) clearly
        applies on the finding read with reasons given in the award itself
        that the contract by its nature is determinable. This being so
        granting the relief of restoration of the distributorship even on the
        finding that the breach was committed by the appellant-
        Corporation is contrary to the mandate in <a href="/doc/1400696/" id="a_63">Section 14(1)</a> of the
        Specific Relief Act and there is an error of law apparent on the
        face of the award which is stated to be made according to 'the law
        governing such cases'. The grant of this relief in the award cannot,
        therefore, be sustained."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">42. This law explained in the above decision has been applied and
followed by the High Court in <a href="/doc/1737629/" id="a_64">Rajasthan Breweries Limited v. Stroh
Brewery Company</a> and <a href="/doc/1533053/" id="a_65">Fashion Television India Private Limited v.
FTV BVI</a>. Consequently this Court is not persuaded to grant the reliefs
prayed for in this petition.

<p id="p_53"> Conclusion
</p><p id="p_54">43. The petition is, accordingly, dismissed with costs of Rs.30,000 which
will be paid by PSPL to Takii within four weeks. The interim order is
vacated and the application is dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_55">44. As regards the contempt petition, there is no case made out for
proceeding against the Respondent for disobedience of the order of the
Court. Consequently, CCP No.11 of 2012 is also dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_56">45. It is clarified that the observations on merits made in the present
judgment are tentative and prima facie would not bind any other fora,
including the Arbitral Tribunal, which might deal with the contentions of
the parties on merits.
