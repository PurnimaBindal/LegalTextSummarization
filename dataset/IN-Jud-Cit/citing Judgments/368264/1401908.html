 equipments. It is claimed that the word/mark „GREAVES‟ is

an essential and prominent feature of plaintiff‟s trade name,

Finance Limited, Greaves Midwest Engineering Company

Limited, Crompton Greaves Limited, Dee Greaves Limited,

Piaggio Greaves Vehicles Limited and Greaves Farymann

            The plaintiff company claimed to have incurred

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                             Page 3 of 28

          2006-07               51.74




3.          It is alleged that defendant No.1 who is the

proprietor of defendant No.2, made an application for

registration of the trademark „GREAVES INDIA‟ claiming use

of aforesaid mark since 1.12.2004 in respect of self priming

pump, monobloc pump, jet pump, shallow well pump,

coupled pump, high head coupled pump, diesel pump,

which are exactly of the same type as the pumps of the

plaintiff company. The plaintiff company sent a legal notice

dated 26.12.2007 to the defendant No.1 calling upon it to

cease and desist from using the aforesaid mark.            In his

reply, the defendant claimed to have acquired popularity

and publicity through use since 1.12.2004.

            It is alleged that defendant No.1 is engaged in a

business which is similar to the business of the plaintiff

company and is dealing in products as that of the plaintiff


CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                     Page 4 of 28
 company, the use of the aforesaid mark by the defendant

No.1 would result in causing deception in the market and is

likely to lead the purchaser to believe that the products

being     sold       under      the     marks      „GREAVES     INDIA‟      are

manufactured, sold and marketed by the plaintiff company

or    that     the     use      of    the   aforesaid    mark    has     been

licensed/authorized by the plaintiff company.

4.           The plaintiff has sought permanent injunction

restraining          the   defendant        No.1    from    manufacturing,

exporting,           selling,        marketing      or     advertising      his

products/goods/services under the name „GREAVES INDIA‟

or in other name which is deceptively similar to the name

„GREAVES‟ of the plaintiff company. The plaintiff has also

sought mandatory injunction directing the defendant No.1

to withdraw its application for registration of the mark

„GREAVES INDIA‟.                The plaintiff has further sought for

rendition of accounts.

5.           The defendant No.1 has contested this suit. It is

alleged in the Written Statement that the defendant No.1

has been using the trademark „GREAVES INDIA‟ since

November, 2004 and has also applied for its registration. It

is also alleged that the quality, price and packaging of the

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                                 Page 5 of 28
 products of the defendant No.1 are entirely different from

that of the plaintiff company and the same are clearly

distinguishable by the consumers.         It is also claimed that

the trademark of the defendant is altogether different from

trademark of the plaintiff company.

6.          The following issues were framed on the pleadings

of the parties:

            1. Whether the plaintiff is the registered owner of
                the trademark „GREAVES‟? - OPP
            2. Whether the defendants have been using the
                trademark „GREAVES INDIA‟ since December,
                2005 and if so, its effect? - OPD
            3. Whether the defendants had any right to adopt,
                use and apply for the registration of the
                impugned mark „GREAVES INDIA‟? - OPD
            4. Whether     the    defendants        are   guilty      of

                incorporates the plaintiff‟s registered trademark
                „GREAVES‟? - OPP
            5. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to rendition of
                accounts and damages, if so, to what extent? -
                OPP

            Thus, the plaintiff company is the registered

proprietor of the aforesaid trademarks. The issue is decided

accordingly.

Issues No. 2 to 4

8.          These issues are interconnected and can be

decided together.     In his affidavit by way of evidence, the

defendant No.1 Mr. Mohammad Rafi (DW-1) has stated that

his products are entirely different and are not in any

manner related or connected with the consumer class of the

plaintiff company.       He further stated, that the term

„GREAVES‟ itself is not sufficient to make the mark

„GREAVES INDIA‟ deceptive and confusing. He also stated

that he is also making motor pumps in the name of „POWER

FLOW‟ and he has already applied for registration of the

trademark „GREAVES INDIA‟.          He claimed that he has

stopped sale and marketing of products under the trade

name GREAVES INDIA after the injunction.

            In his cross examination, he admitted that he used

to manufacture and trade in self priming pump, monobloc

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                   Page 8 of 28
 pump, jet pump, shallow well pump, coupling pump, high

head      pumps,     diesel   pumps   under   the   trade   name

„GREAVES INDIA‟, though he stopped using the aforesaid

mark after injunction by this Court.

9.          PW-1 Mr. Vinod Kumar Agarwal, who is the only

witness produced by the plaintiff company has stated in his

affidavit by way of evidence that „GREAVES‟ is the principal

trademark of the plaintiff and is exclusively associated with

its product and its business activities.        He has further

stated that the goods manufactured by the plaintiff under

the trademark „GREAVES‟ are offered for sale in every part

of the country and also exported to several other countries.

According to him, the plaintiff company besides other

products also manufactures engines, sold under the model

name MK-12, MK-20 &amp; MK-25.            MK-12, according to the

witness, is a pump being assembled with various models of

None Self Priming pumps (monobloc and coupled) and is

also being used with many other applications whereas MK-

20 is a single cylinder, air cooled engine, being assembled

with various models of Non Self Priming pumps (monobloc).

According to him MK-25 is a single cylinder, air cooled

engine and this engine is also being coupled with Self

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                     Page 9 of 28
 Priming Pumpset and is being used for other applications as

well. He has stated that the plaintiff company had sale of

Rs. 18637 lac, Rs. 22356 lac, Rs. 21167 lac, Rs. 19885 lac

for MK 12 Pumps, Rs. 3424 lac, Rs. 4126 lac, Rs. 3925 lac,

Rs. 6628 lac for MK 25 and Rs. 2675 lac, Rs. 4936 lac, Rs.

6711 lac, Rs. 6348 lac for MK-20 Pump for the years 2003-

04, 2004-05, 2005-06 &amp; 2006-07 respectively. According to

him the plaintiff company incurred advertising expenditure

of Rs. 9.09 lac, Rs. 23.54 lac, Rs. 36.47 lac, Rs. 48.13 lac &amp;

Rs.51.74 lac for the years 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05,

2005-06 &amp; 2006-07.         He has further stated that the

defendant No.1 in his application seeking registration of

trademark „GREAVES INDIA‟ has claimed use of the

aforesaid mark in respect of self priming pumps monobloc

pump, jet pump, shallow well pump, coupled pump, high

head coupled pump, diesel pump, which are exactly of the

same type as are the pumps of the plaintiff company.

10.         <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_1">Section 28</a> of Trade Marks Act, 1999 gives to the

registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to

the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods or services

in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to

obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                  Page 10 of 28
 the    manner        provided   by   this   Act.   The   action     for

infringement is, thus, a remedy provided by <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks

Act</a> to the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark in

case there is an invasion of the statutory right provided to

him for use of that trade mark in relation to the goods for

which the trade mark has been registered in his name.

<a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_3">Section 29(1)</a> of Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides that a

registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not

being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of

permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is

identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in

relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade

mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use

of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade

mark.

11.         It is also a settled proposition of law, which was

reiterated by Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_4">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt

Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories,

PTC (Suppl</a>) (2) 680 (SC), that if the defendant resorts to

colourable use of a registered trade mark such an act of the

defendant would give rise to an action for passing off as well

as for infringement. In an action based upon infringement

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                        Page 11 of 28
 of a registered trade mark if the mark used by the defendant

is visually, phonetically or otherwise so close to the

registered trade mark of the plaintiff that it is found to be an

imitation of the registered trade mark, the statutory right of

the owner of the registered trade mark is taken as infringed.

In such a case, if it is found that the defendant has adopted

the essential features of the registered trade mark of the

plaintiff, he would be liable even if he is able to establish

that on account of packaging, get up and other writings on

his goods or on the container in which the goods are sold by

him, it is possible to clearly distinguish his goods from the

goods of the plaintiff.    On the other hand in a case of

passing off if it is shown that on account of these factors it

is very much possible for the purchaser to identify the origin

of the goods and thereby distinguish the goods of the

defendant from the goods of the plaintiff, the defendant may

not be held liable.

            <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_5">In Corn Products Refining Co. vs. Shangrila

Food Products Ltd</a>. 1960 (1) SCR 968, the Supreme Court

observed that the question whether two competing marks

are so similar as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion is

one of first impression and it is for the court to decide it.

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                    Page 12 of 28
 The question has to be approached from the point of view of

a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection.

            <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_6">In Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. &amp; Co., Mysore</a>,

AIR 1972 SC 1359, Supreme Court inter alia observed as

under:-

              According to Karly‟s Law of Trade
              Marks and Trade Names (9th Edition
              Paragraph 838) "Two marks, when
              placed side by side, may exhibit
              many and various differences, yet
              the main idea left on the mind by
              both may be the same. A person
              acquainted with the one mark, and
              not having the two side by side for
              comparison, might well be deceived,
              if the goods were allowed to be
              impressed with the second mark,
              into a belief that he was dealing with
              goods which bore the same mark as
              that with which he was acquainted.

              It would be too much to expect that
              persons dealing with trademarked
              goods,    and    relying,  as   they
              frequently do, upon marks, should
              be able to remember the exact
              details of the marks upon the goods
              with which they are in the habit of
              dealing.    Marks are remembered
              rather by general impressions or by
              some significant detail than by any
              photographic recollection of the
              whole.      Moreover, variations in
              detail might well be supposed by
              customers to have been made by the
              owners of the trade mark they are
              already acquainted with for reasons
              of their own.

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                     Page 13 of 28
               It is therefore clear that in order to
              come to the conclusion whether one
              mark is deceptively similar to
              another, the broad and essential
              features of the two are to be
              considered.     They should not be
              placed side by side to find out if
              there are any differences in the
              design and if so, whether they are of
              such character as to prevent one
              design from being mistaken for the
              other. It would be enough if the
              impugned mark bears such an
              overall similarity to the registered
              mark as would be likely to mislead a
              person usually dealing with one to
              accept the other if offered to him.

12.         It is not necessary that in order to constitute

infringement, the impugned trademark should be an

absolute replica of the registered trademark of the plaintiff.

When the mark of the defendant is not identical to the mark

of the plaintiff, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to

establish that the mark being used by the defendant

resembles his mark to such an extent that it is likely to

deceive or cause confusion and that the user of the

impugned trademark is in relation to the goods in respect of

which the plaintiff has obtained registration in his favour. It

will be sufficient if the plaintiff is able to show that the

trademark            adopted   by   the   defendant   resembles      its



CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                         Page 14 of 28
 trademark in a substantial degree, on account of extensive

use of the main features found in his trademark. In fact,

any intelligent person, seeking to encash upon the goodwill

and reputation of a well-established trademark, would make

some minor changes here and there so as to claim in the

event of a suit or other proceeding, being initiated against

him that the trademark being used by him, does not

constitute infringement of the trademark, ownership of

which vests in some other person. But, such rather minor

variations or distinguishing features would not deprive the

plaintiff of injunction in case resemblance in the two

trademarks is found to be substantial, to the extent that the

impugned trademark is found to be similar to the registered

trademark of the plaintiff. But, such malpractices are not

acceptable and such a use cannot be permitted since this is

actuated by a dishonest intention to take pecuniary

advantage of the goodwill and brand image which the

registered mark enjoys, it is also likely to create at least

initial confusion in the mind of a consumer with average

intelligence and imperfect recollection. It may also result in

giving an unfair advantage to the infringer by creating an

initial interest in the customer, who on account of such

CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                  Page 15 of 28
 deceptive use of the registered trademark may end up

buying the product of the infringer, though after knowing,

either on account of difference in packaging etc. or on

account of use of prefixes or suffixes that the product which

he is buying is not the product of the plaintiff, but is the

product of the defendant.


13.         As held by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/368264/" id="a_7">Amritdhara

Pharmacy v. Satyadeo Gupta</a>, AIR 1963 SC 449, whether

a trade name is likely to deceive or cause confusion by its

resemblance to another mark already registered is a matter

of first impression and the standard of comparison to be

adopted in judging the resemblance is from the point of view

of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection.

What is important to keep in mind that the purchaser does

not have both the marks lying side by side for comparison

and, therefore, chances of deception are rather strong.


14.         In a case based on infringement of a registered

trademark, the plaintiff need not prove anything more than

the use of its registered trademark by the defendant.          In

such a case, even if the defendant is able to show that on

account of use of other words by him in conjunction with


CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                  Page 16 of 28
 the registered word/mark of the plaintiff, there would be no

confusion in the mind of the customer when he come across

the product of the defendant and/or that on account of the

packaging, get up and the manner of writing trademark on

the packaging, it is possible for the consumer to distinguish

his product from that of the plaintiff, he would still be liable

for infringement of the registered trademark.


15.         <a href="/doc/280042/" id="a_8">In K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar vs. Shri Ambal

and Co., Madras and Anr</a>., AIR 1970 SC 146, the

respondents were the two registered trademarks. The first</pre>

<p id="p_1">mark consisted of a label containing a device of a goddess

Sri Ambal seated on a globe floating on water enclosed in a

circular frame with the legend "Sri Ambal parimala snuff" at

the top of the label, whereas the other mark consisted of

expression "Sri Ambal". The appellant before Supreme Court

was seeking registration of a label containing three panels.

The first and the third panels contained equivalents of the

words "Sri Andal Madras Snuff", whereas the central panel

contained the picture of goddess Sri Andal and the legend

"Sri Andal". Sri Andal and Sri Ambal are separate divinities.

The question before the Court was whether the proposed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                    Page 17 of 28</span>
 mark of the appellant was deceptively similar to the

respondents‟ mark. Noticing that the word Ambal was an

essential feature of the registered trademarks, the Court

was of the view that the name Andal proposed to be used by

the appellant did not cease to be deceptively similar because

it was used in conjunction with a pictorial device. Supreme

Court referred to the case of De Cordova and Ors. v. Vick

Chemical Coy. (1951) 68 R.P.C.103 where Vick Chemical

Coy were the proprietors of the registered trade mark

consisting of the word "Vaporub" and another registered

trade mark consisting of a design of which the words "Vicks

Vaporub Salve" formed a part.    The defendants advertised

their ointment as 'Karsote vapour Rub" and the Court held

that the defendants had infringed the registered marks. The

view taken by Lord Radcliffe that "a mark is infringed by

another trader if, even without using the whole of it upon or

in connection with his goods, he uses one or more of its

essential features" was affirmed by the Supreme Court.

The appeal was accordingly dismissed by Supreme Court,

despite the fact that the words Ambal and Andal had

distinct meanings.

</p><p id="p_4">            In the case of K.R.Narayanan (supra), it was held

that a mark ought to be registered, before a person can

claim its infringement, and a proposed registration, which

may or may not be granted, does not confer a cause of

action to the person who has applied for its registration. I

fail to appreciate how this judgment can be of any help to

the defendant No.1 when the mark "GREAVES" and

"GREAVES (Label)" are already registered in favour of the

plaintiff company in various classes including Class 7,

which includes centrifugal pump sets and diesel driven

pump sets.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            In KSB Aktiengessellschaft (supra), the plaintiff

company was using "KSB" as part of its corporate name.

Plaintiff No. 2 in that case was also exporting goods under

the trademark "KSB" and/or under the trade name "KSB" &amp;

Logo. The defendant was using "KSB" as a part of its trade

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                  Page 19 of 28</span>
 name. It was contended on behalf of the defendant that no

infringement was made out on its part as it was using the

words "Global Limited" as suffix to the word "KSB".        The

contention was however, rejected by this court noticing that

the parties were in similar line of business and holding the

rival marks were deceptively similar. The Court felt that a

lay consumer could by association relate the origin of

defendant‟s goods to that of the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_6">17.         In Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. (supra), the appellant

was registered proprietor of trade mark "RUSTON" in Class

7 in respect of the diesel internal combustion engines. The

respondent was found using the trademarks "RUSTAM" and

„RUSTAM INDIA". The High Court held that use of the word

"RUSTAM" by the respondent constituted infringement of

"RUSTOM INDIA" on the ground that the plaintiffs products

were manufactured in England whereas the defendant was

manufacturing them in India and the suffix "INDIA" would

be a sufficient warning that the engines sold was not a

"RUSTON" engine manufactured in England. Setting aside

the decision of the High Court, Supreme Court held that if

the respondent trade mark „RUSTOM" was deceptively

similar to that of the appellant‟s trade mark "RUSTON", the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                 Page 20 of 28</span>
 mere addition of word "INDIA" to the respondent‟s trade

mark was of no consequence and the appellant was entitled

to succeed in its action for infringement of trade mark.

</p><p id="p_7">18.         As noted earlier, the defendant No.1 himself has

admitted        in   his   cross   examination   that   he      was

manufacturing monoblock pumps, jet pumps, shallow well

pumps, coupling pumps, high head pumps, and diesel

pumps under the trade name „GREAVES INDIA‟. It has also

come in deposition of PW-1, that the defendants are

manufacturing self priming pump, monobloc pump, jet

pump, shallow well pump, coupled pump, high head

coupled pump, diesel pump etc. and in his application for

registration also the defendant No.1 has claimed use of the

mark "GREAVES INDIA" in respect of the above referred

products which according to PW-1 are exactly of the same

type as are the pumps of the plaintiff company.           It thus,

stands proved that the mark "GREAVES INDIA" is being

used by the defendant No.1 in respect of the same products

for which the mark Greaves is being used by the plaintiff

company. The defendant before this Court has thus, been

manufacturing and selling the same product under the

trade name "GREAVES INDIA", which the plaintiff company

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                      Page 21 of 28</span>
 has been manufacturing and selling under its registered

trade mark "GREAVES".     By using the word "GREAVES

INDIA" the defendant No.1 lifted and adopted the whole of

the registered trademark of the plaintiff company, thereby

causing infringement of that trade mark. Mere use of the

word "INDIA" would make no difference since the word

"GREAVES" is not only an essential but also the main

component of the trademark "GREAVES INDIA" being used

by the defendant No.1. Use of the word "INDIA" as a suffix

and not as a prefix is also a strong indicator that the

defendant No.1 wanted to encash upon the popularity,

goodwill and reputation of the word "GREAVES" engines not

only in India but in many other countries. In fact had the

defendant No.1 used the word "INDIA" as prefix even that,

in my view would have constituted infringement, in facts

and circumstances of this case.   It would be pertinent to

note here that the defendant No.1 has not given any reason

or explanation for use of the word "GREAVES" which is the

most essential component of his trademark. During cross

examination, he could not even give any meaning to the

word "GREAVES". This clearly shows that the adoption of

the word "GREAVES" by the defendant was dishonest,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS)No. 395/2008                               Page 22 of 28</span>
 actuated with the intention to encash upon the tremendous

reputation which the registered trademark of the plaintiff

enjoys in the market. It would also be appropriate to note

here that "GREAVES" is not a dictionary word and is alleged

to be the surname of the founder of the plaintiff company.

Neither deletion of a part of a registered trademark nor the

prefix or suffix of another word to it would validate the use

of the registered mark by an unlicensed user, once it is

shown that the part used by the infringer is an essential

part of the registered trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_8">19.         It also in interest of the consumer that a well

established brand such as "GREAVES" is not to be allowed

to be used by another person.         A person purchasing

pumping sets being sold by the plaintiff company under the

name "GREAVES", when he comes across the product of the

defendant No.1 being sold under the trade name "GREAVES

INDIA", on account of imperfect recollection and his not

having the product of the plaintiff with him at that time,

may form an impression that both the products emanate

from the same source and that is why both of them are

using the word "GREAVES" for selling similar products.

This may cause confusion in the minds of the consumers.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS)No. 395/2008                                 Page 23 of 28</span>
 Also, if the quality of the product of the defendant No.1 is

not found to be as good as the quality of the product of the

plaintiff, the consumer may feel cheated; he having paid the

price which the product of the plaintiff commands in the

market and he may also form an opinion that the quality of

the product of the plaintiff had gone down and that is why

the product purchased by him was found to be of inferior

quality.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs,

the plaintiff is entitled to injunction against use of the

trademark "GREAVES" by the defendant No.1. The plaintiff

is also entitled to mandatory injunction directing the

defendant No.1 to withdraw his application submitted to

trade mark registry for registration of the mark "GREAVES

INDIA". The issues are decided against the defendant No.1
