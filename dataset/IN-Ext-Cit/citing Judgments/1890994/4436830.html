<p id="p_2">Introduction

            This group of six appeals occupied considerable  judicial  time.
These matters  were  heard  on  ten  days  between   November  2,  2011  and
November 29, 2011. Although the  facts  differ  from  one  another  in  some
respects but since fundamental issues appeared to be common  and  all  these
matters arise from a common judgment dated  April  4,  2007  passed  by  the
Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court at  Ranchi,  we  have  heard  all
these matters together which are being disposed of by this common judgment.
Prayers
</p><p id="p_3">2.          The prayers in  the  writ  petitions  filed  by  the  appellants
before the  High  Court  also  differ.  However,  principally  the   reliefs
prayed for by the appellants in their writ petitions  were for quashing  (i)
the  decision  of  the  Department  of  Mines  and  Geology,  Government  of
Jharkhand contained in the letter  dated  September  13,  2005  whereby  the
State Government sought to withdraw the recommendation for grant  of  mining
lease made in favour  of the appellants in  the  subject  iron  ore  bearing
areas in Mauza Ghatkuri, West Singhbhum District, Jharkhand (ii)  the  order
of the Ministry of Mines, Government of India whereunder the  said  Ministry
returned the recommendation made by Government of  Jharkhand  in  favour  of
each of the   appellants  (iii)   for  declaring   the  Notifications  dated
December 21, 1962 and February 28, 1969 issued by the  Government  of  Bihar
and the Notification dated October 27, 2006  issued  by  the  Government  of
Jharkhand  null and void and (iv)  directing   the  respondents  to  proceed
under Rule 59(2) of the Mineral Concession Rules,  1960  (for  short,  ‘1960
Rules’) for grant of mining lease to each of the  appellants  in  the   iron
ore bearing areas in Ghatkuri as applied.

<p id="p_7">Factual features

Civil Appeal No. 3285 of 2009, Monnet Ispat  and  Energy  Ltd.  Vs.Union  of
India and Ors.
</p>


<p id="p_8">5.          The appellant company, referred  to  as  Monnet,  is  registered
under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_10">Companies Act</a>, 1956. Monnet is engaged in the business of  mining,
production of steel, ferro-alloys and power. Monnet   decided to set  up  an
integrated steel plant in Hazaribagh District with a proposed investment  of
Rs. 1400 crores. A Memorandum of  Understanding   (MOU)   was  entered  into
between Monnet and  the State Government  on February  5,  2003.   The  main
raw material for the integrated steel plant is  iron  ore.  On  January  29,
2004, Monnet made an application to  State  of  Jharkhand,  referred  to  as
State Government,  for mining lease of iron ore  over  an  area  of  3566.54
hectares in Mauza  Ghatkuri  for the purpose of the proposed steel plant.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.1.        It is the  case  of  Monnet  that  after  consideration  of  the
application and following the necessary  procedure  contemplated  under  the
Mines and Minerals (Development  and  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_11">Regulation)  Act</a>,  1957   (hereinafter
referred to as 'the 1957 Act’) and the 1960 Rules, the State  Government  in
August, 2004 recommended Monnet’s application to  the  Government  of  India
for grant of mining lease of iron ore over an area of 705 hectares in  Mauza
Ghatkuri under  <a href="/doc/1915831/" id="a_12">Section  5(1)</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1009972/" id="a_13">Section  11(5)</a>  of  the  1957  Act.  The
recommendation was made after the State Government was  satisfied  that  the
said mining block was suitable for exploitation and met  the requirement  of
Monnet. The recommendation  was  also  made  on  priority  basis  as  Monnet
fulfilled the essential objectives of the industrial  policy  of  the  State
with commitment for investment and growth of  employment  and social  sector
under its aegis.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.2.        The Ministry  of Mines, Government of India, on receipt  of  the
recommendation of the State Government, sought  for  certain  clarifications
from the State Government vide their communication dated September 6,  2004.
The State Government is said to have responded  to  the  said  communication
and clarified the position in their reply of November 17,  2004.  The  State
Government reiterated the recommendation in favour  of  Monnet  setting  out
the comparative merit of all such proposals.
</p>
<p id="p_11">5.3.        On November 17, 2004,  the  District  Mining  Officer,  Chaibasa
informed the Secretary, Department  of  Mines  and  Geology,  Government  of
Jharkhand that certain portions of Mauza Ghatkuri and  the  adjoining  areas
were reserved for public sector exploitation under   the  two  Notifications
issued by the Government of Bihar on December  21,  1962  and  February  28,
1969. He further suggested that approval of  the  Central  Government  under
Rule 59(2) of the 1960 Rules should be obtained by the State Government  for
grant of leases in this area to avoid complications.
</p>
<p id="p_12">5.4.        The Central Government vide  its  letter  dated  June  15,  2005
informed that a joint meeting of officers of Ministry of  Mines,  Government
of India and concerned officers of the State Government  be held to  clarify
certain issues in connection with the  Ghatkuri Reserve Forest.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.5.         On June 29, 2005, a joint  meeting  of  the  officials  of  the
Central  Government  and  State  Government   on  the  issues  relating   to
proposals for grant of mining leases  in  Ghatkuri   was  held  wherein  the
Secretary of the State  Government is stated to have requested  the  Central
Government to hold on  the processing of the pending applications.
</p>
<p id="p_14">5.6.        On September 13,  2005,  the  State  Government   requested  the
Central Government to return the proposals of mining lease of  nine  out  of
ten applicants, including Monnet.
</p>
<p id="p_15">5.7.        On September 14, 2005, a joint meeting of the officials  of  the
State Government and the Central Government  took  place.  In  that  meeting
also the officials of the State Government informed the  Central  Government
that it has  decided  to  withdraw  nine  pending  mining  lease  proposals,
including that of Monnet.
</p>
<p id="p_16">5.8.         Monnet  has    averred  that   compartment  no.  5  which   was
recommended for allocation to it was not at  all  affected  by  reservation.
Block No. D  (500  acres)  which  is  overlapping  with  compartment  no.  5
(recommended in favour of Monnet) was earlier  lease  area  of  M/s.  Rungta
Sons Pvt. Ltd.  (for short,  ‘Rungta’).   The  said  lease  was  granted  to
Rungta  for twenty  years  upto  September  3,  1995.   Monnet  claims  that
application for renewal was not  submitted  by  Rungta  one  year  prior  to
expiry of their lease and  their lease  automatically expired  on  September
3, 1995. Moreover, only 102.25  hectares  area  has  been  overlapping  with
compartment no. 5  (out  of  the  705  hectares  recommended  by  the  State
Government for Monnet). Monnet has  thus, set up  the  case  that  the  area
recommended by the State Government for grant of mining lease to it was  not
under any previous reservation for any public sector undertaking.
</p>
<p id="p_17">5.9.        On March 6, 2006,  the  Government  of  India  passed  an  order
accepting the request of the State Government dated September 13,  2005  for
withdrawal of the mining proposals made in favour of  applicants,  including
Monnet.

</p>
<p id="p_40">The main issue

</p><p id="p_41">13.         The  foremost point   that arises for consideration  is  whether
the  Notifications  dated  December  21,  1962  (to  be  referred  as   1962
Notification)  and February 28, 1969 (to be referred as  1969  Notification)
issued by the State of Bihar and the Notification  dated  October  27,  2006
(referred to as 2006 Notification) issued by  the  State  of  Jharkhand  are
legal  and valid.    It is a  little  complex  point,  because  it  involves
threading one’s way through statutory provisions contained in 1957  Act  and
1960 Rules.  I shall set them out to the extent  these  are  relevant  after
noticing the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_42">14.         Mr. Ranjit Kumar,  learned  senior  counsel  for  Monnet  ,  did
initially raise the  plea  that  1962  and  1969  Notifications  were  never
published in the official gazette but on production  of  gazette  copies  of
these Notifications by learned senior counsel for the  State  of  Jharkhand,
the plea with regard to the non-publication of these Notifications  was  not
carried further.

Contentions

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_18">18.         Learned senior counsel for the appellants highlighted  different
aspects  while  setting  up  challenge  to   the   1962,   1969   and   2006
Notifications.   Mr.  Ranjit  Kumar,  learned  senior  counsel  for   Monnet
focussed more on factual aspects peculiar to Monnet.  I shall refer  to  the
factual aspects highlighted by Mr. Ranjit Kumar in the  later  part  of  the
judgment.  While assailing validity of 1962, 1969  and  2006  Notifications,
he referred to the provisions of 1957 Act  and  submitted  that  reservation
was part of a regulatory regime.  According to him,  'regulation  of  mines’
means regulatory regime which has been taken over by the Central  Government
and that would include 'reservation’.  He would submit  that  a  proprietary
right should not be mixed up  with  inherent  right  insofar  as  mining  is
concerned.
</blockquote><p id="p_49">19.         Mr. C.A.  Sundaram, learned senior  counsel  for   Ispat  argued
that  the  2006  Notification  was  bad  in  law  for  (1)   1962  and  1969
Notifications were not valid and as such could not be relied  upon  to  give
sanctity to the  2006  Notification;  (2)  2006  Notification  attempted  to
reserve the area for exploitation by  public  sector  undertaking  or  joint
ventures when <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_17">Section 17A</a> of the 1957 Act only allows the  State  Government
to reserve area for public  sector  undertakings  and  non-joint   ventures;
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_18">Section 17A</a> does not envisage a private participation and (3) under  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_19">Section
17A</a> of the 1957 Act, the  prior  approval  of  the  Central  Government  was
needed  before  the  State  could  reserve  any  area  for   public   sector
undertakings and no such prior approval was taken.
</p>
<p id="p_50">20.         Mr. C.A. Sundaram would submit that 1962 and 1969  Notifications
were invalid since <a href="/doc/1488438/" id="a_20">Section 18</a> of the 1957 Act vests  power  of  conservation
and systematic development of minerals with  Central Government;  there  was
statutory prohibition on the State Government to make  law  with  regard  to
conservation and development of minerals in India.  Rule 59 as it  stood  in
1962 and 1969 envisaged  a situation where reservation could  be  made  only
for a temporary purpose or for an emergency  and  it  did  not  empower  the
State to reserve the area for  public  sector  undertaking.  Learned  senior
counsel submitted that power of reservation  by  the  State  Government  for
public sector undertakings was introduced for  the  first  time  by  way  of
amendment to Rule 58 of the 1960 Rules in 1980 and as such no power  existed
prior to 1980 for the State Government to reserve areas  for  public  sector
undertakings.  Alternatively, he submitted  that  even  if   1962  and  1969
Notifications were held to be validly issued with proper  authority  of  law
at that point of time, the fact that Rule  58  was omitted in  1988  without
any saving clause necessarily meant that 1962 and  1969  Notifications  were
no longer valid and could not be relied upon. He argued that  current  power
of reservation contained in <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_21">Section 17A</a> of the 1957 Act is  consistent  with
the erstwhile Rules  58/59 since <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_22">Section 17A</a> expressly  requires  the  prior
approval of the Central  Government  before   State  Government  issues  any
notification for reservation of mining area for public sector undertakings.

was not a good law.
</p>
<p id="p_52">22.         Mr. L. Nageswara Rao and  Dr.  Abhishek  Manu  Singhvi,  learned
senior counsel, appeared   for  Adhunik  and  argued  that   1962  and  1969
Notifications were issued in contravention  of  law  without  the  statutory
prior approval of the Central Government  under   the  1957  Act.  The  2006
Notification was only a reiteration of what was contained in  the  1962  and
1969 Notifications.   2006 Notification is  bad in law and  ultra  vires  of
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_30">Section 17A</a> of the 1957 Act.   It was submitted that  the  State  Government
never adopted  the  1962  and  1969  Notifications  and,   therefore,  these
Notifications had lapsed even if passed with due authority of law.  In  this
regard, the judgment in <a href="/doc/1774319/" id="a_31">Pratik  Sarkar,  M.B.  Suresh  and  Jitendra  Laxman
Thorve v. State of Jharkhand</a>[8] was relied upon.
</p>
<p id="p_53">23.         Mr. G.C. Bharuka, learned senior counsel appeared  for  Abhijeet
and submitted that till July 1963, the State  Government  had  no  power  to
reserve any mineral bearing land for grant of prospecting licence or  mining
lease  to  any  given  class  of  persons,   including  the  public   sector
undertakings. It was submitted that on declaration under <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_32">Section  2</a>  of  the
1957 Act, the State Legislature was  completely  denuded  of  its  power  to
legislate in respect of mines and  minerals  and   consequently,  the  State
Government had ceased to have any Executive power in respect  of  mines  and
minerals though it remained to be owner of the land  and  the  minerals.  In
this regard, learned senior counsel referred to decisions of this  Court  in
M.A. Tulloch &amp; Co.b; <a href="/doc/1247047/" id="a_33">Baijnath Kadioc and Bharat Coking Coal  Ltd.  v.  State
of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.[9]. Mr. Bharuka also  distinguished  the  decision  of  this
Court in Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd and submitted that  though  there  was  no
specific statutory provision of vesting power with the State Government  for
reservation,  but in that case the Court inferred such power  from  Rule  59
of the 1960 Rules.  Rule  59,  as  originally  framed  in   1960,  permitted
reservation only for “any purpose  other  than  prospecting  or  mining  for
minerals”.  Vide Notification dated July 9,  1963,  the  words  “other  than
prospecting  or  mining  for  minerals”  were  deleted  and,  therefore,  on
December 21, 1962 when the Notification was issued by  the  State  of  Bihar
reserving the lands in dispute for exploitation by public sector, it had  no
power to do so. Learned senior counsel  submitted  that  Amritlal  Nathubhai
Shahd  dealt with situation post 1963 amendment  in  Rule 59  and  not  pre-
amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_54">24.         Learned  senior  counsel  submitted  that  the  “reservation  of
mineral bearing areas for exploitation by public sector”  is  covered  under
the declaration made by Parliament under <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_34">Section 2</a> of the 1957 Act  in  view
of List I, Entry 54 of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution  of  India.  The
topic relating to “reservation” is covered within the field  of  “regulating
the grant of mining lease” and that would include the power to grant or  not
to grant mining lease to a particular person.  The “reservation” would  come
within the scope of “regulating the grant of mining  lease”  for  which  the
Central  Government  is  given  the  power  to  make  rules.   The   Central
Government, as a delegate of the Parliament, can frame  rules  with  respect
to “regulating the   grant  of  mining  lease”.  By  placing  reliance  upon
Baijnath Kadioc  and Bharat Coking Coali, it was submitted that whether  the
rules are made or not, the topic is  covered  by  Parliamentary  Legislation
and to that extent the power of State Legislature  ceased   to  exist.  With
reference to Rule 58, it was submitted that  by amendment  brought  in  1960
Rules in 1980,  the  State Governments became competent   to  reserve  areas
for  exploitation  by  Government  or   a  Corporation  established  by  any
Central, State or   <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_35">Provincial  Act</a>  or  a  government  company  within  the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1430621/" id="a_36">Section 617</a> of the Companies Act. The  Central  Government  could
frame the above rule under its rule-making power in   <a href="/doc/1960266/" id="a_37">Section  13</a>  of   1957
Act  only  because  the  topic  of  reservation  was  covered   within   the
declaration under <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_38">Section 2</a> of the 1957 Act and was well  within  the  scope
of “to the extent hereinafter provided”.
</p>
<p id="p_55">25.         In respect of validity of Notification dated  October  27,  2006
issued by the State Government, it was  submitted  that   2006  Notification
seeks to reserve the area for “joint venture” but that  is  not  permissible
under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_39">Section 17A</a> of the 1957 Act. <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_40">Section 17A(2)</a>  mandates  that  the  area
should be reserved “with the approval of the Central Government”  and  there
was  no  approval  granted  to  the  2006   Notification.   Moreover,   2006
Notification by  its  own  words,  is  nothing  but  merely  an  informatory
Notification having no legal significance or consequence.
</p>
<p id="p_56">26.         Dr. Rajiv Dhavan, learned senior counsel  made  his  submissions
on behalf of Jharkhand  Ispat.  He   vehemently  contended   that  the  1962
Notification was wholly illegal and invalid as it was  totally  contrary  to
Rule 59  of   1960  Rules  as  it  then  stood  which  specifically  allowed
reservation for any purpose other than prospecting or mining  for  minerals.
In this connection, he relied upon a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1861743/" id="a_41">Janak Lal  v.
State of Maharashtra and Others</a>[10].
</p>
<p id="p_57">27.         Learned senior counsel referred  to  changes  that  occurred  in
1957 Act and 1960 Rules with effect from February 10,  1987.   He  submitted
that  by virtue of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_42">Section 17A(3)</a> which was  brought   in  1987   the  State
Governments  acquired power of  reservation  for  specific  areas  with  the
approval of the Central Government.   From April 13, 1988 under  Rule  59(2)
of the 1960 Rules, the Central Government could relax the provisions of sub-
rule (1)  in  any  special  case.  According  to   learned  senior  counsel,
reservation under 1969  Notification  was  technically  permissible  because
Rule 59 was  amended  in  1963  by  removing  ‘no  mining  restriction’  but
reservations after 1980 and especially 1988 could be made only  under a  new
statutory regime.
</p>
<p id="p_58">28.         Dr. Rajeev Dhavan also based his argument  on  the  doctrine  of
federalism and submitted  that the State of Bihar  had  no  legal  power  to
reserve the area de hors the 1957  Act.  He  submitted  that  1957  Act  was
wholly occupied field on the subject of mines and minerals and  that   ousts
the state legislative and congruent executive  power  wholly  and  squarely.
In support of his submissions, he referred to the decisions  of  this  Court
in Hingir-Rampur Coal Co.a , <a href="/doc/1100438/" id="a_43">Baijnath Kadioc , State of Assam and others  v.
Om Prakash Mehta</a> and others[11],  <a href="/doc/879535/" id="a_44">State of W.B. v. Kesoram  Industries  Ltd.
and others</a>[12] and <a href="/doc/1220288/" id="a_45">Sandur Manganese  and  Iron  Ores  Limited  v.  State  of
Karnataka and Others</a>[13].
</p>


<p id="p_59">29.         Dr. Rajeev Dhavan submitted that merely  because  State  happens
to be the owner of the land including mines, it does not give  it  power  to
mine or reserve outside the regime of 1957 Act and 1960 Rules. He  submitted
that Amritlal Nathubhai Shah’s cased must be confined to its own facts.  The
decision in Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd was founded  on  the  specific  finding
that the State’s action was consistent with Rule 59; it does  not  test  the
proposition of a conflict between  the  State’s  power  over  land  and  the
Union’s take over of the field of  mines  and  minerals.  Moreover,  learned
senior counsel would submit that Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd   failed  to  take
note of  earlier Constitution Bench decisions of this Court. Learned  senior
counsel also submitted that the decision of this Court in  Kesoraml  has  no
application as the said decision deals with the State’s power to tax.
</p>
<p id="p_60">30.          Mr.  Dhruv  Mehta,   learned   senior   counsel   for   Prakash
submitted that prior to November 16, 1980, there  was  no  power  with   the
State Governments to reserve any area for exploitation by the Government  or
a Corporation established by Central or <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_46">State Act</a> or a  government  company.
It was only by way of amendment to Rule 58 on November  16,  1980  that  for
the first time the State Governments were conferred  power  to  reserve  any
area for exploitation by the Government or a Corporation established by  the
Central, State or <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_47">Provincial Act</a> or a government company. According to  him,
the question for consideration in the present  context  should  be   whether
prior to 1980,  the State had power either  to  ‘prohibit  mining’    or  to
‘reserve mining for public sector undertaking’. In this regard, he  referred
to decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/1992295/" id="a_48">Baijnath Kadioc, D.K.  Trivedi  and  Sons  and
Others v. State of Gujarat</a> and Others[14], <a href="/doc/1233720/" id="a_49">State of Tamil Nadu v. M/s.  Hind
Stone and Others</a>[15] and <a href="/doc/408637/" id="a_50">Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys  Ltd.  v.  Union  of
India  &amp;  Ors</a>[16].  He  submitted  that  in  view  of  the   above,     1962
Notification reserving iron ore area in the State of Bihar for  exploitation
of mineral in public sector was clearly beyond the power of  the  State.  He
submitted  that the State did  not have any inherent power  to  reserve  any
area for mining in view of the declaration made by Parliament under  <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_51">Section
2</a> of the 1957 Act and  in any  case  Rule  59  of  the  1960  Rules,  as  it
originally  stood,  specifically  excluded  reservation   with   regard   to
prospecting or mining of mineral prior to June 9, 1963.
</p>
<p id="p_61">31.         As regards   2006 Notification,  Mr. Mehta  submitted  that  the
said Notification firstly,  was not a fresh exercise of  reservation  as  it
refers  to  reservation  already  made  by  1962  and  1969   Notifications.
Secondly, even if it is assumed that 2006 Notification is a fresh order  for
reservation in exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_52">Section 17A(2)</a> of the  1957  Act,
yet the said Notification suffers  from  diverse  infirmities,  namely,  (a)
there is no approval by the Central Government and (b) being an exercise  of
subordinate legislation, it cannot be given retrospective  effect.  Reliance
was placed by the learned senior counsel on Hukam Chand  etc.  v.  Union  of
India &amp; Ors[17].
</p>
<p id="p_62">Central Government’s Stand

</p><p id="p_63">32.         Mr. Ashok Bhan, learned senior counsel  for the Union  of  India
referred to Entry 54 of the Union List, Entry 23 of the State List,  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_53">Article
246</a> of the Constitution, various Sections of 1957  Act  and  Rules  of  1960
Rules and submitted that Central Government having taken power on to  itself
by enacting  1957  Act,  the  legislative  field  relating  to  ‘minerals  —
regulation and development’ is occupied and the Central Government  was  the
sole regulator.   Mr. Ashok Bhan submitted that under  the  scheme  of  law,
the State Government was denuded of its power other  than  what  flows  from
the 1957 Act.  In   matters  of  regulation  of  mines  and  development  of
minerals, according to   Mr. Ashok Bhan, public interest is paramount.
</p>
<p id="p_64">Reply on behalf of the State Government

</p><p id="p_65">33.         Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior counsel  for the  State  of
Jharkhand, in reply, strongly contested the contentions  of  learned  senior
counsel appearing for the appellants.  He  vehemently  contended   that  the
State  Government  had  the  inherent  power  to  reserve   any   area   for
exploitation as the owner of  the  land  and  minerals  vested  in  it.   He
submitted that the Bihar Legislature  enacted 1950 <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_54">Bihar Act</a> which  received
the assent of the President and came  into  force  on  September  25,  1950.
<a href="/doc/1587602/" id="a_55">Section 4(a)</a> thereof vested all pre-existing estates  or  tenures  including
rights in  mines  and  minerals  absolutely  in  the  State  free  from  all
encumbrances. 1950 <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_56">Bihar Act</a> has been held to be constitutionally  valid  by
a  decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_57">The  State  of  Bihar  v.  Maharajadhiraja  Sir
Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and Ors</a>.[18]. In  any  event,  Mr.  Ajit  Kumar
Sinha, learned senior counsel submitted that 1950 <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_58">Bihar Act</a>   has  been  put
in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution and  was,  therefore,  beyond  the
pale of challenge. Moreover, the sovereign  executive  power  of  the  State
Government under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_59">Article 298</a> of the Constitution to carry on  any  trade  or
business and to acquire, hold  and  dispose  of  property  for  any  purpose
comprehends and includes the power to reserve land for exploitation  of  its
minerals in the public sector. He heavily relied upon the decisions of  this
Court in Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd, Indian  Metals  and  Ferro  Alloys  Ltd.p
and <a href="/doc/133062941/" id="a_60">Bhupatrai Maganlal Joshi and Others v. Union of India and another</a>[19] .
</p>
<p id="p_66">34.         Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, leaned senior counsel submitted  that  the
source of power for  issuance  of  1962,  1969  and  2006  Notifications  is
clearly traceable to  the  relevant  statutory  provisions.  Learned  senior
counsel would submit that source of  1962 and 1969 Notifications  issued  by
the then State  of Bihar was traceable to  Rule 59 of 1960 Rules as it  then
stood followed by amendment in that rule   on  July  9,  1963,  while   2006
Notification is traceable to <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_61">Section 17A(2)</a> of   1957  Act  read  with  Rule
59(1)(e) as inserted with effect from April 13, 1988.
</p>
<p id="p_67">35.         Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha,  learned  senior  counsel  submitted  that
even otherwise there was  no conflict or encroachment by the  State  of  any
occupied  field.  The  State  has  neither  been  divested  nor  barred  nor
prohibited  by  1957 Act or 1960 Rules. Instead,  the unfettered   power  of
reservation vested with the State alone under Rule 59  of  1960  Rules  from
1962 to 1987 and thereafter under <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_62">Section 17A(2)</a>. According  to  him,  after
1987  there  is  a  concurrent  power  of  reservation  both   with    State
Governments  as well as Central Government as provided  in  <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_63">Section  17A</a>  of
the 1957 Act and Rule 59(1)(e) of the 1960 Rules. He relied  upon  decisions
of this Court in  <a href="/doc/1292736/" id="a_64">Lord  Krishna  Textile  Mills  v.  Its  Workmen</a>[20],  <a href="/doc/730804/" id="a_65">Life

</p>
<p id="p_68">36.         Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior  counsel  referred  to  the

that Parliament itself contemplated state legislation for vesting  of  lands
containing mineral deposits in the State Government and  Parliament did  not
intend to trench upon powers of State legislatures under Entry  18  of  List
II. He relied upon the decisions of this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1201636/" id="a_80">State  of  Haryana  and
Another v. Chanan  Mal  and  Others</a>[24],  <a href="/doc/1293816/" id="a_81">Ishwari  Khetan  Sugar  Mills  (P)
Limited &amp; Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others</a>[25]  and  Kesoraml.   He
heavily relied upon the expression employed in Entry 54, ‘to the  extent  to
which such  regulation  and  development  under  the  control  of  Union  is
declared  by  Parliament  by  law’  and  the   expression  ‘to  the   extent
hereinafter provided’ in <a href="/doc/1747588/" id="a_82">Section 2</a> of  1957 Act  and  submitted   that  what
follows from this is that only when there is a bar or a prohibition  in  the
law  declared by the Parliament in  the  1957  Act  and/or  the  Rules  made
thereunder and  if the State encroaches on the field  covered/occupied  then
to that extent, the act or action of the State would  be ultra vires.  Thus,
Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha  would submit that  the  power  or  competence  of  the
state legislatures to enact  laws  or  of  the  State  Government  to  issue
notification remains  unaffected  if  the  field  is  neither  occupied  nor
disclosed nor prohibited. In this regard, he referred to  few  decisions  of
this Court, namely, Hingir-Rampur Coal Co.a, M.A. Tulloch &amp;  Cob.,  Baijnath
Kadioc, India Cement Limitede, Bharat Coking Coali, Orissa  Cement  Limitedf
and Kesoraml .
</p>
<p id="p_69">37.           Learned  senior  counsel  would  submit   that   the   Central
Government also upon examination of the applications made by the  appellants
rejected the proposals on the ground of reservation made by the  then  State
of Bihar under 1962 and 1969 Notifications and, thus,  it  can  be  inferred
that these Notifications received  post  facto  approval  from  the  Central
Government. In this regard, learned senior counsel relied upon  <a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_83">M/s  Motilal
Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. V. State of U.P. &amp; Ors</a>.[26],  <a href="/doc/1799086/" id="a_84">Amrit  Banaspati

</p>
<p id="p_70">38.         Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha,  learned  senior  counsel  submitted  that
1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by the then  State  of  Bihar  have  been
reiterated by the State Government on its formation  by  2006  Notification.
He referred to Section  85  of  the  Bihar  Reorganization  Act,  2000  that
provides that the appropriate government may, before the expiration  of  two
years adapt and/or modify the law and  every  such  law  shall  have  effect
subject  to  the  adaptations  and  modifications  so  made  until  altered,
repealed or amended by a competent legislature. He, thus, submitted that  by
virtue of Section 85 of Bihar Reorganization Act, 2000  read  with  <a href="/doc/1742492/" id="a_86">Sections
84</a> and <a href="/doc/493013/" id="a_87">86</a> thereof, it is clear that the existing law shall have effect  till
it is altered, repealed and/or amended.

<p id="p_71">Interveners’ view

</p><p id="p_72">39.         Mr. Vikas Singh, Mr. Krishnan Venugopal and Mr. P.S.  Narasimha,
learned  senior  counsel,  appeared  for  interveners.  While  adopting  the
arguments advanced  on  behalf  of  State  of  Jharkhand,  Mr.  Vikas  Singh
submitted that reservation of minerals  is  inherent  right  vested  in  the
State. Mr. Krishnan Venugopal, learned senior counsel  heavily  relied  upon
the decision of this Court in Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd  and  submitted  that
the said decision was binding and not per incuriam as  contended  on  behalf
of the appellants. He submitted that many provisions in 1957  Act  and  1960
Rules acknowledge that all minerals vest in the  State  and  that  power  to
reservation is contemplated by Rule 59 of 1960 Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_73">40.         After this group of appeals was fully argued before us  and  the

judgment of Orissa High Court in W.A. © No.  6288/2006  came  up  for  final
disposal wherein one of the issues concerning reservation of mining area  by
the Government of Orissa for exploitation in public sector was found  to  be
involved.  We thought fit that learned senior counsel and counsel  appearing
in that matter were also heard so that we can have benefit  of  their  view-
point as well.  Accordingly, we heard M/s. Harish Salve, K.K. Venugopal  and
R.K. Dwivedi, learned senior counsel, on the common legal aspect.

provides that an application for the grant of a mining lease in  respect  of
land in which the minerals vest in the  Government  shall  be  made  to  the
State Government in Form I.  Sub-rule  (4)  of  Rule  22  provides  that  on

Government shall take decision to grant precise area  and  communicate  such
decision to the applicant. The applicant, on receipt of  communication  from
the State Government of the precise areas to  be  granted,  is  required  to
submit a mining plan within a period of six months or such other  period  as
may be allowed by the State Government, to the Central  Government  for  its
approval. The  applicant  is  required  to  submit  the  mining  plan,  duly
approved by the Central Government or by an officer duly authorized  by  the
Central Government, to the State Government to grant mining lease over  that
area. Sub-rule (4A) of Rule 22 is a non-obstante  clause  and  empowers  the

than the  underground  mines)  in  respect  of  non-metallic  or  industrial
minerals set out in clauses (i) to (xxix) in  their  respective  territorial

<blockquote id="blockquote_107">           “23. The next question which arises is, even if the  cess  is  a
           fee and as such may be relatable to Entries 23 and 66 in List II
           its validity is still open to challenge because the  legislative
           competence of the State Legislature under Entry 23 is subject to
           the  provisions  of  List  I  with  respect  to  regulation  and
           development under the control of the Union; and that takes us to
           Entry 54 in List I. This Entry reads thus: “Regulation of  mines
           and mineral development to the extent to which  such  regulation
           and development under the control of the Union  is  declared  by
           Parliament by law to be expedient in the public  interest”.  The
           effect of  reading  the  two  Entries  together  is  clear.  The
           jurisdiction of the State Legislature under Entry 23 is  subject
           to the limitation imposed by the latter part of the said  Entry.
           If Parliament by  its  law  has  declared  that  regulation  and
           development of mines should in  public  interest  be  under  the
           control of the Union, to the  extent  of  such  declaration  the
           jurisdiction of the State  Legislature  is  excluded.  In  other
           words, if a  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_143">Central  Act</a>  has  been  passed  which  contains  a
           declaration by Parliament as required by Entry 54,  and  if  the
           said declaration covers the field occupied by the  impugned  Act
           the impugned Act would  be  ultra  vires,  not  because  of  any
           repugnance between  the  two  statutes  but  because  the  State
           Legislature had no jurisdiction to pass the law. The  limitation
           imposed by the latter part of Entry 23 is a  limitation  on  the
           legislative competence of the  State  Legislature  itself.  This
           position is not in dispute.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_108">           24. ………… If it is held that this Act  contains  the  declaration
           referred to in Entry 23 there would be no difficulty in  holding
           that the  declaration  covers  the  field  of  conservation  and
           development of minerals, and the said field is indistinguishable
           from the field covered  by  the  impugned  Act.  What  Entry  23
           provides  is  that  the  legislative  competence  of  the  State
           Legislature is subject to the provisions of List I with  respect
           to regulation and development under the control  of  the  Union,
           and Entry 54 in List I requires a declaration by  Parliament  by
           law that regulation and development of mines should be under the
           control of the Union in public interest. Therefore, if a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_144">Central
           Act</a> has been  passed  for  the  purpose  of  providing  for  the
           conservation and development of minerals, and if it contains the
           requisite declaration, then it would not  be  competent  to  the
           State Legislature to pass an Act  in  respect  of  the  subject-
           matter covered by  the  said  declaration.  In  order  that  the
           declaration should be effective it is not necessary  that  rules
           should be  made  or  enforced;  all  that  this  required  is  a
           declaration by Parliament that it is  expedient  in  the  public
           interest to take the regulation and development of  mines  under
           the control of the Union. In  such  a  case  the  test  must  be
           whether the legislative declaration covers  the  field  or  not.
           Judged by this test there can be no doubt that the field covered
           by the impugned Act is covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_145">Central Act</a> LIII of 1948.</blockquote>


<p id="p_120">           25. It still remains to consider whether<a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_146"> S. 2</a> of  the  said  Act
           amounts in law to a declaration by  Parliament  as  required  by
           <a href="/doc/887242/" id="a_147">Article 54.</a> When the said Act was passed in 1948 the legislative
           powers of the  Central  and  the  Provincial  Legislatures  were
           governed by the relevant Entries in the Seventh Schedule to  the
           <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_148">Constitution Act</a> of 1935. Entry 36 in List I corresponds to  the
           present Entry 54 in List I. It reads thus: “Regulation of  Mines
           and Oil Fields and mineral development to the  extent  to  which
           such  regulation  and  development  under  Dominion  control  is
           declared by Dominion law to be expedient in public interest”. It
           would be noticed that the declaration required by Entry 36 is  a
           declaration by Dominion law. Reverting then to<a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_149"> S. 2</a> of the  said
           Act it is clear that  the  declaration  contained  in  the  said
           section is put in the passive voice; but in  the  context  there
           would be no difficulty in holding that the said  declaration  by
           necessary implication has been made by Dominion  law.  It  is  a
           declaration contained  in  a  section  passed  by  the  Dominion
           Legislature and so it is obvious that it is a declaration  by  a
           Dominion law, but the question is: Can  this  declaration  by  a
           Dominion law be  regarded  constitutionally  as  declaration  by
           Parliament which is required by Entry 54 in List I.”






The majority view found that the declaration by  Parliament  required  under
Entry 54, List I was  absent as the declaration under <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_150">Section 2</a> of the  1948
Act by the Dominion Legislature was not held equivalent  to  declaration  by
the Parliament under <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_151">Section 2</a> of the 1957 Act.

concerned with legality of certain demands of fee under  the  Orissa  Mining
Areas Development Fund  Act,  1952  (Orissa  Act).  The  Constitution  Bench
considered the question, ‘whether  the  extent  of  control  and  regulation
provided by the 1957 Act takes within its  fold  the  area  or  the  subject
covered by Act 27 of 1952 Act’.   The High Court had held that  fee  imposed
by the Orissa Act was rendered ineffective in view  of  the  1957  Act.  The
State of Orissa was in appeal from that judgment.  The Court in para  5  and

           Constitution and the scope, purpose and effect of the State  and
           the Central legislations which we have referred to earlier  that
           the decision of the point turns. <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_152">Article 246(1)</a> reads:

           Constitution referred to as the Union List)”


           and we are concerned in the present case with the State power in
           the State field. The relevant clause in that context  is  clause
           (3) of the Article which runs:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_111">           “Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the legislature  of  any  State
           ... has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any  part
           thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II
           in the seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the
           ‘State List').”


           Coming now to the Seventh Schedule, Entry 23 of the  State  List
           vests in the State  legislature  power  to  enact  laws  on  the
           subject of ‘regulation of mines and mineral development  subject
           to the provisions of List  I  with  respect  to  regulation  and
           development under the control of the Union'. It  would  be  seen
           that “subject” to the provisions of List  I  the  power  of  the
           State to enact Legislation, on the topic of “mines  and  mineral
           development” is plenary. The relevant provision in List I is, as
           already noticed, Entry 54 of the Union List. It may be mentioned
           that this  scheme  of  the  distribution  of  legislative  power
           between the Centre and the States is not new  but  is  merely  a
           continuation of the State of affairs which prevailed  under  the
           Government of India Act, 1935 which included a provision on  the
           lines of Entry 54 of the Union List which then bore  the  number
           Item 36 of the Federal List and an entry corresponding to  Entry
           23 in  the  State  List  which  bore  the  same  number  in  the
           Provincial Legislative List. There is no  controversy  that  the
           <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_153">Central Act</a> has been enacted by Parliament in  exercise  of  the
           legislative power contained  in  Entry  54  or  as  regards  the
           <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_154">Central Act</a>  containing  a  declaration  in  terms  of  what  is

           extent hereinafter provided.”


           It does not need much argument to realise that to the extent  to
           which the Union Government had taken under  “its  control”  “the
           regulation and development of minerals” so  much  was  withdrawn
           from the ambit of the power of the State legislature under Entry
           23 and  legislation  of  the  State  which  had  rested  on  the
           existence of power under that entry would to the extent of  that
           “control” be superseded or be rendered ineffective, for here  we
           have a case not of mere repugnancy between the provisions of the
           two enactments but of  a  denudation  or  deprivation  of  State
           legislative  power  by  the  declaration  which  Parliament   is

           by Parliament to be  expedient  in  the  public  interest”.  The
           crucial enquiry has therefore to be directed to  ascertain  this
           “extent” for beyond  it  the  legislative  power  of  the  State
           remains unimpaired. As the legislation by the State  is  in  the
           case before us the earlier one in point of  time,  it  would  be
           logical first to examine and analyse the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_156">State Act</a> and determine

II and the earlier decisions  in  Hingir-Rampur  Coal  Co.  Ltd.a  and  M.A.
Tulloch &amp; Co.b and observed  as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_114">           “13.        ………….Entry 54 of  the  Union  List  speaks  both  of
           Regulation of mines and minerals development  and  Entry  23  is
           subject to Entry 54. It is open to Parliament to declare that it
           is expedient in the public interest that the control should rest
           in Central Government. To what extent such a declaration can  go
           is for Parliament to determine and  this  must  be  commensurate
           with public interest. Once this  declaration  is  made  and  the
           extent laid down, the subject of legislation to the extent  laid
           down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by Parliament.
           Any  legislation  by  the  State  after  such  declaration   and
           trenching upon the  field  disclosed  in  the  declaration  must
           necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted
           from the legislative competence of the State  Legislature.  This
           proposition is also self-evident that  no  attempt  was  rightly
           made to contradict it. There are  also  two  decisions  of  this

           therefore, can be to what extent the declaration  by  Parliament
           leaves any scope for legislation by the  State  Legislature.  If
           the impugned legislation falls within the ambit of such scope it
           will be valid; if outside it, then it must be declared invalid.

<blockquote id="blockquote_115">           14. The declaration is contained in <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_163">Section 2</a> of Act 67 of  1957

           Government the regulation of mines and development  of  minerals
           to the extent provided in the Act itself. We have  thus  not  to
           look outside Act 67 of 1957 to determine what is left within the
           competence of the State Legislature but have to work it out from
           the terms of that Act. In this connection we may notice what was
           decided in the two cases of this Court.  In  the  Hingir  Rampur
           case a question had arisen whether the Act of 1948 so completely
           covered the field of conservation and development of minerals as
           to leave no room for State legislation. It. was  held  that  the
           declaration was effective even if the rules  contemplated  under
           the Act of 1948 had not been made. However, considering  further
           whether a declaration made by a Dominion Law could  be  regarded
           as a declaration made by Parliament for the purpose of Entry 54,
           it was held that it could not and there was thus a lacuna  which
           the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950 could not remove.  Therefore,
           it was held that there was room for  legislation  by  the  State
           Legislature.</blockquote>


<p id="p_126">           15. In the M.A. Tulloch case the firm was working a mining lease
           granted under the Act of 1948. The State Legislature  of  Orissa
           then passed the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund  Act,  1952
           and levied a fee for the development of mining areas within  the
           State. After the provisions came into force a  demand  was  made
           for payment of fees due from July 1957 to  March  1958  and  the
           demand was challenged. The High Court held that after the coming
           into force of Act 67 of 1957 the Orissa Act must be held  to  be
           non existent. It was held on appeal that since Act  67  of  1957
           contained the requisite declaration by Parliament under Entry 54
           and that Act covered the same field as the Act of 1948 in regard
           to mines and mineral development, the ruling in Hingir  Rampur’s
           case applied and as <a href="/doc/469447/" id="a_164">Sections 18(1)</a> and (2) of the Act 67 of 1957
           were  very  wide  they  ruled  out  legislation  by  the   State
           Legislature. Where a superior legislature evinced  an  intention
           to  cover  the  whole  field,  the  enactments  of   the   other
           legislature whether passed before or after must be  held  to  be
           overborne. It was laid down that inconsistency could  be  proved
           not  by  a  detailed  comparison  of  the  provisions   of   the
           conflicting Acts but by the mere  existence  of  two  pieces  of
           legislation. As <a href="/doc/469447/" id="a_165">Section 18(1)</a> covered the  entire  field,  there
           was no scope for the argument that till rules were framed  under
           that Section, room was available.”






Amritlal Nathubhai Shah
</p><p id="p_127">82.         In Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd, a three-Judge Bench of  this  Court
was concerned with an issue similar to the controversy presented before  us.
That was a case relating to grant  of  mining  leases  for  bauxite  in  the
reserved  areas  in  the  State  of  Gujarat.  On  December  31,  1963,  the
Government of Gujarat issued a Notification intimating  that  lands  in  all
talukas of Kutch district and in Kalyanpur taluka of Jamnagar  district  had
been reserved for exploitation of bauxite in the public sector.  By  another
Notification of February 26, 1964 in respect of all areas  of  Jamnagar  and
Junagarh districts, the exploitation of bauxite was reserved in  the  public
sector. The appellants  therein  made  applications  to  the  Government  of
Gujarat for grant of mining  leases  for  bauxite  in  the  reserved  areas.
Though there were no other applications, the State Government  rejected  the
applications of the appellants on the ground that  areas  had  already  been
notified as reserved for the public sector.  The  appellants,  aggrieved  by
the order of the State Government moved the Central Government invoking  its
revisional jurisdiction.   The  Central  Government  rejected  the  revision
applications. The appellants  then  moved  the  High  Court  but  they  were
unsuccessful there and from the common judgment of the High  Court  and  the
certificate granted  by  it,  the  matter  reached  this  Court.  The  Court
considered Entry 54 of List I, declaration made by Parliament in  <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_166">Section  2</a>
of 1957 Act and  State Legislature’s power under Entry 23 of  List  II,  and
observed that in pursuance of its exclusive power to make laws with  respect
to the matters enumerated in Entry 54 of  List  I,  Parliament  specifically
declared in <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_167">Section 2</a> of the 1957 Act that it was expedient  in  the  public
interest that the Union should take under  its  control  the  regulation  of
mines and the development of minerals to the extent  provided  in  the  Act.
The State Legislature’s power under Entry 23 of List  II  was,  thus,  taken
away and the regulation of mines and development of minerals had  to  be  in
accordance with 1957 Act and 1960 Rules. While saying so,  this  Court  held
as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_116">           “3. ………The mines and the minerals in  question  (bauxite)  were,
           however, in the territory of the State of Gujarat  and,  as  was
           stated in the orders which were passed by the Central Government
           on the  revision  applications  of  the  appellants,  the  State
           Government is the “owner of minerals” within its territory,  and
           the minerals “vest” in it. There is nothing in the  Act  or  the
           Rules to detract from this basic fact. That was why the  Central
           Government stated further in  its  revisional  orders  that  the
           State  Government  had  the  “inherent  right  to  reserve   any
           particular area for exploitation in the public  sector”.  It  is
           therefore quite clear  that,  in  the  absence  of  any  law  or
           contract etc. to the contrary, bauxite, as a  mineral,  and  the
           mines thereof, vest in the State of Gujarat and  no  person  has
           any right to exploit it otherwise then in  accordance  with  the
           provisions of the Act and the Rules. <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_168">Section 10</a> of the  Act  and
           Chapters II, III and IV of the Rules, deal  with  the  grant  of
           prospecting licences and mining leases in the land in which  the
           minerals vest in the Government of a State.  That  was  why  the
           appellants made their applications to the State Government.”




</blockquote><p id="p_128">83.         In Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd, this Court referred  to  <a href="/doc/1587602/" id="a_169">Section  4</a>
of the 1957 Act and held that there was nothing in  1957 Act or  1960  Rules
to require that the restrictions imposed by Chapters II,III and  IV  of  the
1960 Rules would be applicable even if  State Government  itself  wanted  to
exploit a mineral for,  it was its own property. The Court held :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_117">           “4.  ………There is therefore no reason why  the  State  Government
           could not, if it so desired, “reserve” any land for itself,  for
           any purpose, and such reserved land would then not be  available
           for the grant of a prospecting licence or a mining lease to  any
           person.”

</blockquote><p id="p_129">84.         The Court then considered <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_170">Section 10</a> of  1957 Act  and  held  as
follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_118">           “5……The section is therefore indicative  of  the  power  of  the
           State Government to take a decision, one way or  the  other,  in
           such matters, and it does not require much argument to hold that
           that power included the power to refuse the grant of  a  licence
           or a lease on the ground that  the  land  in  question  was  not
           available for such grant by reason of its having  been  reserved
           by the State Government for any purpose.”

</blockquote><p id="p_130">85.         With reference to <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_171">Section  17</a>,  particularly,  sub-sections  (2)
and (4) thereof, the Court held that the said provisions did not  cover  the
entire field of the authority of refusing to grant a prospecting licence  or
a mining lease to anyone  else  and  the  State  Government’s  authority  to
reserve any area for itself was not taken away. It was further held :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_119">           “6.  ………As has been stated, the authority to  order  reservation
           flows from the fact that the State is the owner of the mines and
           the minerals within its territory, which vest in it.  But  quite
           apart from that, we find that Rule 59 of the Rules,  which  have
           been made under <a href="/doc/1960266/" id="a_172">Section 13</a> of the Act, clearly contemplates such
           reservation by an order of the State Government………”

</blockquote><p id="p_131">86.         In Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd, the  Court  also  considered  Rules
58, 59 and 60 of the 1960  Rules  and  it  was  observed  that  it  was  not
permissible for any person to apply for a licence or a lease in  respect  of
a reserved area until after it becomes available  for  such  grant.  It  was
held on the facts of the case that the areas under  consideration  had  been
reserved  by  the  State  Government  for  the   purpose   stated   in   its
notifications and as those lands did not become available for the  grant  of
prospecting licence or a mining lease, the State Government was well  within
its rights in rejecting the applications of the appellants under Rule 60  as
premature and the Central Government was also  justified  in  rejecting  the
revision applications which were  filed  against  the  orders  of  rejection
passed by the State Government.

<p id="p_132">87.         In Chanan Malx, a four-Judge Bench of this Court  was  concerned
with constitutional validity of Haryana Minerals (Vesting  of  Rights)  Act,
1973 (for short, ‘Haryana Act;). One of the contentions in  challenging  the
Haryana Act was that enactment  was  beyond  the  competence  of  the  State
Legislature inasmuch as the filed in which  the  Haryana  Act  operated  was
necessarily occupied by the provisions of  1957 Act under Entry  54  of  the
Union List (List I) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The   Bench
considered extensively  the  provisions  contained   in  the  1957  Act  and
earlier decisions of  this  Court  in  Hingir-Rampur  Coal  Co  Ltd.a,  M.A.
Tulloch &amp; Companyb and Baijnath Kadioc . The Court then referred to  <a href="/doc/1951553/" id="a_173">Section
16(1)(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_174">Section 17</a> of the 1957 Act and held as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_120">           “38. We are particularly impressed by the provisions of <a href="/doc/365890/" id="a_175">Sections
           16</a> and <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_176">17</a> as they now stand. A glance at <a href="/doc/1951553/" id="a_177">Section 16(1)(b)</a>  shows
           that the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_178">Central Act</a> 67 of 1957 itself contemplates  vesting  of
           lands, which had belonged to any  proprietor  of  an  estate  or
           tenure holder either on or after October 25, 1949,  in  a  State
           Government under a State enactment providing for the acquisition
           of estates or tenures in  land  or  for  agrarian  reforms.  The
           provision lays down that mining leases granted in such land must
           be brought into conformity with the amended  law  introduced  by
           Act 56 of 1972. It seems to us  that  this  clearly  means  that
           Parliament itself contemplated State legislation for vesting  of
           lands containing mineral deposits in the  State  Government.  It
           only required that rights to mining granted in such land  should
           be regulated by the provisions of Act 67  of  1957  as  amended.</blockquote>
<p id="p_133">           This feature could only be  explained  on  the  assumption  that
           Parliament did  not  intend  to  trench  upon  powers  of  State
           legislatures under Entry 18 of List II, read with  Entry  42  of
           List III. Again, <a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_179">Section 17</a> of the Central Act 67 of 1957  shows
           that there was no intention to interfere with vesting  of  lands
           in the States by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_180">Central Act</a>.”

the power of the State Legislature under Entry 24 of List II  to  enact  any
legislation in respect of declared industry  so  as  to  encroach  upon  the
field of control occupied by IDR Act would be taken away.      It  was  held
that 1957 Act only required that rights  to  mining  granted  in  such  land
should be regulated by the provisions contained therein.

<p id="p_135">M/s. Hind Stone
</p><p id="p_136">89.         In M/s. Hind Stoneo, the question under consideration was  about
the validity of Rule 8-C of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral  Concession  Rules,
1959 which provided for lease for quarries in respect of  black  granite  to
the government corporation  or  by  the  government  itself  and  that  from
December 7, 1977 no lease for quarrying black granite should be  granted  to
private persons. The matter arose out of  the  application  for  renewal  of
lease. The Court considered Entry 23 of List II and Entry 54 of  List  I  of
Seventh Schedule and the earlier decisions of this  Court  in  Hingir-Rampur
Coal Co.a, M.A. Tulloch &amp; Companyb and Baijnath Kadioc. The Court  made  the
following  general  observations  with  regard  to  minerals   and   natural
resources and the scheme of 1957 Act:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_121">           “6.  Rivers,  Forests,  Minerals  and   such   other   resources
           constitute a nation's natural wealth. These resources are not to
           be frittered away and exhausted by  any  one  generation.  Every
           generation owes a duty to all succeeding generations to  develop
           and conserve the natural resources of the  nation  in  the  best
           possible way. It is in the interest of mankind.  It  is  in  the
           interest  of  the  nation.  It  is  recognised  by   Parliament.
           Parliament has declared that  it  is  expedient  in  the  public
           interest that the  Union  should  take  under  its  control  the
           regulation of mines and the  development  of  minerals.  It  has
           enacted the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_184">Development) Act</a>,
           1957. We  have  already  referred  to  its  salient  provisions.
           <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_185">Section 18</a>, we have noticed, casts a special duty on the Central
           Government to take necessary  steps  for  the  conservation  and
           development of minerals in  India.  <a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_186">Section  17</a>  authorises  the
           Central Government itself to  undertake  prospecting  or  mining
           operations in any area not already held  under  any  prospecting
           licence  or  mining  lease.  <a href="/doc/37693258/" id="a_187">Section  4-A</a>  empowers  the   State
           Government on the request of the Central Government, in the case
           of minerals other than minor minerals, to prematurely  terminate
           existing mining leases and grant fresh leases  in  favour  of  a
           Government  company  or  corporation  owned  or  controlled   by
           government, if it is expedient in the interest of regulation  of
           mines and mineral development to do so. In  the  case  of  minor
           minerals, the State Government  is  similarly  empowered,  after
           consultation with the Central Government.  The  public  interest
           which induced Parliament to make the  declaration  contained  in
           <a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_188">Section 2</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_189">Development)
           Act</a>, 1957, has naturally to be the  paramount  consideration  in
           all  matters  concerning  the  regulation  of  mines   and   the
           development  of  minerals.  Parliament's   policy   is   clearly
           discernible  from  the  provisions  of  the  Act.  It   is   the
           conservation and the prudent and discriminating exploitation  of
           minerals,  with  a  view  to  secure  maximum  benefit  to   the
           community. There are clear  signposts  to  lead  and  guide  the
           subordinate legislating authority in the matter of the making of
           rules. Viewed in the light shed by the other provisions  of  the
           Act, particularly <a href="/doc/37693258/" id="a_190">Sections 4-A</a>, <a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_191">17</a> and <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_192">18</a>,  it  cannot  be  said
           that the rule-making authority under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_193">Section 15</a> has exceeded its
           powers in banning leases for quarrying black granite  in  favour
           of private parties and in stipulating that the State  Government
           themselves may engage in quarrying black granite or grant leases
           for quarrying black granite in favour of any corporation  wholly
           owned by the State Government. To view such a rule made  by  the
           subordinate legislating body as a rule made  to  benefit  itself
           merely  because  the  State  Government  happens   to   be   the
           subordinate legislating body, is, but, to take too narrow a view
           of the functions of that body……….”


</blockquote><p id="p_137">90.         The Court then considered Rule 8-C in  light  of  the  statement
made in the counter affidavit filed by the State of Tamil Nadu  and  it  was
held that Rule 8-C was made in bona fide exercise of the rule  making  power
of the State Government. In paragraph 10 of the  Report,  the  Court  stated
thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_122">           “10. One of the arguments pressed before us was that <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_194">Section  15</a>
           of the Mines  and  Minerals  (Regulation  and  <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_195">Development)  Act</a>
           authorised the making of  rules  for  regulating  the  grant  of
           mining leases and not for prohibiting them as Rule 8-C sought to
           do, and, therefore, Rule 8-C was ultra vires <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_196">Section  15</a>.  Well-
           known cases on the subject right from Municipal  Corporation  of
           the City of Toronto v. Virgo [1896 AC 88]  and  Attorney-General
           for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominions [1896 AC  348]

<p id="p_138">           [1979 (3) SCC 229] were brought to  our  attention.  We  do  not
           think that “regulation” has that rigidity of meaning as never to
           take in “prohibition”. Much depends on the context in which  the
           expression is used in the statute and the object  sought  to  be
           achieved by the contemplated  regulation.  It  was  observed  by
           Mathew, J. in <a href="/doc/96170/" id="a_198">G.K. Krishnan v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> [1975 (1) SCC
           375]: “The word  ‘regulation’  has  no  fixed  connotation.  Its
           meaning differs according to the nature of the thing to which it
           is applied.” In modern  statutes  concerned  as  they  are  with
           economic and social activities, “regulation” must, of necessity,
           receive so wide an interpretation that in certain situations, it
           must exclude competition to the public sector from  the  private
           sector. More so in a welfare State. It was pointed  out  by  the
           Privy Council in Commonwealth of Australia v. Bank of New  South
           Wales [1950 AC 235]— and we agree with what was stated therein —
           that  the  problem  whether  an  enactment  was  regulatory   or
           something more or whether  a  restriction  was  direct  or  only
           remote or  only  incidental  involved,  not  so  much  legal  as
           political, social or economic consideration and  that  it  could
           not be laid down that in no circumstances could the exclusion of
           competition so as to create a monopoly, either  in  a  State  or
           Commonwealth agency, be justified. Each case, it was said,  must
           be judged on its own facts and in its own setting  of  time  and
           circumstances and it might be that in regard  to  some  economic
           activities and at some stage of social development,  prohibition
           with a view  to  State  monopoly  was  the  only  practical  and
           reasonable manner of regulation. The statute with which  we  are
           concerned, the Mines and Minerals (Development  and  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_199">Regulation)
           Act</a>, is aimed, as we have already said more than  once,  at  the
           conservation and the prudent and discriminating exploitation  of
           minerals. Surely, in the case of a  scarce  mineral,  to  permit
           exploitation  by  the  State  or  its  agency  and  to  prohibit
           exploitation by private agencies is the most effective method of
           conservation and prudent exploitation. If you want  to  conserve
           for the future, you must prohibit in the  present.  We  have  no
           doubt that the prohibiting of leases in certain cases is part of
           the regulation contemplated by <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_200">Section 15</a> of the Act.”



D.K. Trivedi and Sons

</p><p id="p_139">91.         In D.K. Trivedi and Sonsn, this Court  was  concerned  with  the
constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_201">Section 15(1)</a> of  1957  Act;  the  power  of  the
State Governments to make rules under that Section to enable them to  charge
dead rent and royalty in respect of leases  of  minor  minerals  granted  by
them and  enhance the rates of dead rent and royalty during the  subsistence
of such lease, the validity of  Rule  21-B  of  the  Gujarat  Minor  Mineral
Rules, 1966 and certain notifications issued by the  Government  of  Gujarat
under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_202">Section 15</a> amending the said Rules so  as  to  enhance  the  rates  of
royalty and dead rent in respect of leases  of  minor  minerals.  The  Court
traced the legislative  history  of  the  enactment;  referred  to  Baijnath
Kadioc and in paragraph 27 of the Report (Pgs. 46-47) observed as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_123">           “27. The 1957 Act is made in exercise of the powers conferred by
           Entry 54 in the Union List. The said Entry 54 and  Entry  23  in
           the State List fell to be interpreted by a Constitution Bench of
           this Court in <a href="/doc/1752601/" id="a_203">Baijnath Kedia v. State of  Bihar</a>.  In  that  case
           this Court held that Entry 54 in the Union List speaks  both  of
           regulation of mines and mineral development and Entry 23 in  the
           State List is subject to Entry 54. Under Entry 54 it is open  to
           Parliament to  declare  that  it  is  expedient  in  the  public
           interest that the control in these matters should  vest  in  the
           Central Government. To what extent such a declaration can go  is
           for Parliament to determine and this must be  commensurate  with
           public interest but once such declaration is made and the extent
           of such regulation and development laid down the subject of  the
           legislation to the extent so  laid  down  becomes  an  exclusive
           subject for legislation by Parliament. Any  legislation  by  the
           State after  such  declaration  which  touches  upon  the  field
           disclosed   in   the   declaration    would    necessarily    be
           unconstitutional  because  that  field  is  extracted  from  the
           legislative competence of the State legislature.  In  that  case
           the court further pointed out that  the  expression  “under  the
           control of the Union” occurring in Entry 54 in  the  Union  List
           and Entry 23 in the State List did  not  mean  “control  of  the
           Union Government” because the Union  consists  of  three  limbs,
           namely,  Parliament,  the  Union  Government   and   the   Union
           Judiciary, and the control of the Union which is to be exercised
           under the said two  entries  is  the  one  to  be  exercised  by
           Parliament, namely, the legislative organ of  the  Union,  which
           is, therefore, the control by the Union. The court further  held
           that the Union had taken all  the  power  in  respect  of  minor
           minerals to itself and had authorized the State  Governments  to
           make rules  for  the  regulation  of  leases  and  thus  by  the
           declaration made in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_204">Section 2</a> and the enactment  of  <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_205">Section  15</a>
           the whole of the field relating to minor  minerals  came  within
           the jurisdiction of Parliament and there was no  scope  left  to
           the State  legislatures  to  make  any  enactment  with  respect
           thereto. The court also held that by giving  the  power  to  the
           State Governments to make rules, the control of  the  Union  was
           not negatived but, on the  contrary,  it  established  that  the
           Union was exercising the control. One of the contentions  raised
           in that case was that <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_206">Section 15</a>  was  unconstitutional  as  the
           delegation of legislative power made by it  to  the  rule-making
           authority was  excessive.  This  contention  was,  however,  not
           decided by the court as the appeals in that case were allowed on
           other points.”

While dealing with the meaning of the word  ‘regulation’,  particularly  the
expression, ‘the act of regulating, or the state  of  being  regulated’  and
Entry 54 in the Union List, this Court stated in paragraph 31 of the  Report

<blockquote id="blockquote_124">           “31. Entry 54 in the Union  List  uses  the  word  “regulation”.
           “Regulation”  is  defined  in   the   Shorter   Oxford   English
           Dictionary, 3rd Edn., as meaning “the act of regulating, or  the
           state of being regulated”. Entry 54 reproduces the  language  of
           Entry 36 in the Federal Legislative List in  the  Government  of
           India Act, 1935, with the omission of the words “and oilfields”.
           When the Constitution came to be enacted,  the  framers  of  the
           Constitution knew that since early days mines and minerals  were
           being regulated by rules made by Local  Governments.  They  also
           knew that under  the  corresponding  Entry  36  in  the  Federal
           Legislative List, the 1948 Act had been enacted and was  on  the
           statute book and that the 1948 Act  conferred  wide  rule-making
           power upon the Central  Government  to  regulate  the  grant  of
           mining leases  and  for  the  conservation  and  development  of
           minerals. It also knew that in the exercise of such  rule-making
           power the Central Government had  made  the  Mineral  Concession
           Rules, 1949, and that by Rule 4 of the said Rules the extraction
           of minor minerals was left to be regulated by rules to  be  made
           by  the  Provincial  Governments.  Thus,  the  makers   of   the
           Constitution were not only aware of the legislative  history  of
           the topic of mines and minerals but  were  also  aware  how  the
           Dominion legislature had interpreted Entry  36  in  the  Federal
           Legislative List in enacting the 1948 Act.  When  the  1957  Act
           came  to  be  enacted,  Parliament  knew  that  different  State
           Governments had, in pursuance of the provisions of Rule 4 of the
           Mineral Concession Rules, 1949, made rules  for  regulating  the
           grant of leases in respect of minor minerals and  other  matters
           connected therewith and for this reason it expressly provided in
           sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_207">Section 15</a> of the 1957 Act that the rules  in
           force immediately before the  commencement  of  that  Act  would
           continue in force until superseded  by  rules  made  under  sub-
           section (1) of <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_208">Section 15</a>. Regulating the grant of mining leases
           in respect of minor minerals and other  connected  matters  was,
           therefore, not something which was done for the  first  time  by
           the 1957  Act  but  followed  a  well  recognized  and  accepted
           legislative practice. In fact, even so  far  as  minerals  other
           than minor minerals were  concerned,  what  Parliament  did,  as
           pointed out earlier, was to transfer to  the  1957  Act  certain
           provisions which had until then been dealt with under the  rule-</blockquote>

           scope of subordinate legislation……….”




Then in paragraph 33 of the Report (Pgs. 50-51), the  Court  with  reference
to sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_209">Section 13</a> of the 1957 Act further held:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_126">           “33. ………The opening clause of sub-section  (2)  of  <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_210">Section  13</a>,
           namely, “In particular, and without prejudice to the  generality
           of the foregoing power”, makes it clear that the topics set  out
           in that sub-section are already included in  the  general  power
           conferred  by  sub-section  (1)  but   are   being   listed   to
           particularize  them  and  to  focus  attention  on   them.   The
           particular matters in respect of which  the  Central  Government
           can  make  rules  under  sub-section  (2)  of  <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_211">Section  13</a>  are,
           therefore, also matters with respect to which under  sub-section
           (1) of Section 15 the  State  Governments  can  make  rules  for
           “regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases  or  other
           mineral  concessions  in  respect  of  minor  minerals  and  for
           purposes connected therewith”. When <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_212">Section 14</a> directs that “The
           provisions of <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_213">Sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_214">13</a> (inclusive) shall  not  apply  to
           quarry leases, mining leases or  other  mineral  concessions  in
           respect of minor minerals”, what is intended is that the matters
           contained in those  sections,  so  far  as  they  concern  minor
           minerals, will not be controlled by the Central  Government  but
           by the concerned State Government by exercising its  rule-making
           power as a delegate of the Central Government. <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_215">Sections 4</a> to  <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_216">12</a>
           form a group of sections under the heading “General restrictions
           on undertaking prospecting and mining operations”. The exclusion
           of the application of these sections  to  minor  minerals  means
           that these restrictions will not apply  to  minor  minerals  but
           that it is left to  the  State  Governments  to  prescribe  such
           restrictions as they think  fit  by  rules  made  under  <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_217">Section
           15(1)</a>. The reason for treating minor minerals  differently  from
           minerals other than minor minerals is obvious. As seen from  the
           definition of minor minerals given in clause (e) of  <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_218">Section  3</a>,
           they are minerals which are mostly used in local areas  and  for
           local purposes while minerals  other  than  minor  minerals  are
           those which  are  necessary  for  industrial  development  on  a
           national scale and for the economy of the country. That  is  why
           matters relating to minor minerals have been left by  Parliament
           to the State Governments while  reserving  matters  relating  to
           minerals other than minor minerals to  the  Central  Government.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_127">           <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_219">Sections 13</a>, <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_220">14</a> and <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_221">15</a> fall in the group of  sections  which  is
           headed “Rules for regulating the grant of  prospecting  licences
           and mining  leases”.  These  three  sections  have  to  be  read
           together. In providing that <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_222">Section 13</a> will not apply to  quarry
           leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of
           minor minerals what was done was to take away from  the  Central
           Government the power to make rules in respect of minor  minerals
           and to confer  that  power  by  <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_223">Section  15(1)</a>  upon  the  State
           Governments. The ambit of the power under <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_224">Section 13</a>  and  under
           <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_225">Section 15</a> is, however, the same, the only difference being that
           in one case it is the Central  Government  which  exercises  the
           power in respect of minerals other than minor minerals while  in
           the other case it is  the  State  Governments  which  do  so  in
           respect of minor minerals. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_226">Section  13</a>  which
           is illustrative of the general power conferred by <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_227">Section  13(1)</a>
           contains sufficient guidelines  for  the  State  Governments  to
           follow in framing the rules under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_228">Section 15(1)</a>, and in the same
           way, the State Governments have before them the restrictions and
           other matters provided for in <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_229">Sections 4</a>  to  <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_230">12</a>  while  framing
           their own rules under <a href="/doc/115407457/" id="a_231">Section 15(1)</a>.”

Janak Lal

</blockquote><p id="p_140">92.         In Janak Lalj, this Court had an occasion  to  consider  meaning
and scope of Rule 59 of  1960 Rules. The Court considered  Rule  59,  as  it
stood prior to amendment in 1963, and  the  provision  after  amendment.  In
paragraph 6 of the Report (Pg. 123) the Court held as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_128">           “6. Earlier  the  expression  “reserved  for  any  purpose”  was
           followed by the words “other  than  prospecting  or  mining  for
           minerals”, which were omitted  by  an  amendment  in  1963.  Mr.
           Dholakia, learned counsel  for  the  respondents,  appearing  in
           support of the impugned judgment, has contended that as a result
           of this amendment the expression must now be confined  to  cases
           of prospecting or mining for minerals and all other cases  where
           the earlier reservation was for agricultural, industrial or  any
           other purpose must be excluded from the scope of  the  rule.  We
           are  not  persuaded  to  accept  the  suggested  interpretation.</blockquote>
<p id="p_141">           Earlier  the  only  category  which  was   excluded   from   the
           application of Rule 59 was prospecting or mining leases and  the
           effect of the amendment is  that  by  omitting  this  exception,
           prospecting and mining  leases  are  also  placed  in  the  same
           position as the other cases. We do not see any reason as to  why
           by including in the rule  prospecting  and  mining  leases,  the
           other cases to which it applied earlier would get excluded.  The
           result of the amendment is to extend the rule and not to curtail
           its area of operation.  The  words  “any  purpose”  is  of  wide
           connotation and there is no reason to restrict its meaning.”

The Court clarified that intention of amendment in 1963 was  to  extend  the
rule and not to curtail its area of operation.

<p id="p_142">Bharat Coking Coal

</p><p id="p_143">93.         In the case of Bharat Coking Coal l, the  Court  said  that  the
State Legislature was competent to enact law for  the  regulation  of  mines
and mineral development under Entry 23 of State  List  but  such  power  was
subject to the declaration which  may  be  made  by  Parliament  by  law  as
envisaged by Entry 54 of the Union List. It was  held that  the  legislative
competence of the State Legislature to make law on the topic  of  mines  and
mineral was  subject  to  parliamentary  legislation.   While  dealing  with
<a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_232">Section 18(1)</a> prior to its amendment by amending Act 37 of  1986  and  after
amendment, the Court held in paragraph 16 of the Report (Pg. 572)  as  under
:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_129">           “16. ……..The amended and unamended sections both lay  down  that
           it shall be the duty of the Central Government to take all  such
           steps as may be necessary “for the conservation and  development
           of minerals” in India and for that  purpose  it  may  make  such
           rules as it thinks fit. The expression “for the conservation  of
           minerals” occurring under <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_233">Section 18(1)</a> confers  wide  power  on
           the Central Government to frame any rule which may be  necessary
           for protecting the mineral from loss, and for its  preservation.</blockquote>
<p id="p_144">           The expression ‘conservation’  means  “the  act  of  keeping  or
           protecting from loss or injury”. With reference to  the  natural
           resources, the expression in the context means  preservation  of
           mineral; the wide  scope  of  the  expression  “conservation  of
           minerals” comprehends any rule  reasonably  connected  with  the
           purpose of protecting the loss of coal through the waste of coal
           mine, such a rule may also regulate the discharge of  slurry  or
           collection of coal particles after the water content  of  slurry
           is soaked by soil. In addition to the  general  power  to  frame
           rules for the conservation of mineral,………….”




The  Court further held in para 19 of the Report (Pgs. 575-576) as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_130">           “………No doubt under Entry 23 of List II,  the  State  legislature
           has power to make law but that power is subject to Entry  54  of
           List I with respect to the regulation and development  of  mines
           and minerals. As discussed  earlier  the  State  legislature  is
           denuded of power to make laws on the subject in view of Entry 54
           of List I and the Parliamentary declaration made under <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_234">Section 2</a>
           of the Act. Since State legislature's power  to  make  law  with
           respect to the matter enumerated in Entry 23 of List II has been
           taken  away  by  the  Parliamentary   declaration,   the   State
           Government ceased to have any  executive  power  in  the  matter
           relating  to  regulation  of  mines  and  mineral   development.</blockquote>
<p id="p_145">           Moreover, the proviso to <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_235">Article 162</a> itself contains  limitation
           on the exercise of the executive power of  the  State.  It  lays
           down that in any matter with respect to which the legislature of
           a State and Parliament have power to make  laws,  the  executive
           power of State shall be subject to limitation of  the  executive

Orissa Cement Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_146">94.         A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Orissa Cement Limitedf  was
concerned with the validity of the levy of  a  cess  based  on  the  royalty
derived from mining lands by States of Bihar,  Orissa  and  Madhya  Pradesh.
The case of the petitioners therein was that similar levy  had  been  struck
down by a seven-Judge Bench of this Court in India  Cement  Limitede  .  The
contention of the States, on the other hand, was that  issue  was  different
from the India Cement Limitede  as the nature and character  of  the  levies
imposed by these States was  different  from  Tamil  Nadu  levy.  The  Bench
considered  Entries 52 and 54 of the Union List and Entries 18, 23, 45,  49,
50 and 66 of the State List and also considered earlier  decisions  of  this
Court in HRS Murthy v. Collector of Chittoor[38],  Hingir-Rampur  Coal  Co.a
, M.A. Tulloch &amp; Co.b , Ishwari Khetan Sugar Mills   (P)  Ltd.y  ,  <a href="/doc/1818099/" id="a_236">Baijnath

cite paragraphs 49, 50, 51 and 53 (Pgs. 480-486) of the  Report  which  read
as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_131">           “49.  It is clear from a perusal of the  decisions  referred  to
           above that the answer to the question before  us  depends  on  a
           proper understanding of the scope of M.M.R.D. Act, 1957, and  an
           assessment of  the  encroachment  made  by  the  impugned  State
           legislation into the field covered by  it.  Each  of  the  cases
           referred  to  above  turned  on  such  an  appreciation  of  the
           respective spheres of the two legislations. As  pointed  out  in
           Ishwari Khetan, the mere declaration of a law of Parliament that
           it  is  expedient  for  an  industry  or  the   regulation   and
           development of mines and minerals to be under the control of the
           Union under Entry 52 or entry  54  does  not  denude  the  State
           legislatures of their legislative powers  with  respect  to  the
           fields covered by the several entries in List II  or  List  III.
           Particularly, in the case of a declaration under Entry 54,  this
           legislative power is  eroded  only  to  the  extent  control  is
           assumed by the Union pursuant to such declaration as  spelt  out
           by the legislative enactment which makes  the  declaration.  The
           measure of erosion turns upon the field of the enactment  framed
           in pursuance of the declaration. While the legislation in Hingir-
           Rampur and Tulloch was found to fall  within  the  pale  of  the
           prohibition, those in Chanan Mal,  Ishwari  Khetan  and  Western
           Coalfields were general in  nature  and  traceable  to  specific
           entries in the State List and did not encroach on the  field  of
           the Central enactment except by way of  incidental  impact.  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_238">The
           Central Act</a>, considered in Chanan Mal, seemed  to  envisage  and
           indeed permit State legislation  of  the  nature  in  question.”




           “50.  To turn to the respective spheres of the two  legislations
           we are here concerned with, the Central Act (M.M.R.D. Act, 1957)
           demarcates the sphere of Union control in the  matter  of  mines
           and mineral development. While concerning itself generally  with
           the requirements regarding grants of  licences  and  leases  for
           prospecting and exploitation of minerals,  it  contains  certain
           provisions which are of direct relevance to the issue before us.
           <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_239">Section 9</a>, which deals with the topic of royalties and specifies
           not only the quantum but also the limitations on the enhancement
           thereof, has already been noticed.  <a href="/doc/162241585/" id="a_240">Section  9A</a>  enacts  a  like
           provision in respect of dead rent……..”




           “51.  If one looks at the above provisions  and  bears  in  mind
           that, in assessing the field covered by the Act of Parliament in
           question, one should be guided (as laid  down  in  Hingir-Rampur
           and Tulloch) not merely by the actual provisions of the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_241">Central
           Act</a> or the rules made  thereunder  but  should  also  take  into
           account matters and aspects which can  legitimately  be  brought
           within the scope of  the  said  statute,  the  conclusion  seems
           irresistible, particularly in view of Hingir-Rampur and Tulloch,
           that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_242">State Act</a> has trespassed into the field covered by  the
           <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_243">Central Act</a>. The nature of the incursion made into the fields of
           the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_244">Central Act</a> in the other cases were different.  The  present
           legislation, traceable to the legislative power under  Entry  23
           or Entry 50 of the State  List  which  stands  impaired  by  the
           Parliamentary declaration under Entry 54, can hardly be  equated
           to the law for  land  acquisition  or  municipal  administration
           which were considered in the cases cited and which are traceable
           to different specific entries in List 11 or List III.</blockquote>




<p id="p_147">           “53.        These observations establish on the  one  hand  that
           the distinction sought to be made  between  mineral  development
           and mineral area development is not a real one as the two  types
           of development are inextricably  and  integrally  interconnected
           and, on the other, that, fees of the  nature  we  are  concerned
           with squarely fall within the scope of  the  provisions  of  the
           <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_245">Central Act</a>. The object of <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_246">Section 9</a> of the Central  Act  cannot

Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys Ltd.
</p><p id="p_148">95.         In Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys Ltd.p , a two-Judge  Bench  of
this Court was concerned with the  principal  question  as  to  whether  the
petitioners therein were  entitled  to  obtain  leases  for  the  mining  of
chrome. While dealing with  the  principal  question  and  other  incidental
questions, the Court considered Entry 54 of List I, Entry  23  of  List  II,
the 1957 Act, particularly, <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_250">Sections 2</a>, <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_251">4</a>, <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_252">10</a>, <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_253">11</a>, <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_254">17A</a> and  <a href="/doc/50607108/" id="a_255">19</a>  thereof  and
the 1960 Rules including Rules 58, 59 and 60 thereof.   While  dealing  with
the reservation policy of the State Government in having the  area  reserved
for exploitation in the public sectors, the  Court  observed  in  paragraphs
39 and 40 (Pg. 133) as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_132">           “39.  The principal obstacle in the way of ORIND as well as  the
           other private parties getting any leases was put up by the S.G.,
           OMC  and  IDCOL.  They  claimed  that  none   of   the   private
           applications could at all be considered because the entire  area
           in  all  the  districts  under  consideration  is  reserved  for
           exploitation in the public  sector  by  the  notification  dated
           August 3, 1977 earlier referred to. All the private parties have
           therefore joined hands to fight the case of reservation  claimed
           by the S.G., OMC and IDCOL. We have indicated earlier  that  the
           S.G. expressed its preparedness to accept the Rao report and  to
           this extent waive the claim of reservation.  Interestingly,  the
           OMC and IDCOL have entered  caveat  here  and  claimed  that  as
           public sector corporations they could  claim,  independently  of
           the S.G.'s stand, that the leases should be given only  to  them
           and that the Rao report recommending leases to IMFA,  FACOR  and
           AIKATH should not be accepted by us.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_133">           40. The relevant provisions of the Act and the rules  have  been
           extracted by us earlier. Previously, Rule 58 did not enable  the
           S.G. to reserve any area in the State for  exploitation  in  the
           public sector. The existence and validity of  such  a  power  of
           reservation was upheld in <a href="/doc/196256/" id="a_256">A.Kotiah Naidu v. State of  A.P</a>.  (AIR
           1959 AP 485) and <a href="/doc/490558/" id="a_257">Amritlal Nathubhai Shah v. Union Government  of
           India</a> (AIR 1973 Guj. 117), the latter of which was  approved  by
           this Court in <a href="/doc/620816/" id="a_258">Amritlal Nathubhai Shah v. Union of India</a>  ([1977]
           1 SCR 372). (As pointed out earlier, Rule 58 has been amended in
           1980 to confer such a power on the S.G.).  It  is  also  not  in
           dispute that a notification of reservation was made on August 3,
           1977.  The  S.G.,  OMC  and  IDCOL  are,  therefore,  right   in
           contending that,  ex  facie,  the  areas  in  question  are  not
           available for grant to any person  other  than  the  S.G.  or  a
           public sector  corporation  [rule  59(1),  proviso]  unless  the
           availability for grant is  renotified  in  accordance  with  law
           [rule 59(1)(e) ] or the C.G. decides to relax the provisions  of
           Rule 59(1) [rule 59(2)  ].  None  of  those  contingencies  have
           occurred since except as is indicated later  in  this  judgment.</blockquote>
<p id="p_149">           There is, therefore, no answer to the plea  of  reservation  put
           forward by the S.G., OMC and IDCOL.”



Then in paragraph 45 (Pgs. 136-138), while considering <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_259">Section 17A</a> (1)  that
was inserted in 1957 Act by amendment in 1987, the Court held :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_134">           “45. Our conclusion that the areas in question  before  us  were
           all duly reserved  for  public  sector  exploitation  does  not,
           however, mean that private parties cannot be granted  any  lease
           at all in respect of these areas for, as pointed out earlier, it
           is open to the  C.G.  to  relax  the  reservation  for  recorded
           reasons. Nor does this mean, as contended for by OMC and  IDCOL,
           that they should get the leases asked for by them.  This  is  so
           for two reasons. In the first place, the  reservation  is  of  a
           general nature and does not directly confer any  rights  on  OMC
           and IDCOL. This reservation is of two types. Under  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_260">Section  17A</a>
           (1), inserted in 1986, the C.G. may after  consulting  the  S.G.
           just reserve any area- not covered by a PL or a ML-with  a  view
           to  conserving  any  mineral.  Apparently,  the  idea  of   such
           reservation is that the  minerals  in  this  area  will  not  be
           exploited at all, neither by private parties nor in  the  public
           sector. It is not necessary to  consider  whether  any  area  so
           reserved can be exploited in the public sector  as  we  are  not
           here concerned with the scope of such reservation, there  having
           been no notification Under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_261">Section 17A(1)</a> after 1986  and  after
           consultation with the S.G. The second type  of  reservation  was
           provided for in Rule 58 of the rules  which  have  already  been
           extracted earlier in this judgment. This reservation could  have
           been made by the S.G. (without any necessity for approval by the
           C.G.) and  was  intended  to  reserve  areas  for  exploitation,
           broadly speaking, in the public sector. The notification  itself
           might specify the Government, Corporation or Company that was to
           exploit the areas or may be just general, on the  lines  of  the
           rule itself. Under Rule 59(1), once a notification under Rule 58
           is made, the area so reserved shall not be available  for  grant
           unless the two requirements of Sub-rule (e) are satisfied:  viz.
           an entry in a register and a Gazette notification that the  area
           is available for grant.  It  is  not  quite  clear  whether  the
           notification of March 5, 1974 complied with  these  requirements
           but it is perhaps unnecessary to go into this  question  because
           the reservation of the areas was again notified in  1977.  These
           notifications are general. They only  say  that  the  areas  are
           reserved for exploitation in the  public  sector.  Whether  such
           areas are to be leased out to OMC or IDCOL or some other  public
           sector  corporation  or  a  Government  Company  or  are  to  be
           exploited by the Government itself  is  for  the  Government  to
           determine de hors the statute and the rules. There is nothing in
           either of them which gives a right to OMC  or  IDCOL  to  insist
           that the leases should be given only to them and to no one  else
           in the public sector. If, therefore the claim of reservation  in
           1977 in favour of the public sector is upheld absolutely, and if
           we do not agree with the findings of Rao that  neither  OMC  nor
           IDCOL deserve any grant, all that we can do is to  leave  it  to
           the S.G. to consider  whether  any  portion  of  the  land  thus
           reserved should be given by it to these two corporations.  Here,
           of  course,  there  are   no   competitive   applications   from
           organisations in the public sector controlled either by the S.G.
           or the C.G., but even if there were, it would  be  open  to  the
           S.G. to decide how far the lands or any portion of  them  should
           be exploited by each of such Corporations or by the C.G. or S.G.
           Both the Corporations are admittedly  instrumentalities  of  the
           S.G. and the decision of the S.G. is binding on them. We are  of
           the view that, if the S.G. decides  not  to  grant  a  lease  in
           respect of the reserved area to an instrumentality of the  S.G.,
           that instrumentality has no right to insist that a ML should  be
           granted to it. It is open to the S.G. to exercise at any time, a
           choice  of  the  State  or  any  one  of  the  instrumentalities
           specified in the rule. It is true that if, eventually, the  S.G.
           decides to grant a lease to one or other of them in  respect  of
           such land, the instrumentality whose application is rejected may
           be aggrieved  by  the  choice  of  another  for  the  lease.  In
           particular,   where   there   is    competition    between    an
           instrumentality of the C.G. and  one  of  the  S.G.  or  between
           instrumentalities  of  the  C.G.  inter  se   or   between   the
           instrumentalities of the S.G. inter  se,  a  question  may  well
           arise how far an unsuccessful instrumentality can challenge  the
           choice made by the  S.G.  But  we  need  not  enter  into  these
           controversies here. The question we are concerned with  here  is
           whether OMC or IDCOL can object to  the  grant  to  any  of  the
           private parties on the ground that a reservation has  been  made
           in favour of the public sector. We think the answer must  be  in
           the negative in view of the statutory provisions. For  the  S.G.
           could  always  denotify  the  reservation  and  make  the   area
           available for grant to private parties. Or,  short  of  actually
           dereserving a notified area, persuade  the  C.G.  to  relax  the
           restrictions of Rule  59(1)  in  any  particular  case.  It  is.</blockquote>
<p id="p_150">           therefore, open to the S.G. to  grant  private  leases  even  in
           respect of areas covered by a notification of the S.G. and  this
           cannot be  challenged  by  any  instrumentality  in  the  public
           sector.”



The legal position post amendment in 1957 Act by <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_262">Central Act</a> 37 of 1987  was
explained (para 46; Pgs. 138-139) in the following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_135">           “46.  Before leaving this  point,  we  may  only  refer  to  the
           position after 1986. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_263">Central Act</a> 37 of 1986 inserted Sub-section
           (2) which empowers the State Government  to  reserve  areas  for
           exploitation in the public sector. This provision  differs  from
           that in Rule 58 in some important respects-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_136">           (i) the reservation requires the approval of the C.G.;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_137">           (ii) the reservation can only be  of  areas  not  actually  held
           under a PL or ML;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_138">           (iii)  the  reservation  can  only  be  for  exploitation  by  a
           Government company or a  public  sector  corporation  (owned  or
           controlled by the S.G. or C.G.) but not for exploitation by  the
           Government as such.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_139">           Obviously, <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_264">Section 17A(2)</a> and rule 58 could not  stand  together
           as <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_265">Section 17A</a> empowers  the  S.G,  to  reserve  only  with  the
           approval  of  the  C.G.  while  Rule  58   contained   no   such
           restriction.  There  was  also  a  slight  difference  in  their
           wording. Perhaps because of this Rule 58 has been omitted by  an
           amendment of 1988 (G.S.R. 449E  of  1988)  made  effective  from
           April 13, 1988. Rule 59, however, contemplates a  relaxation  of
           the reservation only  by  the  C.G.  By  an  amendment  of  1987
           effective on February 10, 1987, (G.S.R. 86-E of  87)  the  words
           "reserved by the State  Government"  were  substituted  for  the
           words "reserved by the Government" in Rule 59(1)(e). Later, Rule
           59(1) has been amended by the insertion of the words  "or  Under
           <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_266">Section 17-A</a> of the Act" after the  words  "under  Rule  58"  in
           Clause (e) as well as in the second proviso. The result  appears
           to be this:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_140">           (i) After March 13, 1988, certainly, the S.G. cannot notify  any
           reservations without the approval of the C.G., as  Rule  58  has
           been deleted. Presumably, the position is the same  even  before
           this date and as soon as Act 37 of 1986 came into force.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_141">           (ii) However, it is open to the S.G. to denotify  a  reservation

           dereservation of an area reserved by the  S.G.  after  the  1986
           amendment can be done only with the approval of the C.G. for  it
           would be anomalous to hold that a reservation by the S.G.  needs
           the C.G.'s approval but not the  dereservation.  Anyhow,  it  is
           clear that relaxation  in  respect  of  reserved  areas  can  be
           permitted only by the C.G.</blockquote>


<p id="p_151">           (iii)  It is only the C.G. that can make a  reservation  with  a

<p id="p_158">           63.   As discussed earlier, <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_283">Section  11(4)</a>  is  consistent  with
           Rules 59 and 60 when  it  provides  for  consideration  only  of

           the  consideration   of   applications   made   prior   to   the
           Notification, as required by the first proviso to <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_284">Section 11(2)</a>,
           is  clearly  inconsistent  with  Rules  59  and  60.   In   such
           circumstances, a harmonious reading of <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_285">Section 11</a> with Rules  59
           and  60,  therefore,  mandates  an  interpretation  under  which
           Notifications would be issued under <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_286">Section 11(4)</a> in the case of
           categories  of  areas  covered   by   Rule   59(1).   In   these
           circumstances, we are unable  to  accept  the  argument  of  the
           learned senior counsel for Jindal and Kalyani with reference  to
           those provisions.”








Paragraph 7  of Amritlal Nathubhai  Shahd  was considered  in  paragraph  65
of  the  Report   and  then   in   paragraph   66  (Pg.  32),   the    Bench
observed
 as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_144">           “66.- Even thereafter, this Court  has  consistently  taken  the
           position that applications made prior to a  Notification  cannot
           be entertained. In our view, the purpose of Rule 59(1), which is
           to ensure that mining lease areas are not  given  by  the  State
           Governments to favour persons of their choice without notice  to
           the general public would  be  defeated.  In  fact,  the  learned

           205 at page 218, where it has been held in the  context  of  the

           while subordinate to the parent  statute,  is  otherwise  to  be
           treated as part of  the  statute  and  is  effective.  The  same

<blockquote id="blockquote_145">           “80.  It is clear that the State Government is purely a delegate

           <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_292">Section 11(3)</a> of the Act, hence it cannot act in a  manner  that
           is inconsistent with the provisions of <a href="/doc/916778/" id="a_293">Section 11(1)</a> of the MMDR

           Act clearly states that the regulation  of  mines   and  mineral
           development   comes   within   the  purview    of    the   Union
           Government and not the State Government. As a  matter  of  fact,

Whether 1962 and 1969 Notifications are ultra vires?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_159">100.        Now, in light of the above, I have to consider whether 1962  and
1969 Notifications issued by the Government  of  erstwhile  State  of  Bihar
notifying for the information of public that iron ore in  the  subject  area
was reserved for exploitation in the public sector are ultra  vires  and  de
hors 1957 Act and 1960 Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_160">Constitutional  philosophy  about  law  making  in  relation  to  mines  and
minerals

</p><p id="p_161">101.        Entry 36 in List I (Federal  List)  and  Entry  23  in  List  II
(Provincial List) in the Seventh Schedule of Government of India  Act,  1935
correspond to Entry 54 in List I (Union  List)  and  Entry  23  in  List  II
(State List) in our Constitution. It is interesting  to  note  that  in  the
course of debate in respect of the above entries in the Government of  India
Bill, the Solicitor  General  in  the  House  of  Commons  stated  that  the
rationale of including only the ‘regulation of mines’  and  ‘development  of
minerals’ and that too only to the extent it  was  considered  expedient  in
the public interest by a Federal law was to ensure that the  Provinces  were
not completely cut-out from the law relating to mines and  minerals  and  if
there was inaction at the Centre, then the Provinces could  make  their  own
laws. Thus, powers in relation to mines and minerals were accorded  to  both
the  Centre  and  States.  The  same  philosophy   is   reflected   in   our
Constitution.  The management of the mineral resources has  been  left  with
both the Central Government and State Governments in terms of  Entry  54  in
List I and Entry 23 in List II.  In the  scheme  of  our  Constitution,  the
State Legislatures enjoy power to enact legislation on the topics of  ‘mines
and mineral development’. The only fetter imposed on the State  Legislatures
under Entry 23 is by the latter part of the said entry which  says  ‘subject
to the provisions of List I with  respect  to   regulation  and  development
under the control of the Union’. In other  words,  State  Legislature  loses
its jurisdiction to the extent to which  Union  Government  had  taken  over
control, the regulation of mines and development of minerals  as  manifested
by legislation incorporating the declaration and no more.  If Parliament  by
its law has declared that regulation of mines  and development  of  minerals
should in the public interest be under the control of Union,  which  it  did
by making declaration in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_298">Section 2</a> of the 1957 Act, to the  extent  of  such
legislation  incorporating  the  declaration,  the  power   of   the   State
Legislature is excluded.   The  requisite  declaration  has  the  effect  of
taking out regulation of mines and development of minerals  from  Entry  23,
List II to that extent.  It needs no  elaboration  that  to  the  extent  to
which the Central Government had taken under ‘its control’  ‘the  regulation
of mines and development of minerals’ under 1957 Act, the  States  had  lost
their legislative competence.  By the presence of expression ‘to the  extent
hereinafter provided’ in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_299">Section 2</a>, the Union has  assumed  control  to  the
extent provided in 1957 Act.  1957 Act prescribes the extent of control  and
specifies it.  We must bear in mind that as the declaration made in  <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_300">Section
2</a> trenches upon  the  State  Legislative  power,  it  has  to  be  construed
strictly.    Any  legislation  by  the   State   after   such   declaration,
trespassing the field occupied in the  declaration  cannot  constitutionally
stand. To find  out  what  is  left  within  the  competence  of  the  State
Legislature on the declaration having been made in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_301">Section  2</a>  of  the  1957
Act, one does not have to look outside the provisions of 1957 Act   but   as
observed in Baijnath Kadioc , ‘have to work it out from the  terms  of  that
Act’. In order that  the  declaration  made  by  the  Parliament  should  be
effective, the making of rules or  enforcement  of  rules  so  made  is  not
decisive.
</p><p id="p_162">102.        The declaration made by Parliament in  <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_302">Section  2</a>  of  1957  Act
states that it is expedient in the public interest  that  the  Union  should
take under its control the  regulation  of  mines  and  the  development  of
minerals to the extent provided in the Act itself. Legal regime relating  to
regulation of mines and development of minerals is thus guided by  the  1957
Act  and  1960  Rules.   Whether  reservation  made   by   1962   and   1969
Notifications is in any manner contrary or inconsistent with  1957  Act?  In
my view not at all. Whether the  impugned  Notifications  impinge  upon  the
legislative power of the Central  Government?  My  answer  is  in  negative.
Whether the Government of erstwhile State of Bihar did not  have  the  power
to make reservation which it did by 1962 and 1969  Notifications?   I  think
there was no lack of power in the  State   in  making  such  reservation.  I
indicate the reasons therefor.
</p>
<p id="p_163">Management of minerals : general observations
</p><p id="p_164">103.        First, few general observations.  Minerals  –  like  rivers  and
forests – are a valuable natural resource. Minerals constitute our  national
wealth and are vital raw-material  for  infrastructure,  capital  goods  and
basic   industries.   The   conservation,   preservation   and   intelligent
utilization of minerals are not only need of  the  day  but  are  also  very
important in the interest of mankind and succeeding generations.  Management
of minerals should be in a way that helps in country’s economic  development
and which also leaves for future generations to  conserve  and  develop  the
natural resources of the nation in  the  best  possible  way.    For  proper
development of economy and industry, the exploitation of  natural  resources
cannot be permitted indiscriminately; rather nation’s natural wealth has  to
be used judiciously so that it may not be exhausted within a few years.
</p>
<p id="p_165">No fundamental right in mining
</p><p id="p_166">104.        The  appellants  have  applied  for  mining  leases  in  a  land
belonging to Government of Jharkhand (erstwhile Bihar) and it is  for  iron-
ore which is a mineral included in the First Schedule to  the  1957  Act  in
respect of which no mining lease can be granted  without the prior  approval
of the Central Government. It goes without saying that no person  can  claim
any right in any land belonging to Government or in any mines  in  any  land
belonging to Government except under 1957 Act and 1960 Rules. No person  has
any fundamental right to claim that he should be  granted  mining  lease  or
prospecting licence  or  permitted  reconnaissance  operation  in  any  land
belonging to the Government.  It is apt to quote  the  following   statement
of O. Chinnappa Reddy, J. in M/s. Hind Stoneo , albeit  in  the  context  of
minor mineral, ‘The public interest which induced  Parliament  to  make  the
declaration contained in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_303">Section 2</a>……. has  naturally  to  be  the  paramount
consideration in all matters concerning the  regulation  of  mines  and  the
development of minerals’. He went on to say, ‘The statute with which we  are
concerned, the Mines and  Minerals  (Development  and  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_304">Regulation)  Act</a>,  is
aimed  ………..at  the  conservation  and  the   prudent   and   discriminating
exploitation of minerals. Surely, in  the  case  of  a  scarce  mineral,  to
permit exploitation by the State or its agency and to prohibit  exploitation
by private agencies  is  the  most  effective  method  of  conservation  and
prudent exploitation. If you want to  conserve  for  the  future,  you  must
prohibit in the present.’

State Government’s ownership in mines and minerals within its territory  and
the power of reservation

</p><p id="p_167">105.        It is not in dispute that all rights and  interests,   including
rights in mines and minerals in the subject area,  had vested absolutely  in
the  erstwhile  State  of  Bihar  free  from  all  encumbrances.    At   the
commencement of Constitution, the erstwhile State  of  Bihar  was  a  Part-A
State specified in the First Schedule of the Constitution and prior  thereto
the Province of Bihar.  By virtue of <a href="/doc/1254651/" id="a_305">Article 294</a>, all properties and  assets
which were vested in His Majesty for  the  purposes  of  the  Government  of
Province of Bihar stood vested in the  corresponding  State  of  Bihar.   By
1950 <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_306">Bihar Act</a>, all other lands i.e., estates and tenures of whatever  kind,
including the mines and minerals therein,  stood  vested  in  the  State  of
Bihar.   Thus,  all lands and minerals on  or  under  land  situate  in  the
erstwhile State of Bihar came to vest in it.  Thereafter  with  effect  from
November 15, 2000, the State of Jharkhand was carved out  of  the  State  of
Bihar pursuant to the Bihar Re-Organisation Act,  2000.    Accordingly,  all
lands, inter alia, belonging to the  then State of  Bihar  and  situated  in
the  transferred  territories  of  Singhbhum  (East)  and  Singhbhum  (West)
Districts, passed to the newly created State  of  Jharkhand.   The  admitted
position is that the State Government (erstwhile Bihar  and  now  Jharkhand)
is the owner of the subject area. Mines and minerals  within  its  territory
vest in it absolutely. As a matter of fact it is because  of  this  position
that the appellants made their application for grant of mining lease to  the
State  Government.  The  question  now  is,  the  regulation  of  mines  and
development of minerals having been taken under its control by  the  Central
Government, whether the provisions contained in 1957 Act or 1960 Rules  come
in the way of the State  Government  to  reserve  any  particular  area  for
exploitation in the public sector.
</p><p id="p_168">106.        The  legislation  on  the  subject  of  mines  and  minerals  as
contained in 1957 Act and 1960 Rules has  been  extensively  quoted  in  the
earlier part of the judgment. Suffice it to say that <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_307">Section 4</a> is a  pivotal
provision around which the  legal framework for the regulation of mines  and
development of minerals as laid down in 1957 Act revolves.
</p><p id="p_169">107.         The character of the impugned Notifications making  reservation
of the area set out therein for exploitation of iron ore  in  public  sector
has to be judged in light of the provisions in 1957 Act and 1960 Rules.  The
object and effect of declaration made by Parliament in  <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_308">Section  2</a>  and  the
provisions that follow <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_309">Section 2</a> in 1957 Act, which  have  been  extensively
referred to above, even remotely do not suggest that the Government  of  the
erstwhile State of Bihar lacked authority or competence to make  reservation
of subject mining areas within its territory  relating  to  iron  ore  which
vested in it for public sector undertaking by 1962 and  1969  Notifications.
Whatever way it is seen, whether ‘reservation’ topic  was  covered  by  1957
Act when 1962 and 1969 Notifications were issued and published by the  State
Government or whether the provisions of 1957 Act,  as  were  then  existing,
enabled the State Government to reserve the subject area  for  its  own  use
through the agency in public sector, I am of  the  opinion  that  since  the
State Government’s  paramount right over the iron ore  being  the  owner  of
the mines did not get affected by 1957  Act,  the  power  existed  with  the
State Government to reserve subject areas  of  mining  for  exploitation  in
public sector undertaking. It was, however, argued  that  by  1957  Act  the
State’s ownership rights insofar as ‘development of minerals’ was  concerned
stood frozen. ‘Development’ includes exploitation of mineral  resources  and
to allow to exploit or not to allow to exploit is all covered  by  1957  Act
and by  <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_310">Section  4</a>  the  right  of  the  State  Government  with  regard  to
development of minerals was taken away and the State  Government  ceased  to
have any inherent right of reservation.
</p><p id="p_170">108.        I do not agree.  In the first place,  the  declaration  made  by
Parliament in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_311">Section 2</a> and the provisions that follow <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_312">Section  2</a>   in  1957
Act have left untouched the State’s ownership of mines and  minerals  within
its territory although the  regulation  of  mines  and  the  development  of
minerals have been taken under the control of the Union.   <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_313">Section  4</a>  deals
with activities in relation to land and does not extend  to  extinguish  the
State’s right of  ownership in such land. <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_314">Section 4</a> regulates the  right  to
transfer but does not divest ownership of minerals in a State and  does  not
preclude the State Government from exploiting  its  minerals.  <a href="/doc/71471946/" id="a_315">Section  4(1)</a>
can have no application  where  the  State  Government  wants  to  undertake
itself mining operations in the  area  owned  by  it.  On  consideration  of
<a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_316">Section 5</a>, I am of the view that the same conclusion must follow. <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_317">Section  5</a>
or for that matter <a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_318">Sections  6</a>, <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_319">9</a>, <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_320">10</a>, <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_321">11</a> and  <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_322">13(2)(a)</a>  also  do  not  take
away the State’s ownership  rights in the  mines  and  minerals  within  its
territory. The power to legislate for regulation of  mines  and  development
of  minerals under the control of the Union may definitely  imply  power  to
acquire mines and minerals in the  larger  public  interest  by  appropriate
legislation, but by 1957 Act that has not been done.  There  is  nothing  in
1957 Act to suggest even remotely – and there is  no  express  provision  at
all – that the mines and minerals  that  vested  in  the  States  have  been
acquired.  Rather, the scheme and provisions of  1957  Act  themselves  show
that Parliament itself contemplated State legislation for vesting  of  lands
containing mineral deposits in the State Government and that Parliament  did
not intend to trench upon powers of State Legislatures under Entry 18,  List
II.  As noted above, the declaration made by  Parliament  in  <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_323">Section  2</a>  of
1957 Act states that it is expedient in the public interest that  the  Union
should take under its control the regulation of mines  and   development  of
minerals to the extent provided in the Act itself. The declaration  made  in
<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_324">Section 2</a> is, thus, not all comprehensive.
</p><p id="p_171">109.        The regulation of mines and development  of  minerals  has  been
taken over under its control by the Central Government to the extent  it  is
manifested in 1957 Act which does not contemplate acquisition of  mines  and
minerals.  By the presence of keynote expression ‘to the extent  hereinafter
provided’ in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_325">Section  2</a>,  the  Union  has  assumed  control  to  the  extent
specified in the provisions following <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_326">Section 2</a>.  In my view,  although  the
word `regulation’ must in the context receive wide interpretation,  but  the
extent of control by  Union as specified in 1957 Act  has  to  be  construed
strictly.  The decisions of this Court in  M.A.  Tulloch  &amp;  Co.b,  Baijnath
Kadioc, Bharat Coking Coali  and few other decisions where  this  Court  has
held with reference to declaration made by Parliament in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_327">Section 2</a>  of  1957
Act and the provisions of that Act that the whole of the  legislative  field
was covered were  in  the  context  of  specific  State  legislations  under
consideration. In the  context  of  subject  State  legislation,  the  whole
legislative field was found to be occupied by the Central law. The  same  is
the position in the case of Hingir-Rampur  Coal  Co.a  where  whole  of  the
legislative field relating to ‘minerals’ was found  to  be  covered  by  the
declaration made in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_328">Section 2</a> of the 1948 Act in the context  of  the  State
legislation  under  consideration.  In  Hingir-Rampur   Coal   Co.a    while
examining  the  constitutional  validity  of   the   Orissa   Mining   Areas
Development Fund Act, 1952 this Court  held that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_329">State Act</a>  was  covered
by the 1948 Act. In M.A. Tulloch &amp; Companyb , this Court was concerned  with
the same Orissa Act which was  under  consideration  in  Hingir-Rampur  Coal
Co.a  and in light of <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_330">Section  18(1)</a>  of  the  1957  Act  which  was   under
consideration it was held that the intention of Parliament was to cover  the
entire field.  In  Baijnath  Kadioc,  this  Court  was  concerned  with  the
constitutional validity of proviso (2) to <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_331">Section 10(2)</a> added by Bihar  Land
Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1964. While examining the  constitutional  validity
of the above provision, the Constitution Bench of this Court  analysed  1957
Act. In light of  Entry   54  in  List  I  and  Entry  23  in  List  II  the
observation  that  whole  of  the  legislative  field  was  covered  by  the
Parliamentary declaration read with 1957  Act  was  with  reference  to  the
State legislations under consideration and  the  whole  of  the  legislative
field was found to be occupied by 1957 Act. Similar observations in  various
other decisions by this Court  were made in the context of the  topic  under
consideration.
</p><p id="p_172">110.        I am supported in my view by a  three-Judge  Bench  decision  of
this Court in Orissa Cement Limitedf wherein it  was  emphatically  asserted
that in the case of a declaration under Entry 54, the legislative  power  of
the State Legislatures is eroded only to the extent control  is  assumed  by
the Union pursuant to such declaration  as  spelt  out  by  the  legislative
enactment which makes the declaration.  The three-Judge   Bench  on  careful
consideration said,  ‘The measure of erosion turns upon  the  field  of  the
enactment framed in pursuance of the declaration.  While the legislation  in
Hingir-Rampur Coal Co.a  and M.A.Tulloch &amp; Co.b  was found  to  fall  within
the pale of the prohibition,  those in Chanan  Malx,  Ishwari  Khetan  Sugar
Millsy  and  Western  Coalfields  Limitedoo  were  general  in  nature   and
traceable to specific entries in the State List and did not encroach on  the
field of the Central enactment except by way of incidental impact’.
</p><p id="p_173">111.        Secondly, after enactment  of  1957  Act  and  1960  Rules  made
thereunder,  the Central Government has all throughout understood  that  the
State Governments as owner of mines  and  minerals  within  their  territory
have inherent right to reserve any particular area for exploitation  in  the
public sector. This position is reflected from  the  order  of  the  Central
Government that was passed by it and which was under challenge in   Amritlal
Nathubhai Shahd. In its order the  Central  Government  had  stated,  ‘….The
State Government had the inherent right to reserve any particular  area  for
exploitation in the public sector. Mineral vest in them and they are  owners
of minerals…….and  Central  Government  are  in  agreement  with  the  State
Government in so far as the reservation of areas is concerned…..”
</p><p id="p_174">112.        The above position held  by  the  Central  Government  has  been
approved by  this  Court  in  Amritlal  Nathubhai  Shahd.   I  have  already
referred to the facts in the case of  Amritlal  Nathubhai  Shahd    and  the
issue involved therein – an issue  similar  to  the  controversy   presented
before  us  – in earlier part  of  this  judgment.   In  Amritlal  Nathubhai
Shahd,  the Court referred to <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_332">Section 4</a> of 1957 Act and  it  was  held  that
there was nothing in 1957 Act or 1960 Rules to conclude as to why the  State
Government could not , if it so desired, ‘reserve’ any land for itself,  for
any purpose, and such reserved land would then  not  be  available  for  the
grant of a prospecting licence or a mining lease to any person.   The  Court
then pointed out, ‘the authority to order reservation flows  from  the  fact
that the State is the owner  of  the  mines  and  the  minerals  within  its
territory’. It was also held that quite apart from that,  Rule  59  of  1960
Rules clearly contemplated reservation by an order of the State  Government.
The above legal position has been reiterated by this Court in Indian  Metals
and Ferro Alloys Ltd.p .
</p>
<p id="p_175">Whether Amritlal Nathubhai Shah is not a binding precedent

</p><p id="p_176">113.        Learned senior counsel for the appellants,  however,  vehemently
contended that  Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd  is not a binding  precedent  being
per incuriam inasmuch as earlier judgments  of  this  Court  have  not  been
considered and applied. It was argued that decision  in  Amritlal  Nathubhai
Shahd   was limited to its own facts and that decision did   not  deal  with
reservation prior to amendment in Rule 59. In that case Notification was  of
December 31, 1963 whereunder lands in particular  areas  had  been  reserved
for exploitation of bauxite in the public sector.   At that time Rule 59  of
1960 Rules had been amended and, moreover, that was a case  of  exploitation
of mineral by the State itself and in case of  exploitation  other  than  by
State it could  only be done in accord with the 1957 Act and 1960 Rules.
</p><p id="p_177">114.        I am afraid that  the  distinguishing  features  highlighted  by
learned senior counsel for the appellants are not  substantial  and  do  not
persuade me not to follow Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd.  The  judgment  of  this
Court in Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd establishes the  distinction  between  the
power of reservation to exploit a mineral as its own  property  on  the  one
hand and the regulation of mines and mineral development under the 1957  Act
and the 1960 Rules on the other. The authority of the  State  Government  to
make reservation of a particular mining area within its  territory  for  its
own use is the offspring of  ownership;  and  it  is  inseparable  therefrom
unless denied to it expressly by an appropriate law. By 1957  Act  that  has
not been done by Parliament.  Setting aside by a State of land owned  by  it
for its exclusive use and under its dominance and control, in  my  view,  is
an incident of sovereignty  and  ownership.   There  is  no  incongruity  or
inconsistency in the  decisions of this Court in  Hingir-Rampur  Coal  Co.a,
M.A. Tulloch &amp; Co.b, Baijnath Kadioc and  Amritlal  Nathubhai  Shahd  .  The
Bench  in  Amritlal  Nathubhai  Shahd   was  alive  to  the  legal  position
highlighted by this Court in Hingir-Rampur Coal Co.a, M.A.  Tulloch  &amp;  Co.b
and Baijnath Kadioc although it did not expressly refer to these  decisions.
This is apparent from the observations made in para 3 wherein  it  has  been
stated that in pursuance of its exclusive power to make  laws  with  respect
to the matters enumerated in Entry 54 of List I  in  the  Seventh  Schedule,
Parliament specifically declared in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_333">Section 2</a> of the 1957 Act  that  it  was
expedient in the public interest  that  the  Union  should  take  under  its
control, regulation of mines and the development of minerals to  the  extent
provided therein. The Bench noticed that  State  Legislature’s  power  under
Entry 23 of List II was, thus, taken  away  and   regulation  of  mines  and
mineral development had therefore to be in accordance with the 1957 Act  and
1960 Rules. The legal position exposited  in  Amritlal  Nathubhai  Shahd  is
that even though the field of  legislation  with  regard  to  regulation  of
mines and development of minerals  has been covered by  the  declaration  of
the Parliament in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_334">Section 2</a> of the 1957 Act, but that can  not  justify  the
inference that the State Government has  lost  its  right  to  the  minerals
which vest in it as a property within its territory and hence no person  has
a right to exploit the mines other than in accordance  with  the  provisions
of the 1957 Act and the 1960 Rules. The authority of  the  State  Government
to order reservation flows from the fact that it is the owner of  the  mines
and the minerals within its territory. Such authority is also  traceable  to
Rule 59 of 1960 Rules.
</p><p id="p_178">115.        Yet another  considerable point was  made  that  1962  and  1969
Notifications are not relatable to statutory provisions  contained  in  1957
Act and 1960 Rules. Reference was made to <a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_335">Sections 17</a> and <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_336">18</a>  and  Rules  58
and 59 of 1960 Rules and it was argued that these provisions are  indicative
of  the  position  that  reservation  made  by  the  State  Government   for
exploitation  of  minerals  in   public   sector   was   unsupportable   and
unsustainable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_179"><a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_337">Section 17</a> – not all -  comprehensive provision
</p><p id="p_180">116.        I am of the opinion that <a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_338">Section 17</a> is not all  -  comprehensive
on the subject of refusal to grant  prospecting  licence  or  mining  lease.
<a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_339">Section 17</a> has nothing to do with public or  private  sector.  It  does  not
deal   directly  or  indirectly  with  the  State  Government’s  right   for
reservation of its own mines and minerals. Its application  is  not  general
but it is confined to a specific  situation  where  the  Central  Government
proposes to undertake prospecting or  mining  operations  in  any  area  not
already held under any prospecting licence or mining lease. The  above  view
with regard to <a href="/doc/60301399/" id="a_340">Section 17</a>  finds  support  from  Amritlal  Nathubhai  Shahd.
Insofar as <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_341">Section 18</a> is concerned, it  basically  confers  additional  rule
making power upon the  Central  Government  for  achieving  the  objectives,
namely, conservation and  systematic  development  of  minerals  articulated
therein. If the State Government makes reservation in public  interest  with
respect to minerals which vest in it for exploitation in  public  sector,  I
fail to see how such reservation can be seen  as  impairing  the  obligation
cast upon the Central Government under <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_342">Section 18</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_181">Rule 59 and Janak Lal
</p><p id="p_182">117.        It is true that Rule 58 as it existed originally did not  enable
the State Government to reserve any area in the State  for  exploitation  of
minerals in public sector. But Rule 59 did recognise the State  Government’s
authority to make reservation for any purpose.   It  was,  however,   argued
by Dr. Rajiv Dhavan that Rule 59,  as it  then  stood,  allowed  reservation
for any purpose other than prospecting or mining  for  minerals.  He  relied
upon decision of this Court in Janak Lalj. In  Janak  Lalj,  admittedly  the
disputed area was reserved for nistar  purposes.  When  an  application  for
grant of mining lease was earlier made by a third party it was  rejected  on
the ground that it was so reserved. It was also an admitted position  before
this Court that the procedure under Rule 58 was not  followed  before  grant
was made in favour of respondent no. 4 therein and no opportunity was  given
to any other person before entertaining application of respondent no. 4.  In
the backdrop of the  above  admitted  position,  the  Court  considered  the
question whether Rule 59 was attracted or not. The High Court  had  accepted
the argument of the  respondents  that  the  expression  ‘reserved  for  any
purpose’ in Rule 59 did not cover a case where the  area  was  reserved  for
nistar purposes or for any purpose other than  mining. This  Court  did  not
accept the High Court’s view. While construing  Rule  59  as  it  originally
existed and the amendment brought in Rule 59 by deleting the  words,  ‘other
than prospecting or mining for minerals’, the Court said that the result  of
the amendment was to extend  the  rule  and  not  to  curtail  its  area  of
operation. It was held that words ‘any purpose’ was of wide connotation  and
there was no reason to restrict its meaning.
</p><p id="p_183">118.         Janak Lal,j   in my  opinion,  does  not  help  the  contention
canvassed  on  behalf  of  the  appellants.   The  expression,  ‘other  than
prospecting or mining for minerals’ that formed part of  original  Rule  59,
in my view, was not of much  significance  and  did  not  impede  the  State
Government’s authority to make reservation of any area for  exploitation  in
public sector founded on its ownership over that area.  It  was  because  of
this that this insignificant and inconsequential  expression  was  later  on
deleted from Rule 59 in 1963.  Rule 59, accordingly, continued to  recognise
the State Government’s right to reserve  any  area  for  mining  within  its
territory for any  purpose  including  exploitation  in  public  sector.  In
Amritlal Nathubhai Shahd, this position has been expressly affirmed when  it
said, “but quite apart from that, we find that Rule 59 of  the  Rules  which
have been made under <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_343">Section  13</a>  of  the  Act,  clearly  contemplates  such
reservation by an order of the State Government”.
</p>
<p id="p_184">Repeal of Rule 58 and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_344">Section 17A</a>
</p><p id="p_185">119.        Rule 58 was amended in 1980 whereby it expressly  provided  that
the State Government may by Notification in  the  official  gazette  reserve
any area for exploitation by the Government, a  corporation  established  by
the Central, State or <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_345">Provincial Act</a> or  a  Government  company  within  the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1430621/" id="a_346">Section 617</a> of the Companies Act. Rule 58 has been  omitted  from
1960 Rules as the provision for reservation has now been expressly  made  by
insertion of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_347">Section 17A</a> in 1957 Act.  According  to  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_348">Section  17A(2)</a>,   the
State Government with the approval of the  Central  Government  may  reserve
any area not already held under any prospecting licence or mining  lease  to
undertake prospecting or mining operations through a Government  company  or
a corporation owned or controlled by it. In terms  of  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_349">Section  17A(2)</a>,  any
reservation made by the State Government after coming  into  force  of  that
Section must bear approval of the Central Government.
</p><p id="p_186">120.        From the above, it becomes clear that what was  implied  by  the
provisions originally contained in  1957  Act  and  1960  Rules  insofar  as
authority of the State Government to reserve any area within  its  territory
for mining in public sector has been made explicit  first  by  amendment  in
Rule 58 in 1980 and later on by introduction of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_350">Section 17A</a> in 1957  Act  by
virtue of amendment effective from 1987.
</p><p id="p_187">121.        It was also argued by Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned senior  counsel
for one of the appellants that even if  1962  and  1969  Notifications  were
held to be validly issued with proper authority of  law  at  that  point  of
time, the fact that Rule 58 was omitted in 1988 without  any  saving  clause
necessarily meant that these Notifications were no longer  valid  and  could
not be relied upon. He argued that current power  of  reservation  contained
in <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_351">Section 17A</a> of 1957 Act is consistent with erstwhile  Rules  58/59  since
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_352">Section 17A</a> expressly  requires  the  approval  of  the  Central  Government
before any State Government  issues  any  notification  for  reservation  of
mining area in public sector.
</p><p id="p_188">122.        The impact of omission of Rule 58 in 1988 from  1960  Rules  and
the introduction of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_353">Section 17A</a> in 1957 Act in the  context  of  reservation
of the mining area by the State Government for  public  sector  exploitation
came up for direct consideration by this Court in Indian  Metals  and  Ferro
Alloys Ltd.p.  In the earlier part of the judgment  I  have  already  quoted
the relevant portion of the decision of this  Court  in  Indian  Metals  and
Ferro Alloys Ltd.p. The  Court referred to the relevant amendments  in  1957
Act and 1960 Rules and categorically held that  reservations made  prior  to
insertion of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_354">Section 17A</a> continue in force even after  the  introduction  of
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_355">Section 17A</a>. The reservations made by the State Government  in  1977  before
omission of Rule 58 and amendment in Rule 59  and insertion of  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_356">Section  17A</a>
in 1957 Act were, thus, held to be unaffected.
</p>
<p id="p_189">123.        Having carefully considered <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_357">Section 17A</a>, I  have  no  hesitation
in holding that the said provision is prospective. There  is  no  indication
in <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_358">Section 17A</a> or in terms  of  the  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_359">Amending  Act</a>  that  by   insertion  of
<a href="/doc/21491470/" id="a_360">Section 17A</a> the Parliament intended  to  alter  the  pre-existing  state  of
affairs. The Parliament does not seem  to  have   intended  by  bringing  in
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_361">Section 17A</a> to undo the reservation of any mining area  made  by  the  State
Government  earlier  thereto  for  exploitation  in   public   sector.   The
Parliament has no doubt  plenary  power  of  legislation  within  the  field
assigned to it to legislate prospectively as well  as  retrospectively.   As
early as in  1951  this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/656658/" id="a_362">Keshavan  Madhava  Menon   v.  State  of
Bombay</a>[44] had stated about   a  cardinal  principle  of  construction  that
every statue is prima  facie  prospective  unless  it  is  expressly  or  by
necessary implication made to have  retrospective  operation.  Unless  there
are  words  in  the  statute  sufficient  to  show  the  intention  of   the
Legislature to affect existing rights, it is deemed to be prospective  only.
 In Principles  of  Statutory  Interpretation  (Seventh  Edition,  1999)  by
Justice G.P. Singh, the statement of  Lord  Blanesburg   in  Colonial  Sugar
Refining  Co.  v.  Irving[45]  and  the  observations  of  Lopes,  L.J.   in
Pulborough Parish School Board Election, Bourke v. Nutt[46] have been  noted
as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_147">           “In the words of Lord  Blanesburg,  “provisions  which  touch  a
           right in existence at the passing of the statute are not  to  be
           applied retrospectively in the absence of express  enactment  or
           necessary  intendment.”  “Every  statute,  it  has  been  said”,
           observed Lopes, L.J., “which takes away or impairs vested rights
           acquired under existing laws, or creates  a  new  obligation  or
           imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in  respect  of
           transactions already past, must be presumed to be  intended  not
           to have a retrospective effect”.
</blockquote>





<p id="p_190">124.        Where an issue arises before the  Court  whether  a  statute  is
prospective or retrospective, the Court has to keep in mind  presumption  of
prospectivity articulated in legal maxim  nova  constitutio  futuris  formam
imponere debet non praeteritis, i.e., ‘a new law ought to regulate  what  is
to follow, not  the  past’.    The  presumption  of  prospectivity  operates
unless shown to the contrary by express  provision  in  the  statute  or  is
otherwise discernible by necessary implication.
</p>
<p id="p_191">125.        The aspects, namely, (i)  1993  mineral  policy  framed  by  the
Central Government envisaged permission of captive consumption  of  minerals
across the country; (ii) in 1994 Central  Government  asked  all  the  state
governments to de-reserve 13 minerals including iron ore and  directed  them
to take steps accordingly; (iii)  confirmation by the  Government  of  Bihar
to the Central Government in 1994 that no mining  areas  were  reserved  for
public sector undertaking in the then State of Bihar; (iv)  confirmation  by
the State Government in  2001  to  Central  Government  that  there  are  no
reserved areas in the State and (v)  in  2004,  the  recommendation  by  the
State Government  in favour of the appellants to the Central Government  for
grant of prior approval and reminder in 2005, in my  view,  have  no  impact
and effect on the validity of 1962 and 1969 Notifications.  The  above  acts
of the Government of Bihar and the Government of Jharkhand in  ignorance  of
1962 and 1969 Notifications cannot  be  used  as  a  sufficient  ground  for
invalidating these  Notifications.  If  a  state  government  has  power  to
reserve mineral bearing area for exploitation in public sector – and I  have
already held that the then Government of Bihar had such power – the  act  of
reservation vide 1962 and 1969 Notifications  is  not  rendered  illegal  or
invalid. I am clearly of the view that lack of knowledge on the part of  the
State Government  about the reservation of areas for exploitation in  public
sector vide 1962 and 1969 Notifications does not affect in  any  manner  the
legality and validity of these Notifications once it  has  been  found  that
these Notifications have been issued by the  erstwhile  State  of  Bihar  in
valid exercise of power which it had.
</p>


<p id="p_192">Validity of 2006 Notification
</p><p id="p_193">126.         On  October  27,  2006,  the   State   Government    issued   a
Notification declaring its decision that the iron ore deposits  at  Ghatkuri
would not be thrown open for grant of prospecting  licence,  mining  licence
or otherwise for  private parties. In the said Notification,  it  was  noted
that the deposits were at all material times kept reserved by 1962 and  1969
Notifications issued by the State of Bihar. It was further mentioned in  the
Notification that mineral reserved in Ghatkuri area has now been decided  to
be utilized for exploitation by public sector undertaking or  joint  venture
project of the State Government as they would usher in maximum  benefits  to
the State and would generate substantial amount of employment in the  State.
2006 Notification states that it has been issued in the public interest  and
in  the  larger  interest  of  the  State  for   optimum   utilization   and
exploitation of the mineral resources in the State and for establishment  of
mineral based industry with value addition thereon. It was argued that  2006
Notification  is  bad  for  the  same  reasons  for  which  1962  and   1969
Notifications are bad in law and  invalid.  The  argument  is  noted  to  be
rejected. For 1962 and 1969 Notifications are not and have  not  been  found
by me to suffer from any legal infirmity. 2006 Notification mentions  factum
of reservation made by 1962 and 1969 Notifications. It  is  founded  on  the
policy of the State Government that such reservation will usher  in  maximum
benefits to  the  State  and  would  also  generate  substantial  amount  of
employment in the State. The public interest is, thus, paramount. The  State
Government had authority to do that under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_363">Section 17A(2)</a> of  1957  Act  read
with Rule 59(1)(e) of 1960 Rules.
</p><p id="p_194">127.         It was, however, argued on behalf of the appellants  that  2006
Notification has attempted to reserve the area for  exploitation  by  public
sector undertaking or in joint venture project  whereas  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_364">Section  17A(2)</a>  of
1957 Act allows the State  Government  to  reserve  area  for  a  government
company or corporation owned or controlled by it and not  in  joint  venture
project. The submission was that 2006 Notification is an  attempt  to  bring
in indirectly private companies  through  joint  venture  project  although,
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_365">Section 17A</a> clearly does not envisage private participation.
</p><p id="p_195">128.         The mineral reserved in the said area by 2006 Notification  has
been decided to be utilized for exploitation by  public  sector  undertaking
or joint venture project of the State  Government.  2006  Notification  does
mention reservation for joint venture project of the State  Government  but,
in my opinion, the said expression must be understood to be confined  to  an
instrumentality having the trappings and character of a  government  company
or corporation owned or controlled by the State Government and  not  outside
of such instrumentality.
</p><p id="p_196">129.        The types of reservation under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_366">Section 17A</a> and their scope  have
been considered by this Court in Indian Metals and Ferro  Alloys  Ltd.p   in
paragraphs 45 and 46 (pgs. 136-139)  of  the  Report.  I  am  in  respectful
agreement with that  view.  However,  it  was  argued  that  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_367">Section  17A(2)</a>
requires prior approval of the Central Government before reservation of  any
area by  the  State  Government  for  the  public  sector  undertaking.  The
argument is founded on  incorrect reading of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_368">Section 17A(2)</a>. This  provision
does not use the  expression,  ‘prior  approval’  which  has  been  used  in
<a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_369">Section 11</a>. On the other hand, <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_370">Section 17A(2)</a>  uses  the  words,  ‘with  the
approval of the Central Government’. These words in <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_371">Section 17A(2)</a>  can  not
be equated with prior approval of the Central Government.  According to  me,
the approval contemplated in <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_372">Section 17A</a>   may  be  obtained  by  the  State
Government before the exercise of power of reservation or after exercise  of
such power. The approval by the Central Government contemplated  in  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_373">Section
17A(2)</a> may be express or implied. In a case such as the  present  one  where
the Central Government has relied upon  2006  Notification  while  rejecting
appellants’ application for grant of mining lease,  it  necessarily  implies
that  the  Central  Government  has  approved  reservation  made  by   State
Government in 2006 Notification otherwise it would not  have  acted  on  the
same. In any case, the Central Government has  not  disapproved  reservation
made by the State Government in 2006 Notification.
</p><p id="p_197">130.        Two more contentions advanced on behalf of the appellants,  one,
 with regard to 2006 Notification and the other  with  regard  to  1962  and
1969 Notifications may be briefly noticed. As regards 2006  Notification  it
was contended that it was not legally valid as it has  been  made  operative
with retrospective effect. In respect of 1962  and  1969  Notifications,  it
was argued that the State Government  had never adopted these  Notifications
and, accordingly, these Notifications lapsed. None of  these  two  arguments
has any merit. 2006 Notification has not been given retrospective  operation
as contended on behalf of the appellants. I  have  already  held  that  2006
Notification is prospective.  Mere reference to 1962 and 1969  Notifications
in 2006 Notification does not make 2006 Notification retrospective.
</p><p id="p_198">131.        The other argument that 1962 and 1969 Notifications  had  lapsed
as the State Government never adopted them is also  without  any  merit  and
substance. The new State of Jharkhand was carved out of the erstwhile  State
of Bihar and it came into existence by virtue of  the  <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_374">Bihar  Reorganisation
Act</a>, 2000. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_375">Section 85</a> of that Act provides that the  appropriate  Government
may before expiration of two years adapt and/or modify  the  law  and  every
such law shall have effect subject to adaptation and  modification  so  made
until altered, repealed or amended by a competent Legislature. In  light  of
<a href="/doc/601425/" id="a_376">Section 85</a> of the Bihar Reorganisation Act read  with  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_377">Sections  84</a>  and  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_378">86</a>
thereof,  position that emerges is that the existing law shall  have  effect
until it is altered,  repealed  and/or  amended.  Since  the  new  State  of
Jharkhand  had  not  altered,  repealed  and/or  amended   1962   and   1969
Notifications issued by the erstwhile State of  Bihar,  it  cannot  be  said
that  1962  and  1969  Notifications   had   lapsed.   Moreover,   in   2006
Notification, 1962  and  1969  Notifications  and  their  effect  have  been
mentioned and that also shows that 1962 and 1969 Notifications continued  to
operate. The expression,  ‘the  deposit  was  at  all  material  times  kept
reserved vide  Gazette  Notification  No.  A/MM-40510/62-6209/M  dated  21st
December, 1962 and No. B/M-6-1019/68-1564/M dated  28th  February,  1969  of
the  State  of  Bihar’  leaves  no  manner  of  doubt  that  1962  and  1969
Notifications continued to operate and did not lapse.

<p id="p_199">Principles of promissory estoppel

</p><p id="p_200">132.        The doctrine of promissory estoppel is  now  firmly  established
and is well accepted in India. Its nature, scope and  extent  have  come  up
for consideration before this Court time  and  again.  One  of  the  leading
cases of this Court on the doctrine of promissory estoppel is  the  case  of
Motilal Padampat Sugar Millsz . In that case,   the  Court  elaborately  and
extensively  considered  diverse  facets  and  aspects   of    doctrine   of
promissory estoppel. That was a  case  where  the  appellant  was  primarily
engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of sugar and it had  also  a
cold storage plant and a steel foundry. On October 10, 1968 a news item  was
carried in the newspaper/s that the State of Uttar Pradesh  had  decided  to
give exemption from sales tax for a period of three years under Section  4-A
of the U.P. Sales Tax Act to all new industrial units in the  State  with  a
view to enabling them, “to  come  on  firm  footing  in  developing  stage”.
Motilal Padampat Sugar Millsz on the basis of the above  news,  addressed  a
letter to the Director of the Industries stating that in view of  the  Sales
Tax  Holiday  announced  by  the  Government,  it  intended  to  set  up   a
hydrogeneration plant for manufacture of vanaspati and  sought  confirmation
whether proposed industrial unit would be entitled to sales tax holiday  for
a period of  three  years  from  the  date  it  commenced  production.   The
Director of Industries replied that there would be no sales  tax  for  three
years on the finished product of the vanaspati from the date  it  got  power
connection for commencing production. Motilal  Padampat  Sugar  Millsz  then
started taking steps for establishment  of  the  factory.  It  entered  into
agreement for procuring plant and machinery and also took diverse steps  and
considerable progress in the  setting  up  of  the  vanaspati  factory  took
place. Later on, the State Government had a second thought on  the  question
of exemption of sales tax and, ultimately,  the  government  took  a  policy
decision that new vanaspati units in the  State  which  go  into  commercial
production by September 30, 1970 would be given only partial  concession  in
sales tax for a period of three years.  Motilal Padampat Sugar  Millsz  took
up the matter with the  Government  and  in  the  meanwhile  its  production
started on July 2, 1970 which was also intimated  to  the  functionaries  of
the State.  Having been denied total sales  tax  holiday  although  promised
earlier by the Director of Industries, it filed a writ petition  before  the
High Court. The principal argument advanced on behalf  of  Motilal  Padampat
Sugar Millsz was that on a categorical assurance  of  the  State  Government
that it would be exempted from payment of sales tax for a  period  of  three
years from the date of commencement of  production  that  it  established  a
hydrogeneration plant for manufacture of vanaspati. The assurance was  given
by the State Government intending or knowing that it would be  acted  on  by
it and in fact by acting on it, it altered its position and, therefore,  the
State Government was bound  on  the  principle  of  promissory  estoppel  to
honour the assurance and exempt it from sales tax  for  a  period  of  three
years. In  backdrop of  these  facts,   when   the   matter    reached  this
Court, the Court considered the nature, scope and extent of the doctrine  of
promissory estoppel. In paragraph 8 of the  Report,  the  Court   considered
the view  of Justice Denning,  as  he  then  was,  in  the  Central   London
Property  Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.[47]  wherein Denning,  J.  had
considered Jorden v. Money[48]. This Court also  referred  to  in  paragraph
 8, the opinions in Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Company[49] ,  Birmingham
and District Land Co., v. London and North Western Rail Co.[50]  which  were
considered by Justice Denning in the High  Treesuu   case.  The  Court  also
considered the decisions in Durham  Fancy  Goods  Ltd.  v.  Michael  Jackson
(Fancy Goods) Ltd.[51], Evenden v. Guildford City Association Football  Club
Ltd.[52] and Crabb v. Arun District Council[53] and  culled  out  the  legal
position as follows :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_148">           “8.  …… The true principle of  promissory  estoppel,  therefore,
           seems to be that where one party has by  his  words  or  conduct
           made to the other a  clear  and  unequivocal  promise  which  is
           intended  to  create  legal  relations   or   affect   a   legal
           relationship to arise in the future, knowing or  intending  that
           it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is
           made and it is in fact so acted upon by  the  other  party,  the
           promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not
           be entitled to go back upon it, if it would  be  inequitable  to
           allow him to do so having regard  to  the  dealings  which  have
           taken  place  between  the  parties,  and  this  would   be   so
           irrespective of whether there is any  pre-existing  relationship
           between the parties or not.”






Then in para 9, the Court stated that it was a doctrine  evolved  by  equity
in order to prevent injustice. The Court pointed out that where  promise  is
made by a person knowing that it would be acted on by the person to whom  it
is made and in fact it is so acted on, it is inequitable to allow the  party
making the promise to go back upon it.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_201">133.        In para 13, the development of doctrine of  promissory  estoppel
in England was noticed  by  observing,  “that  even  in  England  where  the
Judges, apprehending that if a cause of action is allowed to be  founded  on
promissory  estoppel  it  would  considerably  erode,  if   not   completely
overthrow, the  doctrine  of  consideration,  have  been  fearful  to  allow
promissory estoppel to be used as a weapon of offence, it is interesting  to
find that promissory estoppel has not been confined to  a  purely  defensive
role”.
</p>
<p id="p_202">134.        In Motilal Padampat Sugar Millsz, the  Court  also  referred  to
American law on the subject. In para 14 after observing,  ‘the  doctrine  of
promissory estoppel has displayed remarkable  vigour  and  vitality  in  the
hands of American Judges and it is still rapidly  developing  and  expanding
in the United States”, the Court referred to  <a href="/doc/1226972/" id="a_379">Article  90</a>  of  American  Law
Institute’s “Restatement of the Law of Contracts” and the statement at  page
657 of Volume 19 of American Jurisprudence.
</p>
<p id="p_203">135.        The Court  then  considered  the  view  of  Justice  Cardozo  in
Allengheny College v. National Chautauque County  Bank[54]  and  Orennan  v.
Star Paving Company[55] and noted as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_149">           “14. There  are  also  numerous  cases  where  the  doctrine  of
           promissory estoppel has  been  applied  against  the  Government
           where the interest of  justice,  morality  and  common  fairness
           clearly dictated such a course. We shall refer  to  these  cases
           when we discuss the applicability of the doctrine  of  equitable
           estoppel against the Government. Suffice it  to  state  for  the
           present that the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been  taken
           much  further  in  the  United  States  than  in   English   and
           Commonwealth jurisdictions and in some States at least,  it  has
           been used  to  reduce,  if  not  to  destroy,  the  prestige  of
           consideration as an essential of valid  contract.  Vide  Spencer
           Bower and Turner's Estoppel by Representation (2d) p. 358.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_204">136.        The Court  then  considered  to  what  extent  the  doctrine  of
promissory estoppel was applicable against the Government.  After  referring
to few decisions  of  the  English  courts  and  the  American  courts,  the
decisions of this Court in  <a href="/doc/1882267/" id="a_380">Union  of  India  v.  Indo-Afghan  Agencies</a>[56],

considered.
</p>
<p id="p_205">137.        After entering into detailed consideration as  noted  above,  in
Motilal Padampat Sugar Millsz , this  Court  exposited  the  legal  position
that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may be applied  against  the  State
even  in  its  governmental,  public  or  sovereign  capacity  where  it  is
necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice.  The  following   position
was culled out:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_150">           “The  promissory  estoppel  cannot  be  invoked  to  compel  the
           Government or even a private party to do an  act  prohibited  by
           law.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_151">           To  invoke  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  it  is  not
           necessary  for  the  promisee  to  show  that  he  suffered  any
           detriment as a result of acting in reliance on the promise.  The
           detriment is not some prejudice  suffered  by  the  promisee  by
           acting on the promise but the prejudice which would be caused to
           the promisee, if the promisor were allowed to  go  back  on  the
           promise.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_152">           Whatever be the nature  of  function  which  the  Government  is
           discharging, the Government is subject to the rule of promissory
           estoppel and if the  essential  ingredients  of  this  rule  are
           satisfied the Government can  be  compelled  to  carry  out  the
           promise made by it.”




</blockquote><p id="p_206">138.         <a href="/doc/53080/" id="a_389">In  Union  of  India  and  Others  v.  Godfrey  Philips   India
Limited</a>[65] (para 9,  page  383  of  the  Report),  this   Court  stated  as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_153">           “9. Now the doctrine of promissory estoppel is well  established
           in the administrative law of India. It  represents  a  principle
           evolved by equity to avoid injustice and, though commonly  named
           promissory estoppel, it is neither in the realm of contract  nor
           in the realm of estoppel. The basis  of  this  doctrine  is  the
           interposition of equity which has  always,  true  to  its  form,
           stepped in to mitigate the rigour of strict law. This  doctrine,
           though of ancient vintage, was rescued  from  obscurity  by  the
           decision  of  Mr.  Justice  Denning  as  he  then  was,  in  his
           celebrated judgment in Central London  Property  Trust  Ltd.  v.
           High Trees House Ltd. The true principle of promissory  estoppel
           is that where one party has by his word or conduct made  to  the
           other a clear and unequivocal promise or representation which is
           intended  to  create  legal  relations   or   effect   a   legal
           relationship to arise in the future, knowing or  intending  that
           it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise or
           representation is made and it is in fact so acted  upon  by  the
           other party, the promise or representation would be  binding  on
           the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon
           it, if it would be inequitable to allow him  to  do  so,  having
           regard to the  dealings  which  have  taken  place  between  the
           parties. It has often been said in England that the doctrine  of
           promissory estoppel cannot itself be the basis of an action:  it
           can only be a shield and not a sword: but the law in  India  has
           gone far ahead of the narrow position adopted in England and  as
           a result of the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_390">Motilal Padampat Sugar
           Mills v. State of U.P</a>. it is now well settled that the  doctrine
           of promissory estoppel is not limited in its application only to
           defence but it can also found a cause of action. The decision of
           this Court in Motilal Sugar Mills case  contains  an  exhaustive
           discussion of the doctrine of promissory estoppel  and  we  find
           ourselves wholly in agreement with  the  various  parameters  of
           this doctrine outlined in that decision.”


</blockquote><p id="p_207">139.         The  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  also   came   up   for
consideration before this Court in <a href="/doc/1348961/" id="a_391">Delhi Cloth and General Mills Limited  v.
Union of India</a>[66]. In para 18 (page 95) of the Report the Court  stated  as
follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_154">           “18. Here the Railways Rates  Tribunal  apparently,  appears  to
           have gone off the track. The doctrine of promissory estoppel has
           not been correctly understood by the Tribunal. It is true,  that
           in the formative period, it was generally said that the doctrine
           of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked by the promisee  unless
           he has suffered “detriment” or “prejudice”. It  was  often  said
           simply, that the party asserting the  estoppel  must  have  been
           induced to act to his detriment. But this has now been explained
           in so many decisions all over. All that is now required is  that
           the party asserting  the  estoppel  must  have  acted  upon  the
           assurance given to him. Must have relied upon the representation
           made to him. It means, the party  has  changed  or  altered  the
           position by relying on the assurance or the representation.  The
           alteration of position by the party is  the  only  indispensable
           requirement of the  doctrine.  It  is  not  necessary  to  prove
           further  any  damage,  detriment  or  prejudice  to  the   party
           asserting the estoppel. The court,  however,  would  compel  the
           opposite party to adhere to the  representation  acted  upon  or
           abstained from acting.  The  entire  doctrine  proceeds  on  the
           premise that it is reliance based and nothing more.”

</blockquote><p id="p_208">140.        A two-Judge Bench of  this  Court  in  Amrit  Banaspati  Company

doctrine of promissory estoppel and after considering  earlier decisions  of
this Court in Indo-Afghan Agenciesddd ,  Motilal  Padampat  Sugar  Millsz  ,
Godfrey  Philips  India  Limitedmmm  and  Delhi  Cloth  and  General   Mills
Limitednnn  culled out the legal position   that  if  a  representation  was
made  by  an  official  on  behalf  of  the  Government  then  unless   such
representation is established to be beyond scope of authority it  should  be
held binding  on  the  Government.   However,  if  such  representation  was
contrary to law then such representation was unenforceable. Then  the  Court
stated (para 10, page 424) as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_155">           “10. But promissory estoppel being an extension of principle  of

           due to promisor's going back on its  promise,  is  incapable  of
           being enforced in a court of law if the promise which  furnishes
           the cause of action or the agreement, express or implied, giving
           rise to binding contract is statutorily prohibited or is against
           public policy……”

Court was principally concerned with the invocation    of  the  doctrine  of
promissory estoppel in the facts and circumstances  of  the  case  obtaining
therein. The Court considered the decision  of  this  Court  in  Indo-Afghan
Agenciesddd and the successive decisions. The Court held  in  (paras  11-12,
pages 283-284) as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_156">           “11. The doctrine of promissory estoppel or  equitable  estoppel
           is well established in the administrative law of the country. To
           put it simply, the doctrine represents a  principle  evolved  by
           equity to avoid injustice. The basis of  the  doctrine  is  that
           where any party has by his word or conduct  made  to  the  other
           party an  unequivocal  promise  or  representation  by  word  or
           conduct, which is intended to create legal relations or effect a

<p id="p_210">           12. It has been settled by  this  Court  that  the  doctrine  of
           promissory estoppel is applicable against  the  Government  also
           particularly where it is necessary to prevent fraud or  manifest
           injustice. The doctrine, however, cannot be pressed into aid  to
           compel the Government or the public authority “to  carry  out  a
           representation or promise which is contrary to law or which  was
           outside the authority or power of the officer of the  Government
           or of the public authority to make”. There is  preponderance  of
           judicial opinion that  to  invoke  the  doctrine  of  promissory
           estoppel clear, sound and positive foundation must  be  laid  in
           the petition itself by the party invoking the doctrine and  that
           bald expressions, without any supporting material, to the effect
           that the doctrine is attracted because the  party  invoking  the
           doctrine has altered its position relying on  the  assurance  of
           the Government would not be sufficient to  press  into  aid  the
           doctrine. In our opinion, the doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel
           cannot be invoked in the abstract and the courts  are  bound  to
           consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved
           and the public good at  large,  because  while  considering  the
           applicability of the doctrine, the courts have to do equity  and
           the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present to
           the mind of the court, while considering  the  applicability  of
           the doctrine. The doctrine must yield when the equity so demands
           if it can be shown having regard to the facts and  circumstances
           of the case that it would be inequitable to hold the  Government
           or  the  public  authority  to   its   promise,   assurance   or
           representation.”




Then in paragraph 20 of the Report  while  distinguishing  the  facts  under
consideration  which were not found to be  analogous to the facts  in  Indo-
Afghan Agenciesddd and  Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills,     the  Court  stated
(Para 20-21, pages 287-288) as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_157">           “20. The facts of the appeals before us are not analogous to the
           facts in Indo-Afghan Agencies or M.P. Sugar Mills. In the  first
           case the petitioner  therein  had  acted  upon  the  unequivocal
           promises held out to it  and  exported  goods  on  the  specific
           assurance given to it and it was in that fact situation that  it
           was held that Textile Commissioner who had enunciated the scheme
           was bound by the assurance thereof and obliged to carry out  the
           promise made thereunder. As  already  noticed,  in  the  present
           batch of cases neither  the  notification  is  of  an  executive
           character nor does it represent a scheme designed to  achieve  a
           particular purpose. It  was  a  notification  issued  in  public
           interest and again withdrawn in public interest. So far  as  the
           second case (M.P. Sugar Mills case) is concerned the facts  were
           totally different. In the correspondence exchanged  between  the
           State and the  petitioners  therein  it  was  held  out  to  the
           petitioners that the industry would be exempted from  sales  tax
           for a particular number of initial  years  but  when  the  State
           sought to levy the sales tax it was held by this Court  that  it
           was  precluded  from  doing  so  because  of   the   categorical
           representation made by it to the petitioners through letters  in
           writing, who had relied upon the same and set up the industry.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_158">           21.  The  power  to  grant  exemption  from  payment  of   duty,
           additional duty etc. under the Act, as  already  noticed,  flows
           from the provisions of <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_393">Section 25(1)</a> of the Act.  The  power  to
           exempt includes the power to modify or withdraw  the  same.  The
           liability to pay customs duty or additional duty under  the  Act
           arises when the taxable event occurs. They are then  subject  to
           the payment of duty as prevalent on the date of the entry of the
           goods. An exemption notification issued under <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_394">Section 25</a> of  the
           Act had the effect of suspending the collection of customs duty.
           It does not make items which are subject to levy of customs duty
           etc. as items not leviable to such duty. It  only  suspends  the
           levy and collection of customs duty, etc., wholly  or  partially
           and subject to such conditions  as  may  be  laid  down  in  the
           notification by the Government in  “public  interest”.  Such  an
           exemption by its very nature is susceptible of being revoked  or
           modified or subjected to other conditions. The  supersession  or
           revocation of an exemption notification in the “public interest”
           is an exercise of the statutory power of the State under the law
           itself as is obvious from the language of <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_395">Section 25</a> of the Act.
           <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_396">Under the General Clauses Act</a> an authority which has  the  power
           to issue a notification has the undoubted power  to  rescind  or
           modify the notification in a like manner. From the  very  nature
           of power of exemption granted to the Government under <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_397">Section 25</a>
           of the Act, it follows that the same is with a view to  enabling
           the Government to regulate, control and promote  the  industries
           and industrial production in the country. Notification No. 66 of
           1979 in our opinion, was not designed or issued  to  induce  the
           appellants  to  import   PVC   resin.   Admittedly,   the   said
           notification was not even intended as an incentive  for  import.</blockquote>
<p id="p_211">           The notification on the plain language of it was  conceived  and
           issued on the Central Government “being  satisfied  that  it  is
           necessary in the public interest so to do”.  Strictly  speaking,
           therefore, the notification cannot be said to have extended  any
           ‘representation’ much less a ‘promise’ to a  party  getting  the
           benefit of it to enable it to invoke the doctrine of  promissory
           estoppel against the State. It would  bear  repetition  that  in
           order to invoke the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel,  it  is
           necessary that the promise which is sought to be  enforced  must
           be shown to  be  an  unequivocal  promise  to  the  other  party
           intended to create a legal relationship and that  it  was  acted
           upon as such  by  the  party  to  whom  the  same  was  made.  A
           notification issued under <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_398">Section 25</a> of the Act cannot  be  said
           to be holding  out  of  any  such  unequivocal  promise  by  the
           Government which was intended to create any  legal  relationship
           between the Government and the  party  drawing  benefit  flowing
           from of the said  notification.  It  is,  therefore,  futile  to
           contend that even if the public interest  so  demanded  and  the
           Central Government was satisfied  that  the  exemption  did  not
           require to be extended any further, it could still not  withdraw
           the exemption.”

The Court went on to observe (paras 24 and 25, pages 289-290) as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_159">           “24. It needs no emphasis that  the  power  of  exemption  under
           <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_399">Section 25(1)</a> of the Act has been granted to the  Government  by
           the Legislature with a view to enabling it to regulate,  control
           and promote the industries and  industrial  productions  in  the
           country. Where the Government  on  the  basis  of  the  material
           available before it, bona fide, is satisfied  that  the  “public
           interest” would be served by either  granting  exemption  or  by
           withdrawing,  modifying  or  rescinding  an  exemption   already
           granted, it should be allowed a free  hand  to  do  so.  We  are
           unable to agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that
           Notification No. 66 of 1979 could not be withdrawn before  31-3-
           1981. First, because  the  exemption  notification  having  been
           issued under <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_400">Section 25(1)</a> of the Act, it  was  implicit  in  it
           that it could be rescinded or modified at any time if the public
           interest so demands  and  secondly  it  is  not  permissible  to
           postpone the compulsions of “public interest” till  after  31-3-
           1981 if the Government is satisfied as  to  the  change  in  the
           circumstances before that date. Since,  the  Government  in  the
           instant case was satisfied that the very public  interest  which
           had demanded a total exemption from payment of customs duty  now
           demanded that the exemption should be withdrawn it was  free  to
           act in the manner it did. It would bear  a  notice  that  though
           Notification No. 66 of 1979 was initially valid only up to 31-3-
           1979 but that date was extended in “public interest”, we see  no
           reason why  it  could  not  be  curtailed  in  public  interest.
           Individual interest must yield in favour of societal interest.

<blockquote id="blockquote_160">           25. In our considered  opinion  therefore  the  High  Court  was
           perfectly right in  holding  that  the  doctrine  of  promissory
           estoppel had no application to the impugned notification  issued
           by the Central  Government  in  exercise  of  its  powers  under
           <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_401">Section 25(1)</a> of the Act in view of the facts and circumstances,
           as established on the record.”

principle of estoppel it was not necessary that there must be a contract  in
writing entered into between the parties. Having regard to the facts of  the
case under consideration,  the Court held that it  was  not  satisfied  even
prima facie that  it  was  a  case  of  an  error  committed  by  the  State
Government of which it was  not  aware.   While  observing  that  the  State
cannot take advantage of its  own  omission,  the  Court  held  that  having
persuaded the respondent  therein to establish an industry  and  that  party
having acted on the solemn promise of the State  Government,  purchased  the
raw material at a fixed price and also sold  its  products  by  pricing  the
same taking into consideration the price of the raw material  fixed  by  the
State Government, the State Government cannot be  permitted  to  revise  the
terms for supply of raw material adversely to the interest of that party.

Inter alia, the Court considered the earlier  decisions  of  this  Court  in
Indo-Afghan Agenciesddd, Motilal  Padampat  Sugar  Millsz,  Godfrey  Philips
India Limitedmmm,  Mangalam Timber Products  Limitedppp  ,  Amrit  Banaspati
Company Limitedaa and  Kasinka  Tradingooo  .  The  Court  followed  Godfrey
Philips India Limitedmmm  which was found to be close to the facts  of  that
case. The Court did not accept the  argument  canvassed  on  behalf  of  the
State  of  Punjab  that  the  overriding  public  interest  would  make   it
inequitable to enforce the estoppel against the State Government.

(paras 5-7, pages 631-633) and it was held as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_161">        “5. Estoppel is a rule of equity which has gained new dimensions in
        recent years. A new class of estoppel has come to be recognised  by
        the courts in this country as well as in England. The  doctrine  of
        “promissory estoppel” has assumed importance in recent years though
        it was dimly noticed in some of the earlier cases. The leading case
        on the subject is Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High  Trees
        House Ltd., (1947) 1 K.B. 130  The rule laid  down  in  High  Trees
        case again came up for consideration before  the  King's  Bench  in
        Combe v. Combe [(1951) 2 KB 215]. Therein the Court ruled that  the
        principle stated in High Trees case is that, where one  party  has,
        by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise  or  assurance
        which was intended to affect the legal relations between  them  and
        to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other  party  has  taken
        him at his word and acted on it, the party who gave the promise  or
        assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert  to  the  previous
        legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made
        by him, but he must accept their legal  relations  subject  to  the
        qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though it is
        not supported in point of law by any consideration, but only by his
        word. But that principle does not create any cause of action, which
        did not exist before; so that, where a promise is made which is not
        supported by any consideration, the promise cannot bring an  action
        on the basis of that promise.  The  principle  enunciated  in  High
        Trees case was also recognised by the House of Lords in Tool  Metal
        Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Tungsten Electric Co. Ltd. [(1955) 2 All ER  657].
        That principle was adopted by this Court in <a href="/doc/1882267/" id="a_404">Union of India v. Anglo
        Afghan Agencies</a> (AIR 1968 SC 718) and <a href="/doc/1913517/" id="a_405">Turner Morrison and Co.  Ltd.
        v. Hungerford Investment Trust Ltd</a>.[(1972) 1 SCC 857].  Doctrine of
        “promissory estoppel” has  been  evolved  by  the  courts,  on  the
        principles of equity, to avoid injustice. “Promissory estoppel”  is
        defined in Black's Law Dictionary as an estoppel.

           induce such action or forbearance, and such promise  is  binding
           if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of promise”.

<blockquote id="blockquote_163">        So far as this Court is concerned, it invoked the doctrine in Anglo

        which enacts the rule of estoppel, it would  still  be  open  to  a
        party who had acted on a representation made by the  Government  to
        claim that the Government should be bound to carry out the  promise
        made by it even though the promise was not recorded in the form  of

<blockquote id="blockquote_164">        6. In the backdrop, let us travel a little distance into  the  past
        to  understand  the  evolution  of  the  doctrine  of   “promissory
        estoppel”. Dixon, J., an Australian  jurist,  in  Grundt  v.  Great
        Boulder Gold Mines Pty. Ltd. [(1939) 59 CLR 641 (Aust HC) laid down
        as under:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_165">           “It is often said simply that the party asserting  the  estoppel
           must have  been  induced  to  act  to  his  detriment.  Although
           substantially such a  statement  is  correct  and  leads  to  no
           misunderstanding, it  does  not  bring  out  clearly  the  basal
           purpose of the doctrine. That purpose is to avoid or  prevent  a
           detriment to the party asserting the estoppel by compelling  the
           opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which the former
           acted or  abstained  from  acting.  This  means  that  the  real
           detriment or harm from which the law seeks to give protection is
           that which would  flow  from  the  change  of  position  if  the
           assumptions were deserted that led to it.”


        The principle, set out above, was reiterated  by  Lord  Denning  in
        High Trees case. This principle has been evolved by equity to avoid
        injustice. It is neither in the realm of contract nor in the  realm
        of estoppel. Its object is to interpose equity shorn of its form to
        mitigate the rigour  of  strict  law,  as  noted  in  Anglo  Afghan
        Agencies case and <a href="/doc/139299795/" id="a_414">Sharma Transport v. Govt. of A.P</a>. [(2002)  2  SCC

        before it was withdrawn. The rule of  promissory  estoppel  can  be
        invoked only  if  on  the  basis  of  representation  made  by  the
        Government, the  industry  was  established  to  avail  benefit  of

</blockquote><p id="p_215">145.        In M.P. Mathurcc , the Court was  concerned  with  the  question
whether on the facts of the case, the plaintiffs could  compel  transfer  of
tenements in their favour on the basis of  promissory  estoppel.  The  Court
(para 14, page 716 of the Report) observed as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_167">           “………The term “equity” has four different meanings, according  to
           the context in which it is used. Usually it means “an  equitable
           interest in property”. Sometimes,  it  means  “a  mere  equity”,
           which is a procedural right ancillary to some right of property,
           for example, an equitable right to have a conveyance  rectified.
           Thirdly, it may mean “floating equity”, a term which may be used
           to  describe  the  interest  of  a  beneficiary  under  a  will.
           Fourthly, “the right to obtain an injunction or other  equitable
           remedy”. In the present  case,  the  plaintiffs  have  sought  a
           remedy which is discretionary. They  have  instituted  the  suit
           under <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_416">Section 34</a> of the 1963 Act. The discretion which the court
           has to exercise is a judicial discretion. That discretion has to
           be exercised on well-settled principles.  Therefore,  the  court
           has to consider—the nature of obligation  in  respect  of  which
           performance is sought, circumstances under  which  the  decision
           came to be made, the conduct of the parties and  the  effect  of
           the court granting the decree. In such cases, the court  has  to
           look at the contract. The court has to ascertain  whether  there
           exists an element of mutuality in  the  contract.  If  there  is
           absence of mutuality the court will not exercise  discretion  in
           favour of the plaintiffs. Even if, want of mutuality is regarded
           as  discretionary  and  not  as  an  absolute  bar  to  specific
           performance, the court has to consider the entire conduct of the
           parties in relation to the subject-matter and  in  case  of  any
           disqualifying circumstances the court will not grant the  relief
           prayed for (Snell's Equity, 31st Edn., p. 366)……..”


</blockquote><p id="p_216">146.        In my view, the following principles must guide  a  Court  where
an issue of applicability of promissory estoppel arises:
</p>
<p id="p_217">(i)   Where one party has by his words or conduct made to  the  other  clear
      and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or
      affect a legal  relationship  to  arise  in  the  future,  knowing  or
      intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to  whom  the
      promise is made and it is, in fact, so acted upon by the other  party,
      the promise would be binding on the party making it and he  would  not
      be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be  inequitable  to  allow
      him to do so having regard to the  dealings  which  have  taken  place
      between the parties, and this would  be  so  irrespective  of  whether
      there is any pre-existing relationship between the parties or not.
</p>
<p id="p_218">(ii)  The doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  may  be  applied  against  the
      Government where the interest of justice, morality and common fairness
       dictate such a course. The doctrine is applicable against  the  State
      even in its governmental, public or sovereign  capacity  where  it  is
      necessary  to  prevent  fraud  or  manifest  injustice.  However,  the
      Government or even a private party under the  doctrine  of  promissory
      estoppel cannot be asked to do an act prohibited in  law.  The  nature
      and function which the Government discharges is not very relevant. The
      Government is subject to the rule of promissory estoppel  and  if  the
      essential ingredients of this doctrine are satisfied,  the  Government
      can be compelled to carry out the promise made by it.
</p>
<p id="p_219">(iii) The doctrine of promissory estoppel is not limited in its  application
      only to defence but it can also furnish  a cause of action.  In  other
      words, the doctrine of promissory estoppel can by itself be the  basis
      of action.
</p>
<p id="p_220">(iv)   For  invocation  of  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel,  it  is
      necessary for the promisee to show that by acting on promise  made  by
      the other party, he altered his position. The alteration  of  position
      by the promisee  is a sine  qua  non  for  the  applicability  of  the
      doctrine. However, it is not necessary for him to  prove  any  damage,
      detriment or prejudice because of alteration of such promise.
</p>
<p id="p_221">(v)   In no case, the doctrine of promissory estoppel can  be  pressed  into
      aid to compel the Government or a public  authority  to  carry  out  a
      representation or promise which  is  contrary  to  law  or  which  was
      outside the authority or power of the officer of the Government or  of
      the public authority to make.  No promise  can be  enforced  which  is
      statutorily prohibited or is against public policy.
</p>
<p id="p_222">(vi)  It is necessary for invocation of the doctrine of promissory  estoppel
      that a  clear, sound and positive foundation is  laid in the petition.
       Bald assertions, averments or  allegations   without  any  supporting
      material  are  not  sufficient to  press  into  aid  the  doctrine  of
      promissory estoppel.
</p>
<p id="p_223">(vii) The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be  invoked  in   abstract.
</p><p id="p_224">      When it  is sought to be invoked, the Court must consider all  aspects
      including the result sought to be achieved  and  the  public  good  at
      large.  The  fundamental principle of equity must forever  be  present
      to the mind of the court.  Absence of it must not hold the  Government
      or the public authority to its promise, assurance or representation.

<p id="p_225">Principles of legitimate expectation
</p><p id="p_226">147.        As there are  parallels  between  the  doctrines  of  promissory
estoppel  and  legitimate  expectation  because  both  these  doctrines  are
founded on the concept of fairness and arise out of natural justice,  it  is
appropriate that the principles  of legitimate expectation are also  noticed
here only to  appreciate the  case of the appellants  founded on  the  basis
of doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation.
</p><p id="p_227">148.         <a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_417">In  Union  of  India  and  Others  v.   Hindustan   Development
Corporation and Others</a>[70], this Court had an occasion to  consider  nature,
scope and applicability of the  doctrine  of  legitimate  expectation.   The
matter related to a government contract. This Court in  paragraph  35  (Pgs.
548-549) observed as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_168">      “35. Legitimate expectations may come in various forms and  owe  their
      existence to different kind of circumstances and it is not possible to
      give an exhaustive list in the context of vast and fast  expansion  of
      the governmental activities. They shift and change so  fast  that  the
      start of our list would be obsolete before we reached the  middle.  By
      and large they arise in cases of promotions which are in normal course
      expected, though not guaranteed by way of a statutory right, in  cases
      of contracts,  distribution  of  largess  by  the  Government  and  in
      somewhat similar  situations.  For  instance  discretionary  grant  of
      licences, permits or the like, carry with it a reasonable expectation,
      though not  a  legal  right  to  renewal  or  non-revocation,  but  to
      summarily disappoint that expectation may be seen  as  unfair  without
      the expectant person being heard. But there again the court has to see
      whether it was done as a policy or in the public  interest  either  by
      way of G.O., rule or by way  of  a  legislation.  If  that  be  so,  a
      decision denying a legitimate expectation based on such  grounds  does
      not qualify for interference unless in a given case, the  decision  or
      action taken amounts to an abuse of power. Therefore the limitation is
      extremely confined and if the according of natural  justice  does  not
      condition the  exercise  of  the  power,  the  concept  of  legitimate
      expectation can have no role to play and the court must not usurp  the
      discretion of the public authority which  is  empowered  to  take  the
      decisions under law and the court is expected to  apply  an  objective
      standard which leaves to the deciding  authority  the  full  range  of
      choice which the legislature is presumed to have intended. Even  in  a
      case where the decision is left entirely  to  the  discretion  of  the
      deciding authority without any such legal bounds and if  the  decision
      is taken fairly and objectively, the court will not interfere  on  the
      ground of procedural fairness to a  person  whose  interest  based  on
      legitimate expectation might be affected. For instance if an authority
      who has full discretion to grant a licence prefers an existing licence
      holder to a new applicant, the decision cannot be interfered  with  on
      the ground of legitimate expectation entertained by the new  applicant
      applying the principles of natural justice. It can therefore  be  seen
      that legitimate expectation can at the most  be  one  of  the  grounds
      which may give rise to judicial review but the granting of  relief  is
      very much limited. It  would  thus  appear  that  there  are  stronger
      reasons  as  to  why  the  legitimate  expectation   should   not   be
      substantively protected than the  reasons  as  to  why  it  should  be
      protected. In other words such a legal obligation exists whenever  the
      case supporting the same in terms of  legal  principles  of  different
      sorts, is stronger than the case against it. As observed  in  Attorney
      General for New South Wales case: [(1990) 64 Aust LJR 327]: “To strike
      down the exercise of administrative power  solely  on  the  ground  of
      avoiding the disappointment  of  the  legitimate  expectations  of  an
      individual would be to set the courts adrift on a featureless  sea  of
      pragmatism. Moreover, the notion of a legitimate expectation  (falling
      short of  a  legal  right)  is  too  nebulous  to  form  a  basis  for
      invalidating the exercise of  a  power  when  its  exercise  otherwise
      accords with law.” If a denial of legitimate expectation  in  a  given
      case  amounts  to  denial  of  right  guaranteed  or   is   arbitrary,
      discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or violation of
      principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well-</blockquote>
<p id="p_228">      known grounds  attracting  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_418">Article  14</a>  but  a  claim  based  on  mere
      legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give  a
      right to invoke these principles. It can be  one  of  the  grounds  to
      consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision
      is violative of these principles warranting interference.  It  depends
      very much on the  facts  and  the  recognised  general  principles  of
      administrative law  applicable  to  such  facts  and  the  concept  of
      legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit to a long  list  of
      concepts fashioned by the courts  for  the  review  of  administrative
      action, must be restricted to the general legal limitations applicable
      and binding the manner of the future exercise of administrative  power
      in a particular case.  It  follows  that  the  concept  of  legitimate
      expectation is “not the key which  unlocks  the  treasury  of  natural
      justice and it ought not to unlock the gates which shuts the court out
      of review on the merits”, particularly when the element of speculation
      and uncertainty is inherent in that  very  concept.  As  cautioned  in
      Attorney General for New South Wales case the courts  should  restrain
      themselves and restrict such claims duly to the legal limitations.  It
      is a well-meant  caution.  Otherwise  a  resourceful  litigant  having
      vested interests in contracts, licences etc. can successfully  indulge
      in  getting  welfare  activities  mandated  by  directive   principles
      thwarted to further his own interests. The  caution,  particularly  in
      the changing scenario, becomes all the more important.”

While  observing  as  above,  the  Court  observed  that  legitimacy  of  an
expectation could be inferred only if it was founded on the sanction of  law
or custom or an  established  procedure  followed  in  regular  and  natural
sequence. Every such legitimate expectation  does  not  by  itself  fructify
into a right  and,  therefore,  it  does  not  amount  to  a  right  in  the
conventional sense.

doctrine of legitimate expectation in paras 3,  4  and  5  (Pages.  272-273)
stated as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_169">           “3………The doctrine of legitimate expectation plays no  role  when
           the appropriate authority is empowered to take a decision by  an
           executive policy or under law. The court leaves the authority to
           decide  its  full  range  of  choice  within  the  executive  or
           legislative power. In  matters  of  economic  policy,  it  is  a
           settled law that the court gives a large leeway to the executive
           and the legislature. Granting licences for import or  export  is
           by  executive  or  legislative  policy.  Government  would  take
           diverse factors for formulating the policy for import or  export
           of the goods granting relatively greater priorities  to  various
           items in the overall larger  interest  of  the  economy  of  the
           country. It is, therefore, by exercise of the power given to the
           executive or as the case may be, the legislature is  at  liberty
           to evolve such policies.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_170">           4. An applicant has no vested right to  have  export  or  import
           licences in terms of the policies in force at the  date  of  his
           making application. For obvious reasons,  granting  of  licences
           depends upon the policy prevailing on the date of the  grant  of
           the licence or permit. The  authority  concerned  may  be  in  a
           better position to have the overall picture of  diverse  factors
           to grant permit or refuse  to  grant  permission  to  import  or
           export goods. The  decision,  therefore,  would  be  taken  from
           diverse economic perspectives which the executive is in a better
           informed position unless, as we have stated earlier, the refusal
           is mala fide or is an abuse of the power in which  event  it  is
           for the applicant to plead and prove to the satisfaction of  the
           court that the refusal was vitiated by the above factors.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_171">           5. It would, therefore, be clear that grant of  licence  depends
           upon the policy prevailing as on the date of the  grant  of  the
           licence. The court, therefore, would  not  bind  the  Government
           with a policy which was existing on the date of  application  as
           per previous  policy.  A  prior  decision  would  not  bind  the
           Government for  all  times  to  come.  When  the  Government  is
           satisfied that change in the policy was necessary in the  public
           interest, it would be entitled to revise the policy and lay down
           new policy. The court, therefore, would  prefer  to  allow  free
           play to the Government to evolve fiscal  policy  in  the  public
           interest and to act upon the same. Equally,  the  Government  is
           left free to determine priorities in the matters of  allocations
           or allotments or utilisation  of  its  finances  in  the  public
           interest.  It  is  equally  entitled,  therefore,  to  issue  or
           withdraw or modify the export or  import  policy  in  accordance
           with  the  scheme  evolved.  We,  therefore,   hold   that   the
           petitioners have no vested or accrued right for the issuance  of
           permits on the MEE or NQE, nor is the Government  bound  by  its
           previous policy. It would be open to the  Government  to  evolve
           the new schemes and the petitioners would get  their  legitimate
           expectations accomplished in accordance with either of  the  two
           schemes subject to their satisfying the conditions  required  in
           the  scheme.  The  High  Court,  therefore,  was  right  in  its
           conclusion that the Government is not barred by the promises  or
           legitimate expectations from evolving new policy in the impugned
           notification.”

held that  the  doctrine  of  legitimate  expectation  had  been  judicially

expectation would be too nebulous  a  ground  for  setting  aside  a  public
exercise by law and it would be necessary that  a  ground  recognized  under

</p><p id="p_233">153.        It is not necessary to multiply the decisions of  this  Court  .
Suffice it to observe that the  following  principles  in  relation  to  the
doctrine of legitimate expectation are now well established:
</p>
<p id="p_234">(i)    The  doctrine  of  legitimate  expectation  can  be  invoked   as   a
      substantive and enforceable right.
</p>
<p id="p_235">(ii)  The doctrine of legitimate expectation is founded on the principle  of
      reasonableness and fairness. The doctrine arises out of principles  of
      natural justice and  there  are  parallels  between  the  doctrine  of
      legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel.
</p>
<p id="p_236">(iii) Where the decision of an authority is founded  in public  interest  as
      per executive policy or law, the court would be reluctant to interfere
      with such decision by invoking  doctrine  of  legitimate  expectation.
      The legitimate  expectation  doctrine  cannot  be  invoked  to  fetter
      changes in administrative policy if it is in the public interest to do
      so.
</p>
<p id="p_237">(iv)  The legitimate expectation is   different  from  anticipation  and  an
      anticipation  cannot  amount  to  an  assertible   expectation.   Such
      expectation should be justifiable, legitimate and protectable.
</p>
<p id="p_238">(v)    The  protection  of  legitimate  expectation  does  not  require  the
      fulfillment of the expectation where  an  overriding  public  interest
      requires otherwise. In other words, personal benefit must give way  to
      public interest and the doctrine of legitimate expectation  would  not
      be invoked which could block public interest for private benefit.

<p id="p_239">Whether  doctrines  of  promissory  estoppel  and   legitimate   expectation
attracted

</p><p id="p_240">154.        I may now examine whether the doctrines of  promissory  estoppel
and the legitimate expectation help the appellants in obtaining the  reliefs
claimed by them and whether the actions of  the  State  Government  and  the
Central Government are  liable to be set aside by applying these doctrines.
</p><p id="p_241">155.        Each of the  appellants  has  raised  the  pleas  of  promissory
estoppel and legitimate expectation based on  its  own  facts.   It  is  not
necessary to narrate facts in each appeal with  regard  to  these  pleas  as
stipulations in the MOUs entered into between the respective appellants  and
the State Government are broadly similar. For the sake of  convenience,  the
broad features in the matter of Adhunik may be considered. The MOU was  made
between the State Government  and Adhunik on February 26, 2004.  Adhunik  is
involved in diversified activities such as production  of  sponge  iron  and
steel, generating power etc.  The  preamble  to  the  MOU  states  that  the
Government of Jharkhand is desirous of utilization of its natural  resources
and rapid industrialization of the State and  has  been  making  efforts  to
facilitate setting up of  new  industries  in  different  locations  in  the
State. It is stated in  paragraph  2  of  the  MOU,  “in  this  context  the
Government  of  Jharkhand  is  willing  to  extend  assistance  to  suitable
promoters to set up new industries” (emphasis supplied).  Adhunik  expressed
desire of setting up manufacturing/generating facilities  in  the  State  of
Jharkhand.  Proposed Phase-I comprised of setting up Sponge Iron  Plant  and
Pelletaisation Plant while Phase-II comprised of Sponge  Iron  Plant,  Power
Plant, Coal Washery, Mini Blast Furnace, Steel Melting/LD/IF and   Iron  Ore
Mining and Phase-III comprised of establishment of Power Plant.  Para  4  of
MOU states  that  Adhunik  requires  help  and   cooperation  of  the  State
Government  in several areas to enable them  to  construct,  commission  and
operate the project. The  State  Government’s  willingness   to  extend  all
possible help and cooperation is stated in the above  MOU.     Para  4.3  of
MOU records that  the State Government shall assist in  selecting  the  area
for Adhunik for iron ore and  other  minerals  as  per  requirement  of  the
company depending upon quality and  quantity.   The  State  Government  also
agreed to grant mineral concession as per existing Acts and Rules.
</p><p id="p_242">156.        In pursuance of  the above MOU, the  State  Government   through
its Deputy Secretary, Mining and  Geology  Department  recommended   to  the
Government of India through its Joint Director, Mining  Ministry  on  August
4, 2004 to grant prior approval under <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_423">Section 11(5)</a>  and  <a href="/doc/121033656/" id="a_424">Section   5(1)</a>  of
the 1957 Act  for grant of  mining lease to Adhunik  for  a   period  of  30
years in the area of 426.875 hectares. The reasons for  such  recommendation
were stated by the State Government  in  the  above  communication.  In  the
above communication, it was stated that Adhunik  had  signed  MOU  with  the
State Government for making a  capital  investment  of  Rs.  790  crores  in
establishment of an industry based on  iron ore mineral in  the  State.  The
steps taken by Adhunik were also highlighted.
</p><p id="p_243">157.        Adhunik’s case is that on the basis of definite  commitment  and
firm promise made by the State Government for  grant  of  captive  mines  as
stipulated in   the  MOU  and   the  State’s  Industrial  Policy,  it  acted
immediately on the MOU  and  has  invested  more  than  Rs.  100  crores  to
construct and commission the plant and facilities in Phase-I of the MOU  and
  it  has   employed  about  3500  people  directly   and   indirectly   for
construction and operation of plant in Phase-I.  According  to  Adhunik,  it
has ordered equipments and machinery for Phase-II and Phase-III  at  a  cost
of Rs. 25 crores and has also made further financial  commitments  for  more
than Rs. 1000 crore to set up the expansion.  Adhunik claims  to  have  also
borrowed a sum of Rs. 60 crores from banks and  financial  institutions  and
invested that sum  in the proposed project.
</p><p id="p_244">158.        According to Adhunik, no integrated steel plant can   be  viable
in the State of Jharkhand without captive iron ore  mines  and  without  the
definite promise of the State Government to grant the captive mines  and  it
would not have acted on the MOU to make such a huge investment if the  State
Government were not to make available captive iron ore  mines.  Adhunik  has
also stated that in the absence of grant of captive iron ore mines,  it  has
been suffering huge and irreparable losses due to   (a)  shortage in  supply
of iron ore due to poor availability,  (b)  it  has  to  purchase  from  the
market poor quality of iron ore and (c) extra cost due  to  abnormal  market
prices compared to the actual cost of captive iron ore.
</p><p id="p_245">159.         What  the  State  Government   had  expressed  in  MOU  is  its
willingness to extend all possible help and cooperation in  setting  up  the
manufacturing/generating facilities by Adhunik. The clause   in  MOU  states
that the State Government shall assist in selecting the area  for  iron  ore
and other minerals as per requirement of the company depending upon  quality
and quantity. The State Government agreed to  grant  mineral  concession  as
per existing Act and Rules. As a matter of fact, when the  MOU  was  entered
into, the State Government  was not even aware about the reservation of  the
subject mining area for  exploitation  in  the  public  sector.  It  was  on
November 17, 2004 that the District Mining Officer,  Chaibasa  informed  the
Secretary, Department of Mines and Geology,  Government  of  Jharkhand  that
certain portions of Mauza Ghatkuri and the  adjoining  areas  were  reserved
for public sector under 1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by the  erstwhile
State  of  Bihar.  The  District  Mining  Officer  suggested  to  the  State
Government that approval of the Central Government should  be  obtained  for
grant of leases to  the  concerned  applicants.  In  his  communication,  he
stated that the fact of reservation of the subject  area  in  public  sector
vide 1962 and 1969  Notifications  was  brought  to  the  knowledge  of  the
Director of Mines, Jharkhand but he did not  take  any  timely  or  adequate
action in the matter. In view of the fact that the subject mining  area  had
been  reserved  for  exploitation  in  pubic  sector  under  1962  and  1969
Notifications, in my opinion, the stipulation in  the  MOU  that  the  State
Government shall assist in  selecting  the  area  for  iron  ore  and  other
minerals as per requirement of the company   and  the  commitment  to  grant
mineral concession  cannot be enforced.  For one,  the  stipulation  in  the
MOU  is  not  unconditional.   The  above   commitment   is   dependent   on
availability and as per existing law.   Two,  if  the  State  Government  is
asked to do what it represented to do under the MOU then that  would  amount
to asking the State Government to  do  something  in  breach  of  these  two
Notifications which continue to hold the field. The doctrine  of  promissory
estoppel is not attracted in the present facts,  particularly when   promise
was made – assuming that  some of the clauses in  the MOU amount to  promise
– in a mistaken belief and in ignorance of the  position  that  the  subject
land was not available for iron ore mining in the private sector.  I do  not
think that the State Government can  be  compelled  to  carry  out  what  it
cannot do in the existing state of  affairs   in  view   of  1962  and  1969
Notifications.   In my opinion,  the State Government  cannot be held to  be
bound by its commitments or  assurances or representations made in  the  MOU
because   by   enforcement   of   such   commitments   or   assurances    or
representations, the object sought to be  achieved  by  reservation  of  the
subject area is likely to be  defeated  and  thereby  affecting  the  public
interest.   The  overriding  public  interest  also   persuades  me  in  not
invoking the doctrines of promissory estoppel  and  legitimate  expectation.
For the self-same  reasons none of the appellants is entitled to any  relief
based on these doctrines; their  case is no better.
</p><p id="p_246">160.        As a matter of  fact,  on  coming  to  know  of  1962  and  1969
Notifications, the State Government  withdrew the proposals  which  it  made
to the appellants and reiterated the reservation by its  Notification  dated
October 27, 2006 expressly “in public interest and in  the  larger  interest
of the State”.
</p><p id="p_247">161.         The  act  of  the   State   Government   in   withdrawing   the
recommendations made by it to the Central Government in  the  above  factual
and legal backdrop cannot be said to be bad in  law  on  the  touchstone  of
doctrine of  promissory estoppel as well as legitimate expectation. The  act
 of the State Government is neither unfair  nor  arbitrary  nor  it  suffers
from the principles  of  natural  justice.  The  Government  of  India  upon
examination of the proposals rejected them on the ground that  subject  area
was  under  reservation  and  not  available  for  exploitation  by  private
parties. In these circumstances, if the clauses in  the MOU are  allowed  to
be carried out,  it would tantamount to enforcement  of  promise,  assurance
or representation which  is  against   law,   public  interest  and   public
policy which I am afraid cannot be permitted.
</p><p id="p_248">162.        On behalf of the appellants, it was also argued  that  the  1962
and 1969 Notifications had remained in disuse for about 40 years and  it  is
reasonable to infer that these two  Notifications  no  longer  operated.  In
this regard, the doctrine of quasi repeal by  desuetude  was  sought  to  be
invoked.
</p>
<p id="p_249">Doctrine of desuetude
</p><p id="p_250">163.        The doctrine  of  desuetude  and  its  applicability  in  Indian
Jurisprudence have been considered by this Court on more than one  occasion.
In the case of <a href="/doc/615661/" id="a_425">State of Maharashtra v. Narayan Shamrao Puranik  &amp;  Ors</a>.[74],
the Court noted the decision of  Scrutton,  L.J.  in  R.  v.  London  County
Council[75] and the view of renowned author Allen in  “Law  in  the  Making”
and observed that the rule concerning desuetude has always met with  general
disfavour. It was also held that a statute can be abrogated only by  express
or implied repeal; it cannot  fall  into  desuetude  or  become  inoperative
through obsolescence or by lapse of time.
</p>
<p id="p_251">164.        In Bharat Forge Co. Ltd.v, inter alia, the argument  was  raised
that the Notifications of June 17, 1918 have not been implemented till  date
and therefore these  Notifications  were  dead  letter  and  stood  repealed
“quasily”.  A three-Judge Bench of this Court entered into consideration  of
the doctrine of desuetude elaborately. After noticing the  English  law  and
Scots law in regard to the  doctrine  of  desuetude,  the  Court  noted  the
doctrine   of   desuetude   explained   in   Francis   Bennion’s   Statutory
Interpretation; Craies Statute Law (7th Edn.)  and  Lord  Mackay’s  view  in
Brown v. Magistrate of Edinburgh[76].
</p><p id="p_252">165.        The Court also referred to “Repeal and Desuetude  of  Statutes”,
by  Aubrey L. Diamond wherein a reference has  been  made  to  the  view  of
Lord Denning, M.R. in Buckoke v. Greater London Council[77]. Having  noticed
as above, the Court in paragraph 34 (pages 446-447) of the Report stated :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_172">           “34. Though in India the doctrine of desuetude does  not  appear
           to have been used so far to hold  that  any  statute  has  stood
           repealed because of  this  process,  we  find  no  objection  in
           principle to apply this doctrine to our statutes as  well.  This
           is for the reason that a citizen should know whether, despite  a
           statute having been in disuse for long duration  and  instead  a
           contrary practice being in use, he is still required to  act  as
           per the “dead letter”. We would think it would advance the cause
           of justice to accept the application of doctrine of desuetude in
           our country also. Our soil is ready to  accept  this  principle;
           indeed, there is need  for  its  implantation,  because  persons
           residing in free India,  who  have  assured  fundamental  rights
           including what has been stated in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_426">Article 21</a>, must be  protected
           from their being, say, prosecuted and punished for violation  of
           a law which has become “dead letter”. A new path is,  therefore,
           required to be laid and trodden.”

</blockquote><p id="p_253">166.        <a href="/doc/1281375/" id="a_427">In Cantonment Board, MHOW and Anr. v. M.P. State Road  Transport
Coroporation</a>[78], this Court had an occasion to  consider  the  doctrine  of
desuetude while considering the submission that  the  provisions  of  Madhya
Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1947  stood  repealed  having  been  in
disuse. The Court considered the earlier decision in Bharat Forge Co.  Ltd.v
 and held that  to  apply   principle  of  desuetude  it  was  necessary  to
establish that the statute in question had been in disuse for long  and  the
contrary practice of some duration  has  evolved.  It  was  also  held  that
neither of these two facts  has been satisfied in  the  case  and  therefore
the doctrine of desuetude had no application.
</p>
<p id="p_254">167.        From the above, the essentials of  doctrine of desuetude may  be
summarized as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_173">        (i)      The doctrine  of  desuetude  denotes  principle  of  quasi
              repeal but this doctrine is ordinarily seen with disfavour.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_174">          ii)      Although doctrine of desuetude has been made  applicable
              in India on few occasions  but  for  its  applicability,  two
              factors, namely, (i) that the statute or legislation has  not
              been in operation for very considerable period and  (ii)  the
              contrary practice has been followed over  a  period  of  time
              must be clearly satisfied.  Both  ingredients  are  essential
              and want of anyone of them would not attract the doctrine  of
              desuetude.  In other words, a mere neglect of  a  statute  or
              legislation over a period of time is not  sufficient  but  it
              must be firmly established  that  not  only  the  statute  or
              legislation was completely neglected but  also  the  practice
              contrary to such statute or legislation has been followed for
              a considerable long period.
</blockquote>



<p id="p_255">Whether doctrine  of  desuetude  attracted  in  respect  of  1962  and  1969
Notifications

</p><p id="p_256">168.        Insofar as 1962 and 1969 Notifications are concerned,  I  am  of
the view that doctrine of desuetude is  not  attracted  for  more  than  one
reason. In the first place,  the Notifications are of 1962 and 1969 and non-
implementation of such Notifications for 30-35 years is  not  that   long  a
period  which  may  satisfy  the  first  requirement  of  the  doctrine   of
desuetude,  namely,  that  the  statute  or  legislation  has  not  been  in
operation for a very considerable period. Moreover, State of Jharkhand  came
into existence on November 15, 2000 and it can hardly be said that 1962  and
1969 Notifications remained neglected by the State  Government  for  a  very
considerable period. As a matter of fact,  in  2006,  the  State  Government
issued a Notification mentioning therein about the reservation made by  1962
and 1969 Notifications. Thus, the first ingredient necessary for  invocation
of doctrine of desuetude is not satisfied. Secondly, and  more  importantly,
even if it is assumed in  favour  of  the  appellants  that  1962  and  1969
Notifications remained in disuse for a considerable period having  not  been
implemented for more than 30-35 years, the second necessary ingredient  that
a practice contrary to the above  Notifications  has  been  followed  for  a
considerable  long  period  and  such  contrary  practice  has  been  firmly
established is totally absent.   As a matter of fact, except stray grant  of
mining lease for a very small portion of the reserved area  to  one  or  two
parties there is nothing to suggest much less establish the  contrary  usage
or contrary practice that the  reservation made  in  the  two  Notifications
has been given a complete go by.
</p>

<p id="p_257">Additional submissions on behalf of Monnet
</p><p id="p_258">169.        The main submissions raised on behalf of the  appellants  having
been dealt with, I may now consider certain additional submissions  made  on
behalf of Monnet. It was argued by Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior  counsel
for  Monnet  that  the  State  Government  in  its  letter  to  recall   the
recommendation made in  favour  of  the  appellant  set  up  the  ground  of
overlapping with the lease of  Rungta   but  it  mala  fide  suppressed  the
fact of expiry of lease of Rungta  in 1995 and also that the said  area  had
been  notified for regrant in the Official Gazette  on  July  3,  1996.   He
would contend that  Rule 24A of the 1960 Rules provides for  an  application
for renewal of lease to be made one year prior to the expiry  of  lease  but
no application for  renewal  was  made  by  Rungta  within  this  time  and,
therefore,  Rungta  had no legal right over the overlapping area.
</p>
<p id="p_259">170.        It was  submitted by Mr.  Ranjit  Kumar  that  the  appellant  –
Monnet had produced two maps before the High Court and this Court  (one  was
prepared by the District Mining Officer in  2004)  that  depicted  that  the
area recommended for grant to the appellant was  not  covered  by   1962  or
1969 Notifications.
</p><p id="p_260">171.        It was submitted on behalf of  Monnet that the case  of   Monnet
was identical to the case of M/s. Bihar  Sponge  Iron  Ltd.  and  the  State
Government had discriminated against the appellant  vis-à-vis  the  case  of
M/s. Bihar Sponge Iron Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_261">172.        Mr. Ranjit Kumar also submitted that there  has  been  violation
of the statutory right of hearing in terms of Rule 26  of  the  1960  Rules.
He submitted that  order  was  not  communicated  to  Monnet  by  the  State
Government  and thereby its remedy under Rule 54 of  1960  Rules  was  taken
away.  The violation of principles of natural justice goes to  the  root  of
the matter and on that ground alone the decision of the State Government  to
recall the recommendation and the decision  of  the  Central  Government  in
summarily rejecting and returning application are bad in  law.  Reliance  in
this regard was placed on a decision of Privy  Council  in  <a href="/doc/1107594/" id="a_428">Nazir  Ahmad  v.
King-Emperor</a>[79]   and  also  a  decision  of  this   Court   in   <a href="/doc/967935/" id="a_429">Nagarjuna
Construction Company Ltd. v. Government of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>.[80].
</p>
<p id="p_262">173.        Mr. Ranjit Kumar  also argued that once recommendation was  made
by it to the Central Government, in view of proviso  to   Rule  63A  of  the
1960 Rules, the State Government had become functus officio and  ceased   to
have any power to recall the  recommendation  already  made  on  any  ground
whatsoever.  In this regard he relied  upon  <a href="/doc/937834/" id="a_430">Jayalakshmi  Coelho  v.  Oswald
Joseph Coelho</a>[81].
</p>
<p id="p_263">174.        Relying upon the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1831036/" id="a_431">Mohinder  Singh  Gill
and Anr. v. The Chief Election Commissioner, New  Delhi,  &amp;  Ors</a>.,[82]    it
was submitted that the reasons originally given in an  administrative  order
cannot be supplanted by other reasons in the affidavits or pleadings  before
the Court.  He submitted that as regards Monnet, the initial  reason by  the
State Government was not founded on reservation but later  on  it  tried  to
bring the ground of reservation in fore by supplanting reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_264">175.        Mr. Ranjit Kumar vehemently contended  that  as  per  the  State
Government’s own case initially, the land that was  recommended  for  mining
lease to Monnet was not under the reserved  area  and,  therefore,  Monnet’s
writ petition ought not to have  been  heard  and  decided  with  the  group
matters.  He also referred  to  interim  order  passed  by  this  Court   on
August 18, 2008, the meeting that took place between the Central  Government
and the State Government pursuant thereto and the subsequent  interim  order
of this Court dated December 15, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_265">176.        I have  carefully  considered  the  submissions  of  Mr.  Ranjit
Kumar.   Most of the above submissions  were not argued on behalf of  Monnet
before the High Court.  The  submissions  were  confined  to  the  issue  of
reservation,   the  legality  and  validity   of   1962,   1969   and   2006
Notifications,  consequent  illegal  action  of  the  State  Government   in
recalling the recommendation and of  the  Central  Government  in  summarily
rejecting the appellant’s application.
</p>
<p id="p_266">177.        In paragraph 17 of the impugned judgment, the arguments  of  the
learned senior counsel  for  Monnet  have  been  noticed.     It  transpires
therefrom  that many of the above arguments  were  not   advanced  including
the issue  of  overlapping  with  the  area  of   Rungta.  In  the  list  of
dates/synopsis of the special leave petition, Monnet  has  not   raised  any
grievance that  arguments made on its behalf  before  the  High  Court  were
not correctly recorded or the High Court failed to consider any or  some  of
its  arguments. Criticism of the High Court judgment is thus  not  justified
and I am not inclined to go into above submissions  of Mr. Ranjit Kumar  for
the first time.
</p>
<p id="p_267">178.        It is too late in the day for  Monnet to contend that  its  case
could not have been decided with group matters and in any  case  the  matter
should be remanded to the High Court  for  reconsideration  on  the  issues,
namely, (a) whether the area recommended for the appellant  was  overlapping
with  Rungta  only to the  extent  of  102.25  hectares  out  of  total  705
hectares recommended for  appellant;  (b)  whether  after  expiry  of  lease
Rungta’s  area was renotified for grant in 1996; (c)  what  was  the  reason
for the State Government to withdraw the recommendation made  in  favour  of
the appellant when the alleged overlapping with  Rungta   was  only  to  the
extent  of  102.25  hectares  and   (d)   is   withdrawal   of   appellant’s
recommendation arbitrary when  reservation vide 1962 Notification   did  not
apply to the area recommended in favour of the appellants.    Monnet’s  writ
petition was decided by the High Court with group matters as  the  arguments
advanced on its behalf were identical to the arguments which were  canvassed
on behalf of other writ petitioners.   The  State  Government  recalled  its
recommendations  by  a  common  communication  and  the  Central  Government
returned the recommendations and  rejected  applications  for  mining  lease
made by the writ petitioners by a common order.
</p>
<p id="p_268">179.         The  State  Government   had   full   power   to   recall   the
recommendation made to the Central Government for some good  reason.    Once
1962 and 1969 Notifications issued by the erstwhile State of Bihar and  2006
Notification issued by the State of Jharkhand  have been found by me  to  be
valid and legal, the submissions of Mr. Ranjit Kumar  noted  above  pale  in
insignificance and are not enough to invalidate  the  action  of  the  State
Government in recalling the recommendation made in favour  of  Monnet.   The
valid reservation of subject mining area for exploitation in  public  sector
disentitles Monnet  - as well as other appellants - to any relief.
</p><p id="p_269">180.        It is well settled that no one has legal or vested right to  the
grant or renewal of a mining lease. Monnet cannot claim a  legal  or  vested
right for grant of the mining lease. It is true  that  by  the  MOU  entered
into between the State Government and Monnet certain commitments  were  made
by the State Government  but  firstly,   such  MOU  is  not  a  contract  as
contemplated  under  <a href="/doc/1525624/" id="a_432">Article  299(1)</a>  of  the  Constitution  of  India   and
secondly, in grant of mining lease of a property of  the  State,  the  State
Government has a discretion to grant or refuse to grant  any  mining  lease.
Obviously, the  State Government is required  to  exercise  its  discretion,
subject to the requirement of law.   In  view  of  the  fact  that  area  is
reserved for exploitation of mineral in public sector,  it  cannot  be  said
that the discretion exercised by  the  State  Government  suffers  from  any
legal flaw.
</p>
<p id="p_270">181.        The case of  discrimination  vis-a-vis  M/s  Bihar  Sponge  Iron
Limited argued on behalf  of Monnet was not pressed before  High  Court  and
is not at all  established.  The  argument  with  regard  to   violation  of
principles of  natural  justice  is  also  devoid  of  any  substance.   The
recommendation in favour of Monnet to the Central Government was  simply   a
proposal with certain pre-conditions.  For  withdrawal of such  proposal  by
the State Government,  in my view,  no notice was  legally  required  to  be
given.  Moreover, no prejudice has been caused  to  it  by  not  giving  any
notice before recalling the recommendation as it  had  no  legal  or  vested
right to the grant of mining lease.  The area is not available for grant  of
mining lease in the private sector.  For all these reasons, I  do  not  find
that the case of Monnet stands differently  from the other appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_271">Conclusion

</p><p id="p_272">182.        In view of the foregoing reasons, there is  no  merit  in  these
appeals and they are dismissed.  There shall be no order as to costs.

<p id="p_280">             All these  appellants  claim  to  be  companies  interested  in
developing iron and steel projects, and therefore sought grant of leases  of
iron-ore mines situated in the state of Jharkhand. Applications of ten  such
companies including the appellants  were  forwarded  by  the  Government  of
Jharkhand sometime around August  2004  to  the  Union  of  India,  for  its
consideration for  grant  of  lease  in  certain  areas.   Subsequently,  on
realising that those areas were reserved  for  exploitation  in  the  public
sector, the State Government by  its  letter  dated  13.09.2005,  sought  to
withdraw nine of these proposals including  those  of  all  the  appellants.
The Central Government however, did not merely return  the  nine  proposals,
but rejected the  same  by  its  letter  dated  6.3.2006  addressed  to  the
Government of Jharkhand.  All these appellants therefore,  along  with  some
others filed writ petitions to challenge these two letters  dated  13.9.2005
and 6.3.2006, and sought a direction to grant the mining leases  to them  in
the proposed areas, and to seek  appropriate  reliefs.  The  Writ  Petitions
filed by the six appellants herein were respectively bearing following  nos.
(1) W.P. (C) No. 4151 of 2006, (2) W.P. (C) No. 1769 of 2006, (3)  W.P.  (C)
No. 2629 of 2006, (4) W.P. (C) No. 5527 of 2006, (5) W.P. (C)  No.  7636  of
2006 and (6) W.P. (C) No. 7363 of 2006.    All  those  writ  petitions  were
dismissed by a Division Bench of  the  Jharkhand  High  Court  by  a  common
judgment and order dated 4.4.2007.  Being aggrieved  by  the  same,  six  of
them have filed these appeals to this Court.
</p><p id="p_281">2.          An  interim  order  came  to  be  passed  in  these  appeals  on
7.5.2007, that until further orders no fresh  leases  shall  be  granted  in
respect of the disputed mining area. We may note  that  at  one  stage  same
workable arrangements were  considered  by  this  Court  but  they  did  not
materialise. These appeals have been admitted thereafter on 30.4.2009.   The
Union of India and the State of Jharkhand are the main  contestants  in  all
these appeals, though  a  few  other  entities  like  the  National  Mineral
Development Corporation (NMDC), Tata Iron Steel Company (TISCO)  and  Arclor
Mittal (India) Ltd. have intervened to oppose them. Learned Senior  Counsels
Sarvashri C.A. Sunderam, Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, Ranjit Kumar, Dhruv  Mehta,  Dr.
Abhishek Manu Singhvi, L. Nageswara Rao, and G.C. Bharuka have  appeared  in
support of these appeals.  Senior Counsels Shri Dilip Sinha, and Shri  Ashok
Bhan  have  appeared  for  the  State  of  Jharkhand,  and  Union  of  India
respectively.  Shri P.S. Narasimha, Senior  counsel  for  NMDC,  Shri  Vikas
Singh, Senior Counsel for TISCO, Shri  Krishnan  Venugopal,  Senior  counsel
for Arclor Mittal (India) Ltd. and Shri J.K. Das, learned  counsel  for  M/s
Rungta Sons Pvt. Ltd., have appeared to oppose these appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_282">      Facts leading to these appeals:-
</p>
<p id="p_283">3.          The facts in all these appeals are by and large similar. We  may
refer to the facts of the first Civil Appeal  in  the  case  of  M/s  Monnet
Ispat and Energy Ltd. (for short ‘Monnet’) as somewhat  representative.   It
is the case of Monnet that it wanted to set-up an iron and  steel  plant  in
the State of Jharkhand.  It was ready to invest an amount of Rs.1400  crores
on this project, and for that purpose it was interested in the allotment  of
iron and manganese ore mines situated in the Ghatkhuri Forest area  of  West
Singhbhum District (which has its headquarters at Chaibasa).  A  high  level
meeting was held  in  Ranchi  for  that  purpose  on  7.7.2002  between  the
officers of Monnet and Jharkhand Government, subsequent  to  which,  minutes
of the meeting were drawn recording the discussion between the two  parties.
 Thereafter, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was arrived at between  the
Government of Jharkhand and Monnet on 5.2.2003, for the establishment of  an
integrated steel plant. The MOU  reaffirmed  the  commitment  of  Monnet  to
establish the  integrated  steel  plant,  and  that  of  the  Government  of
Jharkhand to provide therefor the land containing  iron  and  manganese  ore
mines, a coal block and other facilities.  The MOU recorded that  the  plant
will produce sponge iron of the capacity of 4  lac  tonnes  per  annum,  and
mild steel of 2 lac tonnes  and  alloy  steel  of  2  lac  tonnes.   It  was
expected to provide employment to 10,000 persons.   The  MOU  recorded  that
the  State  Government  agrees  to  recommend  the  proposal  of  Monnet  to
Government of India, for the allotment of  areas  containing  iron  ore  and
manganese ore deposits and coal blocks situated in Ghatkhuri Forest area  of
West Singhbhum District. This clause reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_175">            III. MINES:
</blockquote>                  COAL:……..
<p id="p_284">              IRON ORE AND MANGANESE ORE: The State  Government  agrees  to
           recommend to Government of India for the allotment of  iron  ore
           and  manganese  ore  deposits  expected  to  contain  sufficient
           reserves to cater the  needs  of  the  project.   The  iron  ore
           reserves suitable for  sponge  iron  making  as  identified  are
           Ghatkhuri area in Chaibasa District.  The State Government  also
           agrees to recommend to Government  of  India  for  allotment  of
           additional mines able deposits in West Singhbhum area  to  cater
           the project need.”


 We may as well note that paragraph VII (d) of the MOU stated as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_176">              In  the  event   of   non-implementation   of   the   project,
          support/commitment of the State Government in  the  MOU  shall  be
          deemed to be withdrawn.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_285">4.          Accordingly, the Jharkhand  Government  vide  its  letter  dated
6.8.2004 recommended the proposal of Monnet to Union of India under  <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_433">Section
5</a> (1) and 11 (5) of the Mines  and  Minerals  (Development  and  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_434">Regulation)
Act</a>, 1957 (hereinafter referred to “<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_435">MMDR  Act</a>”).   The  letter  stated  that
some 58 applications were received, seeking grant of the mining leases  over
an area of 3566.54 hectares in Ghatkhuri reserved  forest.   All  applicants
were  given  sufficient  opportunity  of  hearing.   As  far  as  Monnet  is
concerned,  State  Government  had  recommended  the  amended  area  of  705
hectares for the consent of the Central Government for grant of lease  under
<a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_436">Section 5</a> (1) of the Act.  The letter also stated that  priority  was  being
given to Monnet in terms of <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_437">Section 11</a> (3) of the Act on the  basis  of  its
technical mineral based industry and financial capacity.
</p>
<p id="p_286">5.          On receiving that application and  after  considering  that  the
mining lease was to be granted  for  a  period  of  30  years,  the  Central
Government asked the State Government, vide its letter  dated  6.9.2004,  to
forward its justification in support of the proposal, since in its  view  an
adequate justification, in the interest  of  mineral  development,  had  not
been sent.  The State Government explained  its  position,  vide  its  reply
dated 17.11.2004, as to why priority was given to  Monnet,  and  sought  the
approval of Government of India under <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_438">Sections 5</a> (1)  and  11  (5)  of  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_439">MMDR
Act</a>.  It enclosed therewith a comparative statement  of  the  claims  of  58
applicants who had applied for  grant  of  mining  leases  of  iron  ore  on
3566.54 hectares area in the reserved forest  at  Mauza  Ghatkhuri  in  West
Singhbhum District.
</p>
<p id="p_287">6.          It so happened that at that stage the  District  Mining  Officer
of Chaibasa brought it to the notice of the concerned authorities  of  State
Government, by his letter dated 17.11.2004,  that  the  undivided  state  of
Bihar (when Jharkhand was a part of it) had reserved certain areas  for  the
exploitation of minerals in the public sector,  by  its  notification  dated
21.12.1962, and it included the  recommended  area  of  Singhbhum  District.
This  notification  had  been  followed  by  another  notification  of   the
undivided State of Bihar dated 28.2.1969 which reiterated that  an  area  of
168.349 hectares in Ghatkhuri reserved forest block  no.10  in  district  of
Singhbhum was reserved for exploitation of minerals  in  public  sector.   A
copy of the said  notification  had  been  marked  to  the  District  Mining
Officer, Chhaibasa.

State Government,  the  Central  Ministry  of  Mines  by  its  letter  dated

Mines, seeking a meeting of the concerned officers of the  State  Government
and the Ministry of Mines of the Central Government  for  the  clarification
on the following issues:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_177">      (i)   The State Government had rejected even those applicants who were
           prior applicants but were not willing  to  set  up  the  mineral
           based industry in the State.  This stipulated condition of State
           Government is not as per the National Mineral Policy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_178">      (ii)  As against the applicants at Sl. Nos.18, 20, 23, 29, 33, 41,  44
           and 58, the State  Government  had  stated  that  they  had  not
           submitted any solid proposals.  The Central Government wanted to
           know what the State Government meant by ‘solid proposals’.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_179">      (iii) There was wide variation between the area  recommended  and  the
           proposed plant capacity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_180">       (iv)       The total area  of  the  ten  proposals  came  to  3693.05
           hectares whereas the total area  reported  to  be  available  in
           Ghatkhuri was 3566.54 hectares.  It was also stated that in  the
           case of the proposal of M/s Bihar Sponge Iron  Ltd.,  the  total
           area in Ghatkhuri reserve forest was shown as 4692.46 hectares.

<p id="p_305">9.          It was in this  background  that  the  Government  of  Jharkhand
called back nine out of the ten proposals (excluding the one  in  favour  of
Bihar Sponge  Iron  Ltd.),  by  its  letter  dated  13.9.2005.   The  letter
specifically stated that the proposals overlapped  the  areas  reserved  for
the public undertakings and the areas already held by two  other  companies.
This was one of the two letters impugned in the writ petitions to  the  High
Court.  This letter reads as follows:-

           companies for mining of iron ore and Manganese Mineral,  in  the
           reserved  Forest  Land  in  Mauza  Ghat  Kuri   (West   Singhbhu

       On analysis in the department, it has become clear that out  of  the
       10 proposals above said sent in the past, leaving apart Bihar Sponge

       rest of the nine proposals, for consideration as per law,  they  may

the Government of Jharkhand on 6.3.2006.  This is  the  other  letter  which
was under challenge in the writ petitions to the  High  Court.   The  letter

Central Government to reject those very  recommendations.    We  may  record
that  the  Government  of  Jharkhand  had  issued  one   more   notification

described in the 1962 and 1969 notifications will not be  given  to  anyone,

challenged the subsequent notification also.   This  notification  reads  as

appellants and Monnet, except that as far as the appellant in  Civil  Appeal

concerned, it contends that based on the forwarding of its proposal  by  the
State Government to the Central Government, it  had  made  some  substantial
investment.  It had already invested some 82 crores of  rupees  out  of  its
proposed investment of Rs.790 crores, and therefore it had a better case  on
the basis of promissory estoppel.  Additional  material  is  placed  on  the
record of its Civil Appeal in  justification  the  investment  made  by  the
appellant.

various submissions have been raised on behalf of the appellants,  they  are

<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_445">MMDR Act</a> was passed in exercise of the power of the Union  Government  under
List I Entry 54 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution  of  India,  the
State Government had no longer any power to issue the  notifications  making
any  reservations  in  favour  of  public  sector   undertakings   and   the
notifications of the 1962 and 1969 were bad  in  law.   These  notifications
which were defended as being issued under Section 4(a)  of  the  Bihar  Land
Reforms Act, 1950, could not be valid after the passing  of  the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_446">MMDR  Act</a>.
This is because Entry No. 23 List II (State List) of  the  Seventh  Schedule
giving power to  the  State  Government  specifically  stated  that  it  was
subject to the provisions of the entries in List  I  (Union  List)  in  this
behalf.  Entry No. 54 of List I states that Regulation of Mines and  Mineral
development is within the power of the Union Government,  to  the  extent  a
declaration is made by Parliament in that behalf in   public  interest,  and
such a  declaration has been made and is to be found in  <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_447">Section  2</a>  of  the
MMDR Act.  This being the position, the provisions  of  Bihar  Land  Reforms
Act 1950 (Act No. XXX of 1950) <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_448">(Bihar Act</a>,  for  short)  cannot  be  pressed
into service by the respondents.
</p><p id="p_326">(ii)  Shri Sundaram contended that the field was  already  occupied  by  the
<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_449">MMDR Act</a> when these notifications were  issued,  since  the  Parliament  had
already legislated on the field.   <a href="/doc/20877563/" id="a_450">Section 17</a> and <a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_451">17A</a> of the MMDR  Act  give
special power to the Central Government to undertake the  mining  operations
and effect reservations.  <a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_452">Section 18</a> of the Act casts a duty on the  Central
Government to take steps for the conservation and systematic development  of
minerals and for the protection of environment by preventing or  controlling
any pollution which may be caused by the prospecting or  mining  operations.
These powers were not with the State Government.  The  reservations  in  the
notifications of 1962 and 1969 will therefore have to  be  held  as  outside
the powers of the State Government
</p><p id="p_327"> (iii)      This will be the position even when read with Rule  59  (1)  (e)
of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960  (M.C.  Rules  1960  in  short)  which
speaks about reservation of areas  by  the  State  Government  and  re-grant
thereof.  Even the subsequent notification of 27.10.2006,  providing  for  a
joint venture is contrary to 17<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_453">A of MMDR Act</a>, and therefore bad in law.
</p><p id="p_328"> (iv) Shri Sundaram submitted that the High  Court’s  view  that  the  State
Government had  the  inherent  power  over  the  mining  areas  was  equally
erroneous.
</p>
<p id="p_329">14.   (i)   Learned senior counsel  Dr.  Rajeev  Dhawan  appearing  for  the
appellant in C.A. No. 3289/2009 i.e. Jharkhand Ispat Pvt.  Ltd.  (‘Jharkhand
Ispat’ for short) mainly canvassed two submissions. Firstly, in view of  the
federal structure of Indian Constitution, and the provisions  of  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_454">MMDR  Act</a>,
any mining can be done only under the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_455">MMDR  Act</a>  with  Central  permission,
though mining is included is in the State List.  In this behalf, Dr.  Dhawan
took us through the Constitution Bench judgments of this  Court  in  Hingir-
Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Orissa &amp; Ors. reported in AIR  1961
SC 459, State of Orissa &amp; Anr. Vs. M/s M.A. Tulloch &amp; Co.  reported  in  AIR
1964 SC 1284 and Baijnath Kadio Vs. State of Bihar and  Others  reported  in
1969 (3) SCC 838, and submitted that the subsequent judgment of  this  Court
in Amritlal Nathubhai Shah Vs. Union of India reported in 1976 (4)  SCC  108
which has been relied upon by the State of Jharkhand  and  accepted  by  the
High Court to repel the challenge, did not consider  these  three  judgments
and the true import of the propositions laid down therein.
</p>
<p id="p_330">(ii)  Secondly, the Learned Counsel submitted that  the  State  Government’s
decision was ultra-vires to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_456">Section 17A</a> (2) of  the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_457">MMDR  Act</a>.   He  relied
upon Para 6 of the judgment  of  this  Court  in  Janak  Lal  Vs.  State  of
Maharashtra reported in 1989 (4) SCC 121 to draw the distinction between un-
amended Rule 59 and new Rule 59.  In his view,  the  2006  notification  was
also invalid since it was only a revival of 1962 and 1969 notifications.
</p>
<p id="p_331">(iii) It was then submitted that the appellant has also  set  up  a  factory
and  reliance  was  placed  on  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel  and
legitimate expectations.  It was also contended that the  two  notifications
were not acted upon and suffered from Desuetude.  Lastly, it  was  submitted
that the State Government cannot act unreasonably in view of  the  provision
of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_458">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_332">15.         Learned Senior Counsel Shri Ranjit Kumar, appearing  for  Monnet
raised the following additional submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_333">      (i)   The State Government did not have the power  to  issue  the  two
           notifications in 1962 and 1969 under  the  rules  as  they  then
           existed, particularly the notification of 1962, since  the  Rule
           58 of the concerned rules as then existing did not give any such
           power to the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_334">      (ii)  Rule 58 has been  deleted  without  any  saving  clause  by  the
           amendment Act No. 36 of 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_335">      (iii) The two notifications of 1962 and 1969 providing for reservation
           in favour of the public sector undertakings suffered on  account
           of ‘Desuetude’, since they were never acted upon.
</p>
<p id="p_336">      (iv)  In view of the proviso Rule 63A, once a recommendation is  made,
           the State Government becomes functus  officio,  and  it  has  no
           power to recall the recommendation.
</p>
<p id="p_337">      (v)   The right of hearing of Monnet was affected in as  much  as  the
           decision of the State Government to reject its  application  was
           taken behind its back.  It was not provided with any opportunity
           of being heard under Rule 26, of  the  M.C.  Rules  1960  before
           refusing to grant the mining lease.  Besides,  their  remedy  to
           file a revision to the Central Government under Rule 54  thereof
           was affected.
</p>
<p id="p_338">      (vi)  The appellants disputed the fact that at the time  of  rejection
           of  their  applications,  M/s  Rungta  Sons  were   having   any
           subsisting allotment in their favour.  It was submitted that the
           grant in favour of M/s Rungta Sons had already expired,  and  in
           fact they had applied for renewal in 2006.  The area recommended
           to Monnet was not under any previous reservation of  any  public
           sector undertaking or otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_339">      (vii) There was unjustified discrimination in favour of  Bihar  Sponge
           Iron Ltd. since their case was supposed to be similar to that of
           Monnet.
</p>
<p id="p_340">      (viii)      The decision of  the  State  Government  was  hit  by  the
           doctrine of promissory estoppel, since in the  meanwhile  Monnet
           had deposited Rs.50 lacs with the State Government for allotment
           of  land,  and  it  was  taking  further  steps  expecting   the
           allotment.
</p>
<p id="p_341">      (ix)  The provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_459">MMDR Act</a> and the MC Rules will have to  be
           read to mean that the regulatory regime has been taken  over  by
           the Central Government, and the State Government will have to be
           held as without any power to impose reservations.
</p>
<p id="p_342">16.         Learned senior counsel Shri Dhruv Mehta, appearing  for  Prakash
Ispat Ltd. in C.A. No.3290/2009 submitted that as stated in  <a href="/doc/1116044/" id="a_460">Section  14</a>  of
MMDR Act, <a href="/doc/1824949/" id="a_461">Sections 5</a> to <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_462">13</a> of the act do not apply to  minor  minerals,  and
the State Govt’s. power  is  only  to  regulate  the  minor  minerals  under
<a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_463">Section 15</a> of the Act. In this behalf he referred to the  judgment  of  this
Court in D.K. Trivedi and Sons Vs. State of Gujarat reported  in  1986  Supp
(1) SCC 20. He submitted that the rule making power with  respect  to  major
minerals was only with the Central Government.  The State Government had  no
power until Rule 59 was amended in 1980 to provide  reservation  for  public
sector concerning the major minerals. He further submitted that rule  making
power cannot be exercised retrospectively and relied upon  Hukam  Chand  Vs.
Union of India reported in 1972 (2) SCC 601.  He contended that in  view  of
the provision in Rule 59 of the MC  Rules  1960,  an  area  which  has  been
reserved can be made available  for  re-grant  to  private  sector,  and  in
support of this proposition he referred to the judgment  of  this  Court  in
Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys Ltd. VS. Union  of  India  reported  in  1992
Supp (1) SCC 91.
</p>
<p id="p_343">17.          Learned senior  counsel  Shri  Abhishek  Manu  Singhvi  and  L.
Nageswara Rao, appearing for Adhunik  submitted  that  the  High  Court  had
committed an error in relying upon the above referred amended Rule 59.   The
1962 notification was issued when prospecting and mining was not within  the
jurisdiction of the State Government  The judgment  of  this  Court  in  Air
India Vs. Union of India reported in 1995 (4) SCC 734  (para  4  to  8)  was
relied upon to submit that subordinate legislation can  survive  the  repeal
of a statute only when it is saved.   It  was  further  submitted  that  the
impugned notifications were issued without prior  approval  of  the  Central
Government and were therefore bad in law.
</p>
<p id="p_344">18.   (i)     Learned  senior  counsel  Shri  G.C.  Bharuka,  appearing  for
Abhijeet Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.  (‘Abhijeet’  for  short)  submitted  that
Central Government had opened up the minerals for private participants.   In
1962, the Government had no power to issue the notification in  the  absence
of any legislation conferring any  executive  power.   He  relied  upon  the
judgment of this Court in  Bharat  Coking  Coal  Ltd.  Vs.  State  of  Bihar
reported in 1990 (4) SCC 557 (para 19), and submitted  that  the  State  can
act only under a legislation or under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_464">Article 162</a> by  way  of  an  executive
order and not otherwise.   He  submitted  that  the  1962  notification  was
issued under the un-amended Rule 59, and that time there  was  no  power  to
issue such notification.  In his  view  the  subsequent  notification  dated
27.10.2006 which is issued under  <a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_465">Section  17A</a>  (2)  was  also  bad  in  law
because it was issued without the prior approval of the Central Government

</p><p id="p_345">(ii)  It was then submitted by Shri Bharuka, that  Abhijeet’s  proposal  was
sent to the Central Government on 06.08.2004.  State Government withdrew  it
on 13.09.2005, and Central Government rejected it  on  06.03.2006.   In  the
meanwhile the petitioner took steps for  investment.   He  relied  upon  two
judgments to explain the import of  the  doctrine  of  promissory  estoppel,
namely M/s Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. Vs. State of Uttar  Pradesh
 reported in 1979 (2) SCC 409 and State of  Punjab  Vs.  Nestle  India  Ltd.
reported in 2004 (6) SCC 465.  He canvassed the Contempt Petition  moved  by
Abhijeet by contending that Abhijeet ought to have  been  granted  lease  in
pursuance of this Court’s earlier order dated 15.12.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_346">      Reply on behalf of the State of Jharkhand

</p><p id="p_347">19.         Learned Senior Counsel Shri Ajit Kumar Sinha, appearing for  the
State of Jharkhand, traced the power of the State Government to reserve  the
mines situated within its  territory  for  Public  Sector  Undertakings,  to
begin with, to the State’s ownership of the Mines.  He submitted that  these
mines and  minerals    vested  absolutely  in  it,  and  this  position  was
fortified in view of the declaration of the consequences of  vesting  to  be
found in <a href="/doc/667470/" id="a_466">Section 4(a)</a> of the Bihar Act.  The validity of this provision  had
been upheld by a Constitution Bench of this  Court  way  back  in  State  of
Bihar Vs. Kameshwar Singh reported in AIR 1952 SC 252.   In  any  case,  the
Act had been placed at Entry No. 1 in Ninth  Schedule  which  was  added  by
Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 and was protected by <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_467">Article  31-B.</a>
 As held by this Court in Waman Rao Vs. Union of India reported in 1981  (2)
SCC 362, the Act was clearly beyond the pale of challenge.   The  State  had
the inherent power to reserve any area for exploitation in its  capacity  as
the owner of the land  and  the  minerals  vested  therein.   The  Sovereign
executive power of the State under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_468">Article 298</a> of the Constitution to  carry
on any trade or business and to acquire, hold and dispose  of  the  property
and make contracts, certainly included the power to  reserve  the  land  for
exploitation of its minerals by the public sector.
</p>
<p id="p_348">20.         It was further submitted  by  Shri  Sinha,  that  there  was  no
conflict between the right of the State Government to deal  with  the  mines
as the owner thereof, and the provisions of the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_469">MMDR  Act</a>.   <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_470">The  MMDR  Act</a>
does not disturb the ownership of the mines and minerals  of  the  State  in
the land situated within its territory.   The  power  to  issue  appropriate
notifications concerning the mines and minerals situated  within  the  State
is not taken away by any of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_471">MMDR Act</a>.  In the  instant
case the Central Government, in its counter affidavit  at  para  5  (a)  and
para 10 filed before the High Court, had given  deemed/de-jure  approval  to
the reservation upon examination of the 1962  &amp;  1969  notifications.   This
was apart from the impugned order, dated 6.3.2006, rejecting  the  proposals
of the appellants on the ground that the recommended areas in the said  nine
proposals  were  either  reserved  for  public   sector   undertakings,   or
overlapped the areas held by M/s. Rungta Sons Pvt.  Ltd.  and  M/s.  General
Produce Company.  In the counter affidavit  filed  in  this  appeal  by  the
Central Government, it has been specifically stated in paragraph 5 that  the
State Government is the ‘owner of the minerals.’

</p><p id="p_349">21.         It was submitted by Shri Sinha that the  notifications  of  1962
and 1969 continued to be applicable and protected even  after  the  creation
of state of Jharkhand by virtue of <a href="/doc/601425/" id="a_472">Section 85</a> of  the  Bihar  Reorganisation
Act, 2000, which provides that the existing  laws  prior  to  reorganization
shall have effect till they are altered, repealed or amended.   Shri  Sinha,
pointed out that the notifications of 1962  and  1969  had,  in  fact,  been
reiterated  by  the  State  of  Jharkhand  vide   its   notification   dated
27.10.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_350">22.         He submitted that the power to issue the impugned  notifications
was very much available under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_473">MMDR Act</a> and the Rules 58 and  59  of  the
M.C. Rules as they stood at  the  relevant  time.   The  notification  dated
27.10.2006 was clearly traceable to <a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_474">Section 17A</a> (2) of  the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_475">MMDR  Act</a>.  The
mere absence  of  mentioning  of  the  source  of  power  in  the  concerned
notifications did  not  make  them  ineffective.   Shri  Sinha  relied  upon
paragraph 13 of the judgment of this Court in  Dr.  Ram  Manohar  Lohia  Vs.
State of Bihar reported in AIR 1966 SC 740 in support of this proposition.
</p>
<p id="p_351">23.         With respect to doctrine  of  Desuetude,  Shri  Sinha  submitted
that for this doctrine to apply, two conditions have to be  satisfied,  viz.
</p><p id="p_352">(i) there must be a considerable period of neglect, and (ii) there  must  be
a contrary practice for a considerable time.  In the instant  case  no  such
neglect or contrary practice had been shown.  The area  of  mines  has  been
kept reserved, and no mining lease in the reserved area has been granted  to
anyone contrary to  the  notifications.   He  relied  in  this  behalf  upon
paragraph 15 of the judgment of this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/615661/" id="a_476">State  of  Maharashtra  vs.
Narayan Shamrao Puranik</a> reported in 1982 (3) SCC 519, and paragraphs  30  to
36 of Municipal Corporation for <a href="/doc/90876/" id="a_477">City of  Pune  vs.  Bharat  Forge  Co.  Ltd</a>.
reported in 1995 (3) SCC 434, as well as paragraph 16  of  <a href="/doc/1281375/" id="a_478">Cantonment  Board
Mhow vs. M.P. State Road Transport Corpn</a>. reported in 1997 (9) SCC 450.
</p>
<p id="p_353">24.         With respect to  the  submissions  on  promissory  estoppel  and
legitimate expectations, Shri Sinha submitted  that  these  principles  were
based on equity, and when a matter was governed by a  statute,  equity  will
give way.  Besides, the promises as claimed were against the  public  policy
and could not be enforced.  He relied upon paragraph 10 of  <a href="/doc/1799086/" id="a_479">Amrit  Vanaspati
Co. Ltd. vs. State of Punjab</a> reported in 1992 (2) SCC 411, paragraph  of  12
M.P.Mathur vs. DTC reported in 2006  (13)  SCC  706,  and  paragraph  83  of
<a href="/doc/1220288/" id="a_480">Sandur Manganese &amp; Iron Ores Ltd. vs. State of Karnataka</a>  reported  in  2010
(13) SCC 1.
</p>
<p id="p_354">25.         Shri Sinha submitted that MOU between  the  Appellants  and  the
State Government could not be treated as a contract under  <a href="/doc/1525624/" id="a_481">Article  299  (1)</a>
of the Constitution of India.   It  was  neither  enforceable  nor  binding.
Based on the MOU, the State Government had made a recommendation  which  was
only a proposal.  Besides, no one had any legal  or  vested  right  for  the
grant or renewal of  a  mining  lease.   In  this  behalf,  he  relied  upon
paragraph 13 of <a href="/doc/1233720/" id="a_482">State of Tamil Nadu vs. M/s Hind Stone</a> reported in 1981  (2)
SCC 205, paragraph 4 of <a href="/doc/1189153/" id="a_483">Dharambir Singh vs. Union of India</a> reported in  1996

reported in 2010 (13) SCC 1.
</p>
<p id="p_355">26.         Last but  not  the  least,  Shri  Sinha  pointed  out  that  the
controversy in the present matter was fully covered by  the  judgment  of  a
bench of three Judges of this Court in Amritlal (supra)  wherein  the  facts
were by and large similar.  This Court has clearly  held  in  that  judgment
that the mines and minerals within its  territory  did  vest  in  the  State
Government, and it had  the  full  authority  to  reserve  the  exploitation
thereof for the benefit  of  public  undertakings.  There  was  no  conflict
between this judgment, and the three  judgments  in  the  cases  of  Hingir-
Rampur Coal Co.,  M.A. Tulloch &amp; Co. and Baijnath Kadio (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_356">      Reply on behalf of Union of India
</p><p id="p_357">27.         The Learned Senior Counsel Shri Ashok Bhan, appearing for  Union
of India supported the submissions of Shri Sinha.   He  submitted  that  the
mines and minerals in the State of Jharkhand were  owned  by  the  State  of
Jharkhand, and it had the right to deal with the same  appropriately  within
the scheme of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_487">MMDR Act</a>.  It had every right  to  reserve  certain  areas
for the exclusive utilisation of the Public Sector Undertakings, or to  give
a direction to  avoid  overlapping.   He  pointed  out  that  the  proposals
forwarded by the State Government were examined by the Central Government  .
It had accepted the reasons  contained  in  the  State  Government’s  letter
dated 13.9.2005, and therefore rejected nine out of the ten  proposals.   He
drew our attention to the following paragraphs from the affidavit  filed  by
the Central Government in the High Court.  In para  5  (a)  of  its  Counter
Affidavit in reply to the Writ Petition filed by Monnet in the  High  Court,
the Under Secretary, in the Ministry of Mines stated that  ‘the  request  of
the State Government has been examined by the Central  Government,  and  all
nine  proposals  including  the  proposal  recommended  in  favour  of   the
petitioner have been rejected  and  returned  to  the  State  Government  on
06.03.2006.’  In para 10, it was further stated as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_183">           “10. That, as referred herein above, as per information  of  the
      State Government the proposals which were  submitted  to  the  Central

      (Development &amp;  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_488">Regulation)  Act</a>,  1957,  either  fall  in  the  areas
      reserved for exploitation by the Public Sector  or  overlap  with  the
      area earlier held or being presently held by others and  therefore  on
      the request of State Government, examined by Central  Government,  and
      after rejection returned the  proposal  to  the  State  Government  on
      06.03.2006.  Under the circumstances if the State  Government  desires
      to grant the area under mining lease to a person other than  a  public
      sector, it is required to firstly de-reserve the area, notify the same
      under Rule 59 (1) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 and  therefore
      in present situations the petitioner has no case and writ petition  is
      liable to be dismissed.”


   Submissions on behalf of the intervenors

</blockquote><p id="p_358">28.   (i)  Shri Das Learned Counsel appearing for M/s  Rungta  Sons  pointed
out that Rungta had a mining lease in their  favour  and  were  entitled  to
seek the renewal thereof.  Therefore, the appellants  could  not  have  been
granted any lease, in any way overlapping with the mining area  allotted  to
Rungta Sons.
</p>
<p id="p_359">(ii)  Learned Senior Counsels Sarvashri Narasinha, Vikas  Singh  &amp;  Krishnan
Venugopal have appeared for the interveners to oppose these appeals.   Their
submissions have been similar to that of Shri Sinha.

<p id="p_360">29.         After the hearing of these appeals was  concluded,  another  SLP
arising out of the judgment of Orissa High Court in  W.A.  No.6288  of  2006
(Geo Minerals and Marketing (P) Ltd. V. State of Orrisa &amp; ors.) came up  for
consideration wherein one of the issues involved was  regarding  reservation
of mining areas for public sector. The counsel appearing in that matter  for
the respective parties  viz.  Senior  counsel  Sarvashri  Harish  Salve,  KK
Venugopal and  RK  Dwivedi  were  therefore  heard  on  this  issue.   Their
submissions were similar to those of the  respective  parties  appearing  in
the present appeals.

<p id="p_361">      Consideration of the submissions of the rival parties:
</p>
<p id="p_362">      Authority of the State  of  Jharkhand  to  deal  with  the  mines  and
      minerals within its territory

</p><p id="p_363">30.         It was submitted on behalf of the State of Jharkhand as well  as
by Union of India that the mines and minerals within the  territory  of  the
State are owned by the State of Jharkhand, and  it  has  full  authority  to
deal with the same. This authority flows from <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_489">Section 4</a>  (a)  of  the  Bihar
Land Reforms Act, 1950.  As against that, the  counsel  for  the  appellants
have challenged the authority of the State of Jharkhand  to  deal  with  the
mines and minerals on the ground that after the passing  of  the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_490">MMDR  Act</a>,
the authority of the State Government has come to be curtailed.  To  examine
this issue we may look into some of the  salient  provisions  of  the  <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_491">Bihar
Act</a>. To begin with the  Preamble  of  the  Act  declares  its  objective  in
following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_184">           ‘ <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_492">An Act</a> to provide for the transference to  the  State  of  the

       mortgagees and lessees of such  interests   including  interests  in
       trees, forests , fisheries , jalkars, ferries, hats, bazaars,  mines
       and  minerals  and  to  provide  for  the  constitution  of  a  Land
       Commission for the State of Bihar with powers to  advise  the  State
       Government on the  agrarian  policy  to  be  pursued  by  the  State
       Government consequent upon such transference and for  other  matters
       connected therewith.’


<a href="/doc/142884/" id="a_493">Section 3</a> of the Act provides for issuance of notifications  of  vesting  of
estates and tenures in the state. <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_494">Section 4</a> provides  for  the  consequences
of the vesting namely that they shall vest  absolutely  in  the  state  free
from all encumbrances. <a href="/doc/667470/" id="a_495">Section 4(a)</a> of the Bihar Act reads as follows:

<p id="p_364">   4. Consequences of the vesting of an estate or tenure in the State-
</p>

<p id="p_365">       [Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law  for  the  time

    cutchery for the collection of rent of such estate or tenure,  and  his
    interests in trees, forests, fisheries, jalkars, hats,  bazars, 3[mela]
    and ferries and all other sairati interests , as also his  interest  in
    all  subsoil  including  any  rights  in  mines  and  minerals  whether
    discovered or undiscovered, or whether been worked or not, inclusive of
    such rights of a lessee of mines and minerals, comprised in such estate
    or tenure (other than the interests of  raiyats  or  under  -  raiyats)
    shall, with effect from the date of vesting,  vest  absolutely  in  the
    State free from all incumbrances and such proprietor or tenure-  holder
    shall cease to have any interest in  such  estate  or  other  than  the
    interests expresslly saved by or under the provisions of this Act.
</p>

<p id="p_367">Besides, we  must  also  note  that  the  Constitutional  validity  of  this
provision has already been upheld by a Constitution Bench of this  Court  in
State of Bihar Vs. Kameshwar  Singh  reported  in  AIR  1952  SC  252  by  a
detailed judgment where at the end of it in Para 237 the Court has  declared
the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_503">Bihar Act</a> to be valid except as regards<a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_504"> S.  4(b)</a>  and  S.23  (f),  which
were declared to be unconstitutional and void.
</p><p id="p_368">31.         Ownership denotes a complex of rights as the  celebrated  author
Salmond states in his  treatise  on  Jurisprudence  (see  page  246  of  the
Twelfth Edition):
</p>



<blockquote id="blockquote_185">                 ‘44.  The idea of ownership

                 Ownership denotes the relation  between  a  person  and  an
       object forming the subject-matter of his ownership.  It consists  in
       a complex of rights, all of which are  rights  in  rem,  being  good
       against all the world  and  not  merely  against  specific  persons.
       Though in certain situations some of these rights may be absent, the
       normal case of ownership can be expected to  exhibit  the  following
       incidents.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_186">                 First, the owner will have a right  to  possess  the  thing
       which he owns……….
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_187">                 Secondly, the owner normally  has  the  right  to  use  and
       enjoy the thing owned: the right to manage it, i.e.,  the  right  to
       decide how it shall be used; and the right to the  income  from  it.</blockquote>
<p id="p_369">       Whereas the right to possess is a right in the strict  sense,  these
       rights are in fact liberties: the owner has a  liberty  to  use  the
       thing, i.e. he is under no duty not to  use  it,  in  contrast  with
       others who are under a duty not to use or interfere with it.’


The right of the State of Jharkhand to deal  with  the  mines  and  minerals
within  its  territory  including  reserving  the  same  for  Public  Sector
Undertakings, or to direct avoidance of overlapping  while  granting  leases
of mines, obviously flows from its ownership of those mines and minerals.
</p>
<p id="p_370">32.   (i)   It was submitted by the appellants that the power of  the  State
Government under Entry 23, List II of the Seventh Schedule  was  subject  to
the provision of Entry No. 54 of List I.  Entry 54 of  List  I  states  that
regulation of Mines and Minerals Development is  within  the  power  of  the
Union Government to the extent a declaration is made by  the  Parliament  in
that behalf, and such a declaration has been made in <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_505">Section 2</a> of  the  MMDR
Act.  Having stated so, it becomes necessary to  understand  the  extent  of
this control of the Union Government, and for that we must  see  the  scheme
of the Act with respect to the powers of  the  Central  Government  and  the
State Government to deal with the mines and minerals.   This  was  also  the
approach adopted by a Constitution Bench of this  Court  in  Ishwari  Khetan
Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. Vs. State of U.P. reported in  1980  (4)  SCC  136  and
later by a bench of three Judges in Orissa Cement Ltd. Vs. State  of  Orissa
reported in 1991 Supp.(1) SCC 430.
</p>
<p id="p_371">(ii)  In Ishwari Khetan (supra) the Constitution Bench  was  concerned  with
the validity of the provisions  of  U.P.  Sugar  Undertakings  (Acquisition)
Act, 1971 enacted by the State of U.P.  It was canvassed  that  the  State’s
power to legislate in respect of industries under Entry 24  of  List  II  is
taken away to the  extent  of  the  declaration  in  that  respect  made  by
Parliament  under  Entry  52  of  List  I.   After  examining  the  relevant
provisions, the Constitution Bench held in para 24 as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_188">                  “24.  It  can,  therefore,  be  said  with  a  measure  of
    confidence that legislative power of the States under Entry 24, List II
    is eroded only to the extent control is assumed by the  Union  pursuant
    to a declaration made by the Parliament in respect of declared industry
    as spelt out by legislative enactment and the field  occupied  by  such
    enactment is the measure of erosion.  Subject to such erosion,  on  the
    remainder the State legislature will have power to legislate in respect
    of declared industry without in any way  trenching  upon  the  occupied
    field…….”



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_189">(iii) In Orissa Cement Ltd. (supra) a bench of three Judges  of  this  Court
was concerned with the validity of the levy of a cess on mining  imposed  by
State of Orissa, and the competence of the State Legislation was  challenged
on the backdrop of  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_506">MMDR  Act</a>  and  Entry  54  of  the  Union  List.   After
referring to the judgment in Ishwari Khetan  (supra)  the  Court  stated  as
follows in paragraph 49:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_190">                 “…..As pointed out in Ishwari Khetan, the mere  declaration
       of a law of Parliament that it is expedient for an industry  or  the
       regulation and development of mines and minerals  to  be  under  the
       control of the Union under Entry 52 or Entry 54 does not denude  the
       State Legislatures of their legislative powers with respect  to  the
       fields covered by the several  entries  in  List  II  or  List  III.
       Particularly, in the  case  of  declaration  under  Entry  54,  this
       legislative power is eroded only to the extent control is assumed by
       the  Union  pursuant  to  such  declaration  as  spelt  out  by  the
       legislative enactment which makes the declaration.  The  measure  of
       erosion turns upon the field of the enactment framed in pursuance of
       the declaration……”

consultation with the Central Government.  This <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_511">Section 4</a> reads as follows:

of the Act is specifically retained with  the  State  Government.   However,
with respect to the minerals specified in First Schedule, it is  added  that
previous approval of the Central Government is required. Thus, with  respect
to the minerals which are specified in the First Schedule to the  Act,  this
has to be done only after  prior  consultation  with  and  approval  of  the
Central Government.  The provision does not in  any  way  detract  from  the
ownership and the authority of the State Government to deal with  the  mines
situated within its territory.  The only restriction is with respect to  the

made to the State Government, and it is the right of  the  State  Government
either to grant or refuse to grant  the  permit,  licence  or  lease.   This
section reads as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_212">      10. Application for prospecting licences or mining leases-

<blockquote id="blockquote_213">    (1) An application for [a reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or

<blockquote id="blockquote_216">36.         Again,  it  is  the  right  of  the  State  Government  to  give
preferences  in  the  matters  of  granting  lease,  though  this  right  is
regulated by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1555531/" id="a_519">Section 11</a> of  the  Act.   Sub-<a href="/doc/1368663/" id="a_520">section  1</a>  of
this Section  lays  down  that  one  who  has  done  the  reconnaissance  or
prospecting work earlier, will have a preferential  right  for  obtaining  a

prospecting or mining earlier, the application which is received first  will
be considered preferentially.  It is  however,  further  stated  that  where
applications  are  invited  by  any  particular  date,  then  all   of   the
applications received by that date will be considered together.  Sub-section
3 of Section 11 lays down the factors to be considered  while  granting  the

<blockquote id="blockquote_219">            (b) the financial resources of the applicant;

Sub-<a href="/doc/1824949/" id="a_522">section 5</a> lays down that if there are any  special  reasons,  the  State
can grant the licence to a party whose application might have been  received
later in time, but after recording the special  reasons.   This  sub-section
again makes it clear that where any such out of  turn  allotment  is  to  be
done with respect to a mineral specified in First Schedule,  prior  approval
of the Central Government will be  required.   Thus,  although  the  Central
Government is given the authority to approve the applications  with  respect
to the specified minerals,  that  does  not  take  away  the  ownership  and
control of the State Government over  the  mines  and  minerals  within  its
territory.

<p id="p_372">37.         Senior Counsel Shri Sundaram had contended that <a href="/doc/20877563/" id="a_523">Section  17</a>  and

Government as stated in sub-section (2) thereof.  Besides,  sub-section  (3)
requires the Central Government also to pay the  reconnaissance  permit  fee
or prospecting fee, royalty, surface rent or dead rent as the case  may  be.
<a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_529">Section 17A</a> gives the power to the Central Government to  reserve  any  area
not held under any prospecting licence  or  mining  lease  with  a  view  to
conserving any minerals. However that power  is  also  to  be  exercised  in
consultation with the State Government.  Similarly,  under  Sub-section  (2)
of <a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_530">Section 17A</a>, State Government may also  reserve  any  such  area,  though
with the approval of the Central Government.  Thus, these sections  and  the
duty cast on the Central Government under  <a href="/doc/25002195/" id="a_531">Section  18</a>  do  not  affect  the
ownership of the State Government over the mines  and  minerals  within  its
territory, or to deal with them as provided in the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_373">38.         The provisions of the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_532">MMDR  Act</a>  contain  certain  regulations.
However, to say that there are certain provisions  regulating  the  exercise
of power is one thing, and to say that there is no power  is  another.   The
provisions of the Act do not in any way take away or curtail  the  right  of
the State Government to reserve the area of mines in public interest,  which
right flows from vesting of the  mines  in  the  State  Government.   It  is
inherent in its ownership  of  the  mines.   In  the  present  case  we  are
concerned with the challenge to the letter of  the  State  Government  dated
13.9.2005, and that of  the  Central  Government  dated  6.3.2006,  and  the
challenge  to  the  notification  dated  27.10.2006  issued  by  the   State
Government. There is no difficulty in accepting that the Central  Government
does have the power to issue a direction as contained in  the  letter  dated
6.3.2006.  As far as the notification of 27.10.2006 is concerned,  the  same
is also clearly traceable to <a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_533">Section 17A</a> (2) of the Act.  This  <a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_534">Section  17A</a>
(2) reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_223">            “(2) The State Government may, with the approval of the  Central
      Government, reserve any area not already held  under  any  prospecting
      licence  or  mining  lease,  for  undertaking  prospecting  or  mining
      operations through  a  Government  company  or  corporation  owned  or
      controlled by it and  where  it  proposes  to  do  so,  it  shall,  by
      notification in the Official Gazette, specify the boundaries  of  such
      area and the mineral or minerals in respect of which such  areas  will
      be reserved.”

As can be seen, this  sub-section  requires  the  approval  of  the  Central
Government for reserving any new area which is not already  held  through  a
Government Company or Corporation, and where the proposal is to do so.   The
notification of 27.10.2006 refers to the previous notifications of 1962  and
1969 whereunder the  mining  areas  in  the  Ghatkuri  forest  were  already
reserved, and reiterates the decision  of  the  State  Government  that  the
minerals which were already reserved in the  Ghatkuri  area  under  the  two
notifications will continue  to  be  utilised  for  exploitation  by  public
sector undertakings or joint  venture  projects  of  the  State  Government.
</blockquote><p id="p_374">Therefore this notification of 27.10.2006 did not require  the  approval  of
the Central Government.
</p>


<p id="p_375">39.          When it comes to the challenge to the letter  dated  13.9.2005,
it is seen that the State Government states therein that  nine  out  of  the
ten proposals overlap the areas meant for public undertakings and two  other
companies, and therefore the proposals were called back.  The power to  take
such a decision rests in the State Government in view of  its  ownership  of
the mines, though there may not be a  reference  to  the  source  of  power.
Absence of reference to any particular section or rule  which  contains  the
source of power will not invalidate the decision of  the  State  Government,
since there is no requirement to state the source of power  as  has  already
been held by this Court in the case of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia (supra).
</p><p id="p_376">40.         The appellants have referred to Rules 58 and 59 to contend  that

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_251">43.   (i)   The notification of 1969 is clearly protected under Rule  59  as
amended on 9.7.1963, in as much as the rule clearly states  that  the  State
Government can refuse to grant a mining lease, should the land  be  reserved
for any purpose.  As far as the notification of 1962  is  concerned,  it  is
submitted by the appellants that the Rules 58 and 59  as  they  stood  prior
thereto did not contain a  specific  power  to  reserve  the  land  for  any
purpose, in the manner it was incorporated in Rule 59 by  the  amendment  of
9.7.1963.  As can be seen, these rules provide as to when the reserved  area
can be notified for re-grant.  The Rules lay down the requirement of  making
an entry in the register maintained  in  that  behalf,  and  issuance  of  a
notification in the official gazette about the availability of the area  for
grant. These provisions are made to ensure transparency.  The  reference  to
the judgment in Janak Lal (supra) does not take  forward  the  case  of  the
appellants, since as stated in that judgment the result of the amendment  in
the rule is only to extend the rule, and not to  curtail  the  area  of  its
operation.  The judgment in terms states that the purpose of these rules  is
obviously to enable the general public to apply for the proposed lease.
</blockquote><p id="p_383">(ii)  Rule 58 as it originally stood, provided for two  contingencies.   One
contingency is where the applicant has died before the execution of  licence
or lease, and the other is where the order granting  licence  or  lease  has
been revoked.   Rule  59  as  originally  drafted  provided  for  the  third
contingency, namely, where the  State  Government  had  earlier  refused  to
grant a prospecting licence or mining lease in respect of  certain  land  on
the  ground  that  it  was  reserved   for   some   other   purpose,   (e.g.
environmental), and such land becomes available for grant.   For  all  these
three contingencies, the procedure laid down in Rule 58 was required  to  be
followed,  namely  making  of  an  entry  in  the  specified  register,  and
notifying in the official gazette the date  from  which  the  area  will  be
available for grant.
</p><p id="p_384">44.         The appellants then contended by referring to the  amended  Rule
59 that because the  power  to  reserve  the  land  ‘for  any  purpose’  was
specifically provided thereunder from 9.7.1963, such power did not exist  in
the Rules 58 and 59 as they stood prior thereto.   It  is  not  possible  to
accept this construction, for the reason as stated above that the  Rules  58
and 59 as they originally  stood,  merely  dealt  with  three  contingencies
where the prescribed procedure was required to  be  followed.   This  cannot
mean  that  when  it  comes  to  reservation  of  mining  areas  for  public
undertakings, such power was not there with the State  Government  prior  to
the amendment of 1963.  The over-view of various sections of  the  act  done
by  us  clearly  shows  that  the  power  to  grant  the  mining  leases  is
specifically retained with the State Government even  with  respect  to  the
major minerals, though with the approval of  the  Central  Government.   The
power to effect such  reservations  for  public  undertakings,  or  for  any
purpose flows from the ownership of the mines and minerals which vests  with
the State Government.  The amendment of Rule 59 in 1963 made it  clear  that
the State can reserve land ‘for any purpose’, and the amendment of Rules  58
and 59 in 1980 clarified that State can reserve it for a public  corporation
or a Government company. These amendments have been effected  only  to  make
explicit what was implicit. These amendments can not be read to nullify  the
powers which the State Government otherwise had under the statute.   In  the
present matter we are concerned with the  challenge  to  the  power  of  the
State Government to issue the letter of withdrawal dated 13.9.2005 which  is
issued in view of the two notifications of 1962 and 1969.  The challenge  to
the validity of the said letter will therefore have to be repelled.
</p><p id="p_385">45.         Learned Senior Counsel Shri Mehta had relied upon Indian  Metals
and Ferro Alloys Ltd. (supra) to contend that an area which is reserved  can
be made available for re-grant to private sector.  However,  that  situation
can arise when the area becomes de-reserved, and  thereafter  the  specified
procedure is followed.  The following statement  in  para  45  of  the  very
judgment cannot be ignored in this behalf:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_252">       “…..Under Rule 59(1), once a notification under Rule 58 is made, the
       area so reserved shall not be available for  grant  unless  the  two
       requirements of sub-rule (e) are  satisfied:  viz.  an  entry  in  a
       register and a gazette notification that the area is  available  for
       grant……”

Thus, when such a decision to de-reserve the area  for  re-grant  is  taken,
the above two requirements are expected to  be  followed.   In  the  instant
case there was no such occasion since no such decision  had  been  taken  by
the  State  Government.   Once  the  State  Government  realised  that   the
concerned areas were reserved for the  exploitation  in  public  sector,  it
withdrew the proposals forwarding the applications of the appellants to  the
Central Government, and it was fully entitled to do the same.
</blockquote><p id="p_386">46.         It was then contended by Shri Mehta that the State  Government’s
power is only to regulate the minor minerals under <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_542">Section 15</a>  of  the  Act,
since, that section gives power to the State Government  to  make  rules  in
respect of minor minerals, and since <a href="/doc/1116044/" id="a_543">Section 14</a> states that  <a href="/doc/1824949/" id="a_544">Sections  5</a>  to
<a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_545">13</a> do not apply to minor minerals.  On the other hand the over view  of  the
provisions from <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_546">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/196900261/" id="a_547">17A</a> as done above clearly shows the  power  of
the State Government either to grant or not  to  grant  the  mining  leases,
prospecting licenses  and  reconnaissance  permits  and  to  regulate  their
operations even with respect  to  the  major  minerals  specified  in  First
Schedule to the  act  though  with  the  previous  approval  of  the  Centre
Government.  This would include the power to effect reservations  of  mining
areas for the public sector. The reliance on Bharat Coking Coal  (supra)  is
also untenable  for  the  reason  that  the  judgment  lays  down  that  the
executive power of the State is subject to the law made by  the  Parliament.
There is no conflict with the proposition in the facts  of  this  case.  The
power of the State flows from its ownership of the mines, and it is  not  in
any way taken away by the law made by the Parliament viz. the  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_548">MMDR  Act</a>  or
the MC rules.  It is therefore not possible  to  accept  the  submission  of
Shri Ranjit Kumar that because a regulatory regime is created under the  Act
giving  certain  role  to  the  Central  Government,  the  power  to  effect
reservations is taken away from the State Government.  The reference to  the
judgment of this Court in D.K. Trivedi &amp; Sons (supra)  in  this  behalf  was
also misconceived.  In that matter a bench of two  Judges,  of  this  Court,
held <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_549">section 15</a> (1) of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_550">MMDR Act</a> to be constitutional and valid.   The  court
also held that the rule making power of the  State  Government,  thereunder,
did  not  amount  to  excessive  delegation  of  legislative  power  to  the
executive.  In that matter no such submission that the powers of  the  State
Government were restricted only to <a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_551">section 15</a> was under consideration
</p><p id="p_387">47.          Similarly,  the  reliance  on  Hukam  Chand  (supra)  was  also
misconceived in as much as in the present case there is  no  such  issue  of
exercising rule making power retrospectively.  Nor has  the  proposition  in
Air India (supra) any relevance in the present case  since  this  is  not  a
case of saving any provision after the repeal of a statute.  The  action  of
the State cannot as well be faulted for being  unreasonable  to  be  hit  by
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_552">Article 19(1) (g)</a> of the Constitution of India since all that the State  has
done is to follow the Statute as per its letter and its true spirit.
</p>
<p id="p_388">48.         Learned Senior Counsel Shri  Ranjit  Kumar  had  contended  that
once the State Government  had  recommended  the  proposal  to  the  Central
Government for grant of mineral concession  it  becomes  functus-officio  in
view of the provision of Rule 63 A of the MC  Rules,  1960,  and  it  cannot
withdraw the same.  As far as this submission is concerned,  firstly  it  is
seen from the impunged judgment that this plea was not canvassed before  the
High Court.  Besides, in any case, ‘recommendation’  will  mean  a  complete
and valid recommendation after an application for grant of mining  lease  is
made under Rule 22 with all full particulars in  accordance  with  law.   In
the instant case the State Government found that  its  own  proposal  was  a
defective one, since it was over-lapping a reserved area.  In such  a  case,
the withdrawal thereof by the State Government cannot be said to be  hit  by
Rule 63A.  In any case, the Central  Government  subsequently  rejected  the
proposal, and hence not  much  advantage  can  be  drawn  from  the  initial
forwarding of the appellants’ proposal by the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_389">49.           It is also contended that Monnet  was  not  afforded  hearing.
The submission of denial of hearing under Rule 26 by  the  State  Government
is not raised in the Writ Petition. It is  material  to  note  that  another
plea is raised in Para 2 (XVI) of their Writ Petition, namely, that  central
government ought to have  given  a  hearing  before  issuing  the  rejection
order, though no specific provision from the rules was pointed out  in  that
behalf. The plea that the appellants could not resort  to  their  remedy  of
revision under  Rule  54  against  the  letter  of  State  Government  dated
13.9.2005 cannot be accepted for the reason that it is  the  appellants  who
chose to file their writ petition directly to the High  Court  to  challenge
the same (along with  Central  Government  letter  dated  6.3.2006)  without
exhausting that remedy. The Central Government cannot  be  faulted  for  the
same. Incidentally, the Petition nowhere states as to  how  Monnet  came  to
know about these internal communications between the state and  the  central
government. The other petitioners  claim  to  have  learnt  about  the  same
through a newspaper report, and  Adhunik  claims  to  have  got  the  copies
thereof through an application under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_553">Information Act</a>, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_390">50.          The  appellants  had  relied  upon  three  judgments   of   the
Constitution Benches of this Court in Hingir-Rampur Coal Co.,  M.A.  Tulloch
&amp; Co. and Baijnath Kadio (supra). In Hingir-Rampur  Coal  Co.  (supra),  the
Constitution Bench was concerned with the question of legality of  the  cess
under the Orissa Mining  Ares  Development  Fund  Act,  1952.   One  of  the
grounds canvassed was that the said legislation was bad in law for being  in
conflict with the previous Mines and Minerals (Regulation  and  <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_554">Development)
Act</a>, 1948, which was also a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_555">Central Act</a>.  It was contended that the  central
legislation was referable to Entry No.54 of the Union List from the  Seventh
Schedule.  It occupied the field and therefore the state  legislation  which
was referable to  Entry  No.53  was  beyond  the  competence  of  the  state
legislature.  The Court found that the areas covered by the  two  acts  were
substantially the same.  However, the 1948 Act was  a  pre-constitution  act
and  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  constitution  were   held   to   be
prospective.  The Court therefore, held that unless  the  declaration  under
<a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_556">Section 2</a> of the 1948 Act was made after the Constitution came  into  force,
it will not satisfy the requirement  of  Entry  No.54.   The  cess  and  the
Orissa Act were therefore not held to  be  bad  in  law.   What  this  Court
observed in Para 23 in this behalf is relevant for our purpose…………….
</p>
<p id="p_391">           “23.  The next question which arises is, even if the cess  is  a
      fee and as such may be relatable to Entries 23 and 66 in List  II  its
      validity is still open to challenge because the legislative competence
      of the State Legislature under Entry 23 is subject to  the  provisions
      of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control
      of the Union; and that takes us to Entry 54 in  List  I.   This  Entry
      reads thus: “Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent
      to which such regulation and development  under  the  control  of  the
      Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in  the  public
      interest”.  The effect of reading the two Entries together  is  clear.
      The jurisdiction of the State Legislature under Entry 23 is subject to
      the limitation imposed by the latter  part  of  the  said  Entry.   If
      Parliament by its law has declared that regulation and development  of
      mines should in public interest be under the control of the  Union  to
      the  extent  of  such  declaration  the  jurisdiction  of  the   State
      Legislature is excluded.  In other words, if a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_557">Central  Act</a>  has  been
      passed which contains a declaration by Parliament as required by Entry
      54, and if the said declaration  covers  the  field  occupied  by  the
      impu8gned Act the impugned Act would be ultra vires,  not  because  of
      any  repugnance  between  the  two  statutes  but  because  the  State
      Legislature had no jurisdiction  to  pass  the  law.   The  limitation
      imposed by the latter  part  of  Entry  23  is  a  limitation  on  the
      legislative competence of the State Legislature itself.  The  position
      is not in dispute.”

                                             (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_392">51.         In M.A. Tulloch  &amp;  Co.  (supra),  the  Constitution  Bench  was
concerned with legality of certain demands of fee under  the  Orissa  Mining
Areas Development Fund Act, 1952, and the same question arose as to  whether
the provisions of the Orissa Act were hit by the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_558">MMDR Act</a>, 1957 in  view  of
Entry No.54 of the Union List.  The validity of the state act was  canvassed
under Entry No.23 of the State List and was  accepted  as  not  hit  by  the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_559">MMDR Act</a>, 1957. The Court held  the  Orissa  Act  and  the
demand of fee to be valid.  What this Court observed in Para 5  is  relevant
for our purpose………..
</p>
<p id="p_393">           “5.   ………….It does not need much argument to realise that to the
      extent to which the Union Government had  taken  under  “its  control”
      “the regulation and development of minerals”  so  much  was  withdrawn
      from the ambit of the power of the State Legislature  under  Entry  23
      and legislation of the State which had  rested  on  the  existence  of
      power under that entry would  to  the  extent  of  that  “control”  be
      superseded or be rendered ineffective, for here we have a case not  of
      mere repugnancy between the provisions of the two enactments but of  a
      denudation  or  deprivation  of  State  legislative   power   by   the
      declaration which Parliament is empowered to make and has made.”



</p><p id="p_394">52.         In Baijnath Kadio (supra), this Court  was  concerned  with  the
validity of second proviso of Section 10 of  the  Bihar  Land  Reforms  Act,
1964 for being in conflict with the  provisions  concerning  miner  minerals
under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_560">MMDR Act</a>, 1957.  The Court followed the  propositions  in  Hingir-
Rampur Coal Co. and M.A. Tulloch Co. and found that the field was  not  open
to the State Legislature, since it was covered under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_561">Central Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_395">53.         As can be seen  from  these  three  judgments,  if  there  is  a
declaration by the Parliament,  to  the  extent  of  that  declaration,  the
regulation of mines and minerals development will be outside  the  scope  of
the State Legislation as provided under Entry  No.54  of  the  Centre  List.
Presently, we are not concerned with the conflict of any of  the  provisions
under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_562">MMDR Act</a>, either with any State Legislation or with any  Executive
Order under a  State  Legislation  issued  by  the  State  Government.   The
submission of the  appellant  is  that  the  Jharkhand  Government  was  not
competent at all to issue the notifications of 1962 and 1969  reserving  the
mine areas for public undertaking. The answer of  the  State  Government  is
that it is acting under the very <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_563">MMDR Act</a>, and the notifications are  within
the four corners of its powers as permitted by the Central Legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_396">54.         All these issues raised by  the  appellants  have  already  been
decided by a bench of three Judges of this Court in Amritlal Nathubhai  Shah
Vs. Union of India reported in 1976 (4) SCC 108.  In that  matter  also  the
Government of Gujarat had issued similar notifications dated 31.12.1963  and
26.2.1964 reserving  the  lands  in  certain  talukas  for  exploitation  of
bauxite in public sector.  The  applications  filed  by  the  appellant  for
grant of mining lease for bauxite were rejected  by  the  State  Government.
The revision application filed by the appellant to  the  Central  Government
was also rejected by its order which stated that the  State  Government  was
the owner of the minerals within its territory and the minerals vest in  it,
and also that the State Government had the inherent  right  to  reserve  any
particular area for exploitation in the public  sector.   The  Gujarat  High
Court had accepted this view.
</p>
<p id="p_397">55.         While affirming this view,  this  Court  in  Amritlal  Nathubhai
(supra) held in clear terms that the power of  the  State  Government  arose
from its ownership of the minerals, and that it had the  inherent  right  to
deal with them.  In para 3 of its judgment the Court observed as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_253">                 “3. It may be mentioned that in pursuance of its  exclusive
        power to make laws with respect to the matters enumerated in  entry
        54 of List I  in  the  Seventh  Schedule,  Parliament  specifically
        declared in Section 2 of the Act  that  it  was  expedient  in  the
        public interest that the Union should take under  its  control  the
        regulation of mines and the development of minerals to  the  extent
        provided in the Act. The State Legislature's power under  entry  23
        of List II was thus taken away, and it is not  disputed  before  us
        that regulation of mines and mineral development had  therefore  to
        be in accordance with the Act and the  Rules.  The  mines  and  the
        minerals in question (bauxite) were however in the territory of the
        State of Gujarat and, as was stated in the orders which were passed
        by the Central Government  on  the  revision  applications  of  the
        appellants, the State Government is the "owner of minerals"  within
        its territory, and the minerals "vest" in it. There is  nothing  in
        the Act or the Rules to detract from this basic fact. That was  why
        the Central Government stated further in its revisional orders that
        the State  Government  had  the  "inherent  right  to  reserve  any
        particular area for exploitation  in  the  public  sector".  It  is
        therefore quite clear that, in the absence of any law  or  contract
        etc. to the contrary, bauxite, as a mineral, and the mines thereof,
        vest in the State of Gujarat and no person has any right to exploit
        it otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act  and
        the Rules. Section 10 of the Act and Chapters II, III and IV of the
        Rules, deal with the  grant  of  prospecting  licences  and  mining
        leases in the land in which the minerals vest in the Government  of
        a State. That was why the appellants made their applications to the
        State Government.”




</blockquote><p id="p_398">56.         The Court traced the power of the State Government to refuse  to
grant lease, to <a href="/doc/701072/" id="a_564">Section 10</a> of the MMDR  Act.   It  held  that  this  section
clearly included the power either to grant or refuse to grant the  lease  on
the ground that the land in question was not available having been  reserved
by the State Government for any purpose.   In para 5 of  its  judgment  this
Court has held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_254">                 “5. <a href="/doc/701072/" id="a_565">Section 10</a> of the Act in fact provides that in  respect
        of minerals which vest in the State,  it  is  exclusively  for  the
        State  Government  to  entertain  applications  far  the  grant  of
        prospecting licences or mining leases and to grant  or  refuse  the
        same. The section is therefore indicative of the power of the State
        Government to take a decision,  one  way  or  the  other,  in  such
        matters, and it does not require much argument to  hold  that  that
        power included the power to refuse the grant  of  a  licence  or  a
        lease on the ground that the land in question was not available for
        such grant by reason of its  having  been  reserved  by  the  State
        Government for any purpose.”




</blockquote><p id="p_399">57.         In para 6 of the judgment,  this  Court  rejected  the  argument
that since <a href="/doc/20877563/" id="a_566">Section 17</a> of the Act provides for  the  powers  of  the  Central
Government  to  undertake  prospecting  or  mining  operations,  the   State
Government could not be said to have the power for reservations.  The  first
part of this para reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_255">                 “6. We have  gone  through  Sub-sections  (2)  and  (4)  of
       Section 17 of the Act to which our attention has been invited by Mr.
       Sen on behalf of the appellants for the argument that they  are  the
       only provisions for specifying the boundaries of the reserved areas,
       and as they  relate  to  prospecting  or  mining  operations  to  be
       undertaken by the Central Government, they are enough to  show  that
       the Act does not contemplate or provide for reservation by any other
       authority  or  for  any  other  purpose.  The  argument  is  however
       untenable because the aforesaid sub-sections  of  Section 17 do  not
       cover the entire field of the  authority  of  refusing  to  grant  a
       prospecting licence or a mining lease to anyone  else,  and  do  not
       deal with the State Government's authority to reserve any  area  for
       itself. As has been stated, the authority to order reservation flows
       from the fact that the State is the  owner  of  the  mines  and  the
       minerals within its territory, which vest in it…………….”




</blockquote><p id="p_400">58.         The Judgment referred to Rule 59 of the  M.C.  Rules  also,  and
held that it clearly contemplates such  reservation  by  the  order  of  the
State Government  In para 7 this Court held in this behalf as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_256">                 “7..…..A reading of Rules 58, 59  and  60  makes  it  quite
       clear that it is not permissible for  any  person  to  apply  for  a
       licence or lease in respect  of  a  reserved  area  until  after  it
       becomes available for such grant, and the availability  is  notified
       by the State Government in the Official Gazette.  Rule  60  provides
       that an application for the grant of  a  prospecting  licence  or  a
       mining lease in respect of an area for which  no  such  notification
       has been issued, inter alia, under Rule  59,  for  making  the  area
       available for grant of a licence or a lease, would be premature, and
       "shall not be entertained and the fee, if any, paid  in  respect  of
       any such application shall be refunded." It would  therefore  follow
       that as the areas which  are  the  subject  matter  of  the  present
       appeals had been reserved by the State Government  for  the  purpose
       stated in its notifications, and  as  those  lands  did  not  become
       available for the grant of a prospecting licence or a mining  lease,
       the State Government was well within its  rights  in  rejecting  the
       applications of the appellants under Rule 60 as premature. …..”




</blockquote><p id="p_401">59.         In view of the discussion as above,  the  judgment  in  Amritlal
(supra) cannot be said to be stating anything contrary to  the  propositions
in Hingir-Rampur Coal Co., M.A. Tulloch &amp; Co. and  Baijnath  Kadio  (supra),
but is a binding precedent. The notifications impugned by the appellants  in
the present group of appeals were fully protected under  the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_567">MMDR Act</a>, and also as explained in Amritlal (supra).
</p>



<p id="p_402">      Desueutde

</p><p id="p_403">60.         The submissions with respect to the two notifications  suffering
on account of Desuetude has also no merit, as the law requires  that   there
must be a considerable period of neglect, and it is necessary to  show  that
there is a contrary practice of a considerable time.   The  appellants  have
not been able to show anything to  that  effect.   The  authorities  of  the
State of Jharkhand have acted the moment the notifications were  brought  to
their notice, and they have acted in accordance therewith.   This  certainly
cannot amount to deusteude.
</p>
<p id="p_404">      Promissory Estoppel and Legitimate Expectations

</p><p id="p_405">61.          As  we  have  seen  earlier,  for  invoking  the  principle  of
promissory estoppel there has to be a promise, and on that basis  the  party
concerned must have acted to its prejudice.  In  the  instant  case  it  was
only a proposal, and it was very much made clear that it was to be  approved
by the Central Government, prior  whereto  it  could  not  be  construed  as
containing a promise.  Besides, equity cannot be used  against  a  statutory
provision or notification.
</p>
<p id="p_406">62.         What the appellants are seeking is in  a  way  some  kind  of  a
specific performance  when  there  is  no  concluded  contract  between  the
parties.  An MOU is not a contract, and not in any case within  the  meaning
of <a href="/doc/1084525/" id="a_568">Article 299</a> of the Constitution of India.  Barring  one  party  (Adhunik)
other parties do not appear to have taken further steps.  In  any  case,  in
the absence of any promise, the appellants including Aadhunik  cannot  claim
promissory estoppel in the teeth  of  the  notifications  issued  under  the
relevant statutory powers.  Alternatively,  the  appellants  are  trying  to
make a case under the doctrine of legitimate  expectations.   The  basis  of
this doctrine is in reasonableness and fairness.  However, it can  also  not
be invoked where the decision of  the  public  authority  is  founded  in  a
provision of law, and is in consonance with public  interest.   As  recently
reiterated by this Court in the context of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_569">MMDR Act</a>, in Para  83  of  Sandur
Manganese (supra) ‘it  is  a  well  settled  principle  that  equity  stands
excluded when a matter if governed by statute’.   We  cannot  entertain  the
submission of unjustified discrimination in favour of Bihar Sponge and  Iron
Ltd. as well for the reason that it was not pressed before  the  High  Court
nor was any material placed before this Court to point out  as  to  how  the
grant in its favour was unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_407">      Epilogue

</p><p id="p_408">63.          Before we conclude, we may refer to the judgment of this  Court
in State of Tamil Nadu Vs. M/s Hind  Stone  reported  in  AIR  1981  SC  711
wherein the approach towards this statute came  up  for  consideration.   In
that matter this Court was concerned with Rule 8-C of the Tamil  Nadu  Minor
Mineral Concessions Rule, 1959 framed by the Government of Tamil Nadu  under
<a href="/doc/1376698/" id="a_570">Section 15</a> of the MMDR Act.  This rule provided as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_257">                 “8-C. Lease of quarries in  respect  of  black  granite  to
           Government Corporation, etc.

                       these rules, on and from 7th December 1977  no  lease
                       for quarrying  black  granite  shall  be  granted  to
                       private persons.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_259">                    2)  The  State  Government  themselves  may  engage   in
                       quarrying black granite or grant leases for quarrying
                       black granite in favour  of  any  corporation  wholly
                       owned by the State Government.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_260">                 Provided that in respect  of  any  land  belonging  to  any
           private person, the consent of such person shall be obtained for
           such quarrying or lease”




</blockquote><p id="p_409">64.         Although  in  Hind  Stone  the  Court  was  concerned  with  the
provision  of  this  rule  which  was  concerning  a  minor  mineral,  while
examining the validity thereof this Court (per O. Chinnappa  Reddy  J.)  has
made certain observations towards the approach and the  scope  of  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_571">MMDR  Act</a>
which are relevant for our purpose.  Thus in para  6,  it  was  observed  as
follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_261">                 “6…………….The public interest  which  induced  Parliament  to
           make the declaration contained in <a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_572">Section 2</a>  of  the  Mines  and
           Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_573">Development) Act</a>, 1957,  has  naturally
           to be the paramount consideration in all matters concerning  the
           regulation  of  mines   and   the   development   of   minerals,
           Parliament’s policy is clearly discernible from  the  provisions
           of  the  Act.  It  is  the  conservation  and  the  prudent  and
           discriminating exploitation of minerals, with a view  to  secure
           maximum benefit to the community……………..”




</blockquote><p id="p_410">65.         Again in para 9, this Court observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_262">                 “9……….Whenever there is a switch over from ‘private sector’
      to ‘public sector’ it does not necessarily follow  that  a  change  of
      policy requiring express legislative sanction is involved.  It depends
      on the subject and the statute.  For example, if a decision  is  taken
      to impose a general and complete ban on private mining  of  all  minor
      minerals, such a ban may involve the reversal of a major policy and so
      it may require legislative sanction.  But if a decision  is  taken  to
      ban private mining of a  single  minor  mineral  for  the  purpose  of
      conserving it, such a ban, if it is otherwise within the bounds of the
      authority given to the Government by the Statute, cannot  be  said  to
      involve any change of policy.  The policy of the Act remains the  same
      and  it  is,  as  we  said,  the  conservation  and  the  prudent  and
      discriminating exploitation of minerals, with a view to secure maximum
      benefit to the community.  Exploitation of  minerals  by  the  private
      and/or the public sector is contemplated.  If in the  pursuit  of  the
      avowed policy of the Act, it is thought  exploitation  by  the  public
      sector is best and wisest in the case of a particular mineral and,  in
      consequence  the  authority  competent   to   make   the   subordinate
      legislation makes a rule banning private exploitation of such mineral,
      which was hitherto permitted we are unable to see any change of policy
      merely because what was previously permitted is no longer permitted.”

      Last but not least, in para 13 this Court observed as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_263">                 “13……No one has a vested right to the grant or renewal of a
      lease and none can claim a vested right to have an application for the
      grant or renewal of a  lease  dealt  with  in  a  particular  way,  by
      applying particular provisions…….”



</blockquote><p id="p_411">66.         Mines and minerals are a part of the wealth of a  nation.   They
constitute the material resources of the community.  <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_574">Article  39(b)</a>  of  the
Directive Principles mandates that the State shall,  in  particular,  direct
its policy towards securing that the ownership and control of  the  material
resources of the community are  so  distributed  as  best  to  subserve  the
common good.  Thereafter, <a href="/doc/62166/" id="a_575">Article 39(c)</a> mandates that state  should  see  to
it  that  operation  of  the  economic  system  does  not  result   in   the
concentration of wealth and means of production  to  the  common  detriment.
The public interest is very much writ large in the provisions  of  <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_576">MMDR  Act</a>
and in the declaration under <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_577">Section 2</a> thereof.  The ownership of the  mines
vests in the State of  Jharkhand  in  view  of  the  declaration  under  the
provisions of Bihar Land  Reforms  Act,  1950  which  act  is  protected  by
placing it in the Ninth  Schedule  added  by  the  First  Amendment  to  the
Constitution. While  speaking  for  the  Constitution  Bench  in  Waman  Rao
(supra) Chandrachud, C.J. had following  to  state  on  the  co-relationship
between Articles 39 (b) and (c) and the First Amendment:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_264">                 “26.  <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_578">Article 39</a> of the Constitution  directs  by  clauses
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_265">    (b) and (c) that the ownership and control of the material resources of
    the community are so distributed as best to subserve the  common  good;
    that the operation of the  economic  system  does  not  result  in  the
    concentration  of  wealth  and  means  of  production  to  the   common
    detriment.  These twin principles of State Policy were a  part  of  the
    Constitution as originally enacted and it is in order to effectuate the
    purpose of  these  Directive  Principles  that  the  1st  and  the  4th
    Amendments were passed…..”









</blockquote><p id="p_412">67.         What is being submitted by the  appellants  is  that  the  State
Government cannot  issue  such  notifications  for  the  reasons  which  the
appellats have canvassed. We, however, do not find any error in  the  letter
of withdrawal dated 13.9.2005 issued by the  State  of  Jharkhand,  and  the
letter of rejection dated 6.3.2006 issued by the  Union  of  India  for  the
reasons stated therein.  In our view,  the  State  of  Jharkhand  was  fully
justified in declining the grant of leases to the private sector  operators,
and in reserving the areas for the public sector undertakings on  the  basis
of notifications of 1962, 1969 and 2006.  All that the State Government  has
done is to act in furtherance of the policy of the statute and it cannot  be
faulted for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_413">68.         For the reasons stated above we do not find any merit  in  these
appeals and they are all dismissed.  The interim orders passed therein  will
stand vacated.
</p>
<p id="p_414">69.         The Contempt Petition (C) No.14/2009 is  filed  by  Abhijeet  is
for the alleged breach of an earlier  order  dated  15.12.2008.   The  order
dated 28.01.2009 makes it clear that no notice was issued  on  the  Contempt
Petition.  Since  the  appeal  is  being  disposed  of  and  dismissed,  the
Contempt Petition is also dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_415">70.         Iron is a mineral  necessary  for  industrial  development.   In
view of the pendency of these appeals, and the stay  orders  sought  by  the
appellants therein, grant of lease of iron-ore mines to  the  public  sector
undertakings could not be made for over six years.  The State  of  Jharkhand
and the people at large have thereby suffered.  In  view  thereof  we  would
have  been  justified  in  imposing  costs  on  the  appellants.    However,
considering that important questions of law were raised  in  these  appeals,
we refrain from doing the same. The parties will therefore, bear  their  own
costs.
