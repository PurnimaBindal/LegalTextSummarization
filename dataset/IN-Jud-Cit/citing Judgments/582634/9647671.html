<p id="p_14">4.     The petitioner claiming that these drawings had been disclosed
to third parties by the respondent in its 'Online Competitive Bidding
Event' for SB-TUYERE &amp; INSERT ASSY, RFQ CAT. Code-
20314601000514 to be held on 03.06.2016 (hereinafter referred to as

"Tender no. 3") dated 21.04.2017 floated by the Respondent for
issuance of Lining Set for BF-5 Tuyere Stock and Blow Pipe, filed the
present petition praying for the above relief.
</p>
<p id="p_15">5.     It was further submitted that even before filing of the present
petition, Tender No.1 had already been granted to a third party.
</p>
<p id="p_16">6.     This Court vide its order dated 26th May, 2017 directed the
counsel for the respondent to seek instructions with respect to the
drawings that form part of the above tenders, complaining of
disclosure of which, the petition had been filed.         Counsel for the
respondent on 30th May, 2017, on behalf of the respondent, undertook
to remove the said drawings from public domain.
</p>
<p id="p_17">7.     The petitioner thereafter has filed an additional affidavit dated
3rd July, 2017 complaining therein that the respondent has floated a
fresh tender bearing no.005/595/1672000235/01/00/500004605 for



OMP(I)(COMM) 189/2017                                                Page 5
 issuance Tuyere with Insert for BF-5 (hereinafter referred to as
"Tender No.4") dated 26.05.2017, wherein drawing of operational
spares namely Tuyere with Insert for BF-5 has been copied from the
petitioner's drawing bearing no. 2B0987Gl - M358 - G0202.
</p>
<p id="p_18">8.    The respondent in its reply has stated that in terms of the tender,
apart from confidential drawings, various General Arrangements
Drawings had also been given by the petitioner to which the petitioner
can claim no confidentiality. In this regard, reliance was placed on
clause 7.4.3.4 of the contract, which makes reference to 'suppliers and
manufacturing drawings' (except for proprietary items).            It is,
therefore, submitted that merely by insertion of the disclaimer clause,
as has been reproduced above, the petitioner cannot claim that such
drawings have become confidential in nature or cannot be disclosed to
the third party; it is only drawings of proprietary items that are
protected from disclosure.     It is further submitted that there are
approximately 17000 such drawings that were supplied by the
petitioner to the respondent in performance of its work under the
contract, many of which are in public domain and in any case, cannot
be termed as confidential in nature or having any copyright protection.
It is further submitted that for operation and maintenance services, the
petitioner, under clause 7.4.3.3 and 7.4.3.4, was obliged to supply
various details regarding the spares including complete ordering
specification, the list of spares and manufacturing drawings, etc.
These drawings and specifications had been taken so that in case, the
petitioner at any point of time is unable to provide the spares or




OMP(I)(COMM) 189/2017                                              Page 6
 demand exorbitant price for such spares, which is not acceptable to the
respondent, the same can be procured from third party. This, in
submission of the learned senior counsel for the respondent, would
itself entail and authorize the respondent to disclose the drawings,
which are not of proprietary items, to the third parties from whom
such spares have to be procured.
</p>
<p id="p_19">9.    It is further submitted that any order of injunction would cause
grave irreparable injury to the respondent inasmuch as in the absence
of supply of spares, the entire work may come to standstill. Drawing
reference to the prayer (i) of the petition, it is submitted that the prayer
is in omnibus terms and in view of the judgment of this Court in
National Highway Authority of India v. Sudip Hariyal, 142 (2007)
DLT 566 such an omnibus injunction order cannot be granted. It has
been contended by learned senior counsel for the respondent that
though the petition was filed on 12.05.2017, till date the arbitration
proceedings have not commenced. In fact, the petitioner has not even
filed its statement of claim before International Chamber of
Commerce (in short 'ICC').
</p>
<p id="p_20">10.   I have considered the submission of learned senior counsels for
the parties. It is not disputed by the respondent that, in terms and
under the contract, it has received various drawings from the petitioner
which are of proprietary items and/or have a disclaimer of
confidentiality as has been reproduced herein above. The contract
does not contain any clause or term which would authorize the
respondent to use such drawings or disclose the same to a third party




OMP(I)(COMM) 189/2017                                                 Page 7
 post termination of the contract or in the event that the petitioner, at
any stage whatsoever, is unable to supply the spares or the respondent
is not willing to place an order for such spares on the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_21">11.   Submission of learned senior counsel for the respondent that
many of the drawings would not have any protection under Copyright
Law and/or would be available in public domain and therefore cannot
be granted protection by way of an interim order against the disclosure
to a third party cannot be accepted. Where the parties to the contract
have treated certain drawings to be confidential in nature, they are
bound by the same, irrespective of the fact whether, in law, the other
party can claim confidentiality over such drawings or not. <a href="/doc/1739601/" id="a_7">In John
Richard Brady and Ors. v. Chemical Process Equipments P. Ltd and
Anr</a>., MANU/DE/0586/1987, this Court, invoking of general rule of
equity and breach of confidence, had held that injunction can follow
when use of such drawings amounts to the unauthorized use of the
labour of the person who has prepared them and thus provides a
'spring-board' by which an infringer may obtain an unfair advantage
over competitors. This Court had placed reliance on the judgment in
Saltman Engineering Coy. Ld. Ferotec Ltd. and Monarch
Engineering Coy. (MITCHAM) Ld. v. Campbell Engineering Coy.
Ld.(1948) 65 RPC 203 and had extracted from the book of Patrick
Hearn the following passage:

        Engineering owned confidential drawings concerning
       the design and construction of certain specialist tools.
       Through an agent they purported to contract with
       Campbell Engineering for the manufacture of some of
       these tools, and to that end they handed over the
       drawings. Cambell Engineering used these drawings
       for their own purposes. There was contention as to
       whether or not there had been a viable contract, and
       if not whether a breach of confidence could in law
       have occurred. In the Court of Chancery the Judge
       held that there was in fact no binding contract and
       thus no breach of confidence.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       The Court of Appeal found that;
</p>
<p id="p_24">       (a) there was such a contract as had been claimed,

       provided to them for a limited purpose, that is to say
       the manufacture of certain specific tools;

       confidence by using documents for purposes other

        was entitled to have the documents returned to them
       and to receive damages for the breach.
</p>
<p id="p_28">       These bald findings are more specifically explained in
       the judgment of Lord Greene, then Master of the
       Rolls, which contains four important statements:
</p>
<p id="p_29">       1. If two parties make a contract under, which one of
       them obtains for the purpose of the contract, or in
       connection with it, some confidential matter then,
       even though the contract is silent on the matter of
       confidence, the law will imply an obligation to treat
       such confidential matter in a confidential way as one
       of the implied terms of the contract, but the obligation
       to respect confidence is not limited to cases where the
       parties are in confidential relationship.
</p>
<p id="p_30">       2. If a defendant is proved to have used confidential
       information, obtained directly or indirectly, from a
       plaintiff, without the consent, express or implied, of
       the plaintiff, he will be guilty of an infringement of the
       plaintiffs rights.
</p>
<p id="p_31">       3. It seems to me that it would not matter the least bit
       whether there was a contract; but contract or no
       contract, the defendants got those drawings into their
       hands knowing, or knowing shortly afterwards, that
       they belonged to Saltmans that they were obviously
       confidential matter, and they knew that they had got
       them into their hands for a strictly limited purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_32">       4. Information to be confidential must 11 apprehend,
       apart from contract, have the necessary quality of
       confidence about it, namely, it must not be something
       which is public property and public knowledge.
</p>



<p id="p_33">OMP(I)(COMM) 189/2017                                               Page 11
        It is important to note that the word, 'information'
       used in the last statement of the learned Master of the
       Rolls refers to know-how imparted by word of mouth,
       by letter or by demonstration. It does not refer to
       drawings or other such technical documents which
       are by their nature confidential whether or not a
       matter of public knowledge. This is on the established
       principle that the use of such drawings amounts to the
       unauthorized use of the labour of the person who has
       prepared them, and thus provides a 'spring-board' by
       which an infringer may obtain an unfair advantage
       over competitors."

<p id="p_34">12.          <a href="/doc/603848/" id="a_8">In   Zee    Telefilms   Ltd.    &amp;    Anr.    vs.    Sundial
Communications Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>. 2003 (27) PTC 457 (Bom) (DB),
Bombay High Court held that in appropriate cases an interlocutory
injunction may be issued restraining breach of confidentiality. It was
further held that if the confidential information was allowed to be used
against the plaintiff in competition with them by the defendants, it is
not merely a matter of compensation in Pound, Shilling or Pence and,
therefore, plaintiff would certainly be entitled to have injunction for
breaching confidentiality. The above judgment was followed by the
Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/582634/" id="a_9">Urmi Juvekar Chiang vs. Global Broadcast
News Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>. 2007 SCC Online Bom 471 wherein again it was
reiterated that if confidential information is going to be used in

compensation in terms of money. This Court also in <a href="/doc/1023088/" id="a_10">Daljeet Titus vs.

 any right under law; such an obligation need not be express but be
implied and the breach of such confidence is independent of any other
right.
</p>
<p id="p_35">13.      From the above authorities, law is well settled that a party to a
contract having obtained certain information on the basis of
contractual terms cannot turn around and question the confidentiality
of such information. These drawings, in my prima facie opinion, could
be used by the respondent only in working of the contract itself and
not be disclosed to a third party. A party to the contract cannot
challenge such confidentiality at a later stage having taken the benefit
of the same under the contract.        It is estopped from challenging
confidentiality of such drawings on the basis of same not having
copyright protection.
</p>
<p id="p_36">14.      Clause 16.3 of the contract provides that the confidentiality
clause shall not apply to such information which, after entering the
contract enters into public domain through no fault of that party or can
be proven to have been possessed by that party at the time of
disclosure and which was not previously obtained, directly or
indirectly from other party or it otherwise lawfully becomes available
to that party from a third party that has no application of
confidentiality.    Therefore, exception to confidentiality envisaged
under Clause 16.3 is where the drawings are in public domain or have
been obtained by the respondent not in terms of the contract in
question but from some other source. This is not the case pleaded by
the respondent before me. On the other hand, Clause 16.4 again




OMP(I)(COMM) 189/2017                                              Page 13
 retreats that any of these provisions would not modify any undertaking
of confidentiality given by either of the parties, meaning thereby that
where the drawing has been obtained by the respondent which bears
the disclaimer as quoted above, confidentiality shall have to be
maintained whether it is proprietary items or other items irrespective
of copyright protection. Equal protection is granted to the Respondent
under Clause 16.1 quoted above.
</p>
<p id="p_37">15.   Submission of the learned senior counsel for the Respondent
that no injunction be granted in the present case as damages can act as
an adequate relief in case the Petitioner ultimately succeeds, cannot be
accepted. The issue at hand is of confidential drawings and once they
come in public domain, Petitioner would suffer irreparable damage
which cannot be compensated in terms of money.
</p>
<p id="p_38">16.   In my view therefore, the Petitioner has made out a good prima
facie case for grant of an injunction and shall suffer a grave irreparable
injury in case interim injunction is not granted in its favour.
</p>
<p id="p_39">17.   As far as omnibus nature of prayer (i) made by the petitioner is
concerned, I am in agreement with learned senior counsel for the
respondent. The order of injunction as prayed for in prayer (i) cannot
be granted in general terms. In my opinion, the injunction has to be
restricted to only those drawings and information that was relating to
the proprietary items of the petitioner and/or those which bears the
disclaimer as has been quoted above.
</p>



<p id="p_40">OMP(I)(COMM) 189/2017                                              Page 14
</p><p id="p_41"> 18.   Learned senior counsel for the respondent further contends that
the respondent can procure these spares from a third party and for this
purpose certain information would necessarily have to be disclosed to
a third party, otherwise the entire operation of blast furnace would
come to a halt. In my opinion, however, this cannot be a ground for
infringing the confidential information obtained from the petitioner
under the contract. This, in any case, can be safeguarded by clarifying
that the respondent may use all the drawings that are otherwise
available in public domain and/or can be made through its own efforts.
It is true that the petitioner in its additional affidavit has submitted that
certain drawings had been copied by the respondent from its
confidential drawings with small modification, however, in my
opinion, this will be a matter to be adjudicated by the Arbitrator and
cannot be commented upon at this stage. This issue is to be taken
before Arbitral Tribunal, in accordance with the arbitration agreement
that has been executed between the parties. This would adequately
balance the equity between the parties for this purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_42">19.   Learned senior counsel for the respondent submits that this
petition was filed in May 2017, however, in spite of six months having
been passed, no steps has been taken by the petitioner to have the
Arbitration Tribunal constituted for adjudication of the disputes
between the parties. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner, on the
other hand, submits that it has already requested the ICC for
appointment of Arbitral Tribunal for adjudication of the disputes and
is in the process of filing its statement of claim. In my opinion, the




OMP(I)(COMM) 189/2017                                                 Page 15
 petitioner cannot endlessly wait for Arbitral Tribunal to be properly
constituted. I would therefore restrict the operation of my order with
the condition that the petitioner must file its statement of claim with
ICC within a period of 30 days from today, failing which this order
would automatically cease to operate. In case the statement of claim is
filed within 30 days from today and there is no other default on part of
the petitioner for having Arbitral Tribunal constituted with expedition,
this order would continue to operate till it is modified or vacated by
the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the ICC rules.
</p>
<p id="p_43">20.   In view of the above, I pass an ad-interim order restraining the
respondent or its agents in any manner disclosing to a third party the
proprietary drawings/information and/or drawings/information which
bears disclaimer:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "All Rights Reserved. This is a commercial drawing
       and is supplied for use for an authorised job. This
       drawing or any information therefrom shall not be
       disclosed, used or reproduced either wholly or in part,
       except in conjunction with such use and with the prior
       written consent of Daniel Corus. This drawing may
       not be used for construction or fabrication until
       signed as checked and approved."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_44">21.   The petition is allowed in the above terms.
</p>
<p id="p_45">22.   I may, however, hasten to add that my above observations are
prima facie in nature and in no manner bind the Arbitral Tribunal who
shall adjudicate the disputes between the parties on their own merits.
Either party would be free to raise any further claims, submissions,

would be constituted in terms of the Arbitration Agreement.</p><pre id="pre_2">
