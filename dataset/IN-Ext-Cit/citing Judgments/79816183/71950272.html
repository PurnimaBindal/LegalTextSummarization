        Darbhanga in Sessions Trial No.422 of 2010 as well as Sessions Trial

        deceased Kiran Devi had recorded his fard-bayan on 12.04.2010 at

        about 6.00 p.m. at Primary Health Centre, Biraul alleging inter alia

        that on the same day at about 11.00 a.m. while he was at his village,

        one of the villagers was telephoned from Kahua, Jagdishpur

        disclosing the fact that daughter of Shiv Narayan Chaudhary died. He

        was immediately informed whereupon rushed to the place of his

        daughter Kiran Devi lying at village-Kahua Jagdishpur where he

        found outer door bolted from outside. After opening of the door, they

        gone inside the house and in Eastern room, his daughter Kiran Devi

        was found lying on the ground by the side of a bed in burnt condition.

        On query, she disclosed that her husband Guddu Jha has sprinkled

        kerosene oil and during course thereof, her mother-in-law and Nanand

        Leela Devi caught hold and further, assaulted. Then thereafter, her

        mother-in-law lighted match and threw it on her body. At that very

        time, Bhulla Jha, Shyam Jha, Bhagwan Jha were provoking that she

        be eliminated and further, they are ready to face consequence. The

        motive for occurrence has been disclosed as about six years ago at the

        time of marriage of Kiran Devi, Rs.30,000/- remained due in lieu of

        dowry and for that, Guddu Jha, Shyam Jha, wife of Shyam Jha,

        daughter of Shyam Jha were persistently demanding which, on

        account of poverty, he found unable to pay and for that, Bhulla Jha

        and Bhagwan Jha scolded him. Furthermore, deceased Kiran Devi

        was regularly tortured in order to facilitate early procurement of the

        same. It has also been disclosed that deceased had begotten two

        siblings, Nitu Kumari aged about 3 years and a son aged about six

        months.

<p id="p_6">                         3. On the basis of the aforesaid fard-bayan, Biraul P. S.

        Case No.52 of 2010 was registered whereupon investigation

        commenced and concluded by way of submission of chargesheet in

        two stages as per presence of respective accused whereupon two

        separate Sessions Trial, as indicated above, were registered which

        during course of trial, got amalgamated and concluded whereunder

        appellants found guilty and convicted while remaining got acquitted

        whereupon there two appeals arise, the subject matter of adjudication.

        examination as well as statement recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> of the

        Cr.P.C. is of complete denial of the occurrence. Furthermore, it has

        also been pleaded that there was congenial, harmonious relationship

        prevailing amongst the appellants as well as deceased and so, there

        was no occasion for the appellants to advance demand of Rs.30,000/-,

        which never oriented right from negotiation. Apart from this, it has

        also been pleaded that the reason best known to the deceased, she

        committed suicide by setting fire after locking the door from inside

        while her husband Guddu (appellant) had gone to visit Darbhanga for

        his treatment, father-in-law (since acquitted) had gone to participate in

        a Panchayati, mother-in-law (appellant) had gone to the place of DW-

        1 Ghurni Devi along with a kid and after seeing smoke coming out

        from the house, the villagers rushed to rescue the deceased and for

        that, after opening door, they gone inside, but till then, deceased was

        already dead. On that very score, one DW has also been examined.

        examined altogether ten (10) P.Ws. out of whom, PW-1 Dinanand

        Mishra, PW-2 Ram Kumar Yadav, PW-3 Binod Kumar Mishra, PW-

        <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_5">Section 304B</a> of the I.P.C., the mandate of law requires the

        formula could be prescribed there for and will vary as per facts of

        individual case. In case, there happens to be consistent and conclusive

        evidence of the prosecution on that very score, then in that event,

        there would be presumption of dowry death in terms of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_6">Section 113B</a>

        of the Evidence Act even then, the accused will have an opportunity

                                         in the case of an abnormal death if a young bride

                                         confines its charges to Section 304B because the

                                         obligation   to   provide   proof    becomes     least

                                         burdensome for it; this is the significance that

                                         attaches to a deeming provision. But, in any death

                                         other than in normal circumstances, we see no

                                         justification for not citing either Section 302 or

                                         Section 306, as the circumstances of the case call

                                         for. Otherwise, the death would logically fall in the

                                         category of an accidental one. It is not sufficient to

                                         include only Section 498A as the punishment is

                                         relatively light. Homicidal death is chargeable and

                                         punishable under Sections 302 and 304B if

                                         circumstances prevail triggering these provisions.

                                         in <a href="/doc/79816183/" id="a_8">Pathan Hussain Basha v. State of Andhra

                                         opinions - (a) that <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_9">Article 20</a> of the Constitution of

                                         India contains a presumption of innocence in favour

                                         of a suspect and, (b) that the concept of deeming

                                         fiction   is   hardly    applicable    to    criminal

                                         jurisprudence. The logical consequence of both

                                         these conclusions would lead to the striking down of

                                         words are employed in close proximity, or in the

                                         same section, or in the same enactment, the

                                         assumption must be that the legislature intended

                                         them to depict disparate situations, and delineate

                                         dissimilar   and    diverse   ramifications.    Ergo,

                                         ordinarily Parliament could not have proposed to

                                         ordain that the prosecution should "prove" the

                                         existence of a vital sequence of facts, despite having

                                         employed the word "shown" in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_14">Section 304B</a>. The

                                         question is whether these two words can be

                                         construed as synonymous. It seems to us that if the

                                         prosecution is required to prove, which always

                                         means beyond reasonable doubt, that a dowry death

                                         has been committed, there is a risk that the purpose

                                         postulated in the provision may be reduced to a

                                         cipher. This method of statutory interpretation has

                                         consistently been disapproved and deprecated

                                         except in exceptional instances where the syntax

                                         permits reading down or reading up of some words

                                         of the subject provisions.

                                         burden of proof falls upon the party who

                                         substantially asserts the truth of a particular fact

                                         (the prosecution or the plaintiff). A distinction is

                                         drawn between the persuasive (or legal) burden,

                                         defendant is presumed to be innocent until he is

                                         proved guilty; it is therefore the duty of the

                                         prosecution to prove its case by establishing both

                                         the actus reus of the crime and the mens rea. It must

                                         first satisfy the evidential burden to show that its

                                         allegations have something to support them. If it

                                         cannot satisfy this burden, the defence may submit

                                         or the judge may direct that there is no case to

                                         answer, and the judge must direct the jury to acquit.

                                         presumptions of fact to satisfy the evidential burden

                                         of proof (e.g. the fact that a woman was subjected

                                         raise a presumption to support a charge of rape and

                                         prove that she did not consent). If, however, the

                                         prosecution has established a basis for its case, it

                                         must then continue to satisfy the persuasive burden

                                         by proving its case beyond reasonable doubt (see

                                         proof beyond reasonable doubt). It is the duty of the

                                         judge to tell the jury clearly that the prosecution

                                         must prove its case and that it must prove it beyond

                                         reasonable doubt; if he does not give this clear

                                         direction, the defendant is entitled to be acquitted.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.261 of 2015                                                12</span>




                                         the burden of proof is upon the prosecution. The

                                         main exceptions are as follows. (1) When the

                                         defendant admits the elements of the crime (the

                                         actus reus and mens rea) but pleads a special

                                         defence, the evidential burden is upon him to prove

                                         his defence. This may occur, the example, in a

                                         prosecution for murder in which the defendant

                                         raises a defence of self-defence. (2) When the

                                         defendant pleads automatism, the evidential burden

                                         is upon him. (3) When the defendant pleads

                                         insanity, both the evidential and persuasive burden

                                         rest upon him. In this case, however, it is sufficient

                                         if he proves his case on a balance of probabilities

                                         (i.e. he must persuade the jury that it is more likely

                                         that he is telling the truth than not). (4) In some

                                         cases statute expressly places a persuasive burden

                                         on the defendant; for example, a person who carries

                                         an offensive weapon in public is guilty of an offence

                                         unless he proves that he had lawful authority or a

                                         reasonable excuse for carrying it".

                                         interchangeable with the word 'deemed'. In the

                                         realm of civil and fiscal law, it is not difficult to

                                         import the ordinary meaning of the word 'deem' to

                                         denote a set of circumstances which call to be

                                         construed contrary to what they actually are. In

                                         with the demand of dowry. We are aware that the

                                         word 'soon' finds place in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_23">Section 304B</a>; but we

                                         would prefer to interpret its use not in terms of days

                                         or months or years, but as necessarily indicating

                                         that the demand for dowry should not be stale or an

                                         aberration of the past, but should be the continuing

                                         cause for the death under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_24">Section 304B</a> or the

                                         preponderance      of     possibility,    the      initial

                                         presumption of innocence is replaced by an

                                         assumption of guilt of the accused, thereupon

                                         transferring the heavy burden of proof upon him

                                         and requiring him to produce evidence dislodging

                                         his guilt, beyond reasonable doubt. It seems to us

                                         that what Parliament intended by using the word

                                         'deemed' was that only preponderance of evidence

                                         would be insufficient to discharge the husband or

                                         his   family    members     of    their   guilt.    This

                                         interpretation provides the accused a chance of

                                         proving their innocence. This is also the postulation

                                         of <a href="/doc/147127/" id="a_26">Section 101</a> of the Evidence Act. The purpose of

                                         of the IPC, in our opinion, is to counter what is

                                         commonly encountered - the lack or the absence of

                                         evidence in the case of suicide or death of a woman

                                         within seven years of marriage. If the word "shown"

                                         has to be given its ordinary meaning then it would

                                         only require the prosecution to merely present its

                                         evidence in Court, not necessarily through oral

                                         deposition, and thereupon make the accused lead

                                         detailed evidence to be followed by that of the

                                         prosecution. This procedure is unknown to Common

                                         the guilt of a person in a legal system founded on a

                                         Constitution needs to be briefly reflected on. The

                                         Constitution is the grundnorm on which the legal

                                         framework has to be erected and its plinth cannot

                                         be weakened for fear of the entire structure falling

                                         to the ground. If the Constitution expressly affirms

                                         or prohibits particular state of affairs, all statutory

                                         provisions which are incongruent thereto must be

                                         held as ultra vires and, therefore, must not be

                                         adhered to. We have already noted that <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_30">Article 20</a>

                                         of our Constitution while not affirming the

                                         presumption of innocence does not prohibit it,

                                         thereby, leaving it to Parliament to ignore it

                                         whenever found by it to be necessary or expedient.

                                         A percutaneous scrutiny reveals that some legal

                                         principles such as presumption of innocence can be

                                         found   across    a   much       wider   legal   system,

                                         ubiquitously in the Common Law system, and

                                         restrictively in the Civil Law system. It seems to us

                                         that the presumption of innocence is one such legal

                                         principle which strides the legal framework of

                                         several countries owing allegiance to the Common

                                         proved   guilty   according    to   law.   We   may

                                         immediately emphasise that the tenet of presumed

                                         innocence will always give way to explicit

                                         legislation to the contrary. The presumption of

                                         innocence has also been recognised in certain

                                         circumstances to constitute a basic human right.

                                         Parliament, however, has been tasked with the

                                         responsibility of locating myriad competing, if not

                                         conflicting, societal interests. It is quite apparent

                                         that troubled by the exponential increase in the

                                         incidents of bride burning, Parliament thought it

                                         prudent, expedient and imperative to shift the

                                         burden of proof in contradistinction to the onus of

                                         "prove" and the word "deemed" has to be read

                                         down to mean "presumed". Neither life nor liberty

                                         can   be   emasculated     without    providing   the

                                         individual an opportunity to disclose extenuating or

                                         exonerating circumstances. It was for this reason

                                         that this Court struck down the mandatory death

                                         dowry. The other facet is that the husband has

                                         indeed a heavy burden cast on his shoulders in that

                                         his deemed culpability would have to be displaced

                                         and overturned beyond reasonable doubt. This

                                         emerges clearly as the manner in which Parliament

                                         sought to combat the scourge and evil of rampant

                                         bride burning or dowry deaths, to which manner we

                                         unreservedly subscribe. In order to avoid prolixity

                                         we shall record that our understanding of the law

                                         finds support in an extremely extensive and erudite

                                         judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/38264736/" id="a_41">P.N. Krishna Lal v.

                                         which decisions spanning the globe have been

                                         mentioned and discussed. It is also important to

                                         highlight that <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_42">Section 304B</a> does not require the

                                         accused to give evidence against himself but casts

                                         the onerous burden to dislodge his deemed guilt

                                         beyond reasonable doubt. In our opinion, it would

                                         not be appropriate to lessen the husband's onus to

                                         that of preponderance of probability as that would

                                         annihilate the deemed guilt expressed in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_43">Section

                                         304B</a>, and such a curial interpretation would defeat

                                         mind is where dowry demands have indubitably

                                         been made by the accused husband, where in an

                                         agitated state of mind, the wife had decided to leave

                                         her matrimonial home, and where while travelling

                                         by bus to her parents' home she sustained fatal burn

                                         injuries in an accident/collision which that bus

                                         encountered. Surely, if the husband proved that he

                                         played no role whatsoever in the accident, he could

                                         not be deemed to have caused his wife's death. It

                                         needs to be immediately clarified that if the wife

                                         had taken her life by jumping in front of a bus or

                                         before a train, the husband would have no defence.

                                         Examples can be legion, and hence we shall abjure

                                         from going any further. All that needs to be said is

                                         that if the husband proves facts which portray,

                                         beyond reasonable doubt, that he could not have

                                         caused the death of his wife by burns or bodily

                                         injury or not involved in any manner in her death in

        marriage and is found intact even during course of evidence which

        sound of groaning of deceased whereupon they gone near her,

        enquired whereupon deceased disclosed that in the background of

        persistent demand of dowry appertaining to Rs.30,000/-, which

        remained due, the husband sprinkled kerosene oil and then, mother-in-

        law set fire, and at that very time, Bhulla and Bhagwan enticed them.

        During cross-examination, as is evident, PW-1 was not all cross-

        examined on the score whether deceased was dead since before their

        arrival, or deceased was not at all in a position to make any kind of

        disclosure. However, from Para-5, he had stated that he came to know

        on the disclosure having made before him. PW-2, in likewise manner,

        also not been cross-examined on the physical mental condition of the

        deceased as well as she was dead since before their arrival, or was not

        under Para-13, had stated regarding physical condition of the deceased

        whom they had seen after entrance in the house, but again, defence

        did not dare to test his status over dying declaration. PW-6 also not

        specifically been cross-examined and in similarity, PW-7 and PW-8,

        have also been cross-examined. Furthermore, as is evident that by

                                         every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the man

                                         is induced by the most powerful consideration to

                                         speak only the truth. Notwithstanding the same,

                                         great caution must be exercised in considering the

                                         weight to be given to this species of evidence on

                                         account of the existence of many circumstances

                                         which may affect their truth. The situation in which

                                         a man is on the deathbed is so solemn and serene, is

                                         the reason in law to accept the veracity of his

                                         statement. It is for this reason the requirements of

                                         oath and cross-examination are dispensed with.

                                         Since the accused has no power of cross-

                                         examination, the courts insist that the dying

                                         declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire

                                         full confidence of the court in its truthfulness and

                                         correctness. The court, however, has always to be

                                         on guard to see that the statement of the deceased

                                         was not as a result of either tutoring or prompting

                                         or a product of imagination. The court also must

                                         further decide that the deceased was in a fit state of

                                         mind and had the opportunity to observe and

                                         identify the assailant. Normally, therefore, the court

                                         declaration is not acceptable. A dying declaration

                                         even a shadow of continuing in this world

                                         practically non-existent, every motive of falsehood

                                         is obliterated. The mind gets altered by most

                                         powerful ethical reasons to speak only the truth.

                                         Great solemnity and sanctity is attached to the

                                         words of a dying person because a person on the

                                         verge of death is not likely to tell lies or to concoct

                                         a case so as to implicate an innocent person. The

                                         maxim is "a man will not meet his Maker with a lie

                                         in his mouth" (nemo moriturus praesumitur

                                         of a dying man". The general principle on which the

                                         species of evidence is admitted is that they are

                                         declarations made in extremity, when the party is at

                                         the point of death, and when every hope of this

                                         world is gone, when every motive to falsehood is

                                         silenced and mind induced by the most powerful

                                         consideration to speak the truth; situation so

</p><p id="p_30">                         19. It has also been submitted that from the evidence of

        PW-10, the I.O., it is evident that apart from fallacious investigation

        conducted by him, he going to camp of the prosecution, had tried to

        give undue advantage and further, under such activity, he failed to

        inspect the P.O. properly. Had there been a proper investigation, then

        in that event, the objective finding would have suggested probability

        of the defence case justifying the evidence of the defence witness

        disclosing commission of suicide and further, at that very moment,

        none of the family members were present and so, the finding of the

        learned lower Court requires reappraisal.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                         20. It has also been submitted that once on the similar

        kind of evidence, the other co-accused have already been acquitted,

        then in that event, appellants would not have been convicted. So, the

        cumulative effect nullify the judgment impugned.

</p><p id="p_32">                         21. Per contra, it has been submitted on behalf of learned

        Additional Public Prosecutor that death is no more under controversy,

        death within seven years of marriage is also not been challenged, then

        in that event, the other ancillary event as projected by the learned

        counsel for the appellants would have no impact upon the fate of the

        prosecution on account of consistent evidence on that very score. That

        being so, the judgment of conviction and sentence recorded by the

        learned lower Court is found maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_33">                         22. Having minute observation of the evidence as

        discussed above, it is evident that the death within span of seven years

        from the date of marriage and demand of dowry followed with

        treatment meted out to the deceased soon before death is found duly

        substantiated. Furthermore, complicity of the appellants also found

        duly proved.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                         23. In the aforesaid background, now, it could very well

        be said that it happens to be a case of dowry death and on account

        thereof, the appellants would have an opportunity to rebut which they

        availed by way of examine one DW Ghurni Devi. When the evidence

        of Ghurni Devi has been gone through, it is evident that the villagers,

        after seeing smoke coming out from the house of the appellants,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49"> Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.261 of 2015                                  50</span>




        rushed. The door, which was closed from inside was broken and then,

        villagers gone inside the house where they saw the victim dead on

        account of being burnt. The aforesaid event though introduced but

        found shaky one as from the evidence of PW-10, the I.O., it is

        apparent that appellants have not cross-examined PW-10 on that very

        score, even suggesting that he failed to inspect the door, the latches

        affixed thereupon. Moreover, had there been it a case of suicide, then

        in that event, having presence of dead body in static position lying on

        the ground would not have been visualized. Not only this, some sort

        of ancillary event would have also been visualized by way of burning

        of thatched wall as well as presence of shadow of flame, the bed-

        sheet, the bed also have been burnt which has not been found by the

        I.O.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                         24. Acquittal of co-accused would not be a ground for

        acquittal of other co-accused in case there happens to be substantial

        evidence against him. Considering the present nature of the case in

        consonance with the status of appellants and further, the crime having

        been committed within four corner of the house as well as oral dying

        declaration identifying the appellants to be perpetrator of the crime

        did not justify the claim of the appellants to be treated at par with the

        accused having been acquitted.
</p>
<p id="p_36">                         25. That being so, both the appeal san merit and are

                   accordingly, dismissed. Appellants are under custody, which they

                   remain till saturation of the period of sentence.
