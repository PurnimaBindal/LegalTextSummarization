DIPAK MISRA, CJ


       Invoking the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India, the petitioners have prayed for declaring the

circulars AIC No: 7/2007 dated 28.9.2007, AIC No: 15/2008 dated

31.12.2008, AIC No: 6/2009 dated 30.6.2009, AIC No:13/2009 dated

31.12.2009, AIC No:3/2010 dated 2.6.2010 and the Regulations, namely,

Airports Authority of India (General Management, Entry for Ground

Handling Services) Regulations, 2007 (for short „2007 Regulations‟) as ultra

vires the provisions of <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_2">The Aircraft Act</a>, 1934 (for short „the 1934 Act‟), The

W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                         Page 2 of 96
 Aircraft Rules, 1937 (for short „the 1937 Rules‟) and <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_3">The Airports Authority

of India Act</a>, 1994 (for short „the 1994 Act‟) and also ultra vires Articles 14

and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India and further to issue a writ of

certiorari for quashment of the same.


THE FACTUAL EXPOSITION AND THE STAND OF THE
PETITIONERS


2.     The petitioner No.1, Federation of Indian Airlines, is a society

registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_4">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 comprising all the

airline carriers which include the other writ petitioners. It is involved in

promoting and diffusing useful knowledge on the aviation industry in India

and represents the aviation industry before the concerned authorities for the

purpose of resolving the issues and challenges faced by the said industry.

The petitioner Nos.2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 are companies incorporated under

the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_5">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and are engaged in the business of providing

scheduled air transport services. As an integral part of their business, they

operate airlines under the brand names SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir, Jet Airways

(including Jet Konnect), Jet Lite, Kingfisher (include Kingfisher Red), etc.

The petitioner Nos.3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 are shareholders and / or directors of

their respective companies.


3.     As set forth, the business of running the airlines consists, inter alia, of

owning and / or operating airplanes and provision of ground handling


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 3 of 96
 facilities in relation thereto all of which are undertaken by the personnel

dedicated for the said purpose. Though there are outsourced personnel

engaged by various airlines for the same purpose, yet the choice of whether

to outsource and to whom had been left to the option of the concerned

airlines.


4.     The airlines, like the petitioners, are involved in providing self-ground

handling service and even if they are undertaking ground handling services

through third parties, each airline has the right to conduct self-ground

handling services. Ground handling constitutes an integral and inalienable

part of any airlines‟ business and it is one of the main and unique, selling

proposition of the airlines differentiating the services provided by one

particular airline from their competitors. The ground handling services are

aimed at providing a hassle free experience to the passengers and are akin to

providing hospitality services. Some of the airlines provide self-ground

handling services themselves while some airlines sub-contract the same to

the airports or a handling agent or to another airline. The said exercise is

carried out by an airline after careful consideration of numerous factors

including the capability and competency of the agency to provide ground

handling services, the cost impact, the suitability of the business model and

the reputation and standard maintained in the industry. The purpose of the

said agents are monitored by the airlines by strict service level agreements



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 4 of 96
 bearing, amongst others, financial implications in case of failure to meet the

agreed standards of service.


5.     It is the experience of the petitioners that undertaking ground handling

services themselves have enabled them to maintain the quality, cost and

efficiency, level of performance and also helped in providing comfort and

satisfaction to the passengers.     The decision to undertake the ground

handling services, which includes ramp handling and traffic handling, by

themselves or to outsource is a business decision intrinsic to their business

model and the airlines have the liberty to do so. The ramp handling includes

cabin services like cleaning the plane, replenishing the supplies and

consumables, etc. and traffic handling services include guiding the aircraft

into and out of the parking position, refilling of fresh water tanks, air

conditioning, luggage handling by belt loaders and baggage carts, passenger

stairs (used instead of aerobridges or air stairs), wheel chair lifts, providing

check-in counter services, gate arrival and departure services and airline

lounges, etc. In this regard, reference has been made to the circular AIC

No:3/2010 dated 2.6.2010 issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation

laying down the specific components of the ground handling operations. It

is contended that as per the said circular, the private airlines are given

permission only to be involved in ground handling activities where

passenger interface is required.



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 5 of 96
 6.     As set forth in the petition, if the said circular is given effect to, the

airline operators can only undertake very negligible activities and many

activities intrinsically connected with the business cannot be undertaken by

the operators. It is averred that since the inception of civil aviation in India,

the majority of the member airlines of the petitioner No.1 have been

providing self-ground handling services or sub-contracting it to an airport or

handling agent or another airline who can satisfy the specific tailor-made

requirements of an individual airline. The ground handling services have the

statutory recognition, as is noticed from the notification issued by the

Director General of Civil Aviation („DGCA‟) while granting permit to

operate scheduled passengers air transport services.


7.     It is put forth that the aforesaid requirement is one of the pre-

conditions for the grant of a licence and regard being had to the same, the

petitioners have invested huge amounts of money in employing people on its

rolls and creating the necessary and highly capital-intensive infrastructure to

undertake the ground handling services efficiently to cater to the airlines

operations.


8.     As set forth, on 18.10.2007, the Airports Authority of India („AAI‟)

notified its 2007 Regulations. Prior to that, a circular dated 28.9.2007 was

issued by DGCA for the airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore,



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 6 of 96
 Chennai and Kolkata though the airports at Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and

Bangalore are not managed by the AAI. It is contended that the 2007

Regulations ex facie cannot apply to such airports. A reference has been

made to an order dated 21.8.2009 issued by the Bureau of Civil Aviation

Security („BCAS‟) vide AVSEC order No.3/09 stipulating, inter alia, to the

effect that several security functions mentioned therein would have to be

carried out by the airline security personnel themselves and not by any

ground handling agency.       The DGCA by the circular dated 2.6.2010

extended the last date for the airline operators to conduct self-ground

handling to 31.12.2010.


9.     It is averred that the said circular dated 2.6.2010 prevents / prohibits

the airlines to provide ground handling services where there is no passenger

interface. It is contended that the said circular could not have been issued by

the said authority in the absence of an amendment of the ground handling

Regulations 2007 as there is a complete dichotomy between the circular and

the 2007 Regulations in the field.


10.    The impugned circulars and Regulations have been assailed on the

ground that the said circulars / Regulations run counter to Rule 92 of the

1937 Rules. It is contended that the DGCA has no authority to issue the

impugned circulars and that the said circulars have been issued in utter

disregard of the provisions of the 1934 Act, the 1994 Act and the Rules and


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                  Page 7 of 96
 Regulations made thereunder. It is further contended that the circulars have

been issued without any application of mind, as an incurable dichotomy

exists between the Regulations and the circulars.         It is urged that the

circulars are absolutely arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory and, hence,

offend <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India; that the circulars / regulations

violate the individual airlines‟ and their shareholders‟ fundamental right to

practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business as

enshrined under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_7">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India and do not meet

the test of reasonableness enshrined under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_8">Article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution

of India; that the circulars do not in any way remotely suggest for

enhancement of security; and that the applicability of the circulars /

Regulations is immensely vague and the same are also not in accord with the

Acts and the Regulations.


11.    It is contended that while the circulars / Regulations permit ground

handling facilities to either an airport operator or the National Aviation

Company Ltd. or their joint venture, similar facility is denied to the airline

operators as a result of which the discrimination gets writ large, inviting the

frown of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and that the circulars /

Regulations admit to endow the National Aviation Co. Ltd. with an

unprecedented and unwarranted benefit at the cost of the petitioners despite

the fact that the National Aviation Company Ltd. is a competitor of the



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 8 of 96
 petitioners in the airline business and, hence, such conferment of benefit is

completely unjustified and arbitrary.      It is further contended that the

impugned circulars / Regulations virtually make it impossible for the

petitioners to undertake their licensed activities at the six airports out of

many as a consequence of which they would have to abandon their own

operations in the said six airports and eventually only restrict their operation

to the remaining airports resulting in tremendous and immensurable decrease

in their business activity.


12.    It is urged that the plea of security is a subterfuge to paralyze the

operational aspects of the petitioners inasmuch as at various sensitive

airports, the petitioners are legally permitted to carry out the ground

handling facilities and further private players have been allowed to carry out

the ground handling facilities; and that the segregation of ground handling

into those involving passenger interface and not involving passenger

interface is wholly unreasonable and unworkable as both have to be operated

in complete harmony and coordination, but the said aspect has not been

taken into consideration by the authorities issuing the circulars and,

therefore, the new policy, if implemented, would result in retrenchment of

ground service personnel, idling of assets and would further put the

reputation and goodwill of the airlines in jeopardy since such a service is an

insegregable facet of running of the business.



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 9 of 96
 13.    It is contended that the circulars and Regulations have made a

maladroit effort to overturn the level playing field that is required to be

maintained between the National Aviation Company Ltd. and the private

airlines and such an activity is contrary to any commercial policy. It is

contended that in the international field, in many an airport in United States

of America, United Kingdom and Australia, the airline operators are

permitted to provide self-ground handling service in both ramp and terminal

side operations but the same has been denied to the private airline operators

as per the impugned circulars in the garb of security though it is basically

incorrect. It is put forth that the circulars fundamentally transgress the basic

facet of Rule 92 of the 1937 Rules as it totally demolishes the concept of

competitive environment which is impermissible in the face of the said Rule.

It is urged that as a result of the issuance of the notifications, the airlines

would be compelled to avail of the services either from the National

Aviation Company Ltd. or the airport operator who would, in turn, demand

monopolistic charges as there is no provision for any kind of checks and

balances.


14.    It is advocated that the circulars in actuality do not achieve any

significant enhancement of security inasmuch as the airlines had been

involved in the ground handling business for a number of years and have

acquired considerable expertise and there are immense protective guidelines


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 10 of 96
 with regard to the ground handling facility carried out by the petitioners and

their staff have been trained in the said regard and at no point of time it has

been pointed out that there has been any security lapse. It is put forth that if

the circulars have been issued to protect the security in the country, then

there is no justification to restrict it to six airports in the metropolitan cities

since security threat is more grave at some other airports and thus, the whole

intention of the circular is to oust the petitioners from operating the ground

handling facility. It is averred that the basic purpose of the circular is to give

more mileage to the airport operators / owners in the guise of security and,

hence, it is basically a cavil between the commercial interest of the

petitioners and that of the private operators which smacks of total

arbitrariness; that the airlines are responsible for the security of their

equipment including aircraft, etc. and, therefore, it is extremely unreasonable

to expect, on one hand, the airline operators to be responsible for the security

of their own equipment and on the other, prevent them from undertaking

ground handling services which also ensures the security of their equipment

and thereby an anomalous situation has been introduced betraying all norms

of rationality and reasonability.


15.    It is further stated that the security aspect in respect of the ground

handling services is subject to the control of BCAS clearances and, hence,

the same cannot be a ground to deprive the petitioners of the said business



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                     Page 11 of 96
 facility which is an inseparable facet of their business. It is contended that

the ramp handling as well as passenger handling are an inalienable part of an

airlines‟ operations and cost effect and are also connected with on-time

performance, efficient turnaround time and utilization of the aircraft which

are dependent on factors like time, security, efficiency and effective

handling of passengers and their baggage at the airport and the same cannot

be and should not be handed over to a third party. It is asserted that if any

loss or damage is caused to the luggage, the individual airline operators will

still be held liable, whereas, by virtue of operation of the impugned circulars,

they are not permitted to conduct the ground handling facility and such a

situation would be contrary to the Carriage by <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>, 1972 and various

rules framed thereunder. It is contended that the private owners or the

proposed independent ground handling operators would require to recruit the

same staff who are now working on behalf of the airline operators and

thereby the security scenario would not improve but there would only be a

diversion of business interest.


THE STANCE IN OPPOGUNATION BY THE RESPONDENT NOS. 1
AND 2


16.    A counter affidavit has been filed by the respondent Nos.1 and 2

contending, inter alia, that prior to 2007, ground handling at Indian airports

was done under the 2000 Regulations and all scheduled airlines were



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 12 of 96
 permitted to undertake ground handling services. At a later stage, ground

handling of flights at the Indian airports became a matter of grave concern

against the backdrop of international terrorism which witnessed hijacking of

Indian Airline passengers, carrying shoe bombs, liquid explosives, etc. The

respondents thought it prudent to consider the practice adopted in several

other countries for civil aviation safety and security by restricting ground

handling services to only the airport authority and the national carrier and

their subsidiaries excluding all private agencies and self-handling airlines.

Apart from the aspect of safety, certain other aspects, namely, minimum

equipment which lies in the operational area, optimal utilization of

equipment and personnel deployed, ground flight safety and minimum

number of people operating equipment on the airside and a choice of world

class operators for airlines at affordable prices in a competitive environment

were also kept in view. It is put forth that Delhi and Mumbai airports have

been restructured through joint ventures entered into by the airport authority

and regard being had to the factum of restructuring, the concerned

authorities were of the view that ground handling services, being an

important element of service standards to be complied by the airport

operators as laid down in Schedule 3 of the Operation Management and

Development Agreement (OMDA) signed with the JVCs, should be a

restricted activity and self-handling of flights by all airlines except Air India

should not be allowed. The ground handling policy was reviewed by the


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 13 of 96
 Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) in its meeting held on 1.2.2007

wherein, the issues of security and aviation safety, achieving world class

ground handling services, clarity on ground handling, etc. were approved.

The ground handling policy allowed the entities to undertake ground

handling services at all metropolitan airports located at Delhi, Mumbai,

Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The policy was notified by

the Regulation of 2007 on 18.10.2007 in respect of AAI airports and by the

DGCA vide AIC dated 28.9.2007 for other airports. The policy came into

effect from the date of its notification, except to the extent of the exit of non-

entitled entities, which was scheduled for 1.1.2009.


17.    It is asseverated that a representation was received from the airlines

through the petitioner No.1 on 6.11.2008 raising certain issues and regard

being had to the concern shown, time was extended till 30.6.2009. During

the said period, the respondent No.1 undertook an exercise to consult other

stakeholders, including the airlines and airport operators, in order to

understand and accordingly redress the concerns. The petitioner No.1 made

another representation to the respondents on 5.6.2009 almost at the end of

the extended time period fixed for the exit of non-entitled entities and after

examination of the said representation, time was extended by another six

months, i.e., upto 31.12.2009. In order to finalize the views on the issues

raised by the airlines and the petitioner No.1, the answering respondents



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 14 of 96
 collected the details of the number of employees engaged in ground handling

activities working directly on the rolls of the individual domestic airlines

(excluding Air India) and outsourced / sub-contracted through the other

agencies and the details of the equipment employed for ground handling by

these airlines at all the six major airports. The manpower employed by the

various airlines in the six metropolitan airports has been brought on record

as Annexure R-1/5. It is put forth that the total number of 15,954 persons

were employed by the five domestic airlines excluding Air India at the six

metro airports out of which 6210 were direct employees on the rolls of these

airlines and the rest are outsourced to other sub-contractors. With regard to

the assertions made in the petition pertaining to business facilities and

interest, it is averred that the airlines would require some additional time for

phasing out the ground handling equipments and also to create a proper exit

policy for the manpower employed by them and accordingly, certain

amendments in the Regulations issued in the year 2007 were proposed which

was considered by the CCS in its meeting held on 14.12.2009 and it was

approved in the last Regulations, namely, the 2007 Regulations. It was

decided that no further time would be given beyond 31.12.2010 and all

necessary steps should be taken to implement the approved ground handling

policy by that date. Thereafter, no further representation on the ground

handling policy was received by the respondents. In pursuance of the above

decision, the DGCA issued the AIC No.3/2010 dated 2.6.2010 in succession


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 15 of 96
 to the AIC 07/2007 dated 28.9.2007 and amendment to the 2007 Regulations

was issued on 2.12.2010. The BCAS vide its AVSEC order No.05/2009

dated 29.10.2009 had made the airlines responsible for certain activities

relating to security, like the security of the aircrafts, security of catering

items, etc. which otherwise are part of the ground handling activities. It is

put forth that BCAS would be required to amend the AVSEC order

No.03/2009 dated 21.8.2009 in order to bring it in tune with the decision of

the CCS.


18.    It is the stand in the return that the powers of the respondent No.2

emanate from <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_11">Section 5A</a> of the 1934 Act read with clause (m) of sub-

section 2 of Section 5 and by no figment of imagination it can be said that

the power does not vest with the said authority. Reference has been made to

Rules 90 and 92 of the 1937 Rules to justify the action taken by the

authorities. Reliance has been placed on <a href="/doc/851364/" id="a_12">Section 42</a> of the 1994 Act as the

source of power. It is urged that a policy decision has been taken by the

Government keeping in view the security and safety of the aircraft operators

at the airports and in order to achieve economies of scale for proper

utilization of resources and thereby to provide world class standardized

services in ground handling operations and the said power which vests with

the Government does not run counter to any Act or Rules and is not

arbitrary. It is contended that the ground handling policy has been in force



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                 Page 16 of 96
 since the year 2007 but not given effect to because of the representations

submitted by the petitioners from time to time. It is put forth that except the

domestic carriers, most of the other airlines are already carrying out their

ground handling operations through the designated ground handling

agencies as is evident from the information available in Annexure R-1/1.

The ground handling services are an important element of the service

standards to be complied by the airport operators as laid down in Schedule 3

of the OMDA signed by the JVCs at Delhi and Mumbai airports (Annexure

R-1/2) and the airport operators are expected to enter into agreements with

the selected ground handling agencies in order to ensure the prescribed

services standards. The airlines would still have the right of choice from the

selected ground handling concessionaries as the said circular and regulations

allow for a minimum of two ground handling agencies in addition to the

national carrier (Air India). That apart, the domestic airline operators are

still permitted to do self-handling at the non-metro airports. The main spirit

of the circulars and regulations is to extend better and uniform services with

adequate safety and security and the policy has been amended to allow the

airlines to carry out the ground handling functions in relation to passenger

interface. It is pleaded that extensions were granted to the petitioners from

time to time to allow the airlines adequate time to create a proper exit policy

for the manpower employed by them but no effective steps have been taken

to redress the problems.


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                  Page 17 of 96
 19.    It is contended that Rule 92 has been totally misunderstood and

misinterpreted by the petitioners. As per the said Rule, the airlines operators

have been allowed to engage the services of any ground handling service

provider at the airport without any restriction, subject to permission and

security clearance by the Central Government to provide such services. The

circular that has been brought into force permits three entities, namely,

Aviation Company of India Limited or its subsidiary or joint venture to

handle the ground handling operations at all the airports. The airlines can

avail the ground handling services from any of the above entities under

separate contract in respect of their outsourced agent. That apart, they have

not been denied their right to carry on their trade or business, but reasonable

restrictions on such activities is necessary in view of the present security

situation in India and the world over. Therefore, there is no violation of

Articles 14, 19(1)(g) &amp; 19(6) of the Constitution of India. The Regulations

in no way transgress the 1937 Rules as the same has been issued on the basis

of power vested under the Rules read with the provisions contained in the

1994 Act. It is set forth that there is no discrimination since the respondent

No.1 is concerned with the safety and security of the airports and regard

being had to certain aspects, the ground handling service has been taken

away from the airline operators and the same, being a matter of policy

having a purpose, is not arbitrary or unreasonable. Justification has been



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                  Page 18 of 96
 given about the volume of air traffic, the issue of aviation and safety in

metro airports.     Emphasis has been laid on the circular AVSEC order

No.05/2009 dated 29.10.2009 whereby the BCAS has made the airlines

responsible for certain activities pertaining to security.


THE STAND POINT OF THE RESPONDENT NO.3


20.    A return has been filed by the respondent No.3, namely, AAI stating,

inter alia, that the respondent has selected certain bidders subject to

obtaining of security clearance from BCAS, Department of Central

Government. It is put forth that licence for northern region has been granted

to the consortium comprising M/s. Thai Airport Ground Services Bangkok,

Thailand, M/s. Star Consortium Aviation Services Pvt. Ltd., Kolkata and

M/s. Skyline Mercantile Pvt. Ltd., Kolkata. The lead member is M/s Thai

Airport Ground Services, Bangkok. It is also averred that the licence for

western region has been granted to the consortium comprising M/s National

Aviation Services, WLL Kuwait, M/s National Aviation Services India Pvt.

Ltd., Mumbai and M/s DJ Aviation Services Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. The lead

member is M/s National Aviation Services, WLL Kuwait. It is put forth that

the licence for southern region has been granted to the consortium between

M/s Bhadra International India Ltd. and M/s NOVIA International

Consulting Aps Denmark. The lead member is M/s NOVIA International

Consulting Aps. Denmark. It is also put forth that the licence for Chennai

 and Kolkata airports has been granted to the consortium between M/s

Bhadra International India Ltd. and M/s NOVIA International Consulting

Aps Denmark. The lead member is M/s. NOVIA International Consulting

Aps. Denmark.


21.    It is set forth that the ground handling services are a very sensitive

part of an activity of airlines and keeping in view the security factor and to

streamline the ground handling service, the Regulations and the circulars

have been brought into force. The airline operator, in terms of the 2007

Regulations, can undertake ramp handling and traffic handling as mentioned

in Regulation 2(e)(i) and (ii) through their bonafide whole time employees at

all airports other than the six airports and, hence, it cannot be said that they

would be out of business. That apart, only a division of services has been

created keeping the national security in view. The threat perception cannot

be totally marginalized to foster the business interest of the petitioners and,

therefore, framing of a comprehensive policy was the warrant and the same

has been accordingly done. The airlines have been permitted to handle till

the interface of passengers and, thereafter, it has to be done by the agency

chosen, as per the Legislation, Regulations and circulars, by the competent

authority. In terms of Rule 92 of the 1937 Rules, the Central Government

has the power to ensure security and safety while granting ground handling

services. The 1994 Act confers immense powers on the respondent and



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 20 of 96
 accordingly, the Regulations have been framed and the circulars have been

issued and there is no transgression of the Act or the Rules. The policy

decision taken by the authorities has a rationale and the restrictions imposed

are reasonable for the reason that the CCS which is the highest executive

authority on national security has approved the said policy and in any case,

there cannot be any compromise with the security of the nation. The airline

operators, who were carrying out the ground handling services, were

outsourcing the same and a review was done and the policy was amended

and the policy, by no stretch of imagination, can be said to be arbitrary or

capricious.


THE POSITION ASSERTED BY THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS


22.    Affidavits have been filed by the private respondents supporting the

stand of the Union of India and the statutory authorities. It is also asserted in

certain replies that, internationally, ground handling services are considered

to be an extremely specialized state of the art services undertaken at airports

which are carried on by trained manpower with requisite expertise to operate

the equipments. Various examples have been given about the position at

other international airports.   A stand has also been taken that the writ

petition deserves to be thrown overboard on the ground of delay and laches

inasmuch as the 2007 Regulations is challenged in the year 2010 and that

too, after making series of representations to abide by the same. Immense


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 21 of 96
 emphasis has been laid on the decision taken by BCAS under Ministry of

Civil Aviation to highlight that, on the basis of security, the decision has

been taken and, therefore, the spacious plea that security has been used as an

excuse to safeguard the commercial interest of the private respondents is

absolutely erroneous. A similar stand has been taken in the Bombay High

Court by Gulf Air Employees Association and others against the

Government of India and others challenging the circular dated 28.9.2007 to

the extent that restricting ground handling services by excluding self-

handling is illegal but the said challenge did not find favour with the

Bombay High Court which dismissed the writ petition vide order dated

21.4.2009 stating, inter alia, that the petitioners therein had no locus standi

to challenge a policy decision of the Government and if any workman

related issue is in dispute, it is open for the affected party to raise a dispute

before the appropriate legal forum.       Consequent to the privatization of

airports, the responsibility of management, maintenance and operations lies

with the airport operator, and various authorities have prescribed stringent

quality parameters which the airport operators have to mandatorily adhere to

and, hence, a holistic scheme has been brought out which cannot be said to

be arbitrary or unreasonable.


THE STANCE IN THE REJOINDER


23.    A rejoinder affidavit has been filed by the petitioner No.1 to the


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 22 of 96
 counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent Nos.4 to 7, 9, 10, 11 and

13. Apart from stating what has been set forth in the writ petition, it is

contended that the airport operators, as have stated earlier, would absorb the

airline employees. The equipment and security clearance would remain the

same and, thus, there would only be a change of employer. But in actuality,

there is no change in the security status. The consequence of the aforesaid

arrangement would create a monopoly in favour of the airport operators and

eventually, a multiple ground handling agency would create chaos and

anarchy. The outsourcing by the airline operators on certain aspects does

not confer a right on the policy makers to create a monopoly in favour of the

private respondents.


24.    It is further stated that the stand in the return that there is an

adjudicatory method about the charges by the Airport Economic Regulatory

Authority is not a justifiable reason for all airlines to necessarily undertake

ground handling services through the nominated service providers. There is

no reason why the airline operators should be made to abandon their

freedom to contract on their own with a service provider of their choice or to

have their own employees. If the arrangement is introduced, the petitioners

who have invested as airline operators would be required to pay to the

service providers despite the infrastructure having been created by them. It

is put forth that the 2007 Regulations still hold the field which completely



W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                  Page 23 of 96
 bars the airlines from undertaking self-handling of any sort at Chennai and

Kolkata airports and, thus, an incurable anomaly has been brought into

existence. Reliance has been placed on the BCAS circulars to highlight that

the same permits the airline operators to undertake ground handling

activities even through a ground handling agency. But the DGCA circulars

seek to prevent the airline operators from undertaking ground handling

activities themselves.


25.    It is also urged that the circular dated 2.6.2010 enables the cargo

airlines to do self-ground handling activities while the passenger airlines are

not permitted to carry out the same which tantamounts to discrimination.

The contradictions in the circulars issued by the various authorities have

been pointed out. Emphasis has been laid on how security is not the main

reason but a subterfuge inasmuch as there is a complete contradiction

between the security requirements and the ground handling circulars /

regulations. The stance that the circulars / regulations have been issued to

streamline the ground handling operations is far from being true and the

same really requires to be keenly studied and deeply scrutinized to avoid any

kind of anomaly.


26.    It is set forth that the petitioners, as on today, are fully equipped with

specialists and professionals; that they have the potential and the power to

optimize ground handling operations as a consequence of which they are low


W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 24 of 96
 cost carriers and are able to offer low fares; and that there is no justification

to deprive the airline operators of self-ground handling. The exclusion of

the airline operators from self-ground handling invites the frown of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Article

14</a> of the Constitution of India being totally arbitrary.


27.      It is contended that the impugned circulars and regulations have been

issued under <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_14">Section 5A</a> of the 1934 Act and not under any other provision

as the power does not flow from any other enactment, provisions or rules.

The outsourcing of ground handling staff cannot be utilized against the

petitioners as they maintain the security standards and further it is an

inseparable part of their own business model which results in smooth

operation of the airlines. The writ petition is not hit by the doctrine of delay

and laches as the impugned circular was issued in September 2007 and the

petitioners were consistently representing before the governmental

authorities as a result of which the implementation was deferred till 2.6.2010

when the DGCA came out with the modified circular and, therefore, the

challenge is within a reasonable period of time.


28.      Before we proceed to record the submissions of the learned counsel

for the parties, we think it appropriate to refer to the series of circulars issued

by the authorities and the Regulations that have been framed to govern the

field.

 THE SERIES OF CIRCULARS THAT HAVE COME INTO THE
FIELD OF OPERATION


29.    The circular dated 19.2.2007 issued by the Bureau of Civil Aviation

provides for instructions on deployment of ground handling agencies at the

airports. It finds mention therein that the Bureau has found a number of

ground handling agencies which are working at the airports in the country

without prior security clearance and background checks and in view of the

current surcharged security environment in the country and threat to civil

aviation from terrorist outfits, induction of private ground handling agencies

into the airports without proper background checks, security clearance from

the appropriate authority and authorization by the AAI/Airport Operator may

lead to serious security and legal problems. In the said circular, certain

instructions have been given which we think it apposite to reproduce:

              "(i)   No ground handling agency shall be allowed to
                     work at the airport in future by the Airport
                     Operator, Aircraft Operator or any other agency
                     which has legitimate functions at the airport,
                     unless prior security clearance is obtained from the
                     BCAS.

              (ii)   As per the Ground Handling Regulations 2000
                     dated 17.1.2000, the AAI/Airport Operator may
                     issue a license only after security clearance from
                     the BCAS to such ground handling agencies on
                     prescribed terms and conditions and eligibility
                     criteria for ground handling agencies and the
                     number of such agencies to be appointed at each
                     airport shall be determined keeping in view the

                      approval from the AAI/Airport Operator.

              (iv)    In case AAI/Airport Operator or Aircraft Operator
                      intend to appoint a new ground handling agency,
                      the details of such agency is required to be sent to
                      BCAS alongwith the profile of such company at
                      least 3 months in advance so that the background
                      check of the ground handling agency can be done

                      case any company comes to adverse notice, the

<p id="p_26">(c)    The circulars / regulations are violative of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_23">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the

       Constitution of India as the airlines, by virtue of the same, have been

       deprived of doing the intrinsic part of their business of running an

       airline. The compulsion of having to undertake the ground handling

       activities under the aegis of the airport operators is an unreasonable

        restriction on the rights of the petitioners to carry on a fundamental

       and intrinsic part of their business and wherever any unreasonable

       restriction is imposed, the same is to be declared ultra vires.

</p><p id="p_27">(d)    The 2007 Regulations make a differentiation between private airlines

       undertaking ground handling on one hand and private third party

       agency selected by private airport operators undertaking ground

       handling for private airlines on the other which is not an acceptable

       classification as there is no intelligible differentia and no rational

       nexus between the objects sought to be achieved and the result which

       is ultimately achieved.
</p>
<p id="p_28">(e)    The 2007 Regulations are absolutely arbitrary and discriminatory

       inasmuch as they do not take note of the consistent policy which was

       prevalent for long and recognized by the 2000 Regulations. The

       Regulations have failed to take note of the fact that ground handling is

       an activity which distinguishes performance and efficiency-wise one

       airline operator from the other and to destroy the said arrangement is

       wholly impermissible, more so, when the Regulations permit other

       competitors to do the ground handling as a consequence of which total

       commercial chaos is likely to be ushered in and further the same

       brings in an anomalous situation which creates a dent in the equality

       spectrum. The introduction of the 2007 Regulations is an anathema to

       the entire concept of privatization of airline industry and the exclusion


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 38 of 96</span>
        of the petitioners to handle the majority of air traffic in India is

       arbitrary and unreasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_29">(f)    The AAI Regulations 2000 allowed all the airlines to conduct self-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">       ground handling facilities including outsourcing which was permitted

       by the AAI. The 2007 Regulations run counter and are in conflict

       with the statutory requirement contained in Rule 134 read with

       Schedule 11 of the 1937 Rules. That apart, the conditions of the

       licence are statutory in nature and any intervention in the same would

       violate the statutory framework.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">(g)    The Regulations and the circular project a picture of contradiction and

       disharmony inasmuch as the Regulations cover four airports whereas

       the circular covers six airports. That apart, the airports at Kolkata and

       Chennai, which are not managed by private airport owners, could not

       have been covered and same goes to show that there has been a total

       non-application of mind.      The circular, as a policy, smacks of

       arbitrariness and unreasonableness as it creates a dent in the integral

       part of airline operation which includes ground handling facility and

       further does not take note of the fact that Rule 92 of the 1937 Rules is

       required to be read in conjunction with Rule 134.
</p>
<p id="p_31">(h)    The segregation of ground handling into those involving passenger

       interface and those not involving passenger interface is unreasonable

       and unworkable as both the activities have to be carried out in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 39 of 96</span>
        complete harmony and coordination and if a discord and dissonance is

       brought in, an unworkable situation would crop up which is not

       conceived in law.

<p id="p_32"> (i)   The 2000 Regulations permitted ground handling service and though

       the Regulations and circulars were introduced in the year 2007, yet

       they were not given effect to regard being had to their non-workability

       and practical difficulties and further, when the petitioners were

       brought into the fray of airline business by grant of a licence with

       conditions precedent incorporated therein that they have to carry on

       the ground handling services and made huge investment on that score,

       they had a legitimate expectation that they should be carrying on the

       business as a whole, but a bifurcation in a maladroit manner by the

       authorities nullifies their legitimate expectation which has the sanction

       of law.

</p><p id="p_34">43.    Mr.Gopal Subramanium, learned Solicitor General appearing for the

Union of India, has proponed the following contentions:

</p><p id="p_35">(i)    The regulations and the circulars do not transgress any of the

       provisions of the 1934 Act or the Rules framed thereunder and, in

       fact, are in accord with the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_24">Section 5A</a> of the

       1934 Act and <a href="/doc/51568270/" id="a_25">Section 12A</a> of the 1994 Act.               The restrictive

       interpretation placed by the petitioners on <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_26">Section 5A</a> does not



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 40 of 96</span>
         commend acceptation and defeats the legislative intendment.

</p><p id="p_36">(ii)    The security aspect has been the paramount gravamen for making a

        uniform policy which is well controlled in view of the fact that it has

        become absolutely essential to have access to latest technologies and

        management techniques in the matter of security protocol. It is a

        matter of fact that Indian Aviation is a target of international terrorism

        which makes it imperative on the part of the authorities to take control

        of ground handling of flights because the said activity requires the

        presence of maximum number of personnel in sensitive areas of

        airports.
</p>
<p id="p_37">(iii)   The circular No.7/2007 was issued by the DGCA stipulating that the

        airports‟ ground handling facilities would be handled by the airport

        operator itself or its joint venture partner; subsidiary companies of the

        national carrier, i.e., Air India / Indian Airlines or their joint venture

        or third party handling provided that they are selected through

        competitive bidding and on revenue sharing basis and subject to

        security clearance by the Government of India and the said circular

        has been issued under Rule 133A of the 1937 Rules and there is no

        conflict / discord between the rule and the circular.

</p><p id="p_38">(iv)    The proponement that a monopoly has been created in favour of all

        the private operators is sans substratum since Regulation 3 of the 2007

        Regulations clearly stipulates that the ground handling service at


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                     Page 41 of 96</span>
        airport can be carried out by AAI or it joint venture company or

       subsidiary companies of the national carrier, i.e., National Aviation

       Company India Ltd. or its joint ventures specialized in ground

       handling services. That apart, the Regulation also permits any other

       ground handling service provider selected through competitive

       bidding on revenue sharing basis subject to security clearance by the

       Central Government and observance of performance standards. On a

       careful reading of the language employed in the Regulations, it is

       clear as crystal that the airline operator is not totally prohibited to

       carry out the ground handling services if he satisfies the conditions

       enumerated therein.
</p>
<p id="p_39">(v)    The attack that the security measure is a subterfuge is totally without

       any substance since the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, on

       21.8.2009, has clearly stated that certain aircraft operations cannot be

       mixed with ground handling activities and there has to be a protocol.

       In this regard, the Cabinet, in its meeting held on 29.12.2009, has

       decided to bifurcate, to give certain privileges to the private airline

       operators in respect of ground handling services, into two parts.

       Keeping in view the security measures, the grievance of the

       petitioners centering around its commerce and commercial interest

       alone is unacceptable. The stand of the petitioners that their right

       under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_27">Article 19(1)(g)</a> is affected is not correct as the restriction that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 42 of 96</span>
        has been placed is a reasonable restriction as it pertains to the security

       of the country which is indubitably in the interest of the general

       public. The nature of activity or the business carried out by the

       petitioners has to be viewed in a substantive manner and the safety of

       the citizens can never be marginalized for the interest of individual

       airline operators and the safety measures for the collective at large

       cannot be marginalized for the sake of interest of the individual airline

       operators.
</p>
<p id="p_40">(vi)   The policy framed by the Respondent, Union of India, on an

       appropriate scrutiny, does withstand the scanning on the anvil of

       <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_28">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India as it does not smack of

       arbitrariness and is not unguided. The claim that there has been

       irrational classification between the airline operators and the airport

       operators, on one hand, and the cargo operators, on the other, has no

       legs to stand upon inasmuch as they are a class apart and there is an

       intelligible differentia between the two classes and, thus, the equality

       clause in its essential conceptuality does not get attracted.

</p><p id="p_41">(vii) The dichotomy that has been highlighted by the petitioners that the

       Regulations cover four airports whereas the circulars cover six and

       that the Regulations could not have covered all the six in view of the

       language employed "managed by AAI" does not stand to reason in

       view of the language employed under <a href="/doc/51568270/" id="a_29">Section 12A</a> of the 1994 Act


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                      Page 43 of 96</span>

</p><p id="p_43">44.     Dr.A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent

Nos.5 and 7, has advanced the following submissions:

</p><p id="p_44">(i)     The interpretation placed by the learned counsel for the petitioners on

        <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_30">Section 5A</a> of the Act is totally unacceptable as an effort has been

        made to read the provision in a fragmented manner which is not

        permissible.     The said provision has to be contextually and

        conceptually interpreted regard being had to the four facets, namely,

        textual language power, boundaries of the power, targets which are

        required to be addressed to and the proper exercise of power.

</p><p id="p_45">(ii)    The proponement by the petitioners to read „in any case‟ with the

        satisfaction of the security of India and with the clauses that have been

        enumerated earlier is a composite manner is impermissible. The term

        „in any case‟ has to be understood in a broader expanse and it can

        cover any matter where the security of India or safety of aircraft

        operator is a necessity and is not required to have nexus with the

        clauses (aa), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (ga), (gb), (gc), (h), (i), (m) and (qq)

        of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/163339/" id="a_31">Section 5</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_46">(iii)   The interpretation placed on Rule 92 of the 1937 Rules is an adroitly

        artificial one inasmuch as what is provided in the said Rule is that an

        airline operator can engage, without any restriction, any of the ground



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                         Page 44 of 96</span>
        handling service provider permitted by the Central Government and

       the said Rule does not convey that the airline operator has the legal

       right to carry out self-ground handling service. The Regulations and

       the circulars harmoniously co-exist.       The stand that the 2007

       Regulations is vitiated by including certain airports which are

       managed by the AAI though they are not so managed does not

       improve the case of the petitioners as the circulars issued by the

       DGCA under <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_32">Section 5A</a> and the Regulations framed under the 1994

       Act harmoniously co-exist, and as long as they lawfully co-exist the

       question of declaring any one of them ultra vires does not arise and

       further, any action taken under the same cannot be flawed.

</p><p id="p_47">(iv)   The 2007 Regulations and the circulars reinforce each other and there

       is no conflict.
</p>
<p id="p_48">(v)    The submission to claim a right of ground handling services is

       basically fallacious as the petitioners are confused between ground

       handling services and self-handling services.
</p>
<p id="p_49">(vi)   The stand that there could not have been a variation of the statutory

       licence is not tenable as the licence has to be governed and controlled

       by the subsequent circulars and Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_50">(vii) The claim based on the foundation of licence is speculative and lacks

       challenge as no right is created.      That apart, if the terms and

       conditions of the licence are studied with deep ken, it is revealed that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 45 of 96</span>
        it made a stipulation for minimum requirement for grant of permit to

       operate scheduled passengers, air transport services and the same can

       always be changed. Moreso, keeping in view that the privatization of

       airports not being in the horizon, the same was subject to change in

       policy, unless it is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious.

senior counsel has taken us through the pleadings to highlight that they

suffered from vagueness and on the vagueness of pleadings, the

constitutional validity of the Regulations or the circulars should not be dealt

paramount concern is security and when the Regulations and the circulars

have been issued on the foundation or edifice of security, the same cannot be

brushed aside on the basis of individual financial interest of the petitioners.

The challenge on the ground that the right to carry on business has been

THE CORE ISSUES

the controversy in completeness, yet it is thought seemly to concretize the

 core issues and dwell upon the same. In our considered opinion, the core

issues that really emanate for consideration can be put into the following

compartments:
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">(a)    Whether the writ petition is to be thrown overboard on the ground of

       restrictions imposed in the provision itself and ultra vires Rule 92 of

       capricious and arbitrary?

       statutory, the terms and conditions incorporated therein could not have

       been curtailed by the respondents by way of bringing in such circulars

petitioners, instead of challenging the same, sought the intervention of the

Union of India to keep it in abeyance and also for giving effect to the same

and, therefore, the assail to the said circular in 2011 should not be

entertained. In our considered opinion, after the circular came into force, a

Regulation has been framed and that apart, when we have heard the parties

at length, we are not inclined to throw the writ petition over board on the

<p id="p_81">54.    It is submitted by the learned senior counsel for the petitioners that

<a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_57">Section 5A</a> of the 1934 Act has to be given a restricted interpretation and, in

fact, the circulars had to be in accord with the sub-sections mentioned

therein and further, the security aspect has to have nexus only with the

postulates mandated in the aforesaid provisions and cannot travel beyond the

said periphery. It is urged that mere compliance of the provisions alone

would not suffice the security facet. In essentiality, it is propounded that

both the aspects have to be read cumulatively and not in isolation.


</p><p id="p_82">55.    The stipulations engrafted in <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_58">Section 5A</a> are to be contextually

understood. The text and context have to go hand in hand. In this regard,

we may refer with profit to certain decisions in the field. <a href="/doc/1266379/" id="a_59">In Poppatlal Shah

v. State of Madras</a>, AIR 1953 SC 274, the Apex Court, while adverting to

 the concept of construction of a provision, has opined that it is a settled rule

of construction that to ascertain the legislative intent, all the constituent parts

of a statute are to be taken together and each word, phrase or sentence is to

be considered in the light of the general purpose and object of the Act itself.


</p><p id="p_83">56.    <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_60">In State of W.B. v. Union of India</a>, AIR 1963 SC 1241, it has been

ruled that it is the duty of the court to ascertain the intention of the

legislature by directing its attention not merely to the clauses to be construed

but to the entire statute; the court must compare the clause with the other

parts of the law, and the setting in which the clause to be interpreted occurs.


</p><p id="p_84">57.    <a href="/doc/47084921/" id="a_61">In RBI v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd</a>., (1987)

1 SCC 424, it has been opined that the interpretation is best which makes the

textual interpretation match the contextual. Chinnappa Reddy, J., in his

inimitable style, noted the signification of such an interpretation:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">              "33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the
              context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may
              well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives
              the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important.
              That interpretation is best which makes the textual
              interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best
              interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this
              knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and
              then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by
              phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the
              context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-
              maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the
              sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and
              appear different than when the statute is looked at
              without the glasses provided by the context. With these

               glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover
              what each section, each clause, each phrase and each
              word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the
              scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no
              word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes
              have to be construed so that every word has a place and
              everything is in its place."

with the concept of contextual interpretation, their Lordships have opined

thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">              "The rule of contextual interpretation requires that the

              any, and the mischief intended to be remedied. Context

<p id="p_86">59.     Keeping in view the aforesaid pronouncements in the field, we are

required to see whether the authority concerned is empowered to issue

directions for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of <a href="/doc/334761/" id="a_63">Section 5(2)</a>

only when security aspect is inherently involved.            For the aforesaid

interpretation, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners would lay

emphasis on the words "in any case" to convey that the said words really

have the character of condition precedent.

 said words to be of widest amplitude. The question that arose in the said

case was with regard to the interpretation of <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_64">Section 378</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure wherein sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_65">Section 378</a> Cr.P.C. has been

used but there is a fetter in the said sub-section itself. In that context, their

              <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_66">Section 378</a>, without hesitation, means "in all cases", but
              the opening words in the said Section put fetters on the

<p id="p_89">61.    While dealing with the issue whether the State of Bihar had the

competence to file an appeal from the judgment passed by Special Judge,

CBI, their Lordships, while interpreting <a href="/doc/1796168/" id="a_67">Section 378(1)</a> of the Cr.P.C., held

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_65">              "54. In our opinion, the legislature has maintained a
              mutually exclusive division in the matter of appeal from
              an order of acquittal inasmuch as the competent authority
              to appeal from an order of acquittal in two types of cases
              referred to in sub-section (2) is the Central Government
              and the authority of the State Government in relation to
              such cases has been excluded. As a necessary corollary, it
              has to be held, and we hold, that the State Government
              (of Bihar) is not competent to direct its Public Prosecutor
              to present appeal from the judgment dated December 18,
              2006 passed by the Special Judge, CBI (AHD), Patna."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_90">62.    The said decision has been commended to us to highlight that „in any

case‟ does not always mean in all cases. In the obtaining context, as we read

the provision, the language employed in <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_68">Section 5A</a> is really of wide


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 57 of 96</span>
 amplitude. It deals with operation of aerodrome, surveillance, safeguarding

civil aviation. What is argued on behalf of the petitioners is that in the

interest of the security of India or for securing the safety of aircraft

operations, <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_69">Section 5A</a> has to have insegregable nexus with one of the

provisions contained in <a href="/doc/334761/" id="a_70">Section 5(2)</a> of clauses (aa), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g),

(ga), (gb), (gc)], (h), (i), (m) and (qq) and further the directions can be issued

in respect of the same only if the security measure is involved. On a reading

of the provision on the bedrock of contextual interpretation, the said

submission does not deserve acceptation. We are inclined to think that the

words „in any case‟ are to be construed to cover all categories of cases where

the interest of security of India or securing the safety of aircraft operation is

involved. The same cannot be restricted or constricted to the provisions of

<a href="/doc/334761/" id="a_71">Section 5(2)</a> which find mention therein.         In this regard, we may also

fruitfully refer to <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_72">Section 4A</a> of the Act which reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">              "4A. Safety oversight functions. - The Director-
              General of Civil Aviation or any other officer specially
              empowered in this behalf by the Central Government
              shall perform the safety oversight functions in respect of
              matters specified in this Act or the rules made
              thereunder."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_91">63.    We have referred to the said provision as the same is of immense

importance regard being had to the security facet.          In this context and

backdrop, if <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_73">Section 5A</a> is understood only in the light of sub-section (2), it

would not only be unpurposive but also fundamentally defeat the essential


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                    Page 58 of 96</span>
 purpose. That is not the legislative intent. Quite apart from the above, the

clauses which find mention in the provision should also not be narrowly

constructed. Mr.Sudhir Chandra, learned counsel for the respondent Nos.4

and 6 has placed heavy reliance on clauses (b), (ga) and (gc) mainly on the

words „regulations of aerodromes‟, „traffic control‟ and „safeguard of civil

aviation‟.    The said terms, as we perceive, have to be given wider

connotation, for constricted understanding and application would tantamount

to fragmented interpretation. Thus, the inevitable conclusion is that where

the interest of security of India or safety of aircraft operation is concerned,

the competent authority under <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_74">Section 5A</a> can issue directions and the

impugned circulars meet the tests enshrined in <a href="/doc/1684050/" id="a_75">Section 5A</a>. That apart, the

process of interpretation should adhere to the basic principle that it is the

duty of the court to see the legislative intent and its purposeful

implementation. The two principles - the test of intendment and the test of

purpose cannot be marginalized. That apart, on a studied appreciation the

circular deals with security which has nexus with broader context of the

things that find mention in 2(b), 2(ga), 2(gc) and (m) of <a href="/doc/334761/" id="a_76">Section 5(2)</a>. Ergo,

the submission that the same travels beyond the restrictions inherent in the

provision stands repelled.
</p>
<p id="p_92">

to Rule 92 of the 1937 Rules. In this regard, we think it appropriate to have

 a survey of the relevant Rules.       Rule 3 of the 1937 Rules deals with

definitions and interpretation. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 deals with aerodrome.

deals with the procedure for grant of licence. Rule 90 provides for entry into

perform ground handling service.         Thus, we are unable to accept the

              meant for the patients and not the patients for the medical
              stores or those who run the same. The submission of the

              campus of the hospital, the same will jeopardise their
              interest adversely affecting their business and that they
              will not be able to sustain themselves could not be a valid
              ground to disallow the appellants to open a shop within
              the hospital campus. Undoubtedly, the opening of a
              medical store within the hospital campus will provide a
              great facility to the patients who may not be having any
              attendant of their own in the hospital for their assistance
              at odd hours in the event of an emergency to go out to
              purchase the medicines. There may be patients having an
              attendant who may not find it convenient or safe to go
              out of the campus to purchase the medicines in the night
              hours. In these facts and circumstances the paramount
              consideration should be the convenience of the patients

              may be caused to the medical store keepers who may be
              having their shops outside the hospital campus. Thus the
              intention of the appellants to open a medical store within
              the hospital campus is to salvage the difficulties of the
              patients admitted in the hospital and this object of the
              appellants has direct nexus with the public interest
              particularly that of the patients and, therefore, the High

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_97">93.    The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that the

security facet has been introduced as a subterfuge to curtail the commercial

interests of the petitioners and gradually destroy their existence. Per contra,

the submission of the learned Solicitor General is that strong steps have been

taken to regulate, protect and oversee the security measures regard being had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 74 of 96</span>
 to the global phenomena and the security lapses that have taken place at the

airports. The factum of security cannot be gone into by court of law and

more so when specific aspects have been dwelled upon and delved into by

the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.         The security of a country is

paramount. It is in the interest of the nation. There is no question of any

kind of competition between the commercial interest and the security

spectrum. The plea that in the name of security the commercial interest of

the petitioners is infringed or abridged does not merit consideration and in

any case this Court cannot sit in appeal over the same. The individual

interests of the petitioners must yield to the larger public interest. Judged by

these parameters and the authorities which we have referred to hereinabove

that lay down the test under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_100">Article 14</a> and the role of Court while dealing

with policy decisions of the State, we do not remotely perceive the same to

be arbitrary or unreasonable. It cannot be said that it is not based on well

defined grounds. The very purpose is perceptible and does not suffer from

the vice of unreasonableness. Therefore, we hold that the circular, as a

policy decision, is not arbitrary and unreasonable to invite the frown of the

said limb of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_101">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_143">94.    The next aspect which we shall advert to whether the circular as a

policy decision destroys the legitimate expectation of the petitioners. The

submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that when they came


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 75 of 96</span>
 into the business and were granted licence as airline operators, it was a

mandatory requirement to have the self-ground handling service and, hence,

now they cannot be deprived of the said benefit. In this context, we may

note with profit what has been said in <a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_102">Union of India v. Hindustan

Development Corporation</a>, (1993) 3 SCC 499:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_98">              "...The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only
              if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an
              established procedure followed in regular and natural
              sequence. Again it is distinguishable from a genuine
              expectation. Such expectation should be justifiably
              legitimate and protectable.       Every such legitimate
              expectation does not by itself fructify into a right and
              therefore it does not amount to a right in the conventional
              sense."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_99">       In the said decision, it has been further laid down as follows:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_100">              "...even if substantive protection of such expectation
              may be denied or restricted. A case of legitimate
              expectation would arise when a body by representation
              or by past practice aroused expectation which it would
              be within its powers to fulfil. The protection is limited to
              that extent and a judicial review can be within those
              limits. But as discussed above a person who bases his
              claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectation, in the
              first instance, must satisfy that there is a foundation and
              thus has locus standi to make such a claim. In
              considering the same several factors which give rise to
              such legitimate expectation must be present. The
              decision taken by the authority must be found to be
              arbitrary, unreasonable and not taken in public interest.
              If it is a question of policy, even by way of change of old
              policy, the courts cannot interfere with a decision..."

when a change of policy takes place, it cannot totally brush aside the

 legitimate expectations of the persons who were the beneficiaries of the

earlier policy. In this regard, we may fruitfully refer to <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_103">Bannari Amman

Sugars Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer &amp; Ors</a>., (2005) 1 SCC 625, while

dealing with the concept of legitimate expectation and a change in policy,

their Lordships referred to the decision in <a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_104">Union of India v. Hindustan

Development Corporation</a>, AIR 1994 SC 988 and eventually expressed the

view thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">              "While the discretion to change the policy in exercise of
              the executive power, when not trammelled by any statute
              or rule is wide enough, what is imperative and implicit in
              terms of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_105">Article 14</a> is that a change in policy must be
              made fairly and should not give impression that it was so
              done arbitrarily or by any ulterior criteria. The wide
              sweep of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_106">Article 14</a> and the requirement of every State
              action qualifying for its validity on this touchstone
              irrespective of the field of activity of the State is an
              accepted tenet. The basic requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_107">Article 14</a> is
              fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in
              essence and substance is the heart beat of fair play.
              Actions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review
              only to the extent that the State must act validly for
              discernible reasons, not whimsically for any ulterior
              purpose. The meaning and true import and concept of
              arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely
              defined. A question whether the impugned action is
              arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts
              and circumstances of a given case. A basic and obvious
              test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any
              discernible principle emerging from the impugned action
              and if so, does it really satisfy the test of reasonableness."

<p id="p_144"> maker can sustain the change in policy by resort of Wednesbury principles of

rationality or whether the court can go into the question whether the

decision-maker has properly balanced the legitimate expectation as against

the need for a change and whether the public interest overrides the

substantive legitimate expectation of individuals will be for the decision-

maker who has made the change in the policy. The choice of the policy is

for the decision-maker and not for the court.

been opined that a legitimate expectation, even when made out, does not

always entitle the expectant to a relief. Public interest, change in policy,

conduct of the expectant or any other valid or bona fide reason given by the

decision-maker, may be sufficient to negative the "legitimate expectation.


</p><p id="p_147">98.    From the aforesaid exposition of law, there can be no trace of doubt

that though the doctrine of legitimate expectation has its relevance in

administrative law, yet the same is subject to change of rule or a policy

decision and the policy decision is required to be tested on Wednesbury

principle. The present change of policy is neither unreasonable nor malafide

to warrant interference by this Court in exercise of power of judicial reviw.


</p><p id="p_148">99.    The next issue pertains to whether the circulars invite frown of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_110">Article

14</a> of the Constitution since there is no reasonable classification based on



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                  Page 78 of 96</span>
 any intelligible differentia and there is no rational nexus between the objects

sought to be achieved. To substantiate the said submission, it has been

urged with immense vehemence by the learned counsel for the petitioners

that the airport authorities have been put in different categories and have

been deprived of self-ground handling service whereas others have been

extended the benefit. Elaborating the same, it is urged that the circulars

permit the joint venture company or the joint venture companies of National

Aviation Company Ltd. and any other ground handling service provider

selected through competitive bidding on revenue sharing basis but the

petitioners have been deprived.        On a perusal of the 2007 circular

implementation of which has been deferred from time to time by various

circulars defines ground handling to permit third party handling to the

subsidiaries or their joint ventures of the Airports Authority of India or joint

venture companies. Learned Solicitor General submitted that there is no

embargo on the part of the petitioners to enter into a joint venture and carry

out the ground handling services. It is his further proponement that ground

handling service does not mean self-ground handling service by the airline

operator. That apart, it is contended by learned Solicitor General that the

petitioners are airline operators who were carrying on ground handling

service stand on a different class altogether then the Airports Authority of

India or it joint venture companies or any third party which are subsidiaries

on the basis of revenue sharing with the Authority subject to satisfactory


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 79 of 96</span>
 observance of purpose of standards as may be mutually acceptable to the

authorities and their companies. In essence, the contention is that to sustain

the security there has been a restriction and the ground handling services has

been given not to any airline operator but to the Airports Authority of India

or its joint venture company or the subsidiary companies of National carrier

that is the National Aviation Company Ltd. or its joint ventures specialized

in ground handling service. In this context, we may usefully refer to the

decision in Madhya Pradesh Ration Vikreta Sangh Society (supra), the

question that arose before the Apex Court was whether the Madhya Pradesh

Foodstuffs (Civil Supplies Public Distribution) Scheme, 1981 formulated by

the State Government under sub-clause (d) of Clause (2) of the Madhya

Pradesh Foodstuffs (Distribution) Control Order, 1960 introducing a new

scheme for running of individual fair price shops by agents to be appointed

under a Government scheme giving preference to cooperative societies in

replacement of the earlier scheme of running such fair price shops through

retail dealers appointed under clause 3 of the Order of 1960 was violative of

Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. In that context, their

Lordships referred to the decision in <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_111">R.D. Shetty v. International Airport

Authority of India &amp; Ors</a>., AIR 1979 SC 1628 which has laid down the

principle that if a governmental action disclosed arbitrariness, it would be

liable to be invalidated as offending <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_112">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, but

taking into consideration the wider concept, their Lordships held as follows:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                 Page 80 of 96</span>

              treatment based on an intelligible differentia having a
              rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved.
              Consumers' cooperative societies form a distinct class by
              themselves. Benefits and concessions granted to them
              ultimately benefit persons of small means and promote
              social justice in accordance with the directive principles.
              There is an intelligible differentia between the retail
              dealers who are nothing but traders and consumers'
              cooperative societies. The position would have been
              different if there was a monopoly created in favour of the
              later. The scheme only envisages a rule of preference.
              The formulation of the scheme does not exclude the retail

distinction, emphasis has been laid on a joint venture with Airports

Authority of India or its subsidiary company with security concept added to

it. In our considered opinion that is the condition precedent. It is uniformly

applicable to all concerned.        The petitioners are not debarred from

constituting a joint venture company or carrying on the self-ground handling

services by the mode provided.           Thus, that satisfies the concept of

intelligible differentia and it is well nigh impossible to accept the contention

 scrutiny, it is perceivable that the certain ground handling services have been

taken away from the petitioners on the ground of security measures. We

have already reproduced the security measures in the earlier part of our

decision while relating to why such a policy decision was warranted. There

can be no iota of doubt that the national security is in the interest of general

public and public order.     It cannot be said that the petitioners had an

indefeasible right to do the entire ground handling service solely because

they were granted security clearance by the Central Government. One is

required to apply the test of immediate and direct impact, level playing field

which is subject to public interest, the nature of restriction regard being had

to the concept of excessive postulates or stipulation of conditions. In the

case at hand the ground handling service has been bifurcated. The sphere of

operation that has been restricted pertains to the field of security. The

authorities have taken the stand of larger public interest. The level playing

field has to succumb to the same. It is to be kept in mind that the concept of

reasonable restriction strikes a balance between an individual right to carry

on his business or trade or profession and the larger public interests on the

other.   The right of the petitioners to carry out the function of airline

operators has not been taken away. What has been taken away is a part of

ground handling service which is in the realm of security. Thus, we are

unable to accept the submission that the restriction that has been imposed

goes beyond the requirement of the interests of the general public and / or

 excessive in nature. On the contrary, it satisfies the doctrine of balance

which is a basic facet of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_146">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.

Therefore, we repel the challenge to the circular on this score.


</p><p id="p_162">110. The 2007 circular states that with the restructuring of certain airports

and development of a few Greenfield airports in the private sector, it has

become imperative for the Central Government to lay down the eligibility

criteria for various agencies to undertake ground handling services at non-

AAI airports.       In the said circular reference has been made to all

metropolitan airports located at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata,

Bangalore and Hyderabad.         In the Regulations dated 18.10.2007 in

paragraph 3, it has been mentioned that the said Regulations shall apply to

all airports and civil enclaves managed by the AAI.         Regulation (2)(b)

defines authority to mean the Airports Authority of India constituted under

sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/176823/" id="a_147">Section 3</a> of the 1994 Act. Regulation 3 deals with ground

handling service at airports. It postulates that a carrier may carry out ground

handling services at metropolitan airports that is the airports located at

Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad. It is urged by

Mr. Rohtagi, learned senior counsel for the petitioners that in Regulation 2 it

is postulated that the Regulation shall apply to all airports managed by the

AAI. It could not have included Chennai and Kolkata airports which are not

managed by the AAI but by the private airport operators.           Mr. Gopal

 Subramanium, learned Solicitor General would contend if <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_148">Section 12A</a> of

Regulations do not compete with each other as they cover different fields

and, therefore, they can harmoniously exist and, hence, there is no necessity

to delve into the issue whether two other airports which are not covered by

the AAI would have any bearing on the lis. At this juncture, we may refer to

the decision in Mr.Dilip Ranadive &amp; Anr. (supra), wherein the High Court

              substance. The regulations specifically relates to the
              airports managed by the Airport Authority of India
              whereas the circular applies to all the airports other than
              belonging to the Airport Authority of India, and hence
              there is no question of one superseding the another and
              both are to be read harmoniously. In this regard, the
              stand of the respondent No. 1 which is also clear to the
              effect that the regulation does not supersede circular and
              that therefore the EOI cannot be said to be ultra vires.
              The same is the stand of the respondent No. 2 in their
              affidavit where it has been stated that the circular dated
              28th September, 2007 is independent of the regulations of
              2000 and, therefore, there is no question of supersession

<p id="p_164"> 111. We concur with the aforesaid view, for we perceive that in the 2007

refers to that Regulations shall apply to all airports managed by the AAI. It

can be stated with profit by abundant caution the Regulation includes the

two airports which are not managed by the private airport operators and the

same does not take away the impact of the circular.          Thus, they can

harmoniously co-exist.      As we are inclined to think that they can

harmoniously co-exist, there is no justification on our part to dwell upon the

issue that has been urged by learned Solicitor General for Union of India that

the words "managed by" need not be narrowly considered and has to be read

operate any scheduled air transport from, to, in, or across India except with

the permission of the Central Government, granted under and in accordance

with and subject to the provisions contained in Schedule XI. It is also

luculent that every operator operating any scheduled air transport service

 shall render service in accordance with the conditions specified in the order

passed by the Central Government including any condition relating to their

due compliance. Schedule XI deals with grant of permission to operate

scheduled air transport services. Clause 5 provides that every application for

grant of permit is to be made to the Director General. There is prescription

for the format and the fees. Clause 8 stipulates how the Director General

shall consider the application for permit and any representation made in

respect thereof. Sub-clause (2) of Clause 8 provides the guidelines for the

disposal of the application. It reads as follows:

<p id="p_168">114. Clause 11 provides that the grant of permit shall not be construed as in

any way absolving any person from the obligation of complying with the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_152">Aircraft Act</a>, 1934 or with the Rules made thereunder or

with any other statutory provisions. The Director General of Civil Aviation

vide Annexure P-7 dated 1.3.1994 has issued the guidelines for minimum

requirements for grant of permit to operate schedule passenger air transport

services. The introduction to the same reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_129">              "1. INTRODUCTION
               Sub-rule 1 of Rule 134 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937
              specifies that no person shall operate any scheduled air
              transport service from, to, in, or across India except with
              the permission of the Central Government, granted under
              and in accordance with and subject to the provisions of
              Schedule XI of the Aircraft Rules. This Civil Aviation
              Requirement contains the minimum airworthiness,
              operational and other general requirements for grant of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                   Page 93 of 96</span>
               permit for Scheduled air transport operations. This CAR
              is issued under provisions of Rule 133A of the Aircraft
              Rules, 1937. These requirements are complimentary to
              the requirements of ICAO Annex 6 Part I, as applicable
              to scheduled operations."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_169">115. Rule 133A occurs in Part XIIA which deals with Regulatory

Provisions. Rule 133 is the only Rule which occurs in the said part. It deals

with directions by Director-General.        Clause 3 of the Civil Aviation

Requirements stipulates the eligibility requirements. Clause 3.2.6 reads as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_130">              "3.2.6       adequate ground handling facilities and staff
              for preparation of load and trim sheet, flight dispatch and
              passenger / cargo handling. The staff should have
              undergone the training and checks as specified by
              DGCA."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_170">116. It is contended that the same is a condition precedent which has been

provided in the Rule. The Schedule being a part of the Rule, the Regulation

cannot travel beyond the said Rule. It is worth noting that the Regulation

has been issued under <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_153">Section 42</a> of the 1994 Act which authorizes the

competent authority to make Regulations. Sub-section (2)(h) of <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_154">Section 42</a>

reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_131">              (h) securing the safety to aircraft, vehicles and persons
              using the airport or civil enclave and preventing danger
              to the public arising from the use and operation of
              aircraft in the airport of civil enclave"

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">W.P.(C) 8004/2010                                                  Page 94 of 96</span>
<p id="p_171"> 117. As is manifest from the aforesaid provisions, Rule 134 does not vest

any right on the airline operator for any ground handling service. The Civil

Aviation requirements have been formulated by the Director General of

Civil Aviation.     Clause 3.2.6 shows that an airline operator must have

ground handling facilities and staff for preparation of load and trim sheet,

flight despatch and passenger / cargo handling and further postulates that the

staff should have undergone the training and checks as specified by DGCA.

The same is the minimum requirement for grant of permit. The DGCA who

has been conferred the power under <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_155">Section 42</a> has framed the Regulations.

The Civil Aviation Requirements only laid down the condition for fixing the

eligibility criteria. That did not vest any kind of inalienable right with the

petitioners. The Regulations have given more emphasis on security impact.

In any case, merely because an eligibility criteria has been fixed, that does

not mean the same cannot be changed. The eligibility criteria for grant of

permit of ground handling facilities were laid down. It is obligatory on the

part of the airline operator to provide the ground handling facility, if the

authority so directs. When the condition has been altered, that by no stretch

of imagination, would vitiate the Regulations issued under <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_156">Section 42</a> on the

foundation that it violates Rule 134 of the Rules.          We perceive no

justification in such a stand. Therefore, we repel the aforesaid submission

advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners.

dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
