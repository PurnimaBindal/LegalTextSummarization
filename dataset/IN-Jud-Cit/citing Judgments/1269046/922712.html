BA No. 90 of 2008

!Mr. Sunil Sethi, Advocate

MR. JUSTICE J. P. SINGH, JUDGE    
Date : 04/12/2008
: J U D G M E N T 
</pre><p id="p_1">Captain Chatnaya's application seeking release on bail
in a case arising out of FIR No. 34/2008 registered at Police
Station Gangyal under Sections 306/498-A RPC was rejected  
by 3rd Additional Sessions Judge, Jammu, on September 29,  
2008. He has approached this Court seeking his release on
bail.
</p><p id="p_2">I have considered the submissions of Shri Sethi
appearing for the applicant and Shri Sharma, learned
Additional Advocate General, appearing for the State in the
light of judgments they had referred to at the time of
consideration of this application.
</p><p id="p_3">Applicant's counsel's submission that applicant is
entitled to his release on bail in view of the provisions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">2</span>
<a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_1">Section 167(2)</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure, arises out of a
misconception, in that, he treats the Final Police Report, the
Police Challan, as it is commonly so known, which had been 
filed within the prescribed period of 60 days of applicant's
arrest, as an incomplete police challan because the
investigation had not been completed by that time as the
Investigating Police Officer would require some more time to
record the statements of some of the witnesses under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_2">Section
161</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, who are stated to have
been posted at far off places and the Forensic Science
Laboratory's Report too was awaited. This is so because the
Police Challan, which had been filed within the period
prescribed under <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_3">Section 167(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, does not indicate it to be an incomplete Police
Challan. It, on the other hand, is in the requisite form
prescribed by the State Government for production of Final
Police Report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_4">Section 173</a> (2)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5"> of the Code</a> of Criminal
Procedure. Not only this, the Final Police Report contains,
besides a list of 53 witnesses which the Investigating Police
Officer had relied upon to substantiate the charge against the
applicant, the statements of witnesses recorded under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Section
164-A</a> and <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_7">Section 161</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A
categoric finding too stands recorded in the Final Police
Report that, on the basis of the evidence collected by the
Investigation Police Officer, a case for commission of
offences punishable under Sections 306 and 498-A RPC had  
been made out against the applicant. The documents relied
upon in the case too form part of the challan. Mere recital in
the report that statements of some more witnesses, who were 
posted at far off places, were yet to be recorded and the Report
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">3</span>
of the Forensic Science Laboratory had to be obtained, would
not, in my opinion, make the Police Challan filed in the
present case, an incomplete Final Police Report. Filing of
subsequent supplementary challan to form part of the original
challan too would not affect the status of earlier filed Final
Police Report.
</p><p id="p_4">Applicant's counsel's submission that applicant had
acquired an indefeasible right to bail in view of the provisions
of <a href="/doc/839149/" id="a_8">Section 167(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure too is
found unsustainable, in that, on production of the Final Police
Report, which had been filed within the prescribed period of
60 days, on May 30, 2008, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Jammu had taken cognizance of the offence, and after
delivering the copies of the challan and documents to the
applicant-accused, committed the case to the Court of
Sessions for his trial.
</p><p id="p_5">In this view of the matter, cognizance having been taken
by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate on the Final Police
Report, the applicant's custody would be governed by the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1106740/" id="a_9">Section 344</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
and not by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_10">Section 167</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, as urged by Shri Sethi, and in that view
of the matter, provisions of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_11">Section 167</a> (2)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12"> of the Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure cannot be pressed into service by the
applicant for his release on bail thereunder.
Another factor which needs to be noticed is that
applicant does not appear to be either prejudiced or aggrieved
by the order of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jammu,
taking cognizance of the offences on the basis of the Final
Police Report because he has opted not to question the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">4</span>
cognizance which had been taken by learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, and it is now too late in the day for him to urge
that he had any surviving indefeasible right of being released
on bail, particularly when learned 3rd Additional Sessions
Judge, Jammu had found a prima facie case against him for
his trial under Sections 306/498-A RPC for which he stands,
accordingly, charged.
</p><p id="p_6">The view which I have taken in the case on the question
in issue is supported by the law laid down by Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/1128468/" id="a_13">Dinesh Dalmia vs. C.B.I</a>, reported
as 2007 AIR SCW 6112, where, while referring to a
Constitution Bench judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_14">K. Veeraswami v. Union of India and ors</a>, reported as
(1991)3 SCC 655 and the dicta laid-down in its judgment
<a href="/doc/51738625/" id="a_15">Sanjay Dutt vs. State</a> through C.B.I. Bombay (II), reported
(1994) 5 SCC 410, their lordships had held as under:-
"17. We may notice that a Constitution Bench of this Court
in <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_16">K. Veeraswami v. Union of India and Others</a> [(1991) 3
SCC 655] stated the law in the following terms :
"76_ As observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/918619/" id="a_17">Satya Narain
Musadi v. State of Bihar</a> that the statutory
requirement of the report under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_18">Section 173(2)</a>
would be complied with if the various details
prescribed therein are included in the report. This
report is an intimation to the magistrate that upon
investigation into a cognizable offence the
investigating officer has been able to procure
sufficient evidence for the Court to inquire into the
offence and the necessary information is being sent
to the Court. In fact, the report under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_19">Section 173(2)</a>
purports to be an opinion of the investigating officer
that as far as he is concerned he has been able to
procure sufficient material for the trial of the accused
by the Court. The report is complete if it is
accompanied with all the documents and statements  
of witnesses as required by <a href="/doc/5431/" id="a_20">Section 175(5)</a>. Nothing
more need be stated in the report of the Investigating
Officer. It is also not necessary that all the details of
the offence must be stated. The details of the offence
are required to be proved to bring home the guilt to
the accused at a later stage i.e. in the course of the
trial of the case by adducing acceptable evidence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">5</span>
<p id="p_7">18. It is true that ordinarily all documents accompany the
charge sheet. But, in this case, some documents could not be
filed which were not in the possession of the CBI and the
same were with the GEQD. As indicated hereinbefore, the 
said documents are said to have been filed on 20.01.2006
whereas the appellant was arrested on 12.02.2006.
Appellant does not contend that he has been prejudiced by
not filing of such documents with the charge sheet. No such
plea in fact had been taken. Even if all the documents had
not been filed, by reason thereof submission of charge sheet
itself does not become vitiated in law. The charge sheet has
been acted upon as an order of cognizance had been passed  
on the basis thereof. Appellant has not questioned the said
order taking cognizance of the offence. Validity of the said
charge sheet is also not in question.
</p><p id="p_8">Application of Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_21">Section 173</a> of the
Code vis-`-vis Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1645292/" id="a_22">Section 309</a> must be
considered having regard to the aforementioned factual and
legal backdrop in mind.
</p><p id="p_9">19. Concededly, the investigating agency is required to
complete investigation within a reasonable time. The ideal
period therefor would be 24 hours, but, in some cases, it may
not be practically possible to do so. The Parliament,
therefore, thought it fit that remand of the accused can be
sought for in the event investigation is not completed within
60 or 90 days, as the case may be. But, if the same is not
done with the stipulated period, the same would not be
detrimental to the accused and, thus, he, on the expiry
thereof would be entitled to apply for bail, subject to
fulfilling the conditions prescribed therefor.
Such a right of bail although is a valuable right but
the same is a conditional one; the condition precedent being
pendency of the investigation. Whether an investigation in
fact has remained pending and the investigating officer has
submitted the charge sheet only with a view to curtail the
right of the accused would essentially be a question of fact.
Such a question strictly does not arise in this case inasmuch
as, according to the CBI, sufficient materials are already
available for prosecution of the appellant. According to it,
further investigation would be inter alia necessary on certain
vital points including end use of the funds.
It is now well settled that the court takes cognizance
of an offence and not the offender. [<a href="/doc/1025297/" id="a_23">See Anil Saran v. State
of Bihar and another</a> (1995) 6 SCC 142 and <a href="/doc/1241751/" id="a_24">Popular Muthiah 
v. State</a> represented by Inspector of Police (2006) 7 SCC
296]
</p><p id="p_10">22. The power of a court to direct remand of an accused
either in terms of Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_25">Section 167</a> of the Code
or Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1645292/" id="a_26">Section 309</a> thereof will depend on the
stages of the trial. Whereas Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_27">Section 167</a>
of the Code would be attracted in a case where cognizance
has not been taken, Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1645292/" id="a_28">Section 309</a> of the
Code would be attracted only after cognizance has been
taken.
</p><p id="p_11">23. If submission of Mr. Rohatgi is to be accepted, the
Magistrate was not only required to declare the charge sheet
illegal, he was also required to recall his own order of taking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">6</span>
cognizance. Ordinarily, he could not have done so. [<a href="/doc/549946/" id="a_29">See
Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal</a> and Ors. (2004) 7 SCC 338,
<a href="/doc/1318639/" id="a_30">Subramanium Sethuraman v. State of Maharashtra and Anr</a>.   
2004 (8) SCALE 733 and <a href="/doc/1451831/" id="a_31">Everest Advertising Pvt. Ltd. v.
State, Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Ors. JT</a> 2007 (5) SC529]
It is also well-settled that if a thing cannot be done directly,
the same cannot be permitted to be done indirectly. If the
order taking cognizance exists, irrespective of the conduct of
the CBI in treating the investigation to be open or filing
applications for remand of the accused to police custody or
judicial remand under Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_32">Section 167</a> of the
Code stating that the further investigation was pending,
would be of no consequence if in effect and substance such
orders were being passed by the Court in exercise of its
power under Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1645292/" id="a_33">Section 309</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_12">27. We had noticed the dicta of the Constitution Bench
judgment of this Court. At this juncture, we may notice the
dicta laid down by this Court in <a href="/doc/51738625/" id="a_34">Sanjay Dutt v. State Through
C.B.I Bombay (II</a>) [(1994) 5 SCC 410] wherein it was held:
"53 (2) (b) The 'indefeasible right' of the accused to
be released on bail in accordance with <a href="/doc/1495046/" id="a_35">Section 20(4)</a>
(bb) of the TADA Act read with <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_36">Section 167</a> (2) of
the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_37">Cr.P.C</a> in default of completion of the
investigation and filing of the challan within the time
allowed, as held in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur is a right
which enures to, and is enforceable by the accused
only from the time of default till the filing of the
challan and it does not survive or remain enforceable
on the challan being field. If the accused applies for
bail under this provision on expiry of the period of
180 days or the extended period, as the case may be,
then he has to be released on bail forthwith. The
accused, so released on bail may be arrested and
committed to custody according to the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38">CrPC</a>. The right of the accused to be released on
bail after filing of the challan, notwithstanding the
default in filing it within the time allowed, is
governed from the time of filing of the challan only
by the provisions relating to the grant of bail
applicable at that stage."
</p><p id="p_13">28. It is a well-settled principle of interpretation of
statute that it is to be read in its entirety. Construction of a
statute should be made in a manner so as to give effect to all
the provisions thereof. Remand of an accused is
contemplated by the Parliament at two stages; precognizance 
and post _ cognizance. Even in the same case 
depending upon the nature of charge sheet filed by the
investigating officer in terms of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_39">Section 173</a> of the Code, a
cognizance may be taken as against the person against whom  
an offence is said to have been made out and against whom 
no such offence has been made out even when investigation 
is pending. So long a charge sheet is not filed within the
meaning of Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_40">Section 173</a> of the Code,
investigation remains pending. It, however, does not
preclude an investigating officer, as noticed hereinbefore, to
carry on further investigation despite filing of a police
report, in terms of Sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_41">Section 173</a> of the
Code. 
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">7</span>
<p id="p_14">29. The statutory scheme does not lead to a conclusion in
regard to an investigation leading to filing of final form
under Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_42">Section 173</a> and further
investigation contemplated under Sub-section (8) thereof.
Whereas only when a charge sheet is not filed and
investigation is kept pending, benefit of proviso appended to
Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_43">Section 167</a> of the Code would be
available to an offender; once, however, a charge sheet is
filed, the said right ceases. Such a right does not revive only
because a further investigation remains pending within the
meaning of Sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_44">Section 173</a> of the Code."
Applicant's learned counsel's submission that applicant
is entitled to be released on bail in terms of <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_45">Section 167</a> (2)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_46"> of
the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure is thus found to be without
substance. It is, accordingly, rejected.
I will now proceed to consider applicant's plea for his
release on bail on merits of the case.
</p><p id="p_15">The law with regard to grant or refusal of bail is well
settled. The discretion, which the Court while admitting a
person to bail is required to exercise, is not, as a matter of
course. On the other hand, it is required to be exercised in a
judicious manner. Although a detailed examination of
evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the
case is not required to be undertaken at this stage, lest it may
prejudice the prosecution or the defence, yet at the same time
what is required to be indicated in the order granting bail, are
the reasons on the basis whereof the Court may, prima facie,
conclude as to why bail was being granted in non-bailable
offences.
</p><p id="p_16">During the course of consideration of the plea of the
accused for grant or refusal of bail, the Court is required to
keep in mind (1) the nature of accusation, (2) the severity of
punishment in case of conviction, (3) the nature of evidence
relied upon by the Investigating Agency, (4) the reasonable
apprehension that if, released on bail, the accused would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">8</span>
tamper with the prosecution evidence, (5) the possibility of
accused's fleeing from justice when set to liberty and (6)
whether there exists any statutory impediment in considering
the release of accused on bail.
</p><p id="p_17">With this prelude on legal aspect, I will now examine the
facts of the case.
</p><p id="p_18">Applicant's married life with the deceased, as it so
appears from the Final Police Report, had gone into rough
waters after a short time of about one month of their marriage.
Deceased Megha Razdan had been soar over applicant's   
indulging in extra marital affairs, which is stated to be rather
the main cause for the deceased to end her life.
There is no statutory prohibition, as such, in considering
applicant's release on bail. While considering his release on
bail, the rigour of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_47">Section 497</a> (1) RPC too may not apply and
no finding needs to be recorded as to whether or not there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant is guilty of
the offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life.
His case is thus required to be treated like any other case
where a person may be accused of committing non-bailable 
offence(s), punishment wherefor is not Death or Imprisonment
for Life.
</p><p id="p_19">After the commission of suicide by his wife on July 1,
2007, the applicant remained initially in Army custody,
thereafter in police custody and is now finally in the Judicial
custody.
</p><p id="p_20">Learned State Counsel has not projected any such case 
on the basis whereof it may be said that the applicant, who is a
Captain in the Indian Army, is likely to flee from justice or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">9</span>
there are reasonable grounds for believing that he would
tamper with the prosecution evidence, when released on bail.
Taking an over all view of the allegations leveled against
the applicant in the Final Police Report, in the light of the
evidence which the prosecution proposes to lead in the case,
the provisions of Section 306 RPC read with Section 107 RPC 
and those of Section 498-A RPC which require the
prosecution to prove that the applicant's conduct was willful,
and of such a nature, which was likely to derive his wife to
commit suicide, besides the punishment which is provided for
the offences with which the applicant stands charged and the
principle of law that bail cannot be withheld as a matter of
punishment, I am of the view that applicant has succeeded in
making out a case for his release on bail during the trial of the
case.
</p><p id="p_21">Thus allowing the application, applicant is admitted to
bail on his furnishing recognizance of a surety besides his own
recognizance in the amount of Rs. 50,000/- each to the
satisfaction of learned 3rd Additional Sessions Judge Jammu,
undertaking that he would attend the trial regularly and will
not, in any manner whatsoever, come in contact with
prosecution witnesses or otherwise do any such act or
omission which may impede the trial in the case.
