<p id="p_65">51.           A legal fiction has been created in the said provision 
to the effect that in the event it is established that soon before

by her husband or any of his relative; for or in connection with 
any demand of dowry, such death shall be called "dowry death", 
and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused

deficiency   in   evidence   proves   fatal   for   the   prosecution   case. 
Mere   evidence   of   cruelty   and   harassment   is   not   sufficient   to 
bring in application of <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_39">section 304</a>­B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_40">IPC</a>.  It has to be shown in 
addition   that   such   cruelty   or   harassment   was   for   or   in 
connection   with   the   demand   for   dowry.     Furthermore,   the 
prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the occurrence 
of death there was cruelty or harassment and only in that case 
the   aforesaid   presumption,   that   the   dowry   death   took   place, 
would arise.

established by acceptable evidence, such death shall be called 
"dowry death" and such husband or his relative shall be deemed

for   the   offence   of   dowry   death   under   <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_41">section   304</a>­B   is

of an offence under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_43">section 304</a>­B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44">IPC</a>, an exception is made by 
deeming provision as to nature of death as "dowry death" and 
that the husband or his relative, as the case may be, is deemed 
to have caused such death, even in the absence of evidence to 
prove   these   aspects,   but   on   proving   the   existence   of   the 
ingredients of the said offence by convincing evidence.  Hence, 
there is need for greater care and caution, that too having regard 
to the gravity of the punishment prescribed for the said offence, 
in scrutinzing the evidence and in arriving at the conclusion as 
to whether all the above mentioned ingredients of the offence 
are proved by the prosecution.  In the case on hand, the learned 
counsel for the accused persons could not dispute that the first 
two ingredients as mentioned above in para 49 of the judgment 
are satisfied.

alleged   such   statement   and   the   date   of   death.     It   does   not, 
however, mean that such time can be stretched to any period. 
Proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on 
dowry demand and the consequential death is required to be 
proved   by   the   prosecution.  The   demand   of   dowry,   cruelty   or 
harassment   based   upon   such   demand   and   the   date   of   death 
should   not   be   too   remote   in   time   which,   under   the 
circumstances, be treated as having become stale enough.

taken to the house of the accused persons and handed over the 
same to the mother­in­law of the deceased.  On the occasion of 
Holi May 2011 when he had gone to the house of in­laws of the 
deceased alongwith customary gifts, he found some injuries on 
the hand of the deceased and on being asked about the reason 
of   said   injuries,   mother­in­law   of   the   deceased   had   told   that 
deceased had fallen from stairs.  He apprised his  mother about 
said injury on the body of the deceased.  His mother wanted to 
talk to accused Ajay but accused Ajay did not pick up the phone. 
After some time, accused Ajay picked up the phone and stated 
that deceased was sleeping and did not allow him to talk with 
the deceased.  In the fifth month of 2011, accused Ajay called his 
mother/PW­3 and stated that deceased had fallen from stairs. 
He also received a call in this regard from accused Ajay.  He went 
to hospital and his statement was recorded by the Ld. SDM vide

cook food.  PW­9 has also corroborated PW­3 so far as incident 
of Diwali is concerned as she has stated that the deceased made 
a call to her mother in law PW­3 and told her that her in­laws do 
not want anything except money.   The demand of Rs. 2 lakhs

PW­7,   Kamlesh   and   PW­9   Rajni   inspires   confidence   and   they 
are   witnesses   of   credit   and   inspires   confidence.     I   find   no

is   further   corroborated   by   PW­18   Narender   who   has   deposed 
that the deceased was sister­in­law of PW­9, Rajni and father of 
Rajni   was   his   close   neighbour   and   they   are   having   family

had   withdrawn   the   amount   from   his   bank   account   in   March

of Rs. 2 lakhs and he withdrew an amount of Rs. 5 lacs from this 
UCO Bank, Shahpur Jat Branch on the same day as he needed

PW­20   Ashok   from   PW­18,   Narender   Pal   who,   in   turn,   had 
borrowed the said amount from PW­19, Rahul Kaushik.  PW­20 
Ashok has further corroborated the delivery of the amount of Rs. 
2 lakhs at the house of PW­3 as he has stated that he has handed 
over the amount to his sister PW­9 Rajni.  PW­5 Sunil Gehlot has 
stated   that   he   handed   over   the   amount   of   Rs.   2   lakhs   to   the 
mother­in­law  of  the  deceased   in  presence  of  all  the  accused 
persons.     He   denied   all   the   suggestions   given   by   the   defence 
counsel of handing over the said amount of Rs. 2 lakhs to the 
accused persons.  The conjoint reading of the testimony of these 
witnesses   leads   to   the   irresistible   conclusion   that   accused 
persons had tortured and harassed the deceased and mother of 
the deceased had fulfilled a demand of dowry of Rs. 2 lacs as 
made by accused persons.

no major material contradiction or vital discrepancy so far as 
the   role   of   accused   Parveen   Kumar   assigned   in   committing 
mental or physical cruelty on the deceased.

<p id="p_96">77.           So far as contradiction regarding visit of PW­5 at the 
matrimonial   home   of   deceased   on   the   eve   of   Diwali   is 
concerned, it may be noted that PW­3 has stated that on the eve 
of Diwali, her son PW­5 had seen blue marks and injury on the 
hands and arms of the deceased and before deceased could say 
anything, her mother­in­law told Sunil that deceased has fallen 
from stairs. But PW­5 Sunil has stated that he paid a visit to the

some injury marks on the hand of the deceased and her mother­
in­law told at once that she had fallen from stairs.  PW­9 has not

in the presence of her mother­in­law.  So far as incident on the 
eve of Holi is concerned, in his statement under Section 161 Cr 
PC, PW­5 Sunil has stated that the deceased could not converse 
with PW­5 as her husband accused Ajay and mother­in­law were 
present and they asked her to leave the company of PW­5 on the 
pretext that she has to do household work.  Though PW­5 Sunil 
has not stated anything with regard to the incident of Diwali in 
his   deposition   and   stated   about   only   the   incident   which 
occurred on the eve of Holi.   Therefore, it can be inferred that 
PW­5   has   corroborated   his   mother   PW­3,   so   far   as   both   the 
incidents which took place on the eve of Diwali as well as on the 
eve of Holi.  Even PW­9 Rajni has stated in her statement before 
the police  that incident of  Diwali  and Holi  had took place as 
stated   by   PW­5   in   his   statement   under   Section   161   Cr   PC. 
Admittedly,   the   statements   under   Section   161   Cr   PC   has   no 
evidentiary   value   except   for   the   purpose   of   contradicting   the 
previous statement made by the witnesses but for the purpose 
of appreciation of the testimony of the witness those statements 
cane be given a cursory look.  Therefore, from the testimony of 
the relative of the deceased, it may be inferred that the deceased 
was seen by PW­5 on the eve of Diwali having injury mark over 
her body, because, it is settled principle of law that if one fact is 
missed by one of the witness in his testimony and detailed by

<p id="p_98">79.           So   far   as   the   contradiction   regarding   the   fact   that 
deceased was suffering from epilepsy and Menorrhagia disease 
is concerned, it can be noted that PW­3 has denied the fact that 
the   deceased   was   having   the   problem   of   epilepsy.     PW­5   has 
admitted   that   he   as   well   as   his   sister   were   suffering   from 
epilepsy   about   5­6   years   ago.     Accused   Ajay   told   him   that 
deceased Meenakshi is ill.  He asked accused Ajay to allow him 
to get her treated from a doctor but accused did not allow him to 
do   so.     PW­9   has   denied   that   the   deceased   was   having   the 
problem of epilepsy but, even if for the sake of arguments it is 
presumed, that deceased was suffering from epilepsy, this is no 
ground to discard the testimony of these witnesses altogether; 
because, even if, the deceased was suffering from epilepsy and 
Menorrhagia it cannot be presumed that the deceased was not 
being abused and harassed by accused persons for demand of 
dowry.  Therefore, these contradictions as alleged to be material 
is neither her nor there.

function   is   concerned,   it   may   be   noted   that   even   if   it   is 
presumed that no photograph as alleged by the defence is taken 
such fact is not going to affect the prosecution case as it is the 
case of the prosecution witnesses that the deceased was never 
been   harassed   up   to   two   months   after   solemnization   of   her 
marriage.  The accused persons had not demanded any dowry at 
the time  of marriage but they have given jewellary articles as 
well   as   other   customary   gifts   as   per   their   own   sweet   will. 
Similarly, contention regarding second marriage of the deceased 
is   also   wholly   misconceived   and   has   no   concern   with   the 
demand of dowry.   Although PW­3 submitted that she did not 
know   about   the   second   marriage   of   accused   Ajay.   PW­17   has 
stated that his sister/ PW­3 might be knowing that it was the 
second marriage of Ajay; and PW­11 Pradeep has also admitted 
that   he   know   about   the   second   marriage   of   Ajay,   still   such 
factum of second marriage of Ajay is having no concern with the 
demand of dowry made by accused persons resulting in cruelty 
and   mental   torture   committed   by   accused   persons   on   the 
deceased.  Similarly, the contention regarding the contradiction 
in   the   testimony   of   PW­3,   PW­8   and   PW­9   regarding   their 
reaching at the Government Hospital is immaterial as it may be 
noted that the said contradiction is neither material nor vital.

of   Holi   but   her   mother­in­law   told   at   once   that   she   has 
sustained injury by falling from stair case.  But this contradiction 
is   also   immaterial   as   the   witness   is   not   supposed   to   give   a 
graphic version of all the sequence of events that took place on 
the day of incident i.e eve of Holi. Witness is not supposed to 
depose   with   arithmetical   niceties   in   detailing   each   and   every

punctured,   but   this   is   not   such   a   major   contradiction   as   the 
residence of PW­3 and PW­7 are not at such a distance as the 
deceased could not visit the house of both i.e. her mother and 
maternal aunt at the same time.  Otherwise, PW­7 has deposed 
that the deceased has paid a visit to her house as the motorcycle 
on which she was travelling got punctured and she dropped the 
deceased at her residence and deceased told her that she was 
being harassed by accused persons for demand of dowry, and 
thereafter   she   was   dropped   at   her   parental   home   by   PW­7. 
There was possibility of the visit by deceased Meenakshi at the

that   the   word   soon   before   her   death   appearing   in   304B   has 
relation of time between the demand and harassment and date 
of   actual   death.     It   is   contended   that   the   demand   and

Raj vs State of Punjab &amp; Ors</a> 2000 II AD (Cr.) SC 481.                     The 
contention of the counsel for the defence that the statements of 
the deceased referred to in the statement of the witnesses could 
not be termed as cruelty or harassment by the accused persons 
"soon before" her death.   The word "soon before" is a relative 
term   which   is   required   to   be   considered   unless   specific 
circumstances   of   each   case   and   supreme   court   has   not   laid 
down any straight jacket formula by fixing any time limit.  This 
expression   is   pregnant   with   the   idea   of   proximity.    The   term 
"soon   before"   is   not   synonymous   with   term   "immediately 
before" and is opposite of the expression soon after.  Therefore, 
this terminology would suggest that the interval should not be 
too long between the time of making the statement and death. 
In   dowry   deaths,   the   circumstances   showing   the   existence   of 
cruelty   or  harassment   of   the  deceased   are  not  restricted   to   a 
particular instance but normally referred to a course of conduct,

such   conduct   may   be   spread   over   a   period   of   time.       If   the 
cruelty   or   harassment   or   demand   of   dowry   is   shown   to   have 
persisted, it shall be deemed to be "soon before death" if any 
other intervening circumstances showing the non existence of 
such treatment is not brought on record before the alleged such 
treatment and date of death proximate and live links between 
the   effect   of   cruelty   based   upon   dowry   demands   and   the 
consequential   death   is   required   to   be   proved   by   the 
prosecution.  A demand of dowry, cruelty or harassment based 
upon such demands and the date of death should not be too 
remote in time which under the circumstances, be treated as 
having  become  stale   enough.   Therefore,  the prosecution  has 
proved the cruelty or harassment committed upon the deceased 
for or in connection with the dowry.

paid   by   PW­5   Sunil   Kumar   at   the   matrimonial   house   of   the 
deceased   referred   by   one   witness   and   not   mentioned   by   the 
other   can   be   termed   to   be   an   omission   which   in   no   case 
tantamount   to   major   contradiction   entitling   the   accused 
persons of any benefit of doubt.  PW­3 Laxmi has categorically 
deposed that accused persons had raised a demand of Rs. 5 lac 
and a car after two months of the marriage and part of such 
demand was fulfilled by PW­3 Laxmi by sending an amount of 
Rs.  2 lac  through   her  son  Sunil.   The  continuous harassment 
with   the   demand   of   dowry   is   shown   to   be   existence   till 
10.03.2011 when amount of Rs. 2 lac was handed over to the 
accused persons by PW­5 Sunil sent by PW­3 Laxmi.  Thereafter, 
the   deceased   is   not   shown   to   have   met   any   one   and   no 
intervening circumstances showing the resolvent or settlement 
regarding demand of dowry is brought on record.  The deceased 
was found dead on 16.05.2011.       PW­3 has stated that she has 
given dowry articles including jewellery to the deceased as well 
as her in­laws as per her capacity.   She has deposed that her 
daughter   had   told   her   that   the   accused   wanted   her   to   bring

further cash amount i.e Rs. 3 lacs and a car.   Testimony of PW­3 
is further corroborated by PW­5 Sunil and PW­9 Rajni, so far as 
persistent demand made by the accused persons for  Rs. 5 lacs 
and a car on 10.03.2011.  There is also general corroboration in 
the testimony of PW­3, PW­5 and PW­9 so far as incident which 
took   place   on   the   eve   of   Diwali   in   the   year   2010   when   the 
deceased was seen with the injuries mark by PW­5.   Therefore 
there is consistency in the testimony of relative of the deceased 
that deceased was being tortured, harassed for the dowry and 
such demands persistently continuous till the deceased died.

<p id="p_110">91.           In   criminal   jurisprudence,   evidence   has   to   be 
evaluated on the touchstone of consistency.  Consistency is the 
keyword   for   upholding   the   conviction   of   an   accused.     In   a 
criminal   trial,   evidence   of   the   eyewitness   requires   a   careful 
assessment and must be evaluated for its creditability.  Since the 
fundamental   aspect   of   criminal   jurisprudence   rests   upon   the 
stated principle that "no man is guilty until proven so", hence 
utmost   caution   is   required     to   be   exercised   in   dealing   with 
situations   where   there   are   multiple   testimonies   and   equally 
large number of witnesses testifying   before the court.   There

<p id="p_111">92.           It   may   be   pertinent   to   note   here   that   accused 
persons while getting their statements under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_53">section 313</a> Cr.PC 
have not offered any explanation as to how the deceased died 
unnatural death.  The only explanation offered by them that the 
deceased   was   suffering   from   the   disease   of   epilepsy   and 
menorrhagia.  First of all, it may be noted here that although the 
PWs   namely   PW­3   and   PW­9   had   denied   that   deceased   was 
suffering from any disease.   PW­5 had admitted that deceased 
was suffering from epilepsy.  Therefore, if it is presumed for the 
sake of arguments, that disease was suffering from epilepsy and 
menorrhagia even then it cannot be held that these injuries are 
incurable.  Otherwise also these injuries are curable and had the 
deceased been admitted in the hospital, she would have been 
cured   and   survived.     But   accused   had   not   provided   any 
treatment to the deceased but in the defence evidence, accused 
persons   have   produced   two   witness   namely   DW­1   Dr.  Vivek

namely Ex.DW1/A (OPD card from RTRM Hospital) and DW1/B 
(OPD card from RTRM Hospital) which are none else the OPD

having bed sores.  It was incumbent upon the accused persons 
either to get informed the family members of the deceased or 
get her admitted in the hospital.  PW­5 has categorically stated 
that   he   requested   time   and   again   accused   Ajay   to   get   sister 
treated   from   a   hospital   or   allow   him   to   get   her   treated   but 
accused   Ajay   refused   to   get   the   deceased   diagnosed   through 
PW­5.  The deceased was reduced to a skeleton weighing only 27 
kgs.     I   have   also   scanned   the   photographs   of   the   deceased 
placed   upon   record   by   the   prosecution   which   prima   facie 
depicts that she is having about 19 external injuries including 
contusion over her body which are detailed in para 12 of the 
judgment.

<p id="p_112">93.           The contusion cannot be caused by free fall in a fit of

injuries were found on the dead body of the deceased were fresh 
which accused failed to explain as to how she sustained such 
injuries.  Therefore, it can be safely concluded that the deceased 
was being harassed, tortured and beaten by the accused persons

accused persons as a dowry and despite that accused persons
