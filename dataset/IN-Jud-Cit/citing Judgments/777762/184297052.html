<p id="p_1">1.     The plaintiff has filed the present suit for the purpose of seeking
permanent injunction restraining infringement of its registered
trademark "Yahoo", passing off, dilution and tarnishment against the
defendants.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     It has been stated that the plaintiff, Yahoo! Inc, is a leading
global Internet brand and communications, commerce and media
company that connects people to their passions, their communities
and world's knowledge by offering a comprehensive branded network
of     searching, directory, information, communication, shopping,
electronic commerce and other online services to millions of users

 highly distinctive trademark "Yahoo". The plaintiff is one of the most
recognized brands in the world.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     The plaintiff has both statutory rights by way of registered
trademarks as well as common law rights in the mark "Yahoo".
Moreover the plaintiff's mark "Yahoo" has been recognized as a well
known trademark in India.
</p><p id="p_4">4.     The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the following
trademarks in India :-
</p><pre id="pre_2">     Trademark No.        Trademark                  Class
     1361856          YAHOO (word)       99 (multi class registration)

</pre><p id="p_5">       It has been stated that the plaintiff has also filed various
applications for registration of other "Yahoo" or "Yahoo" formative
trademarks.
</p><p id="p_6">5.     The plaintiff has been using the mark "Yahoo" in connection
with its web services since June 1994. The plaintiff's Indian website
Yahoo India was launched sometime in June 2000 and has been in
use ever since. The said website can be viewed in English, Hindi,
Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Gujarati. Plaintiff's websites
operated under the mark "Yahoo" record billions of page hits per day
the world over including in India.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) No.3444/2012                                           Page 2 of 20</span>
<p id="p_7"> 6.     It is averred that the usage of the "Yahoo" trademark and trade
name by the plaintiff is not restricted only to computer and internet
related services, but also extends to clothing, sporting goods, books,
magazines        and   other   collateral   goods   including     computer
accessories. The plaintiff has also successfully popularized its well-
known trademark "Yahoo" by extending its use of goods and services
beyond the scope of its dealing through licensing and franchising
such use by third parties. The plaintiff has thus expanded the scope
of the brand value of its "Yahoo" mark and therefore it is very easy for
confusion to arise if any party other than the plaintiff uses the "Yahoo"
mark as such use would indicate an association with the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_8">7.     It is contended that the reputation of the plaintiff's mark
"YAHOO" can be gauged from the ranking given to the "Yahoo" brand
by Interbrand, a leading brand marketing and consulting firm and
APCO Worldwide Rankings. Interbrand on an annual basis comes
up with the "100 Best Global Brands" and in this ranking "Yahoo"
brand of the plaintiff's has featured. Further the "Yahoo" brand of the
plaintiff has also been ranked as No. 2 in a list of 100 most loved
companies in the year 2013 by APCO. There are various articles
published in newspapers reporting the activities of the plaintiff which
in a way indicate the renown of the "YAHOO" mark in India.
</p><p id="p_9">8.     It is averred that the plaintiff's trademark "Yahoo" has been
recognized as well known mark by both the trademark registry and
the Courts in India. In a case titled Yahoo! <a href="/doc/1741869/" id="a_1">Inc. v. Akash Arora &amp;
Anr</a>., 78 (1999) DLT 285 this Court observed that "The services of
the Plaintiff under the trademark / domain name "Yahoo!" have been


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.3444/2012                                             Page 3 of 20</span>
 widely publicized and written about." The plaintiff has been
successful in restraining third parties from infringing its rights in the
said trademark. This Court has, in various suits brought before it by
the plaintiff granted interim injunctions restraining third parties from
using the trademark "YAHOO" in respect of their goods and/or
services.
</p><p id="p_10">9.     It is the case of the plaintiff that defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are
operating a business of tours and travels under the infringing trading
name "Yahoo Tours LLC", who also operate and carry on business
through      the      infringing   website   www.yahootourism.com.       The
defendant No. 1 is the proprietor of defendant No. 2 entity.
</p><p id="p_11">10.    The website of the defendants' allows prospective customers
from all over the world including India and particularly Delhi to make
bookings over the said website, thus allowing for commercial
transactions over the website. Defendants have offices in Dubai,
UAE; Karachi, Pakistan with their head office in Ahmedabad, India.
</p><p id="p_12">11.    On learning about the infringing activities of the defendants, the
plaintiff addressed a cease and desist letter dated 27th May, 2011 to
the defendants through their attorneys in the UAE. The defendants
replied to the cease and desist letter vide letter dated 7th June, 2011
wherein it was stated that the defendants were willing to give up on
the infringing domain name. The defendants sought to differentiate
their colour scheme with the plaintiff's usage on multiple website.
</p><p id="p_13">12.    The plaintiff thereafter through its counsels in the UAE filed a
complaint before the Dubai Department of Economic Development
(DED) and the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.3444/2012                                            Page 4 of 20</span>
 (DDTC). The DED thereafter in a meeting with the defendant No.1
and the plaintiff's representative in the UAE informed the defendants
that they should stop using the plaintiff's famous trademark "Yahoo"
as their activities under the said trademark amounted to infringement
of the trademark "Yahoo". In this regard, DED also sent a letter dated
31st December, 2012 to the plaintiff's UAE counsel confirming the fact
that the defendants were bound to change their name and not to use
Yahoo as part of their trading name. They also mentioned that
administrative action had already been taken against the defendants.
</p><p id="p_14">13.    After the action taken by DED, the defendants wrote an email
dated 2nd September, 2012 to the plaintiff's UAE counsels confirming
that they had changed their name to Rayna Tours LLC and had
moved the entire set-up of Yahoo Tours LLC to India and their India
office was in charge of the infringing website. They also asked the
plaintiff's counsel to contact their India office regarding the infringing
website.
</p><p id="p_15">14.    The plaintiff thereafter filed the present suit against the
defendants in respect of their infringing trading name and infringing
domain name. Vide order dated 8th February, 2013 an ex-parte
injunction was passed against the defendants.
</p><p id="p_16">15.    Defendant No. 3, the Registrar of the impugned infringing
domain name, after receiving the aforesaid ex-parte order of
injunction, sent an email dated 21st February, 2013, to the plaintiff's
counsel stating that they had taken the privacy off the domain to
reveal its true registrant.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No.3444/2012                                           Page 5 of 20</span>
<p id="p_17"> 16.    Defendant No. 2 thereafter wrote an email to the plaintiff's
counsel confirming that he would be stopping all operational work in
the name of Yahoo Tours LLC in Ahmedabad and informed that
though he was operating this booking office, he did not own the
infringing domain name. He told the plaintiff's counsel that he has
contacted the Dubai Office to remove the office address and contact
details of the Ahmedabad office from the website.
</p><p id="p_18">17.    Thereafter, another email was sent by defendant No. 2 to the
plaintiff's counsel wherein he stated that he had stopped all
operations under the name Yahoo Tours LLC and that he was now
working for Rayna Tours. He also mentioned that he had no authority
over the impugned domain name and that Mr. Manoj Tulsani,
defendant No. 1 owned it.
</p><p id="p_19">18.    It is the case of the plaintiff that Rayna Tours is the same entity
as Yahoo Tours LLC which is evident from the contact us page of the
website www.yahootourism.com which provides the name of the
offices as Rayna Tours. The defendants' said website also provides
an application which allows the consumers to make bookings online.
</p><p id="p_20">19.    Though the defendants have, pursuant to the actions taken by
the plaintiff in the UAE and India, started carrying out operations in
their physical offices under the changed name of "Rayna Tours", they
continue to carry on their operations over the internet under the
infringing name of "Yahoo Tours LLC". It is averred by the plaintiff
that as most of the bookings are made by consumers over the
internet on the infringing website of the defendants, the continuing
use of the infringing name "Yahoo Tours LLC" by the defendants for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No.3444/2012                                           Page 6 of 20</span>
 their online operations, along with the continuing use by them of the
infringing domain name &lt;yahootourism.com&gt; is only with the purpose
of causing the consumers to believe that the defendants' business is
in some way endorsed, sponsored and associated with the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_21">20.    The class of goods and services which covers the services
being offered by the defendants is Class 39. The plaintiff also has two
trademark registrations in Class 39, being trademark registration
Nos.1356813 for the trademark "My Yahoo" and 1311393 for the Y
device trademark. The defendants use of the Yahoo mark along with
a Y device which is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's Y device,
amounts to infringement of the registered trademarks of the plaintiff.
It is averred that as the plaintiff's trademark "Yahoo" is a well-known
trademark, such use by the defendants even for non-cognate
goods/services amounts to infringement of the rights of the plaintiff in
the Yahoo trademark. However, in the present case the plaintiff also
offers similar travel and tourism services under the Yahoo trademark
through           their   website       "Yahoo!        Travel"             at
https://www.yahoo.com/travel.
</p><p id="p_22">21.    The plaintiff states that the plaintiff's trademark "Yahoo" has
been used as a prominent part of the defendants' trading name and
such use of the "Yahoo" trademark is a violation of the plaintiff's
exclusive rights in the trademark "Yahoo" and amounts to
infringement and passing off of the Yahoo trademarks and other
Yahoo-formative trademarks of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_23">22.    It is submitted that the defendants have offered no plausible
explanation for the adoption of an identical mark as part of their


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) No.3444/2012                                         Page 7 of 20</span>
 trading name. Moreover, the defendants are bound to be aware of
the plaintiffs' trademark by virtue of the plaintiff's prior use of the
trademark "Yahoo" in relation to a series of goods and services and
the widespread promotional activities of the plaintiff. The defendants
have clearly tried to piggy-back on the plaintiff's reputation and for
this reason, have not only adopted the plaintiff's trademark as their
trading name but also as part of their domain name. The defendants
cannot have any justification for the adoption of the well-known
"Yahoo" trademark.
</p><p id="p_24">23.    The plaintiff further stated that the potentiality of harm is
enormous on the internet. This is especially because the plaintiff has
a very wide internet presence and is the registrant of various Yahoo
formative websites. The use by the defendant of a trading name
which incorporates the registered trademark of the plaintiff as also a
domain name which incorporates the said trademark of the plaintiff is
bound to cause confusion amongst the public.
</p><p id="p_25">24.    Further, it is averred that the defendants' infringing activities
have caused irreparable harm and injury to the plaintiff especially as
the plaintiff has no control over the quality of services being offered
by the defendants under the trademark "Yahoo".
</p><p id="p_26">25.    During the course of proceedings in this matter, defendants No.
1 and 2 could not be served on various occasions through ordinary
process and so they were served by way of publication. However, no
one appeared on their behalf despite service. Accordingly defendants
No. 1 and 2 were proceeded ex-parte vide order dated 26th August,
2014. Defendant No.3 was served by courier but no one appeared,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) No.3444/2012                                         Page 8 of 20</span>
 so even he was proceeded ex-parte vide order dated 26th August,
2014.

Sharma who is a duly appointed constituted attorney of the plaintiff to
prove the facts stated in the plaint. The following documents have
also been filed:

      be reached by anyone anywhere in the world who
      proposes to visit the said Internet site. With the

      and accepted and are being given protection so as to
      protect such provider of service from passing off the
      services rendered by others as that of the plaintiff. As a

       necessary and a strict view is to be taken for its easy

<p id="p_53">       Accordingly, the defendants therein were restrained from
operating any business or selling, offering for sale, advertising and/or
in any manner dealing in service or goods on the Internet or
otherwise under the trademark/domain name 'Yahooindia.com' or any
other trademark/domain name which is identical with or deceptively
similar to the plaintiff trademark 'Yahoo!'
       In Yahoo! Inc. Vs. Sanjay v. Shah and Ors 2006 (32) PTC
263, this Court passed decree for permanent injunction restraining
the defendants therein from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale,
advertising, dealing in gutkha, supari, beverages, fruit juices or any
other product or service under the trademark 'YAHOO' or any other
mark      deceptively   similar   thereto,    or   exploiting/using      the
trademark 'YAHOO'.
</p><p id="p_54">Domain name
</p><p id="p_55">29.    So far as the issue of protection of domain names is
concerned, the law relating to the passing off is well settled. The
principle underlying the action is that no one is entitled to carry on his
business in such a way as to lead to the belief that he is carrying on
the business of another man or to lead to believe that he is carrying

is undisputed fact that a domain name serves the same function as
the trade mark and is not a mere address or like finding number on
the Internet and, therefore, is entitled to equal protection as a trade
mark. A domain name is more than a mere Internet Address for it

<p id="p_57">(i)   In Marks and Spencer v. One in a Million, (1998) FSR 265, it
      was held that any person who deliberately registers a domain
      name on account of its similarity to the name, brand name or
      trade mark of an unconnected commercial organization must
      expect to find himself on the receiving end of an injunction to
      restrain the threat of passing off, and the injunction will be in
      terms which will make the name commercially useless to the
      dealer. It was held in that decision that the name MARKS &amp;
      SPENCER could not have been chosen for any other reasons
      than that it was associated with the well known retailing group.
      The decision further goes on to say that when the value of the
      name consists solely in its resemblance to the name or trade
      mark of another enterprise, the court will normally assume that
      the public is likely to be deceived, for why else would the
      defendants choose it ? It was also observed that someone
      seeking         or   coming    upon     a     website        called

     PTC 619, while considering an injunction sought to restrain the
     defendants from using the mark BISLERI or BISLERI.COM the
     court observed that so far as the Registering Authority of the
     domain name is concerned it agrees for registration of domain
     only to one person. That is on first come first serve basis. If any
     person gets the domain name registered with the Registering
     Authority which appears to be the trade name of some other
     person, the Registering Authority has no mechanism to inquire
     whether the domain name sought to be registered is in prior
     existence and belongs to another person. The court referring to
     Rule 4 of the Domain Name Registration Policy observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           'Unless and until a person has a credible explanation
           as to why did he choose a particular name for
           registration as a domain name or for that purpose as a
           trade name which was already in long and prior
           existence and has established its goodwill and
           reputation there is no other inference to be drawn than
           that the said person wanted to trade in the name of the
           trade name he has picked up for registration or as a
           domain name because of its being an established
           name with widespread reputation and goodwill
           achieved at huge cost and expenses involved in the
           advertisement.'

      "RADIFF" or any other similar name, held that when two similar
     domain names are considered there is every possibility of
     internet user being confused and deceived in believing that both
     domain names belong to one common source and connection
     although the two belong to two different persons.       Once the
     intention to deceive is established, the court should not make
     further enquiry about the likelihood of confusion. If it is found
     that man's object in doing that which he did was to deceive, that
     he had an intention to deceive the Court, will very much infer that
     his object has been achieved, if the facts tend to show that, that
     is the case and to say that his intention to deceive ripening into
     decieve gives ground for an injunction.

     adopted the name KHABAREIN AAJ TAK in respect of
     newspapers.       The mark of the defendants was an exact
     reproduction of the plaintiff's mark.     The court observed that
     while the words "Aaj" and "Tak" may be individually descriptive
     and may not be monopolized by any person, but their
     combination does provide protection as a trade name if it has
     been in long, prior and continuous user and it gets identified with

           lead to a diversion of users which could result from
           such users mistakenly accessing one domain name
           instead of another. This may occur in e- commerce
           with its rapid progress and instant (and theoretically
           limitless) accessibility to users and potential customers
           and particularly so in areas of specific overlap.
           Ordinary consumers/users seeking to locate the
           functions available under one domain name may be
           confused if they accidentally arrived at a different but
           similar web site which offers no such services. Such
           users could well conclude that the first domain name
           owner had mis-represented its goods or services
           through its promotional activities and the first domain
           owner would thereby lose their custom. It is apparent
           therefore that a domain name may have all the

            establishes dishonest intention on the part of the
           defendant. That appears to have been done with bad
           faith in order to gain advantage of spelling error made
           by the internet user while attempting to enter into the
           plaintiff's internet address on their web-browser. The
           very purpose of having two registered domain names

           intention and bad faith on the part of the defendant.
           The real intention behind registering the domain
           names for the same purpose, of which one is
           deceptively similar to the domain name of the plaintiff,
           is to attract or induce the internet user to come to the
           website of the defendant first by mis-spelling the
           plaintiff's mark and domain name and, thereafter,
           taking the said internet user to the domain name of the
           defendant, which is jobsourceindia.com. The
           defendant's choice of slightly mis-spelt version of the
           plaintiff's domain name was deliberate in order to suit
           the business activities of the defendant and for the
           purpose of diverting traffic of the internet users to
           websites unrelated to the plaintiff. The traffic of the
           internet users to the plaintiff's domain name is sought
           to be diverted to the domain name and website of the
           defendant by confusing the internet users as to
           sponsorship or affiliation with a website that defendant
