V.K. Agnihotri, Member (A</a>)
 

</p><p id="p_2">1. In this OA the applicant has sought the following primary reliefs:
</p>  

<p id="p_3">(a) To quash the impugned order dated 8.8.2006 reducing the pay from Rs. 13825/- to 10325/- with retrospective effect from 15.7.2002;
</p> 

<p id="p_4">(b) To direct the respondents to place the applicant in the post of Director and the pay scale of Director, i.e. Rs. 14300-400-18300, from the date of his joining BIFR and, in the meanwhile, protect his pay in the said pay scale, which the applicant has been holding for the last more than 7= years; and
 

</p><p id="p_5">(c) To direct the respondents to release the annual increments of the applicant in the pay scale of Rs. 14300-400-18300 after allowing the appropriate scale of Director in BIFR.
</p> 

<p id="p_6">2. The bare facts of the case are that the applicant, an employee of Hoogly Dock and Port Engineer Limited (HDPEL, for short), a Public Sector Undertaking, joined the Ministry of Shipping (MoS) in 1997 as Director (Mechanical) on deputation in pay scale of Rs. 12000-16500. At the time of completion of his tenure in MoS in 2002, he was drawing a basic pay of Rs. 13,825/-. On 01.02.2002, the applicant made an unsolicited application to the Chairman, Board of Industrial &amp; Financial Reconstruction (BIFR, for short) for the post of Director (Technical). He later applied for the post of Deputy Director in BIFR and upon being selected, he opted to join in the pay scale of Rs. 10000-15200 attached to the post with the proviso that his basic pay should be fixed @ Rs. 13,875/- p.m. Even though there was neither such a pay scale nor such a stage in the pay scale of Deputy Director, the applicant's pay was provisionally fixed as Rs. 13,875/- by BIFR upon his joining the Organization on 15.07.2002. Subsequently, vide order dated 04.05.2005 (Annexure A-7) the applicant's pay was re-fixed @ Rs. 10,325/- p.m. retrospectively w.e.f. 15.07.2002 in terms of para 5.2 of DoP&amp;T O.M. dated 05.01.1994. Thereupon, the applicant filed OA No. 1078/2005 before this Tribunal, which issued an interim order dated 19.05.2005 staying the recovery of excess payments. The OA was finally disposed of, vide order dated 21.02.2006, with the following directions:
</p>  

<p id="p_7">6. It is also trite law that recovery from a government servant when he has not played any fraud or misrepresentation is not permissible. Be that as it may, as it is established on record that before effecting recovery retrospectively on account of wrong fixation of pay applicant has not been given a prior opportunity to show cause, which makes the order impugned herein as non-est in law.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">7. In the result, for the foregoing reasons, OA is partly allowed. Impugned order is set aside. Respondents are directed to afford a reasonable opportunity to show cause to applicant and on receipt of the reply take a final decision by a detailed and speaking order. Till then no recovery shall be effected from applicant. No costs.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">3. In compliance of the aforementioned direction of this Tribunal, the respondents issued a Show Cause Notice dated 31.05.2006 (Annexure A-10). The applicant responded to it, vide his representation dated 07.06.2006 (Annexure A-11). The respondents then proceeded to issue the impugned order dated 08.08.2006. Hence the OA.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">4. During the pendency of the OA, an interim order dated 25.08.2006 was passed, staying the operation of the impugned order dated 08.08.2006. The applicant filed MA No. 1980/2006 on 18.10.2006 seeking direction to the respondents not to fill up the post of Director in BIFR, which had fallen vacant consequent upon Shri D.V.S. Ranga, Director-I being relieved on promotion. This Tribunal, vide order dated 08.11.2006, ordered status quo with regard to filling up of the said post of Director. When the matter came up for hearing before this Tribunal on 05.12.2006, it was ordered as follows:
</p>  

<p id="p_11">Heard the learned Counsel appearing for both the parties.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">During the course of hearing, Shri Padma Kumar, learned proxy counsel appearing on behalf of respondents has submitted that the applicant is not eligible for being considered to the post of Director/Deputy Secretary. The post is not meant for any Technical Officers. Shri Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant has submitted that these statements are not borne by the pleadings and have only come at the time of hearing. The respondents' counsel is, therefore, asked to file an affidavit that the aforesaid post is not meant to be filled up by technical officers. When asked whether there are any recruitment rules to fill up the post of Director (BIFR), the respondents' counsel could not immediately reply but stated that he will file the same if a reasonable time is given to him. Accordingly, the matter is adjourned to 20.12.2006.
</p> 

<p id="p_13">Interim order to continue.
</p> 

<p id="p_14">5. The respondents filed an affidavit accordingly on 09.01.2007.
</p> 

<p id="p_15">6. The applicant has stated that although he was fully qualified for being appointed as a Director in BIFR, but since the Government approval for continuation of the post of Director in BIFR was awaited, he was offered the post of Deputy Director with the condition that his last pay drawn as Director in the Ministry of Shipping will be protected till his posting as Director with BIFR. The applicant accordingly accepted the post of Deputy Director and his salary was protected at the basic pay of Rs. 13825/- from day one.
</p> 

<p id="p_16">7. He has further stated that as per letter of Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, to BIFR dated 26.03.1987 the BIFR is authorized to fill up these posts i.e. Deputy Secretary, Director and Deputy Director on reverse deputation from FIs/Banks without specific approval from the Government. Thus, the BIFR itself was competent to post the applicant as Director in the respective grade in the BIFR.
</p> 

<p id="p_17">8. It has been further averred that the case of the applicant was recommended by the Secretary, BIFR to the Department of Personnel &amp; Training, vide note dated 05.08.2003, in which it was stated that the applicant was a highly qualified and experienced officer having put in 27 years of service and having worked in the Ministry of Shipping as Director (Mechanical) in the scale of Rs. 12000-16500 on deputation continuously for five years and being responsible for techno-commercial appraisal/evaluation of Port Development/Ship Building Projects. Upon completion of one year as Deputy Director in BIFR his performance was assessed as outstanding by the Members of the Board; as such, his placement in the scale of Rs. 10000-15200, without protecting the last pay drawn by him during his earlier deputation to the Ministry of Shipping, will be highly unjustified and will have a demoralizing effect on the officer. Therefore, in accordance with the representation of the applicant, the Secretary, BIFR requested the DOP&amp;T for placement of the applicant in the scale of Rs. 12000-16500 for which full justification was given. This was followed up with letter dated 22.08.2003 and 30.09.2004 by Secretary, BIFR to Joint Secretary (Establishment), Department of Personnel &amp; Training and Joint Secretary (Shipping) reiterating the proposal.
</p> 

<p id="p_18">9. The applicant has argued that the impugned order dated 08.08.2006 is clearly unsustainable in law inasmuch as only on the basis of an assurance/promise, the applicant joined the BIFR immediately after his completion of five years tenure as Director (Mechanical) in the Ministry of Shipping in the pay scale of Rs. 12000-16500. Since the Government had promised to protect the applicant regarding the above mentioned pay and gave an assurance that as and when the post of Director is filled up, the applicant will be the first person to be appointed as Director, the sudden shift of the stand of the respondents that there is no vacancy of the Director available on deputation and rejecting the case of the applicant on the ground of proposed abolition of BIFR/repeal of SICA by the Government is per se imaginary and meant only to deprive the applicant of the said relief. The fact that the respondents have subsequently made appointment of additional members in the BIFR for constitution of additional Bench in the BIFR clearly establishes the fact that the repeal of SICA/abolition of BIFR is not contemplated.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">10. The respondents have stated that the applicant, vide his application dated 01.02.2002, applied for the post of Director (Technical) in BIFR. But there was no such vacant post of Director (Technical) in BIFR and such a vacancy was not circulated by BIFR. A circular for filling up the vacant post of Deputy Director in BIFR was issued on 22.02.2002. The name of the applicant was considered for the vacant post of Deputy Director in the pay scale of Rs. 10000-15200 and consequent upon his selection against this post, he was appointed as Deputy Director in the pay scale of Rs. 10000-325-15200 w.e.f. 15.07.2002 (FN) on reverse deputation basis. While exercising his option for fixation of his pay in the scale of pay attached to the post of Deputy Director, the applicant, however, put the condition that his pay may be fixed as per last pay details (Basic pay of Rs. 13875/- p.m. in the pay scale of Rs. 12000-375-16500). As per provisions of Department of Personnel &amp; Training O.M. No. 2/29/91-Estt. (Pay-II) dated 05.01.1994, which governs the terms and conditions of deputation, the benefit of fixation of pay under para 5.2 is available in case of appointment to a time scale of pay identical to the ex-cadre post held by an officer during his earlier deputation. Since the time scale of pay of the ex-cadre posts held by the applicant under Ministry of Shipping and BIFR are not identical, the last pay drawn by him as Director (Mechanical) under the Ministry of Shipping cannot be protected.
</p> 

<p id="p_20">11. The respondents have further stated that the pay of the applicant was never fixed as Rs. 13875/-. In fact, there is no stage of Rs. 13875/- in the pay scale of Rs. 10000-325-15200. In fact the applicant was stagnating at the highest stage of Rs. 9600/- in the pay scale of Rs. 7000-275-8100-300-9600 in his parent Department, i.e. HDPEL, on the date of his appointment in BIFR. On his appointment in BIFR as Deputy Director, his pay was fixed at a higher stage as compared to what he would have been drawing in his parent Department. Ever since the applicant joined BIFR as Deputy Director in the pay scale of Rs. 10000-325-15200, he has been representing against protection of last pay drawn by him during his earlier deputation as Director (Mechanical) in the Ministry of Shipping in the pay scale of Rs. 12000-375-16500 and fixation of his pay in the grade of Deputy Secretary/Director, resulting in delay in fixation of his pay in the scale of Deputy Director. Pending a decision on his representations and fixation of his pay as Deputy Director in the pay scale of Rs. 10000-325-15200, the applicant due to an inadvertent error continued to draw the basic pay of Rs. 13875/-, i.e. the pay drawn by him as Director (Mechanical) in the Ministry of Shipping, though no orders were ever issued by the Board protecting his last pay drawn in the earlier ex-cadre post held by him. After the representation dated 19.09.2002 and 25.06.2003 of the applicant were appropriately examined and disposed of, his pay was fixed, vide Office Order dated 04.05.2005 as Rs. 10325/- as on 15.07.2002, while, at the same time, releasing the increments of pay due to him on 01.07.2003 and 01.07.2004.
</p> 

<p id="p_21">12. The respondents have also pointed out that the Chairman, BIFR is authorized to make appointments of officers from Public Financial Institutions to be taken on reverse deputation to fill only the sanctioned posts upto the rank of Director in BIFR. Thus, BIFR was not competent to make appointment to the post of Director, for which Government sanction for further continuation was not available.
</p> 

<p id="p_22">13. In the affidavit filed by the respondents, as per direction of this Tribunal dated 05.12.2006, they have stated that Recruitment Rules for the post of Director (Technical) were not notified. Draft Recruitment Rules for the post of Director (Technical) and certain other categories of posts were forwarded to the government (on 29.03.1988) for its approval in consultation with Union Public Service Commission and other concerned departments. However, they were not approved. In January, 1995, a proposal was sent by the BIFR to the Government seeking approval of the Cadre Controlling Authority of Ministry of Finance to en-cadre certain posts in the cadre of Ministry of Finance. At that time, it was, inter alia, proposed by BIFR to keep the post of Director (Technical &amp; Finance) in the pay scale of Rs. 4500-5700 (pre-revised) along with certain other categories of posts to be filled on ex-cadre basis. It was further intimated by BIFR that action was being taken to send the Recruitment Rules for the posts, which were proposed to be operated on ex-cadre basis. The matter was, however, not processed further in view of the temporary ban on framing/amendment/relaxation/modification/notification of Recruitment Rules/Service Rules in respect of Group `A', `B', `C' &amp; `D' posts/services/cadres, imposed by the Government, vide DoP&amp;T O.M. dated 10.02.1997. Sanction for continuance of the posts of Director [including 1 post of Director (Tech.)] beyond 28.02.1999 was not accorded by the Government. As such, no post of Director (Tech.) exists in BIFR at present. Two sanctioned posts of Deputy Secretary in BIFR in the pay scale of Rs. 12000-375-16500 were filled by the Government in the past under Central Staffing Scheme of the DoP&amp;T. Both these posts of Deputy Secretary in BIFR were last filled by the Government by Director level Central Secretariat Service (CSS, for short) Officers from amongst the CSS officers whose names were suggested by DoP&amp;T. One of these two posts of Deputy Secretary, which was held by Shri D.V.S. Ranga, a Director level officer of CSS has fallen vacant w.e.f. 28.09.2006 consequent upon his being relieved on his promotion as Joint Secretary. As per convention, the posts vacated by CSS officers are filled by the Government by CSS officers.
</p> 

<p id="p_23">14. In his rejoinder, the applicant has reiterated and elaborated on the averments made in the main application.
</p> 

<p id="p_24">15. During the oral arguments, Shri G.D. Gupta, learned Counsel for the applicant, highlighted the fact that the applicant had applied for the post of Director with the respondents but was appointed as Deputy Director with protection of pay. With reference to the affidavit filed by the respondents, the learned Counsel stated that it is not correct that the post of Director (Technical) does not exist in the respondents' Organization, insofar as there are no Recruitment Rules for the post of Director. He further stated that the post of Deputy Secretary has been filled by an officer of CSS admittedly only by convention.
</p> 

<p id="p_25">16. Ms. Sangeeta Tomar, learned Counsel for the respondents, stated that in the appointment order dated 10.07.2002 (Annexure-C) in the counter reply, there was no mention of protection of the pay of the applicant @ Rs. 13825/- p.m. She further stated that no assurance was given to protect the pay of the applicant drawn by him during his earlier deputation in the Ministry of Shipping. In this context, she cited the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_2">Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer and Ors</a>.  to argue that the plea of promissory estoppel should be based on positive foundation with supporting material and the court has to consider all aspects including public good at large.
</p> 

<p id="p_26">17. Learned Counsel for the respondents had initially also raised the pleas of res judicata and multiple reliefs, but they were later not pressed.
</p> 

<p id="p_27">18. We have heard the learned Counsel for both the parties and perused the material on record.
</p> 

<p id="p_28">19. As regards the first relief sought by the applicant relating to quashing of the order of respondents reducing his pay from Rs. 13825/- to Rs. 10325/- with retrospective effect from 15.07.2002, it is necessary to look at the background and certain facts of the case.
</p> 

<p id="p_29">20. From a perusal of the Paper Book we find that on 01.02.2002 the applicant suo motu sent a letter to the Chairman, BIFR seeking consideration of his candidature for appointment against a likely vacancy in the post of Director (Technical). On this, an endorsement was made that pending revival of the post of Director, the applicant's application may be considered for the post of Deputy Director. After the applicant had joined BIFR as Deputy Director and made a request for fixing his pay at Rs. 13825/- in his joining report, BIFR took up the matter with DoP&amp;T, vide U.O. dated 05.08.2003, for protection of the applicant's pay last drawn as follows:
</p>  

<p id="p_30">11. In view of the above, Department of Personnel &amp; Training is requested to kindly agree to the proposal of BIFR to the protection of pay last drawn by Shri G.P. Roy, Deputy Director (Mon), BIFR during his earlier deputation to the Ministry of Shipping as Director (Mechanical) in the pay scale of Rs. 12000-375-16500, keeping in view the following factors:
</p>  

<p id="p_31">(a) that Shri G.P. Roy has worked as Director (Mech) in the Ministry of Shipping in the pay scale of Rs. 12000-375-16500, continuously for five years,
 

</p><p id="p_32">(b) that Shri Roy has joined BIFR directly from Ministry of Shipping without reverting to his parent cadre,
 

</p><p id="p_33">(c) that at the time of joining BIFR, he had opted to draw the pay of Deputy Director to be fixed as per last pay details (Basic pay of Rs. 13875/- p.m. in the scale of Rs. 12000-375-16500), and
 

</p><p id="p_34">(d) that Shri Roy has over the past one year picked up his work very well and it is difficult to get a suitable substitute of Shri Roy at this stage, when repeal of SICA and closure of BIFR is in the offing.
</p> 

<p id="p_35">Sd/- 
</p>
<p id="p_36">(VINAY VASISHTHA) 

SECRETARY, BIFR
 

This was followed up with a D.O. letter dated 22.08.2003 from Secretary, BIFR to the Joint Secretary (Establishment), DoP&amp;T, as follows:
</p>  

<p id="p_37">2. In this connection, I would like to impress upon you that, prior to joining BIFR, Shri Roy was working as Director (Mech) in the Ministry of Shipping. Shri Roy had applied for the post of Director in BIFR and, in spite of his suitability, both in respect of qualification as well as experience, he could not be offered the post of Director, as the continuation of vacant posts of Director was not agreed by the Ministry of Finance due to proposed repeal of SICA. As none of the other officers was found suitable and only 1 post of Deputy Director was available at the time, Shri Roy was persuaded to agree to join as Deputy Director and an informal assurance was given to him that at least his last pay scale would be protected.
</p> 

<p id="p_38">3. Shri Roy has already worked in the Board for the last one year and his performance has been rated as `outstanding' by the Members of the Board. You will please appreciate that working in a lower post tantamounts to demotion for no fault on the part of the individual. Shri Roy is apparently demoralized and is pressing for early repatriation, if his request for protection of the last scale of pay drawn by him is not acceded to. There is acute shortage of officers in the Board due to curtailment of the posts on account of the proposal for repeal of SICA. In view of this, the premature repatriation of Shri Roy is not at all feasible and, therefore, the retention of Shri Roy is in wider public interest as well. Further, at the time of joining BIFR on 15.07.02, the last pay (basic) drawn by Shri Roy was Rs. 13,825.00 p.m. in the scale of Rs. 12000-16500 and, therefore, there will be hardly any additional financial implication on account of fixation of his pay in the same scale of pay. In view of this, it is requested that the proposal of fixation of pay of Shri Roy in the pay scale of Rs. 12000-16500 may kindly be agreed to and communicated to the Board at an early date.
</p> 

<p id="p_39">21. Subsequently, the matter was also taken up with the Department of Expenditure for upgradation of the post of Deputy Director, against which the applicant had been appointed, to the grade of Deputy Secretary, as personal to him, w.e.f. 15.07.2002, vide I.D. dated 14.02.2005, as follows:
</p>  

<p id="p_40">4. Shri G.P. Roy was appointed as Deputy Director in BIFR on 15.07.02. Though Shri G.P. Roy had applied for the post of Director in BIFR and was eligible for being considered for appointment against the post of Director, he was considered for the post of Deputy Director in BIFR, as Govt. approval for continuation of vacant posts of Director in BIFR was awaited at that time. Since a proposal for revival/continuation of three posts of Directors in BIFR was under consideration, he has been during the intervening period paid emoluments with reference to last pay drawn by him as Director (Mechanical) in the Ministry of Shipping. As the Department of Expenditure did not agree to further continuation of the posts of Directors in BIFR, he could not be accommodated against the post of Director in BIFR. Further, his pay in the grade of Deputy Directory could not be fixed as the officer has been representing for fixation of his pay in the grade of Deputy Secretary/Director and a case for upgradation of his pay had been under consideration. Audit has already objected to the excess payment of emoluments to him and advised for recovery of the excess payment of approximately Rs. 1.80 lakhs. The recovery of the excess payment, if effected at this stage, will cause serious pecuniary loss and undue hardship to the officer.
</p> 

<p id="p_41">5. In view of the above, it is requested that the case for upgradation of one post of Deputy Director in BIFR to the grade of Deputy Secretary as personal to Shri G.P. Roy w.e.f. 15.7.2002 till Shri G.P. Roy is repatriated to his parent office or till repeal of SICA and abolition of BIFR, whichever is earlier, may please be considered sympathetically and accepted as a special case not to be quoted as a precedent, in order to mitigate the long outstanding grievance of the officer.
</p> 

<p id="p_42">6. The proposal has had the approval of Banking Division and FA(Finance), vide note page 12/n and page 13/n respectively.

<p id="p_43">Sd/- 
</p>
<p id="p_44">(VINAY VASISHTHA) 

SECRETARY, BIFR
 

</p><p id="p_45">22. Against this backdrop, the learned Counsel for the respondents has cited the ruling of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_3">Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer and Ors</a>. (supra) regarding the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced as follows:
</p>  

<p id="p_46">19. In order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel clear, sound and positive foundation must be laid in the petition itself by the party invoking the doctrine and bald expressions without any supporting material to the effect that the doctrine is attracted because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position relying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient to press into aid the doctrine. The courts are bound to consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public good at large, because while considering the applicability of the doctrine, the courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present in the mind of the court.
</p> 

<p id="p_47"> 20. <a href="/doc/1872329/" id="a_4">In Shrijee Sales Corpn. v. Union of India</a> it was observed that once public interest is accepted as the superior equity which can override individual equity the principle would be applicable even in cases where a period has been indicated for operation of the promise. If there is a supervening public equity, the Government would be allowed to change its stand and has the power to withdraw from representation made by it which induced persons to take certain steps which may have gone adverse to the interest of such persons on account of such withdrawal. Moreover, the Government is competent to rescind from the promise even if there is no manifest public interest involved, provided no one is put in any adverse situation which cannot be rectified. Similar view was expressed in Pawan Alloys and Casting (P) Ltd. v. U.P. SEB and in STO v. Shree Durga Oil Mills
 

From this, it would appear that the requirement for invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel is that the applicant must base his case on material facts and the court is required to, inter alia, take into account the public good at large and public equity and balance it against the principle of individual equity.
</p> 

<p id="p_48">23. From a perusal of the documentation, cited above, it is clear that the respondents were quite keen to obtain as well as retain the services of the applicant and protect the salary last drawn by him between the period from 15.07.2002 upto the point of time of the impugned order dated 04.05.2005 whereby his pay was fixed at Rs. 10325/-. Thus, for almost three years, the applicant was made to believe that his pay shall be protected. In our opinion, no harm will be done to the public good and balance of convenience is in favour of individual equity, if the relief prayed for by the applicant is granted, particularly, since it is neither statutorily prohibited nor against legislative or quasi-legislative power [<a href="/doc/1741949/" id="a_5">Pawan Alloys &amp; Casting Pvt. Ltd., Meerut v. U.P. State Electricity Board</a> and Ors. ; <a href="/doc/98342524/" id="a_6">Kasinka Trading and Anr. v. Union of India and Anr</a>. ; and  <a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_7">Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors</a>. ].
</p> 

<p id="p_49">24. The doctrine of legitimate expectation is also attracted in the present case. As held in the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/141187345/" id="a_8">Madras City Wine Merchants' Association and Anr. v. State of T.N. and Anr</a>. , legitimate expectation may arise from an express promise given by a public authority, provided it is reasonable. Having worked in the Ministry of Shipping on deputation as Director (Mechanical) in the grade of Rs. 12000-16500 for a period of five years, the appointment having been made through UPSC, and having drawn the pay @ Rs. 13825/- towards the end of his deputation, the request of the applicant for protection of that pay on subsequent appointment (even though separated by a short spell of leave) cannot be said to be an unreasonable expectation.
</p> 

<p id="p_50">25. Moreover, as stated in the earlier order of this Tribunal in OA No. 1078/2005 (supra), it is trite law that recovery from a Government servant, when he has not played any fraud or misrepresented the facts, is not permissible, especially with retrospective effect [<a href="/doc/554818/" id="a_9">Sahib Ram v. State of Haryana and Ors</a>. 1995 SCC (L&amp;S) 248].
</p> 

<p id="p_51">26. The other prayer of the applicant is that he should be posted as Director in BIFR with effect from the date he joined (15.07.2002) and be given the annual increments thereafter in the Director's scale of pay. The respondents have stated that, for various reasons, the Recruitment Rules for the post of Director in BIFR have not been finalized and, as a matter of fact, no post of Director (Technical) exists in BIFR at present. On the other hand, it is an admitted fact that there is a vacancy of the post of Director in BIFR on account of repatriation of Shri D.V.S. Ranga, Director-I (Annexure A-14), the filling up of which was stayed by an order of this Tribunal dated 08.11.2006. In the absence of any Recruitment Rules, the proper course of action for the respondents would be to adopt the alternative method of advertising and filling up the post on the basis of the draft Recruitment Rules.

<p id="p_52">27. Filling up of this vacant post of Director through CSS officers is admittedly only a convention and, therefore, does not have the sanctity of a statutory provision. However, as regards the prayer of the applicant for his retrospective placement on the post of Director in BIFR, it cannot be accepted in the absence of a post till such time as the vacancy arose on account of repatriation of Shri D.V.S. Ranga. Moreover, the applicant ipso facto does not have any right to appointment against a particular post without the proper procedure for filling it up having been followed.

Taking the totality of facts and circumstances of the case into consideration, we come to the conclusion that there is no justification in the respondents' ordering downward revision of the pay of the applicant on 04.05.2005 from Rs. 13825/- to 10325/- retrospectively w.e.f. 15.07.2002. The question of recovery of so-called excess payments also, therefore, does not arise. As regards the filling up of the post of Director, BIFR, vice Shri D.V.S. Ranga, the respondents may take suitable steps to fill up the post and applicant would be free to apply for it and, upon his doing so, his candidature shall be considered by the respondents.

The stay order dated 25.08.2006 is accordingly made absolute. As regards the filling up of the post of Director, BIFR, vice Shri D.V.S. Ranga, the respondents are given the liberty to fill it up in terms of the directions aforementioned. There will be no order as to costs.
