<p id="p_1">                         By a judgment dated 12th March, 2019 in National

         Lawyers Campaign for Judicial Transparency and Reforms

         &amp; Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors. (Writ Petition (C)

         No. 191 of 2019), this Bench held that Shri Mathews

         Nedumpara, Advocate has committed contempt in the face

         of the Court.                   In the interest of justice, however,

         notice              was    issued      to    Shri      Nedumpara       as   to   the

         punishment                to    be    imposed       upon   him   for    committing

         contempt in the face of the Court.

<p id="p_4">    In the morning session, Shri Nedumpara did his best

to see that the matter was not heard by this Bench.                    He

informed us that a Transfer Petition was filed asking

the Chief Justice of India to transfer this case from

this Bench to some other Bench.                He also stated that he

was going to file an application for recall of our

order    dated   12th   March,   2019.          He   then   cited   latin

maxims and said that justice must be seen to be done.
</p>
<p id="p_5">He also referred to the famous Rex vs. Sussex Justices

case and referred generally to the fact that relatives

of Judges should not be seen practicing in the same

Court.    He later asked the Bench to grant a “pass over”

of his matter inasmuch as his lawyer Shri Subhash Jha

was on his way from Mumbai.                    The Bench agreed and

placed the matter at 2.00 p.m.

    At 2.00 p.m., Shri Jha came and addressed us, and

pointed out Sections 14 (1) &amp; (2) of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_1">Contempt of

Courts    Act</a>,   1971    together       with    <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Section     479</a>   of   the

Criminal Procedure Code. He also made various other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

submissions which the Court reminded him were not on

the    punishment      aspect    of    this    case.      He   continued,

however, arguing as if he was arguing a review petition

in the open Court.           While Shri Jha was arguing, Shri

Nedumpara stepped in again and went on a long ramble as

to how he had not in fact impersonated Justice Vazifdar,

which is one of the many incidents referred to in our

judgment dated 12th March, 2019.                 At this stage, Shri

Nedumpara then tendered an apology to this Court by way

of an affidavit duly signed by him in the Court in our

presence.      The affidavit reads as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                “AFFIDAVIT

           I, Mathews J. Nedumpara, Advocate, aged 60
  years,       Indian    Inhabitant,          residing    at   Harbour
  Heights, “W” Wing, 12-F, 12th Floor, Sassoon Docks,
  Colaba, Mumbai-400 005, now in Delhi, do hereby
  swear and state as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">  1.       A   Bench    of   this     Hon’ble     Court    comprising
  Hon’ble      Shri     Justice       Rohinton     F.    Nariman   and
  Hon’ble Shri Justice Vineet Saran, by judgment and
  order dated 12th March, 2019, was pleased to hold
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    4</span>

me guilty for contempt in the face of the Court
and list the case for hearing on the question of
punishment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">2.       I happened to mention the name of Shri Fali
S. Nariman to buttress my proposition that even
legendary Shri Fali Nariman is of the view that
the seniority of a lawyer should be reckoned from
the     date   of     his    enrolment       and      nothing     else.
However, I was misunderstood. I along with some
office bearers of the National Lawyers’ Campaign
for     Judicial       Transparency          and      Reforms      have
instituted Writ Petition No.2199/2019 in the High
Court     of    Delhi       for    a      declaration      that     the
Explanation to Rule 6 of the Bar Council of India
Rules is void inasmuch as it explains that the
word “Court” does not mean the entire Court, but
the particular Court in which the relative of a
lawyer is a Judge. I instituted the said petition
only to raise the concern many lawyers share with
me regarding the immediate relatives practising in
the   very     same   Court       where    their      relative    is   a
Judge. In retrospection I realize that it was an
error on my part to have arrayed Shri Fali Nariman
as a Respondent to the said petition. I regret the
same;     no    words       can     sufficiently         explain       my
contrition      and    regret.      I     also   in    retrospection
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        5</span>

     realize that I have erred even during the conduct
     of the above case before this Hon’ble Court and I
     probably would not have kept upto what is expected
     of me as a lawyer in the Bar for 35 years and
     crossed the age of 60. I feel sorry, express my
     contrition     and   tender     my      unconditional         apology,
     while   maintaining      that      some       of    the   accusations
     levelled   against      me    in       the   judgment       dated    12th
     March, 2019 are absolutely wrong, which are, ex
     facie, black and white, and as incontrovertible as
     day and night.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     3.      The apology tendered by me hereinabove be
     accepted and I may be purged of the contempt.
</p>

</p><p id="p_11">     this 27th day of March, 2019 (Mathews J. Nedumpara)”


We have considered the affidavit so filed in the light

of the incidents that have taken place in the Bombay

High Court as well as in this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Given the fact that Shri Nedumpara now undertakes

to    this   Court    that    he   will          never   again    attempt        to

browbeat      any    Judge   either         of    this   Court     or    of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6</span>

Bombay High Court, we sentence Shri Nedumpara to three

months imprisonment which is, however, suspended only

if Shri Nedumpara continues in future to abide by the

undertaking         given   to     us    today.         In     addition,       Shri

Nedumpara      is    barred       from       practicing      as   an    Advocate

before the Supreme Court of India for a period of one

year    from   today.         This       disposes       of     the   punishment

aspect of the contempt that was committed in the face

of the Court.

of the Judges of this Bench on 25.03.2019, is a letter

    It can be seen on a comparison of the prayers in

both the complaints that they are substantially similar

showing that prima facie the aforesaid Shri Vijay Kurle

and Shri Rashid Khan Pathan are acting in tandem. Also,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                           11</span>

the complaints are dated 20th March, 2019 and 19th March,

2019.   Para 3.14 of the said letter is significant and

reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_38">“3.14    The Bombay Bar Association and the Bombay
Incorporated Law Society have reason to believe that Mr.
Nilesh Ojha and Mr. Mathews Nedumpara are in tandem
with one another. In Criminal contempt Petition No.3 of
2017, which was initiated as a result of various acts
of Mr. Nilesh Ojha and his associates, Mr. Mathews
Nedumpara appeared for one of the contemnors. Similarly,
in a Petition being Writ Petition (L) No.1180 of 2018
filed by Mr. Mathews Nedumpara against Hon’ble Mr.
Justice S.J. Kathawalla alleging “judicial defamation”
and seeking compensation, Mr. Nilesh Ojha appeared for
Mr. Mathews Nedumpara. The timing at which these
complaints have been made after the bench comprising of
Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.F. Nariman and Hon’ble Mr.
Justice Vineet Saran of the Supreme Court of India held
Mr. Mathews Nedumpara guilty of contempt of Court and
also the contents of the complaint of Indian Bar
Association make it apparent that these complaints are
made to browbeat the Court for having initiated
contempt proceedings against Mr. Mathews Nedumpara. It
is pertinent to note that the Standing/Managing
Committees of all the three Bar Associations attached
to the Bombay High Court being Bombay Bar Association,
Advocates’ Association of Western India, and the Bombay
Incorporated    Law    Society     passed   Resolutions
appreciating and welcoming the judgment dated 12th March,
2019 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
    Copies of the said Resolutions are hereto annexed
and marked as Annexures “13”, “14” and “15”.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   12</span>

We annex the aforesaid letter dated 23.03.2019 to the

present order.
</p>
<p id="p_39">    Given the two complaints filed, it is clear that
