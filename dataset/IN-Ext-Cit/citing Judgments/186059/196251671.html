</p>
<p id="p_4">            In this blind murder case involving the accused - appellant

Santosh Kumar Singh (herein referred as `the accused'), he has been

convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and to

pay a fine of Rs.5000/- under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860

(for short `the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>') and rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay

fine of Rs.1000/- under <a href="/doc/839778/" id="a_3">Section 380</a> IPC, for causing the death of Sushil

Kumar.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            The factual matrix of the case is that on 15.11.2005, the

complainant Guddu Parshad (herein referred as `the complainant') along

with his brother Sushil Kumar had gone to their place of work at Ram Steel

Mill near Octroi Post No.3, Mandi Gobindgarh, but since Sushil Kumar

(herein referred as `the deceased') was suffering from fever, therefore, at
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                       [2]



10.30 PM, he had sent him back to his room for rest. However, on the next

day i.e, 16.11.2005 at about 9.30 AM when he went and opened the bolt of

the door of the room from outside, he detected that his brother was lying

smeared with blood on the bedding spread on the floor of the room. He was

having deep injuries on the left eye and left side of the neck, caused with

sharp edged weapon. On search of the room, he further found that a black

and white television of `Beltek' company and a sum of Rs.10,000/- kept by

him in the bag were found missing.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            With a view to set the law in motion, the complainant went to

the police station. However, he came across SHO/ Inspector Harbans Singh

at bus stand Mandi Gobindgarh, who recorded his statement and completed

the same at 11.30 AM, on the basis of which DDR No.14 was recorded at

Police Station Mandi Gobindgarh at 12.30 PM. The Investigating Officer

then visited the place of occurrence, lifted the blood stains from the floor,

took a blood stained `loi' placed on the face of the deceased into possession

and dispatched the body for post mortem examination.                 During

investigation, the Investigating Officer recorded the statement of

Mohd.Aslam and on 18.11.2005, arrested the accused. On the same day,

during interrogation, the accused disclosed about the concealment of CTV

marked `Beltek', which he got recovered from the disclosed place.

Thereafter, on 21.11.2005, pursuant to his statement, the accused got

recovered a knife i.e, weapon of offence from the disclosed place.

</p><p id="p_7">            On completion of investigation, the accused was challaned and

ultimately the case was committed for trial. The accused was charged for

the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/839778/" id="a_5">380</a> IPC, to which he pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             During evidence, the prosecution examined Sewa Singh (PW1),

who proved the site plan Ex.PW1/A; Naresh Kumar (PW2), who proved the

photographs MO-1 to MO-8 and negatives MO-9 to MO-16 pertaining to

the recovery of the dead body, which were taken into possession vide

recovery memo Ex.PW2/A; Guddu Parshad (PW3) is the complainant, who

testified that he along with his brother (deceased) had been residing on rent

in the house of Mohinder Singh in Iqbal Nagar, Mandi Gobindgarh and they

both were working in Ram Steel Mill near Octroi Post No.3, Mandi

Gobindgarh. On 15.11.2005, he had sent the deceased back at about 9.30

PM. When his brother did not come to attend to his work on the next day,

then he went to his house and found his brother dead lying in the pool of

blood. He witnessed the injuries on the left eye and left side of neck, having

been caused with a sharp edged weapon. He also found his black and white

television and Rs.10,000/- missing from the house. He also stated that he

had disclosed before the police that he suspected the accused having

committed the murder of his brother Sushil Kumar as he had seen the

complainant keeping Rs.10,000/- in his bag; HC Dharam Pal (PW4)

deposed that on 16.11.2005, he had taken the dead body of the deceased for

post mortem examination and he was handed over the sealed parcel of the

clothes pertaining to the deceased, which he deposited with Inspector

Harbans Singh. He further testified that on 17.11.2005, MHC Gurmit Singh

had handed over him a box containing viscera and another sealed parcel

along with the seal for depositing the same with Chemical Examiner, but the

same was returned by the Chemical Examiner with some objections.
</p><p id="p_9"> Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                          [4]



However, the said articles were deposited by him with the Chemical

Examiner on 21.11.2005 after getting the objections removed; Dr.Sanjeev

Kumar (PW5) deposed that he had conducted the autopsy on the person of

Sushil Kumar and found the following injuries on the body:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "1.   An incised wound over lateral half of eye brow left of the

             size 2.5 cms x 1 cm depth, 1 cm filled with clotted dark red

             blood.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             2.    An incised wound over left pinna of the size 3 cms x 1.5

             cms underlying cartilage cut.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             3.    An incised wound below left ear of the size 2 cms x 1 cm

             and depth 2 cms filled with dark coloured blood.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">             4.    A stab wound starting in the centre of left pinna, piercing

             drum and fracturing left petrous part of occipital bone. The

             direction of wound is backward."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">He also opined that the time elapsed between the death and post mortem

examination was within 24 hours and the time between injury and death

could not be commented upon. The Chemical Examiner did not find any

poison in the viscera and his report is Ex.PW5/C. The doctor proved his

report Ex.PW5/A and the pictorial diagram Ex.PW5/B.              However, the

doctor further opined that the cause of death was the injuries vide his report

Ex.PW5/D;     Inspector Harbans Singh (PW6) is the Investigating Officer,

who testified that though the complainant had not named any person as the

culprit, yet he came to know about the name of the culprit through

Mohd.Aslam(PW10).       He proved the recording of the statement of the

complainant. He has also proved the disclosure statement Ex.PW6/H and
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                        [5]



recovery of the black and white TV vide memo Ex.PW6/J. He further

proved the disclosure statement Ex.PW6/L and recovery memo of the knife

ExPW6/M.     He also proved the entire investigation;       HC Jasbir Singh

(PW7) is the witness of the delivery of the special report to the Ilaqa

Magistrate at 1.15 PM. The distance between the place of occurrence and

Police Station Mandi Gobindgarh is half kilometer as per the report

Ex.PW6/B;     HC Gurmeet Singh (PW8) and Constable Buta Singh (PW9)

are the formal witnesses, while Mohd. Aslam (PW10) has stated that on

15.11.2005, after installing a CD/TV at village Allor, on his return to his

house at 10.30 PM, he left Sunil Kumar at the shop of New Tailors and went

to the room of the complainant and called on him by name. However, the

accused came out in nervous condition and told that the complainant was

not at the house. On 16.11.2005, he came to know that Sushil Kumar

(deceased), brother of the complainant had been murdered.

</p><p id="p_11">            In his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_6">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, 1973, the accused denied all the allegations and pleaded his false

implication in the case. However, he did not lead any evidence in defence.

</p><p id="p_12">            Unlike direct evidence, the circumstantial evidence, if proved

on the record, which completes the chain leading to no other hypothetical

conclusion except that it was the accused and none-else, who had committed

the crime, deserves to be believed, provided, evidence so led is of

determinative tendency.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            The law as regards the circumstantial evidence has been

elaborately discussed in case <a href="/doc/1240999/" id="a_7">Hatti Singh vs. State of Haryana</a>, (2007) 12

SCC 471, wherein, their Lordships observed that conviction can
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                       [6]



undoubtedly be based on circumstantial evidence. However, for that the

prosecution must establish that the chain of circumstances consistently

points only towards the guilt of the accused and is inconsistent with his

innocence. The circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to

be drawn are required to be cogently and firmly established, which have to

be taken into consideration cumulatively. They must be able to conclude

that within all human probability it was the accused, who had committed

the crime and none-else.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            While applying the aforesaid parameters to the instant case, the

circumstantial evidence, so led on the record to connect the accused with the

crime, is neither sufficient and nor of determinative tendency.          The

contentions as urged by Mr.Punia, learned counsel for the accused for

creating the doubt over the prosecution version are quite persuasive and

convincing. It has been strenuously contended by Mr.Punia that the case is

replete with padding on the part of the prosecution and insufficient evidence

pointing towards the guilt of the accused. The testimony of Mohd.Aslam

(PW10) being inconsistent on the material points cannot be placed reliance.

Even otherwise, he being an employee of the complainant, is an interested

witness. The case has been got registered in connivance with Mohd.Aslam

as he supplied the complainant the copy of the bill to authenticate the theft

of the television. It has been further observed that the recovery of the

television as well as the knife cannot be believed. These recoveries have

been planted over the accused just to implicate him in the case. The motive

to commit the crime does not stand proved. The theory of last seen as

uttered by Mohd.Aslam (PW10) is not believable.
</p><p id="p_15"> Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                       [7]



            To the contrary, Mr.Mattewal, Additional Advocate General

appearing for the respondent - State of Punjab has tried to support the

impugned judgment by referring to the statements of the complainant

(PW3), Mohd.Aslam (PW10) and the Investigating Officer Inspector

Harbans Singh (PW6) by urging that there is no reason to discard the

testimony of Mohd. Aslam as also the recoveries of the television and the

weapon of offence. He has tried to strengthen his view point for recording

an opinion against the accused and to confirm the finding of guilt against

him.
</p>
<p id="p_16">            Having heard the rival contentions, it would be pertinent to

mention here that there is no direct evidence in the case to connect the

accused with the crime. The case is based on circumstantial evidence. The

pieces of evidence over which the prosecution seeks to place reliance for

confirming the verdict of guilt are as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            1. Motive;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            2. The evidence regarding referring the deceased to his house

               for rest, a little prior to the occurrence;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            3. production of the bill pertaining to the television Ex.PW3/E

               before the Investigating Officer on 17.11.2005;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            4. statement of Mohd.Aslam (PW10) to the effect that at 10.30

               PM on 15.11.2005, when he enquired from the house of the

               complainant about his presence, then he was told by the

               accused that the complainant was not in the house;</blockquote><p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">            5. recovery of a television `Beltek' 21' Supreme L-1480 and the

               bill allegedly pertaining to the said television dated
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                        [8]



               15.5.2004 vide recovery memo Ex.PW6/J and Ex.PW6/H;

               and

</p><p id="p_19">            6. the recovery of knife vide recovery memo Ex.PW6/N.



            Coming to the first point with regard to motive, though in cases

of direct evidence, when there is a specific evidence of causing or

committing of the crime, the motive which lies in the heart of the culprit and

difficult to explore does not assume importance, but in cases relating to

circumstantial evidence, the motive assumes great importance as it would

dislodge the entire prosecution story.   Similar observations were made in

case <a href="/doc/186059/" id="a_8">Ujjagar Singh vs. State of Punjab</a>, AIR 2008 SC (Supp.) 190.

</p><p id="p_20">            In the instant case, the prosecution has failed to completely

establish the motive. In the instant case, motive of murder is theft of TV

and the amount of Rs.10,000/-. It is not disputed that the prosecution did

not make any efforts to recover the amount of Rs.10,000/- as allegedly

stolen by the accused from the house and no steps leading towards the

recovery of the said amount were taken. The other allegation pertaining to

motive was the theft of a black and white television as mentioned in the

First Information Report. The prosecution has tried to connect the recovery

of the television with the receipt Ex.PW3/E as issued by the Sonu

Electronics on 15.5.2004.      However, on critical analysis of the ocular

version as set out by the prosecution as compared with the receipt as

produced by it in evidence as Ex.PW3/E, it comes out that the story set up

by the prosecution is totally false. First of all, no witness from the Sonu

Electronics for sale of a television was examined to prove the receipt
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                        [9]



Ex.PW3/E. In any case, if it is accepted that the complainant had tendered

this receipt before the police in order to establish the purchase of alleged

stolen television from the Sonu Electronics, even then the same does not

establish the allegations. The receipt indicates that a `Beltek CTV 21' was

purchased by the complainant on 15.5.2004, but the case of the prosecution

as coming from the mouth of the complainant is that he had purchased only

a "black and white" television of `Beltek' company, which was found

missing along with Rs.10,000/-. Again, the receipt was not produced by the

witness on the very day when he had lodged the FIR, but it was produced

before the police on 17.11.2005, after he came in contact with Mohd.Aslam

(PW10), who admittedly was working on the shop, known as "M/s Sonu

Electronics". Had he been in possession of the bill of the television earlier

to 17.11.2005, then certainly he would have produced the same before the

police on the day of registration of the FIR i.e. 16.11.2005 and he would

have submitted that he had a colour television.        There is also another

material improvement regarding company of the television. The FIR reveals

that the `Black and White' television of `Beltek' company was stolen, but the

recovery memo Ex.PW6/J discloses that `coloured' television of `Beltek'

company was recovered from the accused.       All this goes to show that the

prosecution has failed to establish if the complainant had actually any black

and white television, which was found missing from his house and whether

the recovered television was the same which was stolen from his house,

particularly in view of the evidence that the complainant has produced the

purchase bill relating to a coloured television and it is not the case of the

prosecution that any coloured television was stolen.
</p><p id="p_21"> Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                         [10]



            So far as the other point connecting the aforesaid motive with

the recovery of television is concerned, none of the witnesses to the

statements under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_9">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act and the recovery of

the television have been examined.       The said recovery has been proved

only through the statement of Inspector Harbans Singh (PW6), who has

stated that the accused had made the disclosure statement that he had kept

concealed the television in Iqbal Nagar, Mugal Majra under the heap of

`parali' and he got recovered the same from the disclosed place.       During

cross-examination, he admits that the accused was interrogated for one and

half hours, and that the place from where the television was recovered

belongs to Dalip Singh, a resident of Mugal Majra. The place of recovery

is open and accessible to the general public. He also says that 3-4 persons

normally remain present on the Octroi post at Bhakhra canal, which is near

the place of recovery, but surprisingly, the Investigating Officer did not join

any of the employees of Bhakhra octroi post and he also did not associate

the owner of the field for effecting recovery. The long torture for one and

half hour would also indicate that the statement was not free from coercion

and undue influence. Again, the recovery from a place accessible to general

public, after three days of its concealment, could not be said free from

doubt, particularly, when ownership of the said television is not proved on

the record. The recovery of knife is also doubtful for the reason that no

such statement was made by the accused on 18.11.2005 when he was

interrogated regarding the crime and deposed about the concealment of the

television. Had the factum with regard to the concealment of television

been correct, then the accused would have vomitted out the fact with regard
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                       [11]



to the knife on that very day. Both the recoveries are allegedly from a place

near the cremation ground. The dagger which is so shown to have been

recovered from the accused is easily available in the market. The said

dagger was not put to Dr.Sanjeev Kumar (PW5) in order to seek his opinion,

if the injuries as found on the body of the deceased, could be caused with

that weapon.    Thus, in these circumstances, the disclosure statement

recorded after three days of the first disclosure statement certainly creates

doubt, particularly when no efforts were made to recover the amount of

Rs.10,000/- allegedly stolen as stated by the complainant from his house.

</p><p id="p_22">            Now, coming to the evidence of last seen, that also is too weak

to be placed reliance. Mohd. Aslam (PW10) is allegedly the witness of last

seen. On close examination of his statement, he appears to have not stood

the test of scrutiny. He has not disclosed as to what prompted him to go to

the house of the complainant at such odd hours i.e. 10.30 PM. In any case,

according to him, he did not enquire about the deceased from the accused.

No evidence has been led on the record that the deceased had reached the

house before 10.30 PM or that Mohd. Aslam had spotted the deceased

along with the accused in that house. He also did not see the accused with a

knife in his hand.    Had he actually seen the accused on the night of

15.11.2005, then he having come to know about the murder of Sushil

Kumar in the morning and he admittedly having come across the

complainant on 16.11.2005 at 1.00 AM i.e, prior to the lodging of the FIR,

would have come at the fore-front to disclose that the accused was seen by

him at the house of the deceased at the relevant time and he had committed

the crime. Had he even informed the complainant, then he would have got
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                       [12]



recorded about the accused in the FIR lodged on that date, rather, he

disclosed in his statement Ex.PW3/A that the murder was committed by

some unknown person.       That apart, the complainant has tried to make

material improvements over his previous version dated 16.11.2005, while

stating that he had told the accused not to come to their house; that the

accused had seen him placing Rs.10,000/- in his bag and that he had

suspicion that the accused had murdered his brother and stolen the money.

All these improvements made by him during the trial indicate that his

conduct is not above board and as such, no reliance could be placed upon

him.
</p>
<p id="p_23">            Mohd. Aslam (PW10) appears to be an interested witness.

From his conduct, it appears that he was a frequent visitor to the house of

the complainant.    He admits that he works with the complainant (a

contractor) in spare time after he becomes free from CTV shop. He was

working with him for the last 2-3 years. The complainant used to pay him

the wages and he never charged commission for getting labour work done.

Thus, in all human probabilities, it could be expected from Mohd. Aslam to

come at the help of the complainant in the hours of difficulty. Since, he was

working on the shop of CTV, then it was not difficult for him to procure

such bill in order to connect the accused with the commission of the crime

and to introduce the evidence of motive in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_24">            It may further be highlighted that the place of occurrence forms

part of the building belonging to Mohinder Singh, which consists of 4-5

rooms and the other labourers are also residing in those rooms.         The

premises occupied by the complainant is comprised of only one room, then
 Criminal Appeal No.371-DB of 2007(O&amp;M)                       [13]



in these circumstances cries emanating as a result of injuries suffered by

deceased must have attracted any of the neighbours, but none of the

neighbours has come forward to prove the presence of the accused at the

time of occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_25">             Besides, there is unexplained delay in lodging the First

Information Report. Though, none, much less the complainant might have

been attracted to the commission of the crime allegedly at 10.30 PM or

during the night of 15/16.11.2005, yet the complainant, who had come to

know about the occurrence at 9.30 AM on 16.11.2005 did not lodge the FIR

for two hours when the police station is just at a distance of half kilometer

from the place of occurrence, but the story has been concocted by the

prosecution that the police met him at the bus stand. The FIR further

reveals that it reached the Ilaqa Magistrate at 1.15 PM, which also creates

doubt over the truth into the allegations. The time of death is also not

proved on the record. Dr.Sanjeev Kumar (PW5) has not stated as to what

was the time gap between the injuries and the death and what was the

duration of the injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_26">             Resultantly, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the

present case, an irresistible conclusion could be drawn that the prosecution

has miserably failed to prove the complete chain of circumstances pointing

towards the guilt of the accused. The evidence so produced is not trust-

worthy. Therefore, it would have to be concluded that the Trial Court fell in

error in not appreciating the evidence in right perspective. Consequently, it

deserves to be reversed.
</p>
<p id="p_27">             Resultantly, the appeal is allowed. The accused - appellant
