<p id="p_1">BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J

</p><p id="p_2">1.     The present appeal is directed against the judgment and/or order

dated 09.01.2015 delivered by a learned Single Judge of this Court in

IA 24863/2015 which was an application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and

2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. That application was filed in

CS(OS) 3812/2014 which, in turn, had been instituted by the respondents/

plaintiffs. The suit filed by the respondents was one for permanent

injunction restraining infringement of patent No. 222346 granted under the

 <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_1">Patents Act</a>, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as ‗the said Act') in favour of the

respondent No.1/plaintiff No.1.      The suit was also for rendition of

accounts/damages, delivery-up etc.       The respondent No.1 is a Swiss

company and the respondent No.2 is an Indian company. The appellant, of

course, is also an Indian company.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.     The entire controversy is with regard to ‗INDACATEROL' in

respect of which the respondent No.1 holds the said patent.          The said

respondents market the said ‗INDACATEROL' under the name

‗ONBREZ'.        ‗INDACATEROL' is a bronchodilator and provides

symptomatic relief to persons suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary

disease (COPD).

<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.     The appellant launched its drug ‗UNIBREZ' in October, 2004.

However, a suit was filed by the respondents on 09.01.2015 which was

ultimately disposed of on the appellant's undertaking to change the brand

name of the drug from ‗UNIBREZ' to ‗INDAFLO'. That was an

infringement of trade mark action.
</p>

</p><p id="p_8">4.     The respondents do not manufacture ‗INDACATEROL' in India. In

fact, the drug is manufactured by the respondent No.1 in Switzerland and is

 imported into India and marketed by Lupin pursuant to an agreement dated

22.03.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">5.     The appellant is aggrieved by the fact that the learned Single Judge

has restrained the appellant from, inter alia, using, manufacturing,

importing,       selling    any   pharmaceutical     products    etc.    containing

‗INDACATEROL' or ‗INDACATEROL Maleate', alone or in combination

with any other compound or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API),

which may amount to infringement of the respondent No.1's patent No.

222346. However, this injunction has been granted until the determination

by the competent authority of the pleas raised by Cipla for seeking the

compulsory licence, if so filed. In case no such application for compulsory

licence is filed, the learned Single Judge directed that the injunction would

continue during the pendency of the suit. The learned Single Judge also

directed that in case the appellant filed such an application and the same

was decided in favour of the appellant, it could move an application for

modification etc. of the impugned order dated 09.01.2015.



</p><p id="p_11">6.     The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that by virtue of the

impugned         judgment    and/or   order,   the   appellant   cannot        market

 ‗INDACATEROL' in India. It was also submitted that the respondents do

not manufacture ‗INDACATEROL' (ONBREZ) in India.                   Only small

quantities are imported catering to a negligible number of patients. Thus,

according to the appellant, the respondents are not working the patent in

India and consequently, they are not entitled to an injunction.

of patentees. However, it begins with the words ―subject to the other

learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the said rights of patentees

under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_3">Section 48</a> would be subject to other provisions in the Act, including

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">8.     It was submitted that the general principles applicable to the working

of patented inventions stipulated in Section 83 would govern and sit over

the rights of patentees indicated in Section 48 of the said Act. By virtue of

Section 48 of the said Act, a patentee has the exclusive right to prevent

third parties, who do not have his consent, from the act of making, using,

offering for sale, selling or importing for those purposes the product in

India (in this case ‗INDACATEROL').               But, according to the learned

counsel for the appellant, this right would be subject to the fact that the

patent is worked in India on a commercial scale; that the patent is not used

by a patentee merely to enjoy a monopoly for the importation of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO(OS)21/2015                                                        Page 6 of 27</span>
 patented article; that the grant of the patent does not impede protection of

public health and nutrition and that the objective of making the benefit of

the patented inventions available in India at reasonably affordable price to

the public is fulfilled. In this context, it was submitted that the respondents

did not manufacture ‗INDACATEROL' in India and even the importation

was of very small quantities.      Thus, the said drug ‗INDACATEROL',

which was vital for COPD patients, was not available to large sections of

the public in India. It was submitted that the non-availability was further

aggravated by the fact that the price of the respondents' ‗INDACATEROL'

was exorbitant as compared to ‗INDACATEROL' manufactured, supplied

and sold by the appellant. It was submitted that while 10 tablets of the

respondents' drug were sold for Rs 677/-, 10 tablets of the appellant's drug

were priced only at Rs 130/-. In other words, the price of the respondents'

product was five times that of the price of the appellant's product.

<p id="p_13">9.     It was also contended on behalf of the appellant that in the grant of

an injunction, one of the considerations, which is regarded as the fourth

aspect (in addition to prima facie case, balance of convenience and

irreparable harm and injury), was that of public interest. Reliance was

placed on the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_7">F.

 Hoffmann La Roche Limited and Another v. Cipla Limited</a>: 2009 (40)

PTC 125 (Del) (DB). In that decision, the Division Bench of this Court

while dealing with the issue of public interest, inter alia, observed as

under:-

<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       ―81. This Court is inclined to concur with the learned single
       Judge that in a country like India where question of general
       public access to life saving drugs assumes great significance,
       the adverse impact on such access which the grant of injunction
       in a case like the instant one is likely to have, would have to be
       accounted for. Erlocip is the Indian equivalent produced by the
       defendant in India as a generic drug manufacturer. It is priced at
       Rs.1600 per tablet. Even if this does not make it inexpensive,
       the question of greater availability of such drug in the market
       assumes significance.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       82. In the considered view of this Court, while it may be
       possible to distinguish the judgment of the US Supreme Court
       in E Bay as relating to a case of permanent and not temporary
       injunction, the traditional four factor test identified in the said
       judgment does assume relevance even at the stage of grant of an
       interim injunction. Given the nature of the drug, in the instant
       case, which admittedly is a life saving one, the fourth test
       identified in E Bay that the grant of an injunction should not
       result in the public interest being ―disserved‖ would be
       relevant.

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       83. The judgments relied upon by the plaintiffs underscore
       the approach of determining these questions on a case by case
       basis. Whether indeed the public interest in the availability of
       the drug to the public at large is outweighed by the need to
       encourage research in the invention, would obviously differ
       from case to case and depend on a host of factors. This Court
       finds no ground to differ with the reasoning or the conclusions

 according to the appellant, only about 4,000 patients would get the benefit

of the drug ‗INDACATEROL' as against 1.5 crore patients. Thus, it was

submitted that public interest would not be served if an injunction were

allowed to remain against the appellant. We may, at this juncture, however,

note that the figure of 1.5 crore patients suffering from COPD is contested

by the respondents.

       ―27. In his book 'The United States Patent System' (1956),
       Chapter VIII) relating to 'Suppression of Patents', Floyd L.
       Vaughan, refers to what Mr. R.H.F. Palgrave, stated in his
       Dictionary of Political Economy (III, 76). He stated that the
       granting of a patent may be a hindrance to industrial life of the
       patentee, who through want of energy or want of means,
       neglects to work his invention, while others, who would be
       willing and able to do so, are afraid of infringing his rights.
       Reference is made to Mr. William Robinson's. The Law of
       Patents For Useful Inventions (65-67) wherein he said that the
       expectation that the patentee will use his invention is implied in
       the infringement laws, which protect the legal monopoly of the
       patentee throughout the entire period during which his
       monopoly extends. The Corollary of this protection is that the
       patentee must develop his invention. These views suggest that
       if the patentee releases his inventions into the market, it will
       help in further research, improvement and development of
       better technology. Floyd L. Vaughan finally says (p. 259) that
       the US laws allow foreigners to take out patents in US merely
       for the purpose of reserving the US as a market for their
       patented products; If there is suppression, it will prevent
       manufacture in US in spite of more favourable factors for
       production in US.

2010 (43) PTC 630 (Del) is that of a Single Judge. Bard Peripheral

Vascular, Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc.: 670 F.3d 1171 which was a decision of

the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was referred to for the

argument that instead of an injunction, royalty may be a substitute. It was

also contended on the part of the appellant that the view of the learned

Single Judge that the Civil Court could not apply the principles of <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_12">Section

83</a> was wrong. It was submitted that while considering the question of

grant of an injunction, the general principles set down in <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_13">Section 83</a> would

also come into play and the Civil Court ought to consider those principles.


</p><p id="p_22">16.    In sum and substance, the argument on the part of the appellant was

that public interest was an important aspect while considering the question

of grant of an injunction particularly with regard to a drug of the nature of

‗INDACATEROL' which could be a virtual life saver for patients suffering

from COPD. The public interest element is also evident from the vast

difference in the price structure of the appellant's drug, vis-a-vis, the

respondent's drug which was five times more expensive than that of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO(OS)21/2015                                                   Page 14 of 27</span>
 appellant. The factum of non-working of the patent in India would also be a

serious issue to be considered with respect to the grant of an injunction

based on the patent held by the respondents. It was also submitted that the

rights of a patentee declared in <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_14">Section 48</a> of the said Act were subservient

to the general principles stipulated in <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_15">Section 83</a> thereof.



</p><p id="p_23">17.    On the other hand, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that

the fact that they did not manufacture the product in India did not mean that

the patent was not being worked in India because sufficient quantities of

imports were made which would serve the needs of the patients suffering

from COPD. It was also denied by the respondents that the extent of

COPD patients was to the tune of 1.5 crore. It was submitted that enough

imports were being made which would satisfy the requirements of the

COPD patients for ‗INDACATEROL'. It was, therefore, submitted that it

was not a case of public interest being disserved in case an injunction was

granted. It was also submitted that prima facie the learned single Judge had

held the patent to be valid and that has not been challenged, at least not

seriously, by the appellant. Therefore, the respondent is entitled to the

benefit of <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_16">Section 48</a> of the said Act which clearly entitles it to the

exclusive right to prevent third parties, who do not have its consent, from



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO(OS)21/2015                                                   Page 15 of 27</span>
 the act of making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing

‗INDACATEROL' in India.          It was also submitted that the right of

patentees under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_17">Section 48</a> was in no manner reduced or circumscribed by

the provisions of <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_18">Section 83</a>, as the latter provision fell under an entirely

different Chapter and had an entirely different objective.


</p><p id="p_24">18.    It was also submitted that the effectiveness and novelty of

‗INDACATEROL', which was a new chemical entity, is already

established. In COPD, the air sacs in the lungs are damaged and, therefore,

such damage is irreparable. However, the obstruction can be managed.

The obstruction in the respiratory system occurs, inter alia, because of

inadequate dilation. Such inadequate dilation is treated by drugs known as

‗Agonists. INDACATEROL is one such dilator and is a ‗Beta Agonist'. It

functions differently from other inhaled bronchodilators. In the case of

INDACATEROL, one dose in the morning is sufficient to manage the

patient for 24 hours and it is extremely fast acting in the sense that it

provides relief within five minutes. The other inhaled bronchodilators have

very short term effects. There is no doubt that INDACATEROL as a drug

is of extraordinary utility and quality and that the inventiveness and

usefulness of the drug is prima facie established.           It was, therefore,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO(OS)21/2015                                                     Page 16 of 27</span>
 submitted that the fact that the appellant manufactured and marketed

‗INDACATEROL' and ‗INDACATEROL Maleate', is prima facie

indicative of the infringement on the part of the appellant.


</p><p id="p_25">19.    It was, therefore, submitted on behalf of the respondents that, while

public interest considerations may be a relevant factor in certain

circumstances such as in the case of life saving drugs, it cannot by itself

outweigh the rights of a patentee in the case of infringement of the patent as

provided under the said Act.       It was further submitted that the only

argument that has been raised on the part of the appellant is that <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_19">Section 48</a>

is subject to <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_20">Section 83</a> and, therefore, the argument of public interest

would override the rights of a patentee under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_21">Section 48</a> of the said Act. It

was submitted that <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_22">Section 48</a> is undoubtedly subject to the other

provisions contained in the Act but, <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_23">Section 83</a> would have no relevance

insofar as the rights of the patentees under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_24">Section 48</a> are concerned. The

two provisions operate in entirely different fields. <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_25">Section 83</a>, according to

the learned counsel for the respondents, also begins with the words

―without prejudice to the other provisions contained in this Act‖ which

would imply that it is without prejudice to all the other provisions in the

Act which includes <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_26">Section 48</a>.        Secondly, it was submitted that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO(OS)21/2015                                                   Page 17 of 27</span>
 provisions of <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_27">Section 83</a> are not in respect of the rights of the patentees, but

to the powers to be exercised by the controllers and other authorities as

conferred on them by Chapter XVI of the said Act which relates to

Working of patents, Compulsory Licences and Revocation. Therefore, the

element of public interest, which is sought to be introduced by the appellant

through the route of <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_28">Section 83</a> of the said Act, would not, in any way,

impinge upon the rights of the patentees which includes the rights of the

respondent in respect of patent No.222346, under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_29">Section 48</a> of the said

Act. It was also submitted on behalf of the respondents that the statistics

said to have been provided by the appellant with regard to the extent of

COPD patients in India is not reliable. References were made to certain

articles to suggest that COPD does not include an asthma-like respiratory

symptom or chronic bronchitis and, therefore, the number of patients

suffering from asthma or chronic bronchitis cannot be considered as part of

COPD patients. We may point out at this juncture itself that there are also

articles which may tend to indicate that chronic bronchitis is a part of the

COPD spectrum and can be considered as surrogate for COPD. However,

we need not enter into this controversy and only observe that the number of

COPD patients is large.

</p><p id="p_27"> 20.    It was also contended that the conduct of the appellant was mala fide.

In this context, it was submitted that the appellants not only infringed the

respondent's patent, but had also attempted to pass off its INDACATEROL

Maleate's inhalation powder under the trademark ―ONBREZ‖ which was

an imitation of the respondent's trade mark ―UNIBREZ‖. As pointed out

above, it led to the filing of a trademark infringement suit [CS(OS)

3356/2014] in which the appellant undertook not to use the mark

‗UNIBREZ' any further and the suit was decreed in those terms by the

order dated 17.11.2014. It was also pointed out that the appellant had

submitted an application under <a href="/doc/441313/" id="a_30">Section 66</a> of the said Act on 22.10.2014

seeking revocation of the patent on the ground of public interest. And,

shortly thereafter, it launched its INDACATEROL.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">        ―30. It has to be appreciated that undoubtedly patent creates a
       statutory monopoly protecting the patentee against any
       unlicensed user of the patented device. Thus once a violation is
       established in case of a registered patent, subject of course, to
       the patent being used, it will not be permissible to contend that
       the said patentee is not entitled to an injunction. A monopoly of
       the patent is the reward of the inventor. It is also to be
       appreciated that law of the patent is slightly different from the
       law of copyright and trademark as the patent is granted only for
       a period of 14 years. It is also relevant to note that in the
       agreement of technical services dated 28.11.94 there is no
       mandate for the appellant to provide technical information to
       the appellant in respect of the manufacture of any other items
       but the only requirement is that the same can be done if terms
       and conditions are agreed upon between the parties. If the
       respondent would have provided D2 range of products to the
       appellant it would have been entitled to royalty in terms of
       Clause 6.4 of the said agreement. It is thus difficult to believe,
       as stated above, that there could be a license to copy and that is
       a major factor which has weighed with us in deciding the
       present appeal. It may also be added that <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_32">Section 83</a> of the

Hoffman La Roche (supra), it was submitted that injunction was refused

because a prima facie case itself was not made out and there was a credible

challenge to the validity of the patent. This was coupled with the fact that

there was public interest involved because it was a life saving drug. In the

considerations, inter alia, being that patents are granted to encourage

had is that patents are granted to make the benefit of patented inventions

available at reasonably affordable prices to the public.        But, all these

considerations to which regard has to be had, are directed towards the

authorities, who exercise powers conferred under Chapter XVI. Those

powers, include the grant of compulsory licences under <a href="/doc/799603/" id="a_50">Section 84</a>, the

revocation of patents by the controller for non-working of the patents after

the grant of a compulsory licence under <a href="/doc/924604/" id="a_51">Section 85</a> and other incidental

proceedings. It is immediately clear that the provisions of <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_52">Section 83</a> do

not curtail or circumscribe the rights of the patentees under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_53">Section 48</a>,

except in the backdrop of compulsory licences and ancillary issues;

Thirdly, we are of the view that it is not at all necessary that for a patent to

be worked in India, the product in question must be manufactured in India.

As pointed out in Telemecanique (supra), a patent can be worked in India

even through imports. All that is to be seen is that the imports are of a

sufficient quantity so as to meet the demands for the product. This is of

particular importance in the case of pharmaceutical products. From the

presentation of data before us both by the appellant and the respondent in

the shape of articles, etc, we cannot make a definitive conclusion as to

whether the extent of imports is not sufficient for meeting the demands of

 COPD patients in India. This would be a matter of evidence which can

only be thrashed out in the course of a trial. We may also point out that

apart from INDACATEROL, there are other drugs which deal with the

management of COPD which are also available in the Indian market.

INDACATEROL also does not fall in the category of a life saving drug,

such as a cancer medicine. We have also noted the submission made on

behalf of the respondents that sufficient quantities are being imported into

India in order to serve the needs of the COPD patients;

Fourthly, even though the question of public interest may be a factor in

considering the grant of an injunction, it is only one of the factors which

needs to be kept in mind. In any event, in the present case, we do not feel

that the appellant has even made out a case that public service would be

disserved by the grant of an injunction. On the other hand, the respondents

have established a prima facie case in that that patent is valid and,

therefore, there is no credible challenge to the validity of the patent. The

balance of convenience is also in favour of the respondent. We are also of

the view that in case an injunction is not granted in the circumstances, the

respondents would suffer irreparable injury as their rights under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_54">Section 48</a>

would be seriously impaired in a manner which cannot be restituted by

 damages. Because of the aforesaid conclusion, we are also not inclined to

uphold the cross-objections of the respondents in CM No.2090/2015.
