ACT:

Vendor acquitted on plea that he purchased under warranty-In
order  to avoid multiplicity of trials warrantor  should  be
tried along with vendor-But non-impleadment of warrantor  at
trial of vendor does not bar subsequent separate prosecution
of warrantor.



HEADNOTE:
R who was tried for an offence under<a href="/doc/151999671/" id="a_2"> s. 16</a> read with<a href="/doc/1529086/" id="a_3"> s. 7</a> of
the  Prevention. of <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_4">Food Adulteration Act</a>. 1954.  stated  in
Court that he had purchased the curry-powder in question  in
sealed	tins  from the appellant under a warranty  given  by
them and that he sold the curry-powder in the same condition
in which he had purchased it from the appellants.  The first
appellant  was examined in the case.  He gave evidence	that
the  curry-powder was manufactured by, the second  appellant
company and that it had been sold in tins to the concern  of
which R was the proprietor.  He also admitted the issue of a
warranty  on. behalf of the second appellant.  In the  light
of   this  evidence  R	was  acquitted.	  Subsequently	 the
appellants  were  sought  to be tried for  issuing  a  false
warranty.   The	 appellants contended that  the	 proceedings
against	 them  should  be  quashed,  as	 according  to	 the
provisions of the Act, they ought to have been impleaded  in
the  proceedings against R. The, High Court  concurred	with
the conclusions. of the Courts below and held that the	fact
that the appellants were not impleaded and tried along	with
R  was	no  bar to the prosecution of  the  appellants.	  In
appeal	by  special leave, this Court had  to  consider	 the
effect of Ss. 20 and 20<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_5">A of the Act</a>.
Dismissing the appeal,
HELD:	  (1) There is no provision in the-Act which obliged
the Food Inspector to have joined the appellants as  parties
to the complaint filed, against R. <a href="/doc/175685226/" id="a_6">Section 20</a> of the Act has
nothing	 to  do with the matter.  On the  other	 hand,,, <a href="/doc/144953322/" id="a_7"> s.
19(3)</a>  which  says  that any person by whom  a	warranty  is
alleged	 to have been given shall be entitled to  appear  at
the  hearing  and give evidence, seems. to  proceed  on	 the
assumption that it is not obligatory on the part of the Food
Inspector  to join the manufacturer, distributor ;Or  dealer
in  a complaint against	 a person for an offence alleged  to
have been committed underthe Act [160B-L]
(ii)  <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_8">Section  20A</a>  is an enabling  one.  There	 is  nothing
mandatory about it. It is left to the discretion of  the
Magistrate whether, ina particular case, having regard to
the evidence adduced. it is necessary, in theinterest
of justice, to implead the manufacturer, distributor, dealer
as the case may be. [161B]
The normal rule under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a> is to	 try
each accused separately when the offence committed by him is
distinct  and  separate.  The provisions of Ss. 233  to	 239
would  indicate hat joint trial is the	exception..  <a href="/doc/1007660/" id="a_10">Section
5(2)</a>  of  the  Criminal Procedure  Code	 provides  that	 the
provision  of  that Code will apply to trial of	 an  offence
under  any law other than the Indian,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11"> Penal Code</a> subject  to
any  enactment	for the time being in force  regulating	 the
manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying  or
otherwise dealing with such offence.  If that be so.  unless
there is something in<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_12"> s. 20A</a> which, creates an exception  to
the  normal procedure prescribed by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13"> the	 Criminal  Procedure
Code</a>. there would be no justification for importing into the
section by implication an absolute obligation to implead the
manufacturer,  distributor or dealer and try him  also	with
the person who is alleged to have committed an offence under
the Act. in the sense that if the manufacturer,	 distributor
or dealer is not impleaded and tried under the provisions of
s. 20A, a separate trial; would be barred. [161D-<a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_14">G]
State  of Andhra Pradesh v. Cheemalapati Ganeswara  Rao	 and
Another</a>,. [1964] 3 S.C.R. 297. 324, referred to.
158
The real purpose of<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_15"> s. 20A</a> is to avoid, as far as  possible,
conflicting  findings.	 In order to avoid  multiplicity  of
proceedings  and conflict of findings it is imperative	that
the  Magistrate	 should implead these persons under <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_16"> s.	 20A</a>
whenever  the  conditions  laid	 down  in  the	section	 are
satisfied.  It is a far cry from this to say that if this is
not done. the manufacturer, distributor or dealer, would get
an immunity from a separate prosecution. [162E, G]
(iii)	  It  is  impossible to predicate  in  the  abstract
whether	 a  joint trial would be more  advantageous  to	 the
manufacturer.  distributor or dealer than a separate  trial.
Therefore  the	plea that there could be  discrimination  if
unguided  discretion is given to an authority to choose	 one
or the other. could not be accepted. [163D]

MATHEW,	 J.The	Municipal  Corporation	of  Delhi  filed   a
complaint  on September 10, 1970, before the Judicial  First
Class  Magistrate, Delhi against the appellants under <a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_18"> s.  7</a>
read  with<a href="/doc/151999671/" id="a_19"> s. 16(f)</a> of the Prevention of  Food	Adulteration
Act, 1954, hereinafter called "the Act", alleging that	they
gave  a	 false	Waranty	 in  respect  of  the  curry  powder
manufactured  by  them.	  In response to  the  summons,	 the
appellants  appeared and filed an application  for  quashing
the  proceedings  on  the  ground  that	 the  complaint	 was
incompetent.
</p><p id="p_5">The  learned  Magistrate  dismissed  the  application.	 The
appellants filed a revision from the order to the Additional
Sessions  Judge.  That was dismissed.  The  appellants	then
filed  a  revision  against  that  order  before  the	High
Court.The  High	 Court also dismissed the revision.   It  is
against this order that the appellants are filed this appeal
by special leave.
</p><p id="p_6">On November 28, 1968, the Food Inspector went to the shop of
one  Ram  Prakash Oberoi and found that he was	storing	 for
sale  curry  powder.  The, Food	 Inspector  purchase(  three
sealed tins of curry powder from him and after following the
procedure enjoined by the Act, sent one sample to the Public
Analyst,  who, after examining it, sent his report that	 the
sample	was adulterated.  A complaint Was filed against	 Ram
Prakash	 Oberoi	 by  the Food  Inspector  alleging  that  he
committed an offence under<a href="/doc/151999671/" id="a_20"> S. 16</a> read with<a href="/doc/198814423/" id="a_21"> s. 7</a> of the	Act.
Ram.  Parkash Oberoi, in his statement under<a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_22"> s. 342</a>,  stated
that  he had purchased the curry powder in sealed tins	from
the  appellants under a warranty given by them and  that  he
solo the curry powder in the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">159</span>
condition in which he had purchased it from the	 appellants.
The  first  appellant  was examined in the  case.   He	gave
evidence  that	the  curry powder was  manufactured  by	 the
second	appellant company and that it had been sold in	tins
to  the	 concern  of  which  Ram  Prakash  Oberoi  was	 the
proprietor.   He  also admitted the issue of a	warranty  on
behalf	of  the	 second	 appellant.  In	 the  light  of	 the
evidence, Ram prakash Oberoi was acquitted, as, according to
the  Magistrate, he had discharged the onus which lay  upon him in
 order to avail himself the defence under<a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_23"> s. 19(2)</a> of
the  Act.  In the concluding portion of the  judgment  which
was pronounced on October 25, 1969, the Magistrate  observed
that  it is open to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi	"to
institute  a complaint against the warrantor  concerned	 for
issuing a false warranty for the. sale of adulterated  curry
powder to M/s.	T. D. Bhagwan Dass, the proprietor of  which
was accused, Ram Prakash Oberoi through bill Ex.  DWI /A out
of  which a sample bearing No. DS. 2385 was taken by P.W.  2
from Ram Prakash Oberoi".
</p><p id="p_7">The  contention of the appellants in the application  before
the Magistrate to quash the proceedings was that they  ought
to  have  been	impleaded in  the  proceedings	against	 Ram
Prakash Oberoi and tried of the offence alleged to have been
committed  by  them  and, that not having  been	 done,	the,
complaint was barred.
</p><p id="p_8">The High Court concurred with the conclusions of the, Courts
below  and held that the fact that the appellants were,	 not
impleaded  and tried along with Ram Prakash oberoi under <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_24"> s.
20A</a> was no- bar to the prosecution of the appellants for the
offence of giving- false warranty and that the complaint was
competent.
</p><p id="p_9">The  appellants	 submitted before us that it  was  incumbent upon
 the  Food Inspector to have filed a  joint  complaint
against	 Ram Prakash Oberoi and the appellants as them	Food
Inspector had ever opportunity to know that the	 appellants,
had given a warranty when the "articles which were found  to
be  adulterated	 were) sold to Ram  Prakash  Oberoi.   'They
submitted that under<a href="/doc/134223461/" id="a_25"> s. 14A</a>, the vendor is bound to disclose
the  name of the person who given the warranty to  the	Food
Inspector and, as the Food Inspector had knowledge that	 the
vendor	was covered by a warranty issued by  the  appellants it wa
s his duty to have joined the appellants as accused in
the complaint filed by him against Ram Prakash Oberoi.	They
also  submitted that in was no duty upon the Food  Inspector
to  have joined the also as accused, the learned  Magistrate
who  tried  Prakash  Oberoi, in any  event,  ought  to	have
impleaded the appellant in that case under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_26"> s. 20A</a> of the Act
and  tried  the appellants for the offence alleged  to	have
been  committee by them and that not having been  done,	 the
present complaint was barred.
</p><p id="p_10">We  do	not  think  that there is  any	substance  in  these
contentions.  <a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_27">Section  14</a>  provides  that  no  manufacturer,
article of food shall sell such article to any	 distributor
or  dealer of any vendor unless he also gives a warranty  in
writing in the prescribed form about the nature and  quality
of  such  article to the vendor.  <a href="/doc/134223461/" id="a_28">Section  14A</a>	states	that
every  vendor of an article of food shall, if  so  required,
disclose  to the Food Inspector the name, address and  other
particulars of the person from
16 0
whom  he purchased the article of food.	 In<a href="/doc/129536203/" id="a_29"> s. 19(2)</a>  it  is
said that a vendor shall not be deemed to have committed  an
offence	 pertaining  to	 the  sale  of	any  adulterated  or
misbranded  article  of	 food. if he proves :  (a)  that  he
purchased the article of food (i) in a case where a  licence
is  prescribed	for the sale thereof, from a  duly  licensed
manufacturer, distributor or dealer; (ii) in any other case,
from any manufacturer, distributor or dealer, with a written
warranty in the prescribed form; and (b) that the article of
food while in his possession was properly stored and that he
sold  it in the same state as he purchased it.	We  are	 not
aware  of  any provision in the Act which obliged  the	Food
Inspector  to have joiner the appellants as parties  to	 the
complaint  filed against Ram Prakash Oberoi.  <a href="/doc/175685226/" id="a_30">Section 20</a>  of
the Act upon which the appellants relied 'has nothing- to do
with   this  matter.   That  section  only  says   that	  no
prosecution for an offence under the Act shall be instituted
except	by,  or	 with the written consent  of,	the  Central
Government or the State Government or a local authority or a
person	authorised  in this behalf. by	general	 or  special
order, by the Central Government or the State Government  or
a  local  authority.  The proviso to the  section  makes  an
exception to the general rule. in the case of a	 prosecution
for an offence 'instituted by a purchaser referred to in <a href="/doc/78464652/" id="a_31"> S.
1-2</a>,  if he _produces in Court a copy of the report  of	 the
public analyst along with the complaint.  On the other hand,
S. 19(3) seems to proceed on the assumption that it is.	 not
obligatory  on	the  part of a Food Inspector  to  join	 the
manufacturer, distributor or dealer in a complaint against a
person	for an offence alleged to have been committed  under
the Act That section says that any person by whom a warranty
referred to in<a href="/doc/169668608/" id="a_32"> s. 14</a> is alleged to have been given shall  be
entitled  to  appear it the hearing and give  evidence.	  It
would  be  clear  from	this  provision	 that  if  the	Food
Inspector is bound to join the person who gave the  warranty
as a party whenever a complaint is filed against the  vendor
for  storing or selling adulterated articles of food,  there
was  no	 reason	 why the legislature,  should  have  made  a
provision  enabling  the person who gave  the  warranty	 to-
appear	in Court and give evidence.  It is to be noted	that
s.  19(3)  only	 gives liberty to the person  who  gave	 the
warranty   to	appear	and  give  evidence  and   that	  by
volunteering to appear and give evidence. he does not become
an accused.  The opportunity to appear and give evidence  is
to enable the person who gave the warranty to show that	 the
vendor	has  not properly stored the article  while  in	 his
possession. or that he did not sell the article in the	same
state  as he purchase I it and thus to avoid  a	 prosecution
against him on the basis of a false warranty.
The   further  question	 is  whether  the  failure  of	 the
Magistrate  who	 tried	the complaint  against	Ram  Prakasi
Oberoi to implead the appellants under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_33"> s. 20A</a> of the Act and
try them also along with Ram Prakash Oberoi would in any way
bar,the present complaint.  <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_34">Section 20A</a> provides :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "20A.   Where at any time during the trial  of
	      any  offence  under this Act alleged  to	have
	      been  committed by any person, not  being	 the
	      manufacturer,  distributor  or dealer  of	 any
	      article  of food, the court is  satisfied,  on
	      the  evidence  adduced before  it,  that	such
	      manufacturer, distributor or dealer is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">	      161</span>
	      also  concerned with that offence,  then,	 the
	      court may, notwithstanding anything  contained
	      in  sub-section (1) of s-. 351<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_35"> of the Code</a>  of
	      Criminal Procedure, 1898, or in<a href="/doc/175685226/" id="a_36"> s. 20</a> proceed,
	      against  him as though a prosecution had	been
	      instituted against. him under s: 20."
</blockquote><p id="p_11">The section is an enabling one.	 There is nothing  mandatory
about  it.  It is left to the discretion of  the  Magistrate
whether, in a particular case having regard to the  evidence
adduced,  it  is necessary, in the interest of	justice,  to
implead the manufacturer, distributor or dealer as the	case
may  be.  Even in a case where a Magistrate  could  properly
have impleaded the manufacturer, distributor or dealer in  a
proceeding  against  a person alleged to have  committed  an offen
ce under the Act but faded to do so, that would not in
any   way  confer  an immunity	upon   the   manufacturer,
distributor  or	 dealer from a prosecution for	any  offence
committed by him.
</p><p id="p_12">Counsel	 for  the appellants argued that although  the	word
used  in<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_37"> s. 20A</a> is only 'may', it imports an  obligation  on
the  part  of the Magistrate to	 implead  the  manufacturer,
distributor 'or dealer, as the- power to implead is  coupled
with  a	 duty, when it appears from the	 evidence  that	 the
manufacturer,  distributor or dealer, as the case  may	be,
has committed an offence under the Act.
</p><p id="p_13">The normal rule under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a> is to	 try
each accused separately when the offence committed by him is
distinct  and  separate.  The provisions of<a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_39"> ss. 233</a>  to	 <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_40">239</a>
would indicate that joint trial is the exception.  <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_41">In  State
of  Andhra  Pradesh  v.	 Cheemallapati	Ganeswara  Rao	 and
Another</a>() this Court said that separate, trial is the normal
rule  and joint trial is an exception when the accused	have
committed separate offences.  <a href="/doc/1415239/" id="a_42">Section 5(2)</a> of the  Procedure
Code provides that the provisions of that , Code will  apply
to trial of an offence under any law other than,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_43"> the  Indian
Penal  Code</a> subject. to any enactment for the time being  in
force  regulating  the manner or- place.  of  investigating,

that  be  so,  unless there is something  in <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_44"> s.  20A</a>  which
creates	 an exception to the normal procedure r	 scribed  by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_45">

importing  into	 the  section  by  implication	an  absolute

alleged	 to have committed an offence under the Act  in	 the

word-. of the section.	As already Indicated, no prosecution
for  an	 offence under the Act can be instituted by  a	Food

dealer	is impleaded, he becomes an accused in the case	 but
no  objection  can  be taken by him on	the  score  that  no
sanction had been obtained for prosecuting him.	 And, at the
close of the trial, the Magistrate must pass an order either
acquitting  or convicting him.	It does not follow that	 the
failure	 of  the  Magistrate to	 implead  the  manufacturer,
distribute  or	dealer	in  a case  in	which  he  could  be
impleaded  under <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_48"> s.  20A</a> would confer an  immunity  from  a
separate  trial	 against him for the offence  for  which  he
could  have  been  tried under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_49"> s. 20A</a>.	 There	is  also  no
likelihood  of	any  prejudice being caused  to	 him  merely
because	 he  was not impleaded in the trial  of	 an  offence
under the Act committed by any other person as, any evidence
taken in that proceeding won d not be binding on him when he
is  tried  separately.	 In  other  words,  if	a   separate
prosecution   is   instituted  against	 the   manufacturer,
distributor  or dealer, the prosecution cannot rely  on	 the
evidence in the proceedings against the person who committed
the offence as per se ,evidence against him.  It must adduce
evidence  in the case against the manufacturer,	 distributor
or  dealer  to	show  that he  is  guilty.  of	the  offence
complained  of.	 The acquittal, for instance, of the  vendor
who  is	 covered  by a warranty, would not  prove  that	 the
manufacturer,  distributor  or	dealer	has  given  a  false
warranty  or committed any other offence.   The	 prosecution
must show by evidence adduced in the proceedings against the
manufacturer,  distributor or dealer and prove beyond  doubt
that  he  committed  the offence  charged.   Nor  would	 the
conviction of the vendor per se be ground for acquitting the
manufacturer,	distributor  or	 dealer	 for  giving   false
warranty, for, the vendor might have further adulterated the
article after getting a false warranty.	 The real purpose of
enacting<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_50"> S. 20A</a> is to avoid, as far as possible, conflicting
findings.   If,	 in the prosecution instituted	against	 the
vendor, it is found that the vendor has sold the article  of
food in the same state as he purchased it and that while  it
was in his possession it was property stored, and the vendor
is  acquitted,	it would look rather ridiculous, if  in	 the
prosecution against the manufacturer, distributor or dealer,
it  is	found on the evidence that he did not give  a  false
warranty, but that the article was not stored properly while
it  was in the possession of the vendor or that be  did	 not
sell the article in the same state as he purchased it.	This
being  so,  the object of the legislature  in  enacting	 the
section will be frustrated if a Magistrate were to  exercise
his discretion improperly by failing to implead the manufac-
turer,	distributor or dealer under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_51"> s. 20A</a> in a me where  he
should	be impleaded.  But that is no reason to hold that  a
separate  prosecution against the manufacturer,	 distributor
or  dealer would be barred. if he is not impleaded under <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_52"> s.
20A</a>, and tried along with the person who is alleged to	have
committed in  offence under the Act.  In  order	 to  avoid
multiplicity  of proceedings and conflict of findings it  is
imperative that the Magistrate should implead these  persons
under <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_53"> s.  20A</a>	whenever the conditions	 laid  down  in	 the
section are satisfied.	As I said, it is a far cry from this
to  say	 that  if  this	 is  not  done,	 the   manufacturer,
distributor or dealer would get an immunity from a  separate
prosecution.
</p><p id="p_15">The  appellants	 then contended that the, procedure  in	 the
joint  trial will be more advantageous to the  manufacturer,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">163</span>
as  the case may be, than a separate trial  and,  therefore,
there  could  be discrimination if  unguided  discretion  is
given  to an authority to choose the one or the other.	 The
argument was that if the manufacturer, distributor or dealer
is  impleaded  under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_54"> s. 20A</a>, he could avail himself  of	 the
provisions  of	s. 13(2) and request the Court to  have	 the
sample	retained  by the Food Inspector	 and  production  in
Court sent to the Central Food Laboratory for analysis,	 but
if  he	is  tried separately he will  be  deprived  of	that
advantage.   Read literally,<a href="/doc/128134290/" id="a_55"> s. 13</a> (2) would not enable	 the
manufacturer,  distributor  or dealer to pray the  Court  to
have  the  sample  sent for analysis  by  the  Central	Food
Laboratory  even if he is impleaded under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_56"> s. 20A</a>  and  tried
along  with  the  vendor, for, that  sub-section  gives	 the
liberty	 to  move  the court for that purpose  only  to	 the
accused	 vendor	 and the complainant.  But, even  if  it  is
assumed that the manufacturer, distributor or dealer is also
entitled to take advantage of the section and move the court
to have the sample analysed by the Central Food	 Laboratory,
we see no reason why, when he is separately tried. he should
not  have  the	sample retained by the	Food  Inspector	 and
produced  in  Court sent for analysis by  the  Central	Food
Laboratory, if it is available and in a fit condition.	 The
Magistrate  may,  under<a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_57"> s. 20A</a>,	 implead  the  manufacturer,
distributor  or	 dealer	 at any time in the  course  of	 the
trial.	At the time he is impleaded, the sample produced  in
Court by the Food Inspector might not be in a fit  condition
to be sent for analysis to the Central Food Laboratory.	  It
is,  therefore,	 impossible  t' predicate  in  the  abstract
whether	 a  joint trial would be more  advantageous  to	 the
manufacturer, distributor or dealer than a separate trial. ,
The  appellant	relied	on the decision	 of  this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/352854/" id="a_58">Northern India Gaterers Private Ltd. and Another v. State of
Punjab	 and  Another</a>(1)  and  contended  that	 where	 two
procedures  are,  permissible,	one a  joint  trial  of	 the
manufacturer, distributor or dealer with the vendor and	 the
other  a  separate trial, and the one is  more	advantageous
than the other, there will be scope for discrimination.	  We
fail to understand the logic of the argument.  In the  above
case the facts were :	 the  State  of	 Punjab	 leased	 its
premises to the appellant for running	a hotel and when the
lease expired, the appellant was called upon to	  hand	over
vacant	possession.  On the appellant failing to do so,	 the
Collector  issued a notice under s. 4 of the  Punjab  Public
Premises  and  Land (Eviction and Rent Recovery)  Act,	1959
requiring  the	appellant  to show cause  why  an  order  of
eviction  should  not be passed under<a href="/doc/126596261/" id="a_59"> s.  5</a>.  The  appellant
thereupon filed a writ petition in the High Court contending
that the Act violated <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_60">article 14</a> of the Constitution in that
it  discriminated between the occupants of  public  premises
and  those of other premises and that it discriminated	bet-
ween the occupants of public premises inter se as the  State
could  arbitrarily proceed against an occupant either  under
the  Act  or by way of suit.  The High Court  dismissed	 the
petition  holding that the proceeding under the Act  is	 the
exclusive  remedy for eviction of unauthorised occupants  of
public	premises,  that	 there was  a  valid  classification
between	 the  occupiers	 of public  premises  and  those  of
private properties, and that as the Act was substitutive and
not supplemental
(1)  [1967] 3 S.C.P,. 39.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">164</span>
<p id="p_16">there	was  no	 question  of  discrimination  between	 the
occupiers of public premises inter se.	This Court held that
s.  5  of  the	Act violated <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_61">article  14</a>  by  providing	 two
alternative remedies to the government and in leaving it  to
the unguided discretion of the Collector to resort to one or
the other and to pick and choose some of those in occupation
of public properties and premises for the application of the
more  drastic procedure under<a href="/doc/126596261/" id="a_62"> s. 5</a>. The Court  further	held
that discrimination would result if there are two  available
procedures,  one  more drastic or prejudicial to  the  party
concerned  than	 the other and which can be applied  at	 the
arbitrary will of the authority.
</p><p id="p_17">The  appellants	 have not challenged the vires	of <a href="/doc/123346891/" id="a_63"> s.	20A</a>.
That  apart, the principle of the ruling has no	 application
here.	That  principle	 can apply  only  when	an  unguided
discretion  is	conferred  upon an authority  or  person  to
choose	between	 two  procedures,  one	of  which  is	more
advantageous to the person concerned, than the other.  Here.
we  do	not think that any person has been  vested  with  an
unguided  discretion to choose between two  procedures,	 the
one more advantageous to the appellants than the other.
We see no substance in this appeal and we dismiss It.
