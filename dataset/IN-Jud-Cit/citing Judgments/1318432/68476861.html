Judgment On                  : 14.09.2018
Arijit Banerjee, J.:-
(1)   These two appeals and the Cross Objection are directed against a

judgement and order dated 3 November 2017 whereby WP No. 18035

(W) 2016 (<a href="/doc/32937639/" id="a_1">Dr. Naval Patel &amp; Ors.-vs.-The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors</a>.)

was disposed of.


(2)   Five notifications issued by the Department of Health and Family

Welfare, Government of West Bengal were under challenge before the

Learned Single Judge. The first notification which was dated 31 July

2013 reads as follows:-


                   "It has been decided that Doctors, after completing
                   their Postgraduate and Post-Doctoral Education in
                   State Medical Teaching Institutions in West Bengal,
                   will    work   in    Multi-Specialty/Super-Specialty
                   Hospitals, Secondary &amp; Tertiary level Hospitals in
                   West Bengal for a period of one year to serve the
                   rural people.
                   2. It is hereby accordingly ordered that, all
                  candidates, other than Government Sponsored in-
                  service candidates (who have a separate bond), who
                  are admitted in postgraduate and postdoctoral
                  courses, shall have to execute a bond, at the time of
                  admission, to serve this State Government, as
                  above, after successful completion of the course,
                  failing which such candidates will be liable to
                  recompense the State Government a penal amount
                  of Rs. 10 (ten) lakhs.
                  3. It is also ordered that, arrangement shall be
                  effective and applicable for the aforesaid doctors
                  admitted in Postdoctoral courses in State Medical
                  Teaching Institutions from this academic session,
                  i.e., 2013-14 and onwards, while it shall be effective
                  and applicable for such doctors admitted in
                  Postgraduate courses in State Medical Teaching
                  Institutions from the succeeding academic session
                  i.e., 2014-15 and onwards (as post graduate
                  admission has already commenced and on the verge
                  of completion in this academic session 2013-14)."
     The second notification dated 21 March 2014 was essentially a

consequential notification, the subject whereof was implementation of

Bond for Doctors (other than Government sponsored in-service

candidates) undergoing Post Graduates and Post Doctoral Courses.


     The third notification dated 10 June 2014 which was issued in

partial modification of the notification dated 31 July 2013 reads, in so

far as, is material for our purpose as follows:-


                  "Now, in partial modification of Notification
                  Number HF/Q/MERT/912/ME/MISC-78-13 dated 31st
                  day of July, 2013, it is hereby ordered that, every
                  postgraduate trainee (other than State Government
                  sponsored in-service doctors) has to execute an
                   indemnity bond to serve this State Government for a
                  period of three years after successful completion of
                  Post Doctoral/MD/MS Course and for a period of two
                  years after successful completion of PG Diploma
                  course, failing which such candidates will be liable
                  to recompense this State Government a panel
                  amount of Rupees Ten lakh for each defaulting year.
                  All original documents (Mark-Sheets, Certificates
                  and document as required by the Department of
                  Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of West
                  Bengal for time to time) will be retained by the
                  Department for the purpose of ensuring successful
                  completion of the bond prior or payment of panel
                  amount, as may be is applicable. During bond
                  period, specialists will be designated as Senior
                  Resident.
                  It is also ordered that this arrangement shall be
                  effective and applicable for the aforesaid Doctors
                  admitted in Post-Doctoral/MD/MS &amp; PG Diploma
                  course in State Medical teaching Institutions from
                  the succeeding academic session i.e., 2015-16 and
                  onwards."
      The fourth and fifth notifications were again consequential

notifications issued to give effect to the earlier notifications and

pertain to the appointment of doctors in terms of the earlier

notifications for rendering compulsory service in Government Medical

Institutions.


(3)   The   139   writ   petitioners   who   challenged   the   aforesaid

notifications have all acquired the degree of Bachelor of Medicine and

Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from various State Universities. They are

also registered with the respective State Medical Councils.
 (4)   In all the States of the country except Jammu and Kashmir and

Andhra Pradesh, the Government Medical Teaching Institutions

conducting the MD, MS &amp; PG Diploma courses have to keep 50 % of the

seats for students who qualify in the All India Entrance Examinations.

These examinations are known as the All India Post Graduate Medical

Entrance Examination (AIPGMEE) and the All India Post Graduate

Dental Entrance Examination (AIPGDEE). The remaining 50% seats can

be filled up by the State by conducting its own examination or on the

basis of results of AIPDMEE or AIPGDEE.   The West Bengal Government

conducts separate examination for filling up the remaining 50 % of the

post graduate medical and dental seats.


(5)   The writ petitioners qualified in the All India Entrance

Examination.    After the counselling process, each of the writ

petitioners was allotted a medical teaching institute in West Bengal

and the petitioners took admission therein.     At the time of their

admission, they were required to sign a Bond in terms of the

notifications mentioned above, to the effect that they would serve in

the rural areas of the State under the Department of Health &amp; Family

Welfare for a specified period after obtaining the qualification.   In

case they failed to do so, they would have to compensate the State

Government as stipulated in the Bond.
 (6)   Being aggrieved by such bondage, the writ petitioners challenged

the validity of the aforesaid notifications. The learned Single Judge by

the impugned judgment and order dated 3 November, 2017, held as

follows:-


                  "1. The impugned notifications dated 31st July, 2013
                  and 10th June, 2014 are products of executive action
                  of the state under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_2">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of
                  India. They are administrative orders. They are not
                  law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_3">Article 19 (2)</a> of the
                  Constitution of India read with <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_4">Article 13 (3)</a>
                  thereof. Such exercise of executive power had the
                  sanction of the Constitution.
                  2. The aforesaid administrative orders were made
                  after due observance of the Conduct of Government
                  Business Rules contemplated in <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_5">Article 166</a> of the
                  Constitution. In that respect the notifications are
                  valid.
                  3. The legal relationship between the petitioners
                  and the state was that the latter would provide post
                  graduate degree or diploma in medicine, on the
                  condition that the qualified doctors would serve the
                  rural areas of the state for a specified period of
                  time, failing which they would have to pay
                  liquidated damages. This is to be taken as a
                  composite bargain between the state and students.
                  The restriction in practice does not extend to any
                  period outside the contractual period. Hence, the
                  contract is not hit by Section 27 of the said Act.
                  4. No coercion or duress was exercised by the
                  respondents to compel the petitioners to sign the
                  bond promising to offer their service to the state for
                  a limited time and to pay compensation to the state
                  in case of breach. The candidates were aware of the
                  condition and wrote the entrance examination and
                  took admission subject to those conditions with their
                  eyes wide open.
 5. The condition to render three year's
government service or make payment of penalty @
Rs. 10 lakhs per year per student is unreasonable
and arbitrary.
6. Only the notification dated 31st July, 2013 can
be enforced but on the condition that in case a
candidate wants to exit from government service, he
or she can pay Rs. 10 lakhs in five equal instalments
over a period of five years as may be specified by
the State Government within four weeks of this
order.
7. If there is default in the payment of
instalments the degree or diploma already granted
to a candidate may be suspended on the condition
that upon payment of the balance dues together
with such interest as may be specified by the state
government within a particular period of time the
degree or diploma may be restored.
8. The notification dated 10th June, 2014 is
unconstitutional, arbitrary, unreasonable and is set
aside. The notification dated 31st July, 2013 subject
to clauses 6 and 7 above will also apply to
petitioners covered by the 10th June, 2014
notification.
9. The petitioners or such of them to whom the
notifications apply will have an option whether to
avail of the notifications dated 26th July, 2016 and
10th August, 2016. In case they opt out of the
purview of the notifications or choose not to accept
them, they will be allowed the benefit of the
notification dated 31st July, 2013, read with
judgement and order, by the respondents.
10. The respondents will release all the documents
of the petitioners, e.g. mark sheet, degree/diploma
certificate held by them, within two weeks of
receipt of the penalty or the first instalment of it as
determined by them on the basis of this judgement
and order. "
 (7)   Being aggrieved the State is before us by way of MAT 2076 of

2017. Some of the writ petitioners have also preferred an appeal from

the same judgment and order being MAT 380 of 2018. Some other writ

petitioners have filed a Cross Objection being COT 49 of 2018. Since

the same issues are involved in the two appeals and the Cross

Objection, the same are taken up for hearing and disposal together.


(8)   Appearing for the State Mr. Majumder, learned Additional

Advocate General drew our attention to a file note of the Health

Department, wherein it is recorded that the State is suffering from

inadequacy of Specialist Doctors.   A proposal was noted to the effect

that a doctor acquiring Post-doctoral Degree (D.M &amp; M.CH) may be

placed at secondary tiers in State Hospitals including Multi-Specialty

and Super-Specialty hospitals to serve there for at least one year. They

would be designated as Medical Officer (Specialist) and would be

engaged on a contractual basis. It was further suggested that the post-

doctoral course candidates would execute a 'Bond' to that effect and

if the condition of the bond is broken, they would be liable to deposit

bond money of Rs. 15 lakhs in favour of West Bengal Health and Family

Welfare Samity. Learned Counsel submitted that on the basis of the

aforesaid proposal the abovementioned notifications were issued.
 (9)   Mr. Majumder submitted that candidates were apprised of the

bond system prior to their sitting the Entrance Examinations.        He

referred to the Information Bulletin for All India Post-Graduate Medical

Entrance Examination for the year 2014 and subsequent years and in

particular referred to question no. 30 under the heading 'Frequently

Asked Questions', which reads as follows:-


                  "Q.    No.   30.    What     about condition  of
                  stipend/fee/structure/course       duration/bond
                  amount/rendering of service in rural/tribal
                  area/other conditionalities.
                  Ans: Stipend/fee structure/course duration/bond
                  amount/rendering of service in rural/tribal
                  area/other conditions etc. may vary from State to
                  State and Institute to Institute. Some seats may be
                  approved/permitted but not yet recognized by MCI.
                  The allotment made through online allotment
                  process will be firm and final as per Hon'ble
                  Supreme Court's guidelines.          Therefore, the
                  candidates should well examine these points before
                  opting for a seat at a medical college. The Medical
                  Counselling Committee (MCC) shall neither be
                  responsible nor shall entertain any case on above
                  grounds, if any. The information received from
                  various participating Medical Colleges will be made
                  available on Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare
                  website (under the Medical Counselling Post-
                  graduate Counselling 2014 - Information about
                  college, fee, bond information etc.) before
                  commencement of 50% All India PG Counselling 2014.
                  Candidates are also advised to visit the website of
                  college/institution to check the information. In case
                  they require any additional information, they can
                  contact the college/institution on telephone."
      Learned Counsel submitted that the candidates were made aware

of the bond system and denial of such prior knowledge is dishonest.


(10) Mr. Majumdar referred to the A/O affirmed on behalf of the

State before the Learned Single Judge and submitted that various

valuable educational facilities are made available by the State to the

candidates undertaking the medical courses at a very nominal cost. In

effect, the State is offering highly subsidized medical education to the

candidates and hence it is not at all unreasonable for the State to

require them to serve the State Medical Institutions for a limited

period once they acquire their qualifications.    Learned Counsel also

referred to the Global Policy Booklet published by World Health

Organization and submitted that WHO also recommends utilizing

services of these doctors in rural areas. Mr. Majumdar referred to the

decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1599759/" id="a_6">State of Punjab-vs.-

Shiv Ram &amp; Ors</a>., (2005) 7 SCC 1, wherein at paragraph 34 of the

judgment it was observed as follows:-


                  "34. The medical profession is one of the oldest
                  professions of the world and is the most
                  humanitarian one. There is no better service than
                  to serve the suffering, wounded and the sick.
                  Inherent in the concept of any profession is a code
                  of conduct, containing the basic ethics that
                  underline the moral values that govern professional
                  practice and is aimed at upholding its dignity.
                  Medical ethics underpin the values at the heart of
                    the practitioner-client relationship.       In recent
                   times, professionals are developing a tendency to
                   forget that the self-regulation which is at the heart
                   of their profession is a privilege and not a right and
                   a profession obtains this privilege in return for an
                   implicit contract with society to provide good,
                   competent and accountable service to the public. It
                   must always be kept in mind that a doctor's is a
                   noble profession and the aim must be to serve
                   humanity, otherwise this dignified profession will
                   lost its true worth."
     Learned Counsel submitted that the stand of the writ petitioners

is antithetic to the ethics of medical profession. The implicit social

responsibility of doctors has been made explicit by the bond system.


(11) He submitted that the medical students serving the rural areas

for a limited period after acquiring higher qualification is in greater

public interest.    Where public interest is pitted against private

interest, the latter must give way to the former. In this connection he

referred to the Apex Court decision in the case of Sayyed Ratanbhai

Sayeed (dead) through legal representatives &amp; <a href="/doc/125038938/" id="a_7">Ors.-vs.-Shirdi Nagar

Panchayat &amp; Anr</a>., (2016) 4 SCC 631 to which we will revert back

later. Public interest demands the service of the newly qualified

doctors in rural areas. Learned Counsel submitted that the concerned

doctors are not made to render free service.            They receive a

stipend/salary and in the process of serving in the State Medical

Institutions, they also gain valuable experience. Subsidized education
 and compulsory service under the State come as a composite package.

Having enjoyed the benefit of subsidized medical education, the

people like the writ petitioners cannot shirk their responsibilities of

rendering compulsory service in the State Institutions.        Learned

Counsel referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case

of <a href="/doc/166424982/" id="a_8">Dr. Vinod Shankarlal Sharma &amp; Ors.-vs.-The State of Maharashtra

&amp; Anr</a>., 2013 AIR Bom 1.     In that case the Bombay High Court upheld

the constitutional validity of the requirement imposed by the State as

incorporated in the bonds executed by the doctors pursuing super

specialized medical courses to the effect that they shall be required to

render one year service after the completion of their degrees in

Government or Municipal run medical colleges or in the defence

services.


(12) Learned Counsel then submitted that the learned Single Judge

has held that the writ petitioners signed the bond with eyes wide

open. After that, they cannot claim any equitable relief. The learned

Judge has disbelieved the writ petitioners' case that they were not

aware of the implications of the bond prior to executing the same.

Such finding has not been challenged.     He submitted that the writ

petitioners did not approach the Court with clean hands and are thus

not entitled to any equitable relief.    In this connection, he placed
 reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/172073149/" id="a_9">Kishore

Samrite-vs.-State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>., (2013) 2 SCC 398.

Justice, equity and conscience are the trinity of a justice delivery

system, submitted Mr. Majumdar.


(13) Mr. Majumdar relied heavily on the recent decision of the Kerala

High Court in the case of Dr. Ayisha Beegam Devasya House, Pudu,

Bantwal, Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka 574169-vs.-State of Kerala

Represented by the Secretary to Government Health and Family

Affairs Department, Government Secretariat, Thiruvananthapuram

695001, (2018) SCC Online Ker 1287.               In particular he relied on

paragraphs 38 and 42 to 46 of the judgment which read as follows:-


               "38. But here, we see no absolute restraint on the
               students' finding employment. In fact, the State
               assures them of employment for the immediate one
               year; they are entitled to pay and perks, too. True, it
               restricts their choice, but that is a matter of contract,
               which they chose to enter into. So it is fallacious to
               claim that the students suffered any restraint on their
               profession. In any event, we will examine both the
               propositions-the public policy and professionals
               restraint-in the factual backdrop.
               ............................................................
</pre><p id="p_1">               42. So we compel ourselves to conclude that the
               doctrine of public policy is highly subjective, shifting,
               and even changing. Statutorily examined, the
               compulsion of the students' fulfilling the bond-
               obligation does not seem to fall foul of any public
               policy. The Central Government, through Ext. P1,
               permitted the college, university, or the State
 Government to impose its own conditions for
admission. The students, consciously, consented to the
conditions, executed the bonds, and never challenged
them--until they completed their course. True,
students have a weak bargaining power in a contract
vis-a-vis the college or the establishment. So they may
have signed on the dotted lines, without demur. That
said, still their conduct while they continued the
course is inexplicable. They could have challenged the
bond obligations. They did not.
</p><p id="p_2">43. Granted, education occupies the pride of place,
and the students deserve every sympathy. But let us
look at what underlines this transaction: the State or
the college insisting on compulsory service or
compensation. The State acted in its permissible limits
and imposed an eligibility criterion; the student
agreed and got admitted. The State compels the
student to serve one year in the State where she dad
honed her medical skills and acquired a higher
qualification. After all the State invests and subsidizes
medical education. In the scenario of limited
resources, spending somewhere amounts to not
spending somewhere else. So those who get benefitted
must repay their debt--of gratitude.
</p><p id="p_3">44. Viewed differently, the doors are not shut on the
students. They may serve the State and be paid or
server their relation and leave it; it comes at a price;
paying liquidated damages. If the students leave for
greener pastures, they must be prepared to pay, to
compensate. Medical profession--tough as it is and,
perhaps, lucrative as it may be--is not all about
money; it has still an element of service.
</p><p id="p_4">45. About the State's retaining the documents, we may
observe that most students are from other states.
After their leaving the place, it is well neigh
impossible for the State or in the colleges to enforce
recovery. So, as is permissible under law, and as
agreed in clause 2.2 of the State prospectus, it can
enforce its contractual right, by retaining the
documents.
</p><p id="p_5">                     46. So the options for the student are two-fold: (1) the
                    students must serve the bond period; or (2) they may,
                    instead, pay the liquidated damages. For the college
                    or Government, the options are these: (a) it can insist
                    on the student's serving the bond period; (2) it can, on
                    the student's refusal, recover the liquidated damages;
                    (3) till such recovery, it can withhold the documents,
                    as a matter of particular lien."
</p><p id="p_6">(14) Mr. Majumdar finally submitted that having accepted and upheld

all the points of law argued on behalf of the State, the learned Single

Judge in conclusion created a new contract between the writ

petitioners and the State.       By doing so, the learned Judge exceeded

his jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

Submission on behalf of the respondents/writ petitioners:-
(15) Appearing for the writ petitioners Mr. Pratik Dhar, learned Sr.

Counsel submitted that the constitutional rights of the writ petitioners

under Arts. 19(1)(g) and 21 have been sought to be curtailed by

executive instructions in the form of the impugned notifications. This

is impermissible in law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
(16) He then referred to the list of documents required for all India

50% quota at the time of admission for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.

There is no mention of any service bond.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
(17) Mr. Dhar then referred to a letter dated 27 December, 2001

issued by the office of the Director General of Health Services to all
 the Secretaries (Health &amp; ME) of all States/Union Territories as also to

Principal/Dean,       Director     of     all     Government       Medical

Colleges/Institutions stating therein that as per the directions given by

the Apex Court on 27 July, 2001 in CA No. 1944 of 1993, there should

not be any additional eligibility conditions/bonds for All India Quota

Candidates. Learned Counsel submitted that the State of West Bengal

complied with this exemption for All India Quota candidates from

additional eligibility conditions till the year 2013.   By way of example

he referred to an admission document of Dr. B. C. Roy Post Graduate

Institute of Paediatric Sciences, Calcutta wherein it is noted that any

additional State condition shall not be applicable to All India Quota

candidates.    The State followed a path from 2001 to 2013. A sudden

departure from such path by issuing departmental notification is not

permissible.   This can only be done by valid legislation.        The writ

petitioners are fighting as a matter of principle since the service bond

has resulted in curtailment of their freedom.      It is not that there will

be an exodus even without the bond system invoked.         Majority of the

candidates are likely to serve in State Medical Institutions initially but

the same should be a matter of choice for them.           They cannot be

compelled to do so.
</p><p id="p_10"> (18) Mr. Dhar submitted that the impugned notifications interfere

with the writ petitioner's liberty to work at a place they want to.

Liberty does not only mean freedom to move around.              The term

'liberty' is not confined to mere freedom from bodily restraint and

liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the

individual is free to pursue.   It is a fundamental right of a citizen of

our country.    In this connection, learned Counsel relied on the

decisions of the Apex Court in the cases of <a href="/doc/179237868/" id="a_10">Kharak Singh-vs.-State of

U.P. &amp; Ors</a>, AIR 1963 SC 1295 and <a href="/doc/91938676/" id="a_11">K.S. Puttaswamy &amp; Anr.-vs.-Union

of India</a>, (2017) 10 SCC 1.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
(19) Mr. Dhar then relied on the decision of the Apex Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/861066/" id="a_12">Harsh Pratap Sisodia-vs.-UOI &amp; Ors</a>., (1999) 2 SCC 575 in

support of his submission that the State or the colleges cannot insist

upon the satisfaction of the 'State requirements' as a condition to

grant admission to the allottees against the all India quota.    It is not

open to any State to fix any additional eligibility criterion in cases of

candidates who fall under the all India quota.            For the same

proposition he also referred to the decision of the Apex Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/548557/" id="a_13">Anand S. Biji-vs.-State of Kerala &amp; Ors</a>., 2001 (6) SCALE 665.


(20) Mr. Dhar referred to paragraph 4(a) of the A/O affirmed on

behalf of the State respondents before the learned Single Judge and
 submitted that there is a clear admission that service bond

requirement does not apply to All India Quota candidates and is meant

only for the State Quota candidates. Paragraph 4(a) of the said A/O is

set out hereinunder.

<p id="p_12">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 " That the petitioners had to sign a bond to serve

                 academic session 2015-16 onwards."
</blockquote><p id="p_13">(21) Mr. Dhar then referred to the decision of the Apex Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/434106/" id="a_14">Dr. Pradeep Jain &amp; Ors.-vs.-Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., (1984) 3

SCC 654, in support of his submission that in regard to admissions to

the Post-graduate course and particularly Super-specialty such as
 neuro-surgery and cardiology, there should be no reservation at all and

admission should be granted purely on merit on all India basis.


(22) Mr. Dhar referred to the file note that we have adverted to

above and submitted that what is observed there is shortage of doctors

with post-doctoral qualification.   The writ petitioners are not such

persons.   However, at the time of issuing the notification post-

graduate doctors were also roped in.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
(23) Mr. Dhar submitted that freedom to practice medicine is a

fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_15">Art. 19</a> of the Constitution.        Freedom to

practice includes freedom not to practice. This freedom cannot be

restricted by notification.   Further, a fundamental right cannot be

waived by a citizen. For this proposition learned Counsel relied on the

decision of a Constitutional Bench of the Apex Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/761967/" id="a_16">Basheshar Nath-vs.-Commissioner of Income Tax Delhi &amp; Rajasthan

And Anr</a>., AIR 1959 SC 149.      Reliance was also placed on the Apex

&amp; Ors</a>., (2015) SCC Online Utt 1296, wherein it was held that in view

of the judgment passed by the Apex Court in the case of Anand S. Biji
 (supra) the State Government did not have jurisdiction to pressurise

the petitioners to execute bonds to serve the State Government for

five years or else to pay damages to the tune of Rs. 30 lac.   Learned

Counsel also referred to the decision of the Gujarat High Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/131973352/" id="a_19">Poojaben Rajeshkumar Patel-vs.-State of Gujarat &amp; Ors</a>.,

(2014) SCC Online Guj 7988, wherein it was held that in the absence

of Rules or Regulations, the respondent college could not retain the

original documents of the petitioner and could not refuse to return the

same even if there has been breach of the terms and the conditions of

the service bond executed by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
(25) Mr. Dhar referred to an unreported decision of the Chhattisgarh

High Court in Writ Petition (C) No. 586 of 2012 (Dr. Amit Bishamlal

Vallabhani-vs.-State    of    Chhattisgarh,    Through      Secretary,

Department of Health &amp; Family Welfare, DKS Bhawan, Mantralaya,

Raipur (CG)). In that case the Division Bench of the Chhattisgarh High

Court by its order dated 10 July, 2012 while upholding the validity and

constitutionality of the concerned rules providing for execution of

service bond, held that the same cannot be used, implemented and

enforced against those candidates who are given admission due to they

having passed All India Quota Entrance Examination.    In other words,
 All India Quota candidates could not be required to execute service

bonds.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
(26) Mr. Dhar then submitted that the executive cannot change the

law nor can supersede a judgment of a competent court.                   The

Government having followed for long the decision of the Apex Court in

the cases of Harsh Pratap Sisodia (supra) and Anand S. Biji (supra),

cannot suddenly now deviate therefrom.          In this connection, he relied

on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1134977/" id="a_20">Nookala

Setharamaiah-vs.-Kotaiah Naidu &amp; Ors</a>, (1970) 2 SCC 13.


(27) Mr. Dhar then submitted that the impugned notifications have

been issued by the State in exercise of its power under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_21">Art. 162</a> of the

Constitution.     Such notifications are the results of administrative

decisions and are not law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_22">Art. 13</a> of the

Constitution of India. If a customary law is to be given a go-bye for

any purpose, the same must be done in terms of a statute and not

otherwise. For this proposition he relied on the decision of the Apex

Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1637163/" id="a_23">Punit Rai-vs.-Dinesh Chaudhary</a>, (2003) 8 SCC

</p><p id="p_18">204. For the same proposition he also relied on the decision of the

Chandramohanan</a>, (2004) 3 SCC 429.
</p><p id="p_19"> (28) Learned Counsel then submitted that just because the State has

spent money for training of the writ petitioners, the State cannot

demand that the said All India Quota candidates must serve the State

for a certain period.   These candidates have succeeded on their own

merit in an All India competitive examination.   State has not done any

favour to them or has not conferred any special benefit on them. The

service bonds extracted from the writ petitioners are illegal and just

because the State has spent some money for the education of the writ

petitioners, such illegality would not become legitimate.       In this

connection, Mr. Dhar relied on the Apex Court decision in the case of

<a href="/doc/1583107/" id="a_25">Sri K. Ramadas Shenoy-vs.-The Chief Officers, Town Municipal

Council, UDIPI &amp; Ors</a>., (1974) 2 SCC 506.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
(29) Mr. Dhar then submitted that any Act of the Government, if the

same prejudices a citizen, must have legislative sanction.   Otherwise,

such Act must be struck down. In support of this submission, he relied

on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/766560/" id="a_26">State of Madhya

Pradesh &amp; Anr.-vs.-Thakur Bharat Singh</a>, AIR 1967 SC 1170.


(30) Learned Counsel then submitted that just because the writ

petitioners executed the bonds, they are not precluded from

challenging the impugned notifications.     Nobody can be precluded

from exercising his constitutional right of invoking <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Art. 226</a> of the
 Constitution. There can be no estoppel against a statute much less

against a constitutional provision. In this connection, learned Counsel

relied on the decisions of the Apex Court in the cases of <a href="/doc/1903603/" id="a_28">AIR India-vs.-

Nergesh   Meerza    &amp;   Ors</a>.,   (1981)   4   SCC   335   and   <a href="/doc/1718388/" id="a_29">Prashant

Ramachandra Deshpande-vs.-Maruti Balaram Haibatti</a>, (1995) Supp

(2) SCC 539.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
(31) Mr. Dhar submitted that to the extent the bonds executed by the

writ petitioners are being sought to be enforced beyond the period of

the educational course undergone by the writ petitioners, the same

are void. If the terms and conditions of a contract are sought to be

enforced beyond the term and expiry of the agreement, it becomes

void.   For this proposition learned Counsel relied on the decision of

the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/571375/" id="a_30">Percept D'Mark (India) (P) Ltd.-vs.-

Zaheer Khan &amp; Anr</a>., (2006) 4 SCC 227.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
(32) Mr. Dhar then submitted that the service bonds executed by the

writ petitioners fall foul of Sec. 27 of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_31">Indian Contract Act</a> being in

restraint of a lawful profession and accordingly void.           In this

connection, reliance was placed on the decision of the Apex Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_32">Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors.-vs.-Coca Cola Co. &amp; Ors</a>.,

(1995) 5 SCC 545.
</p><p id="p_23"> (33) Mr. Saugata Bhattacharyya, Learned Senior Counsel, appearing

for the Indian Medical Council referred to various provisions of the

<a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_33">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956. He referred to <a href="/doc/1393668/" id="a_34">Section 33</a> of the

1956 Act which empowers the Medical Council of India (MCI) to make

regulations    relating   to   various   matters    including   conduct     of

professional    examinations,    conditions   for   participating   in    such

examinations and qualifications of examiners.       He also referred to the

Post-graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 and two Apex

Court's decisions in the cases of Harsh Pratap Sisodia (supra) and <a href="/doc/1095409/" id="a_35">Dr.

Preeti Srivastava &amp; Anr.-vs.-State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>., AIR

1999 SC 2894. The second decision states that both the Union as well

as the States     have the power to legislate on education including

medical education subject to, inter alia, Entry 66 of List I which deals

with laying down standards in institutions for higher education or

research and scientific and technical institutions as also coordination

of such standards. A State has the right to control education including

medical education so long as the field is not occupied by any Union

Legislation. The State cannot while controlling education in the State,

impinge on standards in institutions for higher education because this

is exclusively within the purview of the Union Government. Therefore,

while prescribing the criteria for admission to institutions for higher
 education including higher medical education, the State cannot

adversely affect the standards laid down by the Union of India under

Entry 66 of List I.   However, there can be rules for admission which

are consistent with or do not affect adversely the standards of

education prescribed by the Union in exercise of powers under Entry 66

of List I.   Thus, a State may, for admission to the post graduate

medical courses, lay down qualifications in addition to those

prescribed under Entry 66 of List I.    This would be consistent with

promoting higher standards for admission to the higher educational

courses. But in lowering of the norms laid down can and do have an

adverse effect on the standards of education in the institutes of higher

education.

<p id="p_24">

decision to the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
State in reply:
</p><p id="p_27">(34) In reply, learned Addl. Adv. General submitted that the State can

issue executive instructions with respect to any matter in the State List

or Concurrent List so long as it is not in conflict with a Central

instruction. If the field is not occupied, the State Government can

issue executive instructions. In this connection, learned Counsel relied

on the Apex Court's decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_36">Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya
 Kapur &amp; Ors.-vs.-State of Punjab</a>, AIR 1955 SC 549 and in the case of

<a href="/doc/67871/" id="a_37">Bishambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan &amp; Ors.-vs.-State of Uttar Pradesh

&amp; Ors</a>., (1982) 1 SCC 39. Learned Counsel also referred to the Rules

of Business of the Government of West Bengal framed under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_38">Art. 166

(3)</a> of the Constitution of India and in particular Rule 47.


(35) Learned Counsel then referred to the State's affidavit dated 11

May, 2017 filed before the learned Single Judge wherein at paragraph 5

it is stated that the answer to question no. 28 in the Frequently Asked

Questions for the All India Quota Post Graduate Medical/Dental Seats,

2014 online allotment process clearly indicated that the stipend/fee

structure/course   duration/bond     amount/rendering     of   service   in

rural/tribal areas/other conditions etc. may vary from State to State

and institute to institute.   In fact, all the writ petitioners executed

bonds for rural service without any protest or demur.          Their stand

before the learned Single Judge that the Frequently Asked Questions

were not made available to them prior to the entrance examination

i.e, All India Medical Entrance Examination, 2014 was disbelieved by

the learned Single Judge and this finding of fact has not been assailed

in the Memorandum of Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
(36) Mr. Majumdar then submitted that the writ petitioners do not

have any fundamental right to pursue post graduate medical education
 at subsidised rates. <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_39">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution does not confer

any such right on them. The petitioners had unfettered freedom of

choice while opting for West Bengal as their educational destination.

They did not do so under any duress. They chose West Bengal because

of the low educational cost.     Further, they are still free to go for

higher education by paying the bond amount.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
(37) Referring to the decisions in Harsh Pratap Sisodia (supra) and

Anand S. Biji (supra), Learned Counsel submitted that the bond is not

an eligibility criterion. Hence, the bond does not fall foul of the said

two Apex Court's decisions.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
Court's View:-
</p><p id="p_31">(38) We have carefully considered the rival contentions of the parties.

In the facts of the case, the following issues arise for our consideration

and determination:-
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">(i) Could the State Government have introduced the bond system by

issuing the notifications which are under challenge in the present

proceeding or was legislation necessary for that purpose?


</p><p id="p_34">(ii) Do the notifications impinge upon the freedom of the petitioners to

practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or

business guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_40">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution?
</p><p id="p_35"> (iii) Were the writ petitioners aware of the bond system before opting

for West Bengal as their academic destination for post graduate

medical studies?
</p>

Re: Issue No. (i):-
</p><p id="p_39">(39) Mr. Dhar argued that the impugned notifications are the results

of administrative decisions and not law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_42">Art. 13</a>

of the Constitution. Specific legislation is required if a customary law

is to be given a go-bye. We are unable to agree with learned Counsel.

<a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_43">Art. 166</a> of the Constitution of India pertains to conduct of business of

the Government of a State. Clause 3 of that Article provides that the

Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the

business of the Government of the State and for the allocation among

Ministers of the State business in so far as it is not business with

respect to which the Governor is by or under the Constitution required

to act in his discretion.   In exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_44">Art. 166(3)</a> Rules

of Business have been framed for the Government of West Bengal.

Under Rule 47 of the Rules of Business the Addl. Chief Secretary or the
 Principal Secretary or the Secretary or the Special Secretary or the

Joint Secretary-in-charge of the Department concerned is responsible

for the proper transaction of business on careful observance of the

Rules. The rules may, to such extent as necessary, be supplemented

by instructions to be issued by the Governor on the advice of the Chief

Minister. The impugned notifications have been issued either by the

Joint Secretary or the Special Secretary to the Government of West

Bengal. Thus, they are issued by the Officers of the State authorised

in that regard under the Rules of Business of the State Government.


(40) The question now is whether the clauses 1 and 2 of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_45">Art. 166</a> of

the Constitution have been followed.       Clause 1 provides that all

executive actions of the Government of a State shall be exercised to

be taken in the name of the Governor. Clause 2 provides that orders

and other instruments made and executed in the name of the Governor

shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in the Rules

to be made by the Governor and the validity of an order or instrument

which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground

that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the

Governor.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
(41) It was urged on behalf of the writ petitioners that Clauses (1) and

(2) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_46">Art. 166</a> of the Constitution were not complied with while issuing
 the impugned notifications.         Even assuming that in issuing the

notifications under challenge Clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_47">Art. 166</a> were not

adhered to, the same per se, would not make the notifications bad. In

this connection, one may refer to the decision of the Apex Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/168139441/" id="a_48">Lalaram &amp; Ors.-vs.-Jaipur Development Authority &amp; Anr</a>.,

(2016) 11 SCC 31.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
(42) The next question is whether or not the State Government could

introduce the bond system by issuing notifications? In our opinion, the

answer is in the affirmative. Under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_49">Art. 162</a> of the Constitution the

executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to

which the State Legislature has power to make laws; provided that, in

any matter with respect to which both the State Legislature and the

Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State

shall be subject to and limited by the executive power expressly

conferred by the Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon

the Union or authorities thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
(43) Entry 25 of List II of Schedule 7 to the Constitution vests the

State legislature with the power to make laws with regard to education

including technical education, medical education and universities

subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I and

vocational and technical training of labour.     Hence, the State can
 exercise     executive      power      by     issuing      administrative

circulars/notifications in relation to education in a field which is not

occupied by any Central Legislation or notification.


(44) In the case of <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_50">Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur &amp; Ors.-vs.-State of

Punjab</a> (supra), the Apex Court in the context of <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_51">Art. 73 (extent of

executive power of the Union)</a> and <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_52">Art. 162</a> observed that neither of

these articles contained any definition as to what the executive

function is and what activities are legitimately given within its scope.

They are concerned primarily with the distribution of the executive

power between the Union on the one hand and the States on the other.

They do not mean that it is only when the Parliament or the State

Legislature has legislated on certain items appertaining to their

respective lists, that the Union or the State Executive, as the case may

be, can proceed to function in respect of them.        On the other hand,

the language of <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_53">Art. 162</a> clearly indicates that the powers of the State

Executive do extend to matters upon which the State Legislature is

competent to legislate and are not confined to matters over which

legislation has been passed already. The same principle underlies <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_54">Art.

73</a> of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/67871/" id="a_55">In Bishambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan &amp; Ors.-

vs.-State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>. (supra), at paragraph 20 of the

reported judgment the Apex Court observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   "20. Even assuming that the impugned teleprinter
                  message is not relatable to the two Control Orders,
                  the State Government undoubtedly could, in
                  exercise of the executive power of the State,
                  introduce a system of verification on movement of
                  wheat from the State of Uttar Pradesh to various
                  other States at the check-posts on the border and
                  place restrictions on inter-district movement of
                  wheat by traders on private account within the
                  State. The executive power of a modern State is not
                  capable of any precise definition. <a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_56">In Ram Jawaya
                  Kapur v. State of Punjab</a>, AIR 1955 SC 549,
                  Mukherjea, C.J., dealt with the scope of Arts. 73
                  and 162 of the Constitution. The learned Chief
                  Justice observed that neither of the two Articles
                  contains any definition as to what the executive
                  function is or gives an exhaustive enumeration of
                  the activities which would legitimately come within
                  its scope. It was observed: "Ordinarily the executive
                  power con-notes the residue of governmental
                  functions that remain after legislative and judicial
                  functions are taken away". It is neither necessary nor
                  possible to give an exhaustive enumeration of the
                  kinds and categories of executive functions which
                  may comprise both the formulation of the policy as
                  well as its execution. In other words, the State in
                  exercise of its executive power is charged with the
                  duty and the responsibility of carrying on the
                  general administration of the State. So long as the
                  State Government does not go against the provisions
                  of the Constitution or any law, the width and
                  amplitude of its executive power cannot be
                  circumscribed. If there is no enactment covering a
                  particular aspect, certainly the Government can
                  carry on the administration by issuing administrative
                  directions or instructions, until the legislature
                  makes a law in that behalf. Otherwise, the
                  administration would come to a standstill."
</blockquote><p id="p_43">(45) Hence, it is clear that in a field which is not occupied by any

legislation, be it Central or State law or any Central notification, and
 the State Legislature is competent to legislate in that field, the State

Government can fill up the vacuum by issuing executive instructions in

the form of circulars/notifications etc. following the Rules of Business.

This power must be conceded to the State Government as otherwise

administration is likely to come to a standstill.       Naturally, there

cannot be legislation with respect to each and every matter which

affects daily decision of the affairs of a Government. In the present

case, there is no law, whether Central or State, relating to compulsory

service bond.      Hence, in our view, the State Government was

competent to issue the notifications impugned in this proceeding and

by doing so has not exceeded its jurisdiction.        The first issue is

therefore decided in favour of the State Government. It may be noted

that this point was decided in favour of the State also by the learned

Single Judge.

<p id="p_44">
Re: Issue nos. (ii) and (iii):-
</p><p id="p_45">(46) Mr. Dhar submitted that the freedom to practise medicine is a

fundamental right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_57">Art. 19((1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.         This

freedom includes freedom not to practice also. A fundamental right

cannot be waived. We quite appreciate Mr. Dhar's submission.        As a

proposition of law it is unexceptionable that a fundamental right

cannot be waived. But in our opinion, no question of waiver of any
 fundamental right arises in the present case. We are in agreement

with the submission of learned Add. Adv. General that the writ

petitioners did not have any fundamental right to pursue post graduate

medical education in the State of West Bengal at a highly subsidised

rate. With open eyes they chose West Bengal as the State where they

wanted to pursue the post graduate medical education at highly

subsidised costs.    The writ petitioners are all post graduate degree

trainees/students. For them the fee structure was as follows:-


</p><p id="p_46">           POST GRADUATE DEGREE TRAINEES/STUDENTS


 Admission fees                  Rs. 2000/-
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><pre id="pre_2"> Tuition fees                    Rs.    1000/-    per    month

                                 (36months)


 Examination Fees                Rs. 10000/-


 Registration Fees               Rs. 2000/-


 Total                           Rs. 50,000/-




</pre><p id="p_48">     Thus, the three years post graduate medical course cost each of

the petitioners Rs. 50,000/- in all. The State has to spend much more

to run these post graduate medical courses.        Obviously, to take
 advantage of this highly subsidised post graduate medical education,

the writ petitioners opted for this State. They were at liberty and had

full freedom not to pursue their studies in West Bengal. Their stand

that they were not aware of the compulsory service bond prior to

sitting the entrance examination has been disbelieved by the learned

Single Judge.   Such finding of fact has not been challenged before us.

Even independently, it is difficult for us to believe that being medical

graduates the writ petitioners would not apprise themselves of all the

terms and conditions on which they could pursue a post graduate

medical course in West Bengal.       Question no. 28 and the answer

thereto of the Frequently Asked Questions appended to the

                  additional information, they can contact the college
                  / institution on telephone."</blockquote><p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">     In view of the said advise, if the writ petitioners chose not to

take the trouble of finding out the applicability of compulsory bond

service in West Bengal, then they did so at their own peril.   Mr. Dhar,

learned Counsel for the writ petitioners strongly relied on a statement

made in paragraph 4(a) of the State's A/O affirmed on 9 January, 2017

and filed before the learned Single Judge to the effect that the

requirement of compulsory rural service was mentioned in the

information booklet meant for the State Quota candidates.             He

submitted that since the writ petitioners were All India Quota

candidates the compulsory bond service did not apply to them. We are

of the opinion that such a stray statement in the said affidavit should

not be read in isolation. The statement made in the State's A/O dated

11 May, 2017 at paragraph 5 which we have referred to above must

also be considered.   The learned Single Judge has also found that the

writ petitioners were well aware of the compulsory bond service in

West Bengal prior to participating in the entrance examination or at
 least prior to they undergoing the counselling process. The ignorance

pleaded in that regard by the writ petitioners are not acceptable to us.


(47) Therefore, we conclude that with open eyes and with full

knowledge that if they pursue the post graduate medical course in

West Bengal at the highly subsidised rate, they would have to undergo

compulsory service as contractual medical officers in rural areas as per

the bond condition, the writ petitioners opted for West Bengal as their

post graduate educational destination.      They executed the bonds

voluntarily to take advantage of the low educational cost in this State

and did not do so under any duress.   This was also the finding learned

Single Judge with which we fully concur.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
(48) In the above factual scenario, can it be said that any

fundamental right of the writ petitioners has been infringed by

requiring them to execute the compulsory service bonds as a pre-

condition for pursuing the post graduate medical course in West

Bengal?   To our mind, the answer must be in the negative. The writ

petitioners had a complete freedom of choice regarding their academic

destination.   They were conscious that in so far as this State is

concerned, the post graduate medical course and the compulsory

medical service bond came as an integral package.       If they wanted

higher education at extremely low cost, they had to serve the State
 Government medical institutions in rural areas for the period of time

mentioned in the respective bonds.    Otherwise, they were free to opt

for any other State where the bond requirement was not there. It is

also pertinent to note that they are not required to serve the State

Government free of cost.     They would be appointed as contractual

medical officers at a monthly remuneration of Rs. 50,000/- for the

compulsory service period.    We do not find anything unreasonable or

arbitrary or unlawful about the compulsory service bonds. It is a policy

decision of the State Government in public interest. The submission of

Mr. Dhar that the State Government did not insist on such service

bonds between 2001-13 and suddenly could not have deviated from

past practise from 2014 onwards, cannot be countenanced.            The

Government is always free to change its policy if the administrative

exigencies so warrant.   It is only that the new policy ought not to be

unreasonable or arbitrary or capricious or in contravention of any law.


(49) The submission of Mr. Dhar that the service bonds are contrary to

the decisions of the Apex Court in the case of Harsh Pratap Sisodia

(supra) and Anand S. Biji (supra) is also not acceptable. As we read

the said decisions, they were to the effect that additional eligibility

criteria should not be prescribed by the State Governments for

admission to the post graduate medical courses.        The compulsory
 service bond is not an eligibility criterion.    The eligibility criteria

pertain to the educational qualifications of the candidates.          The

compulsory service bond is a condition to which a candidate has to

agree to avail of the subsidised post graduate educational facilities in

West Bengal. The writ petitioners were not compelled to undergo post

graduate medical studies in West Bengal. It was an informed decision

that they took by exercising their freedom of choice uninfluenced by

the State authorities in any manner. It was a kind of contract that the

writ petitioners entered into with the State to serve the State medical

institutions for the bond period in return for the State imparting high

quality and highly subsidised post graduate medical education to them.

It was a bargain that the writ petitioners struck on their own volition

and they must honour their obligation under the deal.       It is not that

they do not have an exit route.   It is not that they are in a position of

servitude.   They are free to pursue their career elsewhere without

serving the State for the bond period upon payment of the recompense

amounts mentioned in the bond.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
(50) It is also established law that a policy decision taken by the State

in public interest should not be lightly interfered with.      <a href="/doc/58962247/" id="a_58">In Census

Commissioner &amp; Ors.-vs.-R. Krishnamurthy</a>, (2015) 2 SCC 796, the

Apex Court held inter alia, that it is not within the domain of the
 Courts to embark upon an enquiry as to whether a particular public

policy is wise and acceptable or whether a better policy could be

evolved.    The court may interfere only if the policy framed is

absolutely capricious or not informed with reasons or totally arbitrary

offending the basic requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_59">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution.        As

often said, in certain matters there can be opinions and opinions but

the Court in exercise of its power of judicial review should not sit as an

appellate authority on an opinion formed by the State Administration.

Similar observations have been made by the Apex Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/33856211/" id="a_60">Union of India &amp; Ors.-vs.-M. Selvakumar &amp; Anr</a>., (2017) 3 SCC 504,

Shirdi Nagar Panchayat &amp; Anr</a>., (supra), the Apex Court observed that

the notion of public interest is synonymous with collective welfare of

the people and public institutions and is generally informed with the

dictates of public trust doctrine - res communis i.e. by everyone in

common. Perceptionally, health, law and order, peace, security and a

clean environment are some of the areas of public and collective good
 where private rights if in conflict therewith, have to take a back seat.

In the words of Marcus Tullius Cicero, the great Roman Statesman,

orator, lawyer and philosopher, "the good of the people is the chief

law".      The Apex Court referred to the latin maxim Salus Populi

Suprema Lex Esto which means the health, welfare, good salvation and

felicity of the people should be the supreme law.                The Apex Court

quoted with approval the enunciation made by Herbert Broom, in his

celebrated publication "A Selection of Legal Maxims", wherein he

stated that the aforesaid latin maxim is based on the implied

agreement of every member of the society that his own individual

welfare shall, in cases of necessity, yield to that of the community;

and     that   his   property,   liberty   and   life   shall,    under   certain

circumstances, be placed in jeopardy or even sacrificed for the public

good.

<p id="p_59">
(52) Coming to issue no. (iv) i.e., whether the bond system falls foul

of Sec.27 of the Indian Contract Act, in our opinion, the answer is in

the negative. The post graduate medical course and the service bond

come as a package. The service bond in effect operates as a negative

covenant during the period of the bond requiring to the candidate
 serve the State for the bond period or pay compensation in lieu

thereof.   It is not in restraint of any business or profession. On the

contrary, the State offers the job of medical officer on a contractual

basis to the concerned candidate. This covenant operates only during

the period of the employment and it does not operate beyond such

period and hence, is fully valid in law.   In this connection reference

may be made to the following decisions of the Apex Court in the cases

of Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. (supra) and Percept D'Mark (India) (P)

Ltd. (supra). In the first of these cases, the Apex Court referred to

the dictum of Lord Morris in the case of Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd.-vs.-

Harper's Garage (Stourport) Ltd., (1967) 1 All ER 699, to the

following effect:- 'thus, if A made a contract under which he willingly

agreed to serve B on reasonable terms for a few years and to give his

whole working time to B, it would be surprising indeed, if it were

sought to describe the contract as being in restraint of trade; in fact,

such a contract would very likely be for the advancement of trade'.

In the same case, the Apex Court referred to the dicta of A.P. Sen, J.,

in the case of <a href="/doc/793778/" id="a_62">Superintendence Company of India Pvt. Ltd.-vs.-

Krishan Murgai</a>, (1981) 2 SCC 246, to the effect that 'the doctrine of

restraint of trade never applies during the continuance of a contract of

employment; it applies only when the contract comes to an end'.
 Similarly observations of the Apex Court are there in the case of

Percept D'Mark (India) (P) Ltd. (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_60">
(53) A Division Bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the

constitutionality of similar rural service bond in the case of Dr. Vinod

Shankarlal Sharma (supra). In that case, it was observed that the

State Government does not charge fees commensurate with the cost of

medical education from students who pursue their MBBS degrees or

post graduation or super-specialization in Government and Municipal

medical colleges.   Admissions to such colleges are highly regarded

because of the exposure and knowledge which students gain in the

course of their medical studies in those institutions. The State spends

a considerable amount of money in providing subsidised medical

education.   As a condition attaching to the provisions of subsidised

medical education, it is legitimately open to the State to assert that

upon the completion of their studies, such doctors should be required

to render public service for a specified period of time as mentioned in

the service bond. After completion of service for the bond period, the

doctor is free for the rest of his or her professional career to serve

elsewhere in the country or wherever.      The condition imposed by the

State Government requiring service for a specified period which of

course has to be reasonable, cannot be regarded as arbitrary or
 unreasonable.   Even as a matter of first principle, the State has a

legitimate interest in ensuring that while on the one hand it creates an

infrastructure necessary for the pursuit of medical studies especially

for the higher level students who benefit from that infrastructure and

its attendant resource base, they must contribute back to the

community by rendering public service. The importance of the wider

social perspective cannot be lost from purview.        The Bombay High

Court did not find any infirmity in the policy decision of the State

Government that students who complete their medical degrees from

Government and Municipal run medical colleges must perform public

service for a stipulated period in recognition of the fact that the public

exchequer bears a large burden of the expenditure incurred on their

medical education. It was held that such a requirement is based on a

valid rationale and the classification meets the requirements of a

reasonable classification for the purposes of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_63">Art. 14</a> of the

Constitution.    We completely agree with the reasoning and the

decision of the Bombay High Court in the said case.


(54) A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has also taken a similar

view and has held such service bonds to be constitutionally valid in the

case of Ayisha Beegam (Dr.) (supra). We completely agree with the

rationale and conclusion of the said High Court contained in paragraphs
 42 to 46 of its judgment which have been set out at paragraph 13 of

this judgment.

privacy nor privacy of choice was held to be relatable to <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_64">Art. 19(1)(g)</a>

of the Constitution.       In our opinion, the said decisions are not

germane for deciding the issues involved in the present case.


(56) In so far as the decision of the Uttarakhand High Court in Romil

Saini (supra) and of the Gujarat High Court in Poojaben Rajeshkumar

Patel (supra) are concerned, the same have been delivered following

the Apex Court decision in Harsh Pratap Sisodia (supra) and Anand S.

Biji (supra). We have already indicated above as to how the service

bond does not run counter to the said two decisions of the Apex Court.

In the case of <a href="/doc/93481604/" id="a_65">Dr. Amit Bishamlal Vallabhani &amp; Ors.-vs.-State of

Chattisgarh &amp; Ors (Writ Petition (C) No</a>. 586 of 2012) the petitioners

had refused to execute the bond and questioned the legality and

validity of the relevant rules introducing condition for execution of

bond by filing writ petition before the High Court at Chattisgarh. The

Chattisgarh High Court declared the said rules to be unconstitutional.

However, in the present case, the writ petitioners duly executed the
 bonds and only later during the continuance of their medical courses

they challenged the notification issued by the State Government

providing for execution of the bond. In any event, none of the said

High Courts considered the effect of the Information Bulletin issued by

the National Board of Examination for AIPGMEE.

Re: Issue no. (v):-
</p><p id="p_63">(57) The only issue that remains is whether or not there is such an

error in the judgment and order impugned before us which calls for our

interference. We have extracted the summary of the Learned Single

Judge's judgment at paragraph 6 above.       It may be noted that the

Learned Judge has held that exercise of executive power by the State

had the sanction of the Constitution. The impugned notifications were

validly issued in accordance with the Conduct of Government Business

Rules. Admission to the post graduate medical course and execution of

compulsory service bond are to be taken as a composite bargain

between the States and the students. The restriction in practice does

not extend to any period beyond the contractual period and hence, the

contract is not hit by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_66">Section 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act.        No

coercion or duress was exercised on the students for signing the service

bond. The candidates were fully conscious of the condition and sat the

entrance examination and took admission subject to such condition.
 With all such findings we are in complete agreement. However, we

cannot agree with the findings of the Learned Judge as set out in sub-

paragraphs 5 to 10 under paragraph 6 above.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
(58) For the reasons indicated above, we are of the opinion that the

notifications impugned are neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.

Further, the learned Judge should not have created a new contract

between the State and the students by allowing the students to pay

the bond amount in five equal annual instalments with the rider that

upon payment of the first instalment the respondent authorities will

release   the   documents   of   the   students,   e.g.,   mark   sheet,

degree/diploma certificate etc.. It is not within the domain of the

Court to novate a contract between the two litigating parties.

Accordingly, the findings set out at sub-paragraphs 5 to 10 of

paragraph 6 above are set aside. The State's appeal is allowed to that

extent. The other appeal being MAT 380 of 2018 preferred by some of

the writ petitioners and the cross-objection being COT 49 of 2018 filed

by some other writ petitioners are dismissed. We make it clear that

the service bonds executed by the writ petitioners are valid and

constitutional and constitute a binding contract between the State and

the students and are legally enforceable.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
(59) The appeals and the cross-objection are accordingly disposed of.
 (60) Urgent certified photocopy of this judgment and order, if applied

for, be given to the parties upon compliance of necessary formalities.


I agree.
