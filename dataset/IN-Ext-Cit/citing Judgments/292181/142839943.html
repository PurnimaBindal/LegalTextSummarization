    change and in that regard, he has also referred to Rule 3(6)(b) of the

    Tribunal in not following its earlier decisions in the impugned order and 





    taking a contrary view.   If the Tribunal wanted to differ from binding 

    precedents, it ought to have referred the matter to the Larger Bench.  In 

    the impugned order, the Appellate Tribunal has relied upon the use of 

    the   phrase   "under   the   said"   twice   in   Rule   57AB(2)   to   hold   that 

    AED(T&amp;TA) could not have been utilised for payment of AED(GSI) even

    AED(GSI) is mainly for the purpose of State.  Further erroneous view is 

    cross utilisation of AED(T&amp;TA) for AED(GSI) will be in conflict with the 
      

    purpose of the Act.  The manner of payment of duty and collecting the 
   



    same are governed by provisions of the Cenvat Credit Rules read with 

    the two Acts.   In these circumstances, the reasoning of the Tribunal is 





    ex-facie  incorrect.     Undisputedly,   the   AED(T&amp;TA)   can   be   paid   by 

    utilisation of BED.  He relies upon CBEC Circular dated 16th April, 2003.

    utilised in accordance with these Rules.  In the circumstances, if there is 




                                                       
    a balance credit which could be utilised in terms of these Rules, then, 

    the reference is to the Central Excise Rules, 1944 and particularly Rules 




                                          
    57AA to 57AK.  Mr. Sridharan submits that the balance credit lying on 
                         
    1st April, 2000 in AED(T&amp;TA) account can be utilised towards payment 

    of AED(GSI) on final product.  If the right vested in a manufacturer in 
                        
    the form of credit is to be utilised upon receipt of the input, then, that is 

    a vested right.  It is not a contingent/existing/future right even though 
      


    credit can be utilised in future.  Mr. Sridharan, therefore, submits that 
   



    several Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court conclude this issue.

<p id="p_81">    49)              Now, if one peruses the scheme of credit of duties paid on

    until the Notification was issued by the Government, the credit of these

    upon the words "the Cenvat Credit may be utilised for payment of any

    payment of duty on inputs or capital goods themselves if the further 
                          
    condition stipulated thereunder is satisfied".   The words "any duty of 

    excise on any final products" cannot be read in such a manner as to 
      


    enable cross utilisation.  This sub-rule does not support the argument of 
   



    Mr. Sridharan that in payment of additional duties under the 1957 Act, 

    the credit thereof can be obtained so as to enable payment of duty of 





    excise   specified   under   the   1978   Act.     Mr.   Sridharan's   argument,   as 

    already   held   above,   fails   to   take   note   of   the   fact   that   one   is   the 





    additional duty on goods of special importance, whereas later on is only 

    additional duty on textiles and textile articles.

    would not therefore affect the prior utilisation.  We are unable to agree

    with him because all throughout it has been clarified by the legislature

    1978,   Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act,

    said Acts.  That means the respective Acts.  The word "respectively" only 

    denotes   the   duties   of   excise   leviable   under   the   Additional   Duties   of 




                                          
    Excise   (Textiles   and   Textile   Articles)   Act,   1978,   Additional   Duties   of

    2001 and the additional duty under <a href="/doc/345301/" id="a_72">section 3</a> of the Customs Tariff Act, 

    1975.   Therefore, it is not as if  the  word "respectively" having been 
      


    inserted   that   the   position   prevailing   prior   to   the   said   insertion   or 
   



    introduction   was   not   the   same   but   different   and   distinct.     We   have 

    elaborated on this aspect in the foregoing paragraphs and by pointing 





    out that right from inception any cross utilisation was impermissible. 
</p>
<p id="p_129">    The   word   "respectively"   being   inserted   or   introduced   thus   does   not 





    make any difference.  Mr. Sridharan then relies upon the Cenvat Credit 

    Rules, 2002 and similar stipulation in Rule 3(3) and Rule 3(6) and the 

    insertion of the word "respectively".  However, for the reasons that we 

    have set out above, we do not think that any benefit or advantage can 

    be derived from the insertion or introduction of the word "respectively".

    reading of the Rule by the Tribunal in the case of  Reliance Industries  

    Limited (supra) was contrary to its plain language.  We do not see how

<p id="p_133">    We are of the opinion that independent of this order, the Appellant has 

    addressed   us   extensively   on   the   construction/interpretation   of   the

    unnecessary.  We also need not enter into the controversy as to whether 
                          
    the Tribunal erred in not following or applying its decision in the case of 

    Reliance Industries Limited and Ors.  while deciding the Appeals by the

    the   conclusion   as   above,   then,   we   are   not   required   to   go   into   this 
      


    question any further.   The inputs and the final product dealt with by 
   



    1957 Act and the 1978 Act are not one and the same.   This aspect is 

    clear   if   note   is   taken   of   the   nature   of   the   goods   specified   in   the 





    Schedules to these Acts.  As the title indicates one category is of goods 

    of special importance whereas the other is textiles and textile articles.

<p id="p_134">    The fact that these goods are separately and distinctly classified in the 

    Schedules   to   these   Acts   and   equally   in   the   Central   Excise   Tariff   is 

    enough to reject the submissions of the Appellant.

    referable   to   Sub-Rule   (1),   the   position   with   regard   to   availment   of 

    credit is spelt out by initial Notification No. 21 of 1999-CE (NT) dated 




                                                       
    28th February, 1999.  Once we have based our conclusions on a reading 

    of this and further Notifications following it so also the plain language 




                                          
    of the Rules, then, we do not see any force in this argument.   We are 
                         
    therefore of the opinion that there is no substance in the argument that 

    between   1st  March,   2002   to   9th  September,   2004   the   credit   of 
                        
    AED(T&amp;TA)   can   be   used   for   payment   of   any   of   the   specified   duty 

    referred to in Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 3.  Further, the non-obstante clause 
      


    appearing in Rule 3(6) is so worded because the entitlement to credit is 
   



    spelt out in Rule 3(1).   Thereafter, Rules 3(2) and 3(3) sets out the 

    mode and manner of availment thereof.  It is clarified by Rule 3(3) that 





    Cenvat Credit may be utilised for payment of any duty of excise on any 

    final products or for payment of duty on inputs or capital goods even if 





    the inputs are removed as such or after being partially procured or such 

    capital goods are removed in that State.  Hence, Rule 3(6) contains the 

    non-obstante clause and read as above.   It does not mean recourse to 

    Rule 3(3) is permissible for cross utilisation.

    on the goods specified in <a href="/doc/827932/" id="a_83">section 3(1)</a>.  Such broad and wide stipulation

    be derived from the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which 
                          
    holds that in the absence of any substantive provision, interest cannot 

    be levied and charged on delayed payment of tax.  We are of the view 
                         
    that   the   language   of   <a href="/doc/946858/" id="a_84">section   9A</a>   of   the   Customs   Tariff   Act   and 

    particularly <a href="/doc/946858/" id="a_85">section 9A(8)</a> and <a href="/doc/96321/" id="a_86">section 9(7A)</a> of the said Act cannot be of 
      


    any   assistance.     The   word   "interest"   specifically   having   not   been 
   



    included, the argument is that no interest was payable by the Appellant 

    on   AED(GSI)   paid   by   the   Appellants   by   utilisation   of   credit   of 





    AED(T&amp;TA).     Once   the   controversy   has   been   understood   in   proper 

    perspective and of lack of any provision in the statute enabling availing 





    of such credit between January, 2002 to April, 2003 and this utilisation 

    by   the   Appellant   was   held   to   be   illegal   by   concurrent   orders,   then, 

    interest   was   leviable.     We   have   found   that   no   such   plea   was   raised 

    before   the   Tribunal.     Apart   from   the   fact   that   it   was   not   so   raised,

           The rule in equity is that interest is payable even in the absence of 
           any agreement or custom to that effect though subject, of course, 




                                             
           to a contrary agreement (see Chitty on Contracts, Addition 1999, 
           Vol. II, Part 38-248, at page 712).  Interest in equity has been held 
                          
           to be payable on a market rate even though the deed contains no 
           mention of interest.  Applicability of the rule to award interest in 
           equity  is attracted  on  the  existence of  a state of  circumstances 
           being   established   which   justify   the   exercise   of   such   equitable

           deprived of the use of money to which he is legitimately entitled 
           has a right to be compensated for the deprivation by whatever 





           name it may  be called, viz.,  interest compensation or damages

           to award interest on the amount due under the contract and in 





           the   absence   of   any   other  prohibition,   the  arbitrator  can   award

            Whenever   called   upon   to   adjudicate,   the   Court   would   act   in 
            conjunction with what is the real and substantial justice.   The

            conferred on the party by suitably commanding the party liable 
            to do so.  Any opinion to the contrary would lead to unjust if not
