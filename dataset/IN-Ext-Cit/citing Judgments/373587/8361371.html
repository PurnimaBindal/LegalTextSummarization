        THE HON&#x27;BLE SRI JUSTICE B. KRISHNA MOHAN


                  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 219 OF 2013

JUDGMENT: (Per Hon&#x27;ble Sri Justice M.Satyanarayana Murthy)


       The accused - T.Amaranath, in Sessions Case No.330 of

2011 on the file of III Additional Sessions Judge (F.T.C),

Anantapur, preferred the present criminal appeal challenging

conviction and sentence passed against him for the offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_1">Sections 324</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">302</a> I.P.C to undergo

imprisonment for life and to pay fine of Rs.1,000/- in default to

suffer simple imprisonment of one month. Further, the accused

was also sentenced to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of

six months, while ordering both substantive sentences to run

concurrently.

       The case of the prosecution in nutshell is that, one

Jayakumar, aged 23 years S/o Suryanarayana, was the resident of

Narasimpalli, Tadimarri Mandal, while the accused - Amaranath

and one Sumathi - P.W.10, sister of the accused were also

residents of the same village. Jayakumar after completing his

studies at Anantapur, attended management of Brahmamgari

Temple, whereas the sister of accused Sumathi was studying X

Class in Rajendra Municipal High School, Anantapur by staying in

Balasamudram hostel. She completed her education one year

before the incident, she developed acquaintance with Jayakumar
                                 2


and both of them became close to each other, developed illicit

intimacy.

      Twenty days prior to the incident, Jayakumar came to

Narasimpalli to attend domestic work. While so, during broad day-

light at 12.30 noon, when P.W.10 - Sumathi was present alone in

her house, Jayakumar went to her house. Surprisingly, the

accused who went outside returned to the house and noticed the

presence of Jayakumar with Sumathi. Immediately, the accused

took the axe, dealt a blow on the rear side head of Jayakumar and

caused head injury. The accused also inflicted injuries on P.W.10 -

Sumathi, as a result, there was hue and cry in the house. On

hearing the cries, P.W.-1 V. Krishnamurthy and some others who

were present nearby the scene of offence, witnessed the accused

going away from the scene of incident holding the weapon used in

commission of offence (M.O.5). While leaving the scene of offence,

the accused yelled that, he caused death of brother-in-law of

P.W.1-V. Krishnamurthy. Immediately, P.W.1 and others entered

into the house and found the body of Jayakumar in pool of blood

with hack injuries and also noticed the presence of P.W.10 -

Sumathi with hack injuries, sitting near Jayakumar. Immediately,

P.W.1 -V. Krishnamurthy, P.W.5 - Srinivasulu, P.W.3 - Indiramma

and L.W-7 Ramalakshmamma shifted the injured Jayakumar to

R.D.T Hospital, Bathalapalli, where first aid was given to him and

from there, he was taken to Government General Hospital,

Anantapur, where Jayakumar succumbed to injuries on the same

day i.e. on 26.02.2011. The injured P.W.10 - Sumathi, was also

shifted to Government Hospital, Anantapur by her mother. On the
                                  3


complaint of P.W.1 - V.Krishna Murthy, Assistant Sub Inspector of

Tadipatri Police Station registered a case in Crime No. 5 of 2011

under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_3">Sections 324</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">302</a> of I.P.C, issued F.I.R and submitted

original F.I.R. to the jurisdictional Magistrate and concerned

higher officials of the Department.

      On receipt of copy of F.I.R., Inspector of Police, P.W-16 -

C.M.Gangaiah took up investigation, held inquest over the dead

body of Jayakumar on 27-02-2011 in the presence of inquest

panchayatdars viz., S.Venkateswara Prasad, D.Pullappa and

M.Kristappa (L.Ws 13 to 15). The Inspector visited the scene of

offence, during observation, seized piece of blood stained slab and

controlled earth from the scene of offence in the presence of

mediators P.Ramappa      (L.W -11) and D.Venkataramudu (P.W 8)

under the cover of mediator&#x27;s report dated 27-02-2011 drafted at

1-30 P.M. The dead body of Jayakumar was handed over to the

doctors to conduct autopsy. Dr.M.Babu - P.W-12 conducted

autopsy over the dead body of Jayakumar and issued Ex.P-5 - Post

Mortem Report opining that the cause of death was due to injuries

caused on the head of Jayakumar.

      The Inspector of Police examined P.Ws. 2 to 5 and 7,

observed the scene of offence in the presence of mediators, drawn

rough sketch of the scene of offence Ex.P-10. Later, the accused

was arrested on 01.03.2011 at 01:30 P.M and on interrogation, in

the presence of mediators B. Raghava Reddy and M. Golla Gopal

(LWs.16 &amp; 17), the accused confessed that he had committed the

offence and on the confession made by the accused, seized axe
                                   4


(M.O.5)   under    the   cover    of      Ex.P-8   seizure     mahazar

dated 01-03-2011 at 12-00 noon.

      P.W-16 Inspector C.M.Gangaiah collected maroon colour red

half sleeves shirt with black stripes with two pockets (M.O-1),

Yellow, Blue and sky colour full drawer (M.O-2), Polyster lungi

(M.O-3), Waist thread four rows red in colour          (M.O-4) from the

Government Hospital and blood stained black stone (M.O-6),

Control stone (M.O-7) and Red Bangle piece of P.W-10 (M.O-8)

Science Laboratory for examination along with letter of advice

(Ex.P-11), received R.F.S.L Report-Ex.P12.

      After collecting the entire material including, post-mortem

examination report-Ex.P-5 and FSL Report-Ex.P-12, Inspector of

Police,   Madanapalle     filed       charge   sheet      against   the

accused/appellant, having come to the conclusion that the

accused caused injuries on the body of Jayakumar, which resulted

in his death, with an intention to kill him, having knowledge that

those injuries would cause death in ordinary course of events and

also for causing injuries on the body of P.W-10 - Sumathi who is

none other than his sister, having found her with the company of

Jayakumar. The case was taken on file for the offences under

<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_5">Sections 324</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">302</a> IPC by the Judicial Magistrate of First Class,

Dharmavaram and registered the same as P.R.C No.16 of 2011.

The Judicial Magistrate of First Class committed the case to the

Sessions Division, Anantapur, as the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a>

IPC is exclusively triable by Court of Sessions. The Principal

Sessions Judge, Anantapur, registered the same as Sessions Case
                                      5


No.330 of 2011 and later made over the same to III Additional

District and Sessions Judge (FTC), Anantapur.

      On securing the presence of the accused, upon hearing, the

learned Additional Public Prosecutor and the Defence Counsel, the

Sessions Court framed charge against the accused/appellant for

the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_8">Sections 324</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">302</a> IPC, read over

and explained to him in Telugu, he pleaded not guilty and claimed

to be tried.

      During trial, the prosecution has examined PWs. 1 to 16 and

got marked Exs.P-1 to P-12, M.Os.1 to 8 to substantiate the case

of the prosecution. After closure of prosecution evidence, the

accused was examined under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C, explained the

incriminating material that appeared against him in testimony of

prosecution witness and he denied the same, on behalf of the

accused D.W-1 was examined and                marked Exs.D-1 to D-10      in

defence.

      Upon      hearing   argument       of    learned   Additional   Public

Prosecutor and Defence Counsel, the Court below found the

accused guilty for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_11">Sections 324</a> and

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">302</a> IPC, convicted and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment

for life and to pay fine of Rs.1,000/- in default to suffer simple

imprisonment of one month.

      Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence passed by the

Court below in Sessions Case No.330 of 2011, the present appeal

is preferred.

      The main grounds urged are that, the Trial Court placed

reliance on the oral evidence of P.Ws.1 to 11 erroneously, while
                                   6


ignoring the material discrepancies in their evidence, which are

sufficient to discard the testimony. Similarly, P.W.1 gave an

exaggerated version in his evidence before the Court that there are

material omissions in Ex.P-1, in the previous statement recorded

under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_13">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C. Giving credence to the oral evidence

of P.W.1, who is relative of the deceased, is an apparent error,

committed by the Trial Court. It is also further contended that

recovery of M.O-5 under the cover of seizure panchanama Ex.P-8

by P.W.10 on the confession leading to discovery is not substantive

evidence, but the evidence adduced by the prosecution appears to

be artificial. The prosecution also failed to establish that the injury

found on the body of the deceased Jayakumar and P.W.10

Sumathi was caused with an axe M.O.5, allegedly recovered by

P.W.10 under the cover of Ex.P-8 and thereby, M.O.5 cannot be

connected to the offence. It is urged in the grounds of appeal that,

the Trial Court also ignored the medical evidence, since it is

consistent that no incised wound was found on the body of the

deceased Jayakumar and P.W.10 - Sumathi and such injury could

not have been caused with M.O.5.       The Trial Court also ignored

Exs.D-5 to D-10 to establish plea of the accused that he was living

in a different house and therefore, the Trial Court committed a

serious error in appreciation of the evidence and erroneously found

the accused guilty and requested to set-aside the same.

      During hearing, Smt. Vasundhara Reddy, learned counsel

appearing for the appellant/accused mainly contended that, the

presence of P.W.1 at the time when the accused was leaving the

scene of offence holding the axe M.O.5 after allegedly causing
                                   7


death of Jayakumar is improbable and unbelievable, for the reason

that, the rough sketch of the scene of offence marked as Ex.P-10

did not disclose the residence of P.W.1, who is claiming to be the

neighbour of the accused, having heard the cries of the deceased

on receipt of injuries. When Ex.P-10 does not disclose the house of

P.W.11, question of hearing cries from the scene of offence, cannot

be believed and it improbablises the evidence of P.W.1. That too,

hearing cries and noticing the accused, leaving the scene of offence

holding the axe M.O.5, while yelling that he killed his brother-in-

law, Jayakumar, cannot be believed.

      It is further contended that, there is material improvement

and the omission to state that P.W-1 directly witnessed the

incident of giving second blow with M.O-5 is sufficient to disbelieve

the version of P.W-1, since it is an improved version, suddenly

developed during trial. On the basis of such unreasonable witness,

the conviction cannot be recorded and requested to set-aside the

conviction.

      The     learned   counsel   for   the   appellant/accused,   in

alternative, submitted that the injuries caused on the head of

deceased Jayakumar are fractured wounds and they could be

caused only with blunt side of the axe - M.O-5. Even otherwise,

the accused allegedly took out the axe suddenly when he saw

Jayakumar in the company of his unmarried sister, as both

Jayakumar and P.W.10 - Sumathi were in love with each other,

the accused grew wild on seeing them together, in sudden and

grave provocation, he caused those injuries with no intention to

kill them. Therefore, at best, the incident if proved, would attract
                                   8


the offence punishable under Part-II of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_14">Section 304</a> I.P.C and relied

on several judgments in support of contentions, both main and

alternative contentions and they will be referred at appropriate

stage while deciding the points for determination.

      Whereas,    the   learned       Additional   Public   Prosecutor

Sri Dushyanth Reddy supported the judgment of the Trial Court in

all respects, while contending that the evidence of P.W.16 with

regard to finding house of P.W.2 nearby the scene of offence, he

simply stated that the house was not shown in Ex.P-10 rough

sketch and that indicates that the house of P.W.1, though in

existence being a neighbour to the scene of offence, it was not

shown. Therefore, mere failure to show the house of P.W.1 is not a

ground to discard the evidence of P.W.1, more particularly, about

noticing the accused while coming from the scene of offence

holding the axe M.O.5, while yelling that he killed the brother-in-

law of P.W.1.

      Yet, another contention raised by the learned counsel for the

appellant is that, Ex.P-1 is only information to the police about

commission of cognizable offence and it need not contain minute

details of the manner of occurrence. Therefore, omission to

mention the exact person witnessing the incident while the

accused giving second blow on the head with M.O-5 cannot be

treated as a material omission and when oral evidence is

consistent before the Trial Court, the Court cannot brand him as

wholly unreliable witness. Therefore, the evidence on record is

suffice to support the judgment of the Trial Court, holding that the

accused committed an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">Sections 302</a> and
                                   <a href="/doc/1977541/" id="a_16">9</a>


<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_17">324</a> I.P.C and requested to confirm the conviction and sentence

passed by the learned III Additional Sessions Judge (FTC),

Anantapur in Sessions Case No.330 of 2011 dated 15.02.2013.

      Considering   rival   contentions,    perusing   the   material

available on record, the points that arise for determination are as

follows:

      1)    Whether the accused caused injury on the body of
            Jayakumar with an intention to kill him, knowing
            that the injuries caused on his head with the axe
            M.O-5, allegedly are sufficient to cause death in
            normal course of events?

      2)    Whether the accused caused any injuries on the
            body of P.W.10 - Sumathi with a dangerous
            weapon.    If   so,   whether    the   conviction   and
            sentence passed by the learned III Additional
            Sessions Judge (FTC), Anantapur against the
            accused be sustained under Sessions Case No.330
            of 2011 dated 15.02.2013?

      <a href="/doc/1903086/" id="a_18">Section 374</a> Cr.P.C conferred a substantive right of appeal

on the accused who is convicted by the Trial Court and this Court

while exercising power under <a href="/doc/929532/" id="a_19">Section 374(2)</a> Cr.P.C is bound to

re-appraise entire evidence to come to an independent conclusion,

uninfluenced by the findings recorded by the Court below and

decide the legality of conviction and sentence passed by the

Sessions Court. Hence, it is the duty of this Court to re-appraise

entire evidence recorded by the Court below after giving an

opportunity to both the parties, i.e accused and the respondent,</pre>

<p id="p_1">unless the Court finds manifest perversity in the calendar and

judgment or such findings were recorded without evidence,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    10</span>


normally, this Court cannot interfere with such fact findings in

appeal, while exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/929532/" id="a_20">Section 374(2)</a> Cr.P.C.

It is the sacrosanct duty of the appellate court, while sitting in

appeal against the judgment of the trial Judge, to be satisfied that

the guilt of the accused has been established beyond all reasonable

doubt after proper re-assessment, re-appreciation and re-scrutiny

of the material on record. Appreciation of evidence and proper re-

assessment to arrive at the conclusion is imperative in a criminal

appeal. That is the quality of exercise which is expected of the

appellate court to be undertaken and when that is not done, the

cause of justice is not sub-served, for neither an innocent person

should be sent to prison without his fault nor a guilty person

should be let off despite evidence on record to assure his guilt (vide

<a href="/doc/60940407/" id="a_21">Kamlesh Prabhudas Tanna &amp; Anr v. State Of Gujarat1</a>). Keeping

the scope of <a href="/doc/929532/" id="a_22">Section 374(2)</a> Cr.P.C we would like to re-appreciate

entire evidence on record to come to an independent conclusion,

uninfluenced by the findings recorded by the Court below.


P O I N T No.1:
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">          The case of prosecution is totally based on circumstantial

evidence, since the incident allegedly took place in the house of the

accused/appellant and it is never the case of the prosecution that

the incident was witnessed by any witness. It is the obligation of

prosecution to establish each and every circumstance to complete

the chain of circumstances pointing out the guilt towards the

accused/appellant and inconsistent with the innocence.

        When the case is based on circumstantial evidence, burden of

proof is always on the prosecution to prove all the circumstances

from which conclusion of guilt is to be drawn must be fully

established and the facts so established must be consistent with

hypothesis of guilt of accused and any circumstance consistent

with innocence of accused, he is entitled to benefit of doubt. (vide

<a href="/doc/955616/" id="a_23">Kishore Chand v. State of Himachal Pradesh2</a>)

           The Apex Court while discussing the scope of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_24">Section 3</a> of

the Evidence Act, more particularly, circumstantial evidence held

that, in a case of murder when the prosecution relying on

circumstantial evidence, it is for the prosecution to prove all the

incriminating facts and circumstances and the circumstances

which are incompatible with innocence of the accused to draw

inference of guilt and such evidence should be tested by touch-

stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by

Supreme Court (vide <a href="/doc/883109/" id="a_25">Syed Hakkim &amp; another v. State3</a>)

           Similarly, in <a href="/doc/1964010/" id="a_26">G.Parshwanath v. State of Karnataka4</a>, the

Supreme Court is of the view, when the case of the prosecution is

based on proof of circumstantial evidence on the basis of which

conclusion of guilt is drawn must be fully established fully,

individual chain of circumstances must be complete pointing out

the guilt of accused, all proved facts must lead to inference of guilt

of the accused alone and court has to draw distinction between

primary and basic facts while appreciating the circumstances and

regard must be had to common course of natural events and

human conduct and finally the facts established                       should be

consistent only with hypothesis of guilt of accused and it does not

mean that each and every hypothesis suggested by the accused

must be excluded by proved facts. In Rukia Begum Vs. State of

      The case of prosecution, as narrated above is based on both

direct and circumstantial evidence. The direct evidence available

on record is the evidence of P.W-1, who is none other than brother-

in-law of the deceased Jayakumar and neighbour of accused and

P.W-10 Sumathi. The house of P.W-1 and scene of offence are

separated by a hayrick yard. The basis for registration of crime is

Ex.P-1 on 26.02.2011, where P.W-1 clearly mentioned that there

was love affair between the deceased Jayakumar and P.W.10

Sumathi due to acquaintance at Anantapur, while she was

studying X Class by staying in a hostel, he used to visit the hostel

to see her. Therefore, the affair between the deceased Jayakumar

and P.W-10 Sumathi is not in much controversy. However, it is

only one of the circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      According to Ex.P-1, on 26.02.2011, in the early hours when

P.W-1 took his cattle for grazing and returned in the afternoon at

12:30 noon and while tethering cattle, he heard cries from the

house of the accused and P.W-10 - Sumathi. Immediately, he ran

to the house of the accused and P.W-10 on hearing the cries,

noticed that the accused came out from the house with an axe

M.O-5 and running on the road. Immediately, P.W-1 entered into

the house and found his brother-in-law Jayakumar lying in pool of

blood in supine position, whereas, P.W-10 Sumathi was sitting

with the support of the wall in the room with a bleeding injury on

her head. Immediately, his co-brother Pathipati Sreenivasulu and

his wife Indiramma and co-brother&#x27;s wife Ramalakshmamma and

Krishnaveni came there and they shifted the injured Jayakumar in

an auto to R.D.T. Hospital, Bathalapalli.   There, the doctor gave
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  14</span>


first aid to Jayakumar and thereafter, shifted to Government

General Hospital, Anantapur at about 3:30 P.M, and Jayakumar

succumbed to injuries at 4:00 P.M while undergoing treatment on

the same day. In the report to the police, P.W-1 did not state

anything about witnessing the second blow given on the head of

Jayakumar by the accused. Whereas, in his statement recorded

under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_30">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C, P.W.1 did not disclose about

witnessing the incident i.e, causing second blow on the head of the

deceased, except stating that, on hearing cries from the house of

accused and P.W-10 Sumathi, he immediately ran into the house

of the accused and there he noticed the accused coming out of the

house holding an axe M.O-5 and running on the road holding the

axe M.O-5, while saying that he killed the brother-in-law of P.W-1.

The statement of P.W-1 recorded under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_31">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C is

replica of his statement vide Ex.P-1.       Ex.D-1 is part of the

statement i.e contradiction marked in the evidence of P.W-1. There

is a material improvement in the evidence of P.W-1 regarding,

witnessing the incident of causing a blow on the head of

Jayakumar.    In   examination-in-chief,   P.W.1   stated   that,   on

26.02.2011, at 12:30 noon when he returned home after grazing

his cattle and tethering them in the shed, he heard cries from the

house of the accused and the house of the accused is separated by

hayrick yard, suspecting that it is the voice of his brother-in-law

Jayakumar, P.W-1 rushed to the house of the accused, saw the

accused coming out from the house with an axe- M.O.5 and

reached the main entrance door of his house, the accused stated to

P.W-1 that &quot;RAI NEE BAVAMARIDINI CHAMPINANU CHOOSUKO
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                   15</span>


PORA&quot; (in vernacular). Immediately, P.W.1 entered into the house

of the accused, after the accused went out and saw the body of

Jayakumar lying in pool of blood with injuries on the backside of

the head, whereas, P.W-10 Sumathi was also present at the scene

of offence in the room with bleeding injuries on the left side of her

head. Thereafter, Indiramma and others came there. Hence, the

consistent evidence of P.W-1 in the examination-in-chief is that, he

just witnessed the incident while the accused leaving the scene of

offence holding M.O-5 in his hand. But, in the cross-examination,

there is a clear improvement i.e. witnessing the second blow given

on the head of deceased Jayakumar by the accused with M.O-5 -

axe. The specific sentence in the cross-examination is extracted

hereunder for better appreciation of the case:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       &quot;On hearing the cries, I immediately entered in the house
       of accused, by that time the accused already hacked on
       the head of deceased and I saw when the accused
       hacking 2nd time on the head of deceased.&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_7">


</p><p id="p_8">      This piece of evidence is a clear improvement in the evidence

of P.W-1 about witnessing the incident of second blow dealt with

by the accused on the head of the deceased Jayakumar. If really,

P.W-1 witnessed the incident while dealing with the second blow

by the accused on the head of Jayakumar, atleast he would have

stated the same either in the statement recorded by the police

during investigation or in Ex.P-1 Police Report. Though Ex.P-1 is

only an information given to the police about commission of a

cognizable offence, it need not contain minute details of the

incident. Therefore, omission of mentioning about witnessing the

incident of dealing with the second blow by the accused on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 16</span>


head of Jayakumar by itself is not a ground to brush aside the

evidence of P.W-1 with regard to witnessing the incident. However,

when he was examined by the police and recorded his statement,

atleast he would have stated about witnessing the second blow

given on the head of Jayakumar by the accused, which is a

material fact, which throws light on the complicity of the accused.

But, he did not state anything in the statement recorded by the

police under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_32">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C. This omission goes to the root

of the case. More curiously, even in examination-in-chief of P.W-1,

he did not state anything about witnessing the incident while

dealing with the second blow by the accused on the head of

Jayakumar. But, suddenly, the case of prosecution was improved

in the cross-examination. Therefore, failure to mention about

witnessing the incident i.e dealing with the second blow on the

head of Jayakumar by the accused is a material fact, which throws

light on the complicity of the accused. But, failure to mention the

material fact either in the statement before the police, recorded

under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_33">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C creates any amount of suspicion or

doubt on the veracity of the testimony of the witness, more

particularly, when it is a sudden improvement in the cross-

examination. Hence, the evidence of P.W-1 with regard to

witnessing the incident while dealing with the second blow on the

head of Jayakumar by the accused is highly doubtful and it cannot

be believed, except to the incident of noticing the accused coming

out from the house, holding M.O-5, running on the road while

yelling that he killed the brother-in-law of P.W-1 and asking him to

go and see him. Therefore, the direct evidence of P.W-1 regarding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  17</span>


witnessing the incident while the accused dealing with the second

blow on the head of Jayakumar is not believable, except this part

of evidence, no other direct evidence is available on record. Hence,

the consistent evidence of P.W.1 witnessing the accused while

leaving scene of offence, holding an axe while yelling that he killed

his brother-in-law and to go and see can be believed.

        Injury Nos.1 and 2 noted in the external examination are

corresponding to Injury Nos. 3 &amp; 4 noted in the post mortem

examination. The doctor also found diffused contusion of 17x12

cms and 26x17 cms. But, these two injuries are different from the

Injury Nos. 3 &amp; 4 of external injuries. Therefore, the internal

injuries found on the body of Jayakumar are five in number.

According to the evidence of P.W-1, only the accused dealt with two

blows with an axe and witnessed the second blow. But, how the

other three injuries were found during post mortem examination

was not explained. On overall consideration of oral evidence of

improvement in the cross-examination of P.W-1, his previous

statement recorded under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_34">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C, admissible

portion marked as Ex.D-1, contents of Ex.P-1 and medical

evidence, it is difficult to accept the evidence of P.W-1 witnessing

the incident directly, while accepting part of his testimony to the

extent of accused leaving the scene of offence, holding an axe

M.O.5, while yelling that he killed brother-in-law of P.W.1. Hence,

the evidence of P.W-1 with regard to witnessing the incident

directly is disbelieved.

</p><p id="p_21">        The other evidence available on record is circumstantial

evidence. The Court can record conviction of the accused if these

circumstances complete the links in the chain of circumstances.

</p><p id="p_22">        The following are the circumstances the prosecution relied

upon:
</p>
<p id="p_23">   1. Acquaintance between the deceased- Jayakumar and P.W.10

</p><p id="p_24">        - Sumathi and love affair between them, finding them

        together at the scene of offence.
</p>
<p id="p_25">   2. Accused running from the scene of offence holding the axe

        M.O-5 while asking P.W.1 to go and see as he killed his

        brother-in-law and noticing the same by P.W.1.

</p><p id="p_26">   3. Sustaining injuries by P.W-10 Sumathi and her statement

        recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_35">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C by the Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_27">   4. Seizure of M.O-1 on the confession leading to discovery after

        arrest of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
        If, the above circumstances cumulatively prove the guilt of

the accused unerringly pointing out his complicity without giving

any reasonable hypothesis, incompatible with the innocence of the

accused, the Court can record conviction of the accused, in view of

the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the judgments

referred supra. In view of the law declared by the Apex Court, we

would like to discuss about the circumstances which the

prosecution relied upon.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        The first circumstance is, developing illicit contact by the

accused - Jayakumar and P.W.10 - Sumathi due to love affair. The

evidence of P.Ws. 1,2 and 3 is consistent to establish that they had

acquaintance     with   each     other   when   they were   staying   in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                  21</span>


Anantapur and developed love affair between them, so also, illicit

contact. Their evidence is also supported by the fact that the love

affair was reported to the father of the deceased - Jayakumar and

chastised him, but for no use. When the accused who is the

brother of P.W-10 - Sumathi, saw both the deceased - Jayakumar

and P.W-10 - Sumathi together, he allegedly caused hack injuries

with axe - M.O.5.    Causing death of Jayakumar and sustaining

injuries by P.W.10 - Sumathi is not in dispute. Similarly, the scene

of offence, which is situated in the house of P.W.10 is not disputed,

so also, the homicidal death of Jayakumar. But only the defence

set-up by the accused is that, when Jayakumar entered into the

house and molested P.W.10 - Sumathi, she raised cries and

neighbours came to save P.W.10 and beat Jayakumar, which

resulted in his death. This aspect was spoken by P.W-10, but it is

clear from the material that was not substantiated by any amount

of evidence. But, her testimony is consistent as to causing death at

the scene of offence. Therefore, it is clear from the evidence on

record that there was no dispute with regard to affair between

Jayakumar and P.W.10 - Sumathi.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      The second circumstance relied on by the prosecution is,

death of Jayakumar in the house of the accused and P.W.10 -

Sumathi. But, there is a dispute with regard to the ownership of

the house which is not relevant at this stage. Undisputedly, the

death took place in the house where P.W.10 - Sumathi, her mother

and allegedly the accused are living together. When the death took

place in the house of the accused, it is for the accused to explain

as to how the incident took place. But, P.W.10 - Sumathi gave a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                  22</span>


different version which is contrary to her previous statement

recorded by the Magistrate, so also the statement recorded by the

police during investigation under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_36">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C.       Her

evidence cannot be believed for the simple reason that, she did not

disclose atleast the names of the neighbours who caused injuries

on her head and also on the body of Jayakumar. When the

neighbours entered into the house and caused such injuries,

atleast she could have identified the neighbours and disclosed

their names who caused injuries on her body and on the body of

Jayakumar. If, really neighours caused injuries on the body of

Jayakumar, they ought not to have caused injury on the body of

P.W.10.   She being sister of the accused resiled from her earlier

statement before the police, so also before the Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_31">      In the cross-examination, P.W.10- Sumathi denied the entire

incident but, the statement recorded by the police under

<a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_37">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C, is confronted to her. However, about

sustaining injury by her is supported by her oral evidence and so

also, wound certificate marked as Ex.P-6, coupled with the

evidence of Dr. Sayeedanna - P.W.13.        Therefore, P.W.10 is a

witness supporting the case of the defence, being an unmarried

sister of the accused and consequently, her testimony is rejected

while accepting that she received injury in the same incident where

Jayakumar was murdered. When the incident occurred inside the

house of the accused, which is not accessible to any other person,

except the accused or the inmates, it is for the defence to explain

as to how death took place. But, P.W.10 gave a different version to

avoid conviction of her brother which is totally contrary to her
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                      23</span>


previous statement recorded under <a href="/doc/1383769/" id="a_38">Section 161(3)</a> Cr.P.C, so also

statement recorded by the Magistrate. According to <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_39">Section 106</a> of

the Evidence Act, when a person does an act with some intention

other than that which the character and circumstances of the act

suggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon him. The

explanation offered by P.W.10 was not satisfactory, for the reason

that, no suggestion was put to P.W.1 that the neighbours came

and caused injuries on the body of Jayakumar and P.W.10 -

Sumathi. It is an afterthought when P.W.10 entered into the

witness box.

be a corresponding burden on the inmates of the house to give

           house and when the father of the accused was found
           dead, it was for the accused to offer an explanation as to

           could not offer any explanation as to the homicidal death
           of his father, it is a strong circumstance against the

exact happening of incident as accused himself would have special

knowledge of incident and thus, would have burden of proof as

           proof is on the prosecution to bring sufficient evidence
           pointing towards guilt of the accused. However, in case of

      Though P.W-10 made an attempt to make believe the

explanation offered by her, it is not plausible and reasonable to

find the accused not guilty. Therefore, disbelieving the evidence of

P.W-10, an inference can be drawn that the injuries were caused

by the accused when he found his sister P.W-10 Sumathi in the

company of Jayakumar, even without marriage, in a sudden and

grave provocation, took out axe - M.O-5 from the house itself and

caused injuries. Therefore, non-explanation or failure to explain

satisfactorily as to how Jayakumar and P.W-10 Sumathi received

injuries is another strong circumstance which completes links in

the chain of circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_40">      The other circumstance relied on by the prosecution is that,

noticing the accused running, after he came out from his house,

holding the axe M.O-5 with blood stains, while yelling to P.W-1 to

go and see as he killed his brother-in-law Jayakumar. If, really he

was not the person who caused injuries on the body of Jayakumar

and P.W-10 - Sumathi, he would not have come out from his

house holding the blood stained axe M.O-5 and run on the road.

This fact is substantiated by evidence of P.W.1 and corroborated by

evidence of P.Ws. 2 &amp; 3, who directly witnessed while the accused

was running on the road holding the blood stained axe M.O-5,

from the scene of offence. In the entire cross-examination of PWs.1

to 3, nothing could be elicited by the learned counsel for the

Defence before the Trial Court to disprove the strong circumstance

relied on by the prosecution i.e. the accused coming out from the

scene of offence holding blood stained axe M.O-5, while yelling to

P.W-1 to go and see as he killed his brother-in-law Jayakumar.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                    26</span>


Hence, P.Ws.1 to 3 categorically testified about the accused coming

out from the scene of offence holding the blood stained axe M.O-5,

while yelling to P.W-1 to go and see as he killed his brother-in-law

Jayakumar. This proved circumstance is also directly connecting

the accused with the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      The last circumstance relied on by the prosecution is,

recovery of M.O-5 on the basis of confession leading to discovery

after arrest. P.W.16 is the Inspector of Police who along with the

mediators B. Raghava Reddy and M. Golla Gopal reached

Malyavantham Village bus stop at 9:00 A.M on 01.03.2011, found

the accused, surrounded and arrested him at Malyavantham

village bus stop in the presence of mediators. He was interrogated

in the presence of mediators and reduced the same into writing.

Ex.P-7 is the admissible portion of confessional statement. But, in

the cross-examination of the mediator, nothing was elicited to

discredit and his testimony with regard to the confession made by

the accused, leading to discovery of crime weapon M.O-5.

Similarly, seizure of M.O-5 under the cover of Ex.P-8 Mediators

report is also established by the prosecution beyond reasonable

doubt.

Balaprasanna12</a>, the Apex Court held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">               &quot;Law is well settled that the prosecution while relying upon the
               confessional statement leading to discovery of articles under
               <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_51">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, has to prove through cogent
               evidence that the statement has been made voluntarily and
               leads to discovery of the relevant facts. The scope and ambit of
               <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_52">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act had been stated and restated in
               several decisions of the Supreme Court. However, in almost all
               such decisions reference is made to the observations of the
               Privy Council in <a href="/doc/254739/" id="a_53">Pulukuri Kotayya vs. Emperor</a>, AIR 1947 PC 67.
               At one time it was held that the expression &#x27;fact discovered&#x27; in
               the second is restricted to a physical or material fact which can
               be perceived by the senses, and that it does not include a
               mental fact, now it is fairly settled that the expression &#x27;fact
               discovered&#x27; includes not only the physical object produced, but
               also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of
               the accused as to this, as noted in Pulukuri Kotayya&#x27;s case. The
               various requirements of the section can be summed up as
               follows:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">          1)   The fact of which evidence is sought to be given must be
               relevant to the issue. It must be borne in mind that the
               provision has nothing to do with the question of relevancy. The
               relevancy of the fact discovered must be established according
               to the prescriptions relating to relevancy of other evidence
               connecting it with the crime in order to make the fact
               discovered admissible.

</p><p id="p_47">      In view of the principle laid down in the above decision,

when a fact is discovered in pursuance of confession leading to

discovery is only relevant piece of evidence, but it is not a

substantive piece of evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_48">      As the evidence of P.W-16 is consistent as to confession

leading to discovery and recovery of M.O-5 from the irrigation well,

in the garden of Linganadu at 12 noon on 01.03.2011 in the

presence of mediators is acceptable, for the simple reason that,

throwing of M.O-5 an axe with iron blade and it will not float on

the water. Therefore, confession leading to discovery and recovery

of M.O-5 is another circumstance to enrope the accused drawing

inference that the accused alone is the person who caused injuries

on the body of Jayakumar and P.W-10 Sumathi.                    P.W.10 is no

other than the sister of the accused and her statement before the

police under <a href="/doc/357596/" id="a_54">Section 161(3)</a> and the statement recorded by the

Magistrate, but those statements were recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_55">Section 164</a>

Cr.P.C are consistent. But, no evidentiary value can be attached to

those statements, as she resiled from her earlier statements and

that too, they were recorded in the absence of the accused and the

accused had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness.

However, the prosecution could establish that the accused was the

person who caused injuries on Jayakumar and P.W-10 while they

were alone in the house due to love affair.
</p>
<p id="p_49">      One of the major contentions raised in this appeal which

directly throws light on the probative value of the evidence of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                         29</span>


witnesses is the discrepancies pointed out by the learned counsel

for the appellant, may at best lead this Court to disbelieve directly

witnessing the incident dealing with the second blow with M.O-5

on the head of the deceased, but, not sufficient to acquit the

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_50">          The alternative submissions made by the learned counsel for

the appellant is that, in case the Court believed the evidence of

witnesses on record and concludes that the accused is the person

who caused injuries and his conviction is to be altered from

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_56">Section 302</a> I.P.C to <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_57">Section 304</a> Part-II I.P.C, since he had no

intention to cause death, as the injuries found on the head of the

deceased are only fracture injuries, which could be caused only

with blunt side of axe, in a sudden and grave provocation when he

suddenly noticed the presence of Jayakumar and P.W-10 -

Sumathi due to their love affair and relied on the judgment of the

Apex        Court       in   <a href="/doc/831184/" id="a_58">Surinder   Kumar   v.   Union   Territory,

Chandigarh13</a>, where the Apex Court held that, if on a sudden

quarrel, a person in the heat of the moment picks up a weapon

which is handy and causes injuries out of which only one proves

fatal, he would be entitled to the benefit of the exception provided

he has not acted cruelly. The Apex Court held that the number of

wounds caused during the occurrence in such a situation was not

the decisive factor. What was important was that the occurrence

had taken place on account of a sudden and unpremeditated fight

and the offender must have acted in a fit of anger. Dealing with the

provision of Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_59">Section 300</a>, the Apex Court observed:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">13</span>

      &quot;......To invoke this exception four requirements must be

      satisfied, namely,

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">         (i)     it was a sudden fight;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">         (ii)    there was no premeditation;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">         (iii)   the act was done in a heat of passion; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">         (iv)    the assailant had not taken any undue advantage
                 or acted in a cruel manner. The cause of the
                 quarrel is not relevant nor is it relevant who offered
                 the provocation or started the assault. The number
                 of wounds caused during the occurrence is not a
                 decisive factor, but what is important is that the
                 occurrence    must       have   been   sudden     and
                 unpremeditated and the offender must have acted
                 in a fit of anger. Of course, the offender must not
                 have taken any undue advantage or acted in cruel
                 manner. Where, on a sudden quarrel, a person in
                 the heat of the moment picks up a weapon which is
                 handy and causes injuries, one of which proves
                 fatal, he would be entitled to the benefit of this
                 exception provided he has not acted cruelly.&quot;

P.W-10 Sumathi in the company of Jayakumar in his house, the

accused suddenly caused injuries on the head of Jayakumar

(deceased) with M.O-5. Till then, the accused had no intention to

cause grave injuries or to kill Jayakumar (deceased). In such case,

when the accused had no intention to cause death of Jayakumar

(deceased), as the accused had no premeditation and came with a

weapon, but suddenly in spur of moment, in grave and sudden

provocation, suspected and caused injury with M.O-5. Such act

would attract exception No.1 of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_61">Section 300</a> and liable to be

punished, it would fall within <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_62">Section 300(1)</a> IPC, though the

injuries are on vital part.

murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Here, it

was not the case of the prosecution at any stage that the accused

intentionally killed Jayakumar (deceased). But, the only reason for

causing fatal injuries on the head of Jayakumar (deceased) which

lead to his death is that accused/appellant found P.W-10 Sumathi

in the company of Jayakumar in his house. In such case, the case

of prosecution would fall under Part-II of Section 304 I.P.C.

</p><p id="p_65">           When accused had no pre-meditation to kill deceased or

cause any bodily harm or injury to deceased, everything happened

on spur of moment, possibility of accused losing self control on

seizing the company of deceased with P.W.10 cannot be ruled out

and in such case the accused is liable to be convicted under

Section 304 Part II instead of <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_64">Section 302</a> of I.P.C (vide

<a href="/doc/803279/" id="a_65">Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt v. State of Gujarat14</a>). In the

facts of the above decision, the deceased was working in the house

of accused as a maid.               As she was absent from duties, accused

visited her house asking her to rejoin duty and when she refused

to join duty, altercation ensued between them.              Then, accused

allegedly picked can of kerosene lying nearby, poured kerosene on

the deceased and lit fire on her body, which resulted in death of

servant-maid.            The incident occurred only due to utterances

between the accused and deceased and not pre-meditated to kill

the deceased or cause injury over the body of deceased, thereby

the Apex Court concluded that the accused is liable to be convicted

for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_66">Section 304</a> Part-II of Indian

Penal Code.

      Thus, the view expressed by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in

Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt27 referred supra, is a little bit

conflicting, but the Larger bench judgment in Gurdial Singh and

others29 referred supra, is totally in consonance with the principle

laid down in the decision Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt27.

However, the Larger bench judgment is binding on the Courts.

</p><p id="p_68">      The Court should proceed to decide the pivotal question of

intention, with care and caution, as that will decide whether the

case falls under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_67">Section 302</a> or 304 Part I or 304 Part II. Many

petty or insignificant matters plucking of a fruit, straying of cattle,

quarrel of children, utterance of a rude word or even an

objectionable glance, may lead to altercations and group clashes

culminating in deaths. Usual motives like revenge, greed, jealousy

or suspicion may be totally absent in such cases. There may be no

intention. There may be no pre-meditation. In fact, there may not

even be criminality. At the other end of the spectrum, there may be

cases of murder where the accused attempts to avoid the penalty

for murder by attempting to put forth a case that there was no

intention to cause death. It is for the courts to ensure that the

cases of murder punishable under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_68">Section 302</a>, are not converted

into offences punishable under Section 304 Part I/II, or cases of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder, are treated as murder

punishable under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_69">Section 302</a>. The intention to cause death can

be gathered generally from a combination of a few or several of the

following, among other, circumstances. To decide whether that the

accused caused injuries with an intention to kill deceased, certain

      In the present facts of the case, perusal of nature of incident,

weapon used in commission of the offence, it is consistent case

from the beginning that, when the accused returned to the scene of

offence, he found both Jayakumar and P.W-10 - Sumathi together

due to their affair and on seeing the same, due to sudden

provocation, picked up the weapon from the house itself and it was

not carried along with him, though the accused had no intention to

kill Jayakumar. Hence, applying the principles laid down in the

above judgment, we find that the accused is guilty for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_71">Section 304</a> Part-II I.P.C. In such case, the case

of prosecution would fall under Part-II of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_72">Section 304</a> IPC.

</p><p id="p_79">      As per our discussion, the accused caused injury on the

body of P.W-10 - Sumathi, which is grave in nature and therefore,

he is liable for punishment for the offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_73">Section 324</a> I.P.C. The Trial Court rightly convicted the accused

for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_74">Section 324</a> I.P.C, while

committing an error in finding the accused guilty for the offence

punishable   under    <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_75">Section   302</a>   I.P.C   and   sentencing   him

erroneously, for the simple reason that the incident was not taken

into consideration including the use of axe M.O-5 on its blunt side

to cause injury on the head of Jayakumar. Hence, the conviction

and sentence passed by the Trial Court against the accused for the

offence punishable under Section 302 I.P.C is set-aside, while

holding that the accused guilty for the offence punishable under

Section 304 Part-II I.P.C and sentenced him to undergo rigorous

imprisonment for a period of seven (07) years, while maintaining

the fine imposed by the Trial Court, so also the sentence imposed

against the accused for the offence punishable under Section 324

I.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_80">         In the result, the criminal appeal is partly allowed, setting

aside the conviction and sentence in Sessions Case No.330 of 2011

(FTC), Anantapur, finding the accused not guilty for the offence
