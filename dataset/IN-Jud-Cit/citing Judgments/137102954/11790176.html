    the Plaintiffs came to know of the Defendant's application for registration of
    the trade mark "JUST IN VOGUE" in class 35 in respect of retail stores and
    sales services, etc.  The Plaintiffs thereupon caused a notice of opposition to




                                                                                              
    be   filed   through   their   attorneys.     Upon   making   further   inquiries,   the
    Plaintiffs claim have learnt of the Defendant's use of the trade mark  "JUST
    IN   VOGUE"  in   relation   to   retail   stores   and   sales   services.   Considering

    grievance,   the   Defendant's   use   of   the   trademark  "JUST   IN   VOGUE"
    featuring prominently the word  "VOGUE"  amounts to an infringement of
                                          
    the Plaintiffs' well-known   trademark  "VOGUE".   The Plaintiffs claim that
    the adoption by the Defendant of the impugned mark is ex facie deliberate,
      

    willful   and  mala   fide  with   intent   to   capitalize   on   the   goodwill   and
    reputation  of the Plaintiffs and give an impression to the public that the
   



    services of the Defendant are associated with or connected to the Plaintiffs.
    The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendant is thereby not only infringing the





    Plaintiffs' registered trademark but also passing off its goods and services as
    those of the Plaintiffs.

    the two trades, namely,  fashion magazines and retail sale of fashion goods,
    or commonality of the customer base or source of revenue generation, or
      

    for any other reason, the goods or services can be said to be similar.

    likely to somehow  imagine that these goods or the retail services offered by

    association with the Plaintiffs or their magazine  'VOGUE'.     The goods or

    Defendant's   stores   bears   a   certain   resemblance   (which   can   hardly   be
    described as deceptive  similarity, as I have explained later in this order)

    misled into believing that the goods dispensed at the particular stores have
    a   connection   with   the   publishers   or   owners   of   the   magazine?     It   is
                                           
    important to note that the trade connection relevant for similarity of goods
    must   imply   that   the   goods/services   ordinarily   come   from   the   same
      

    merchant and not that the goods of one merchant have the endorsement or
    backing of another.   Magazine publishers are not ordinarily known to be
   



    retailing   fashion   goods   and   hardly   is   anyone   likely   to   be   misled   into
    believing  that  the  magazine  and the  fashion  goods  come  from  the same





    source.   Even otherwise, the suggestion that the goods of the retailer may
    appear   to   have   the   backing   of   the   fashion   magazine   because   of   the
    similarity  in  names   cannot be said  to  have  any realistic  bearing on the
    subject of similarity of goods.

    an application for  registration of the trade mark "Caltex"  by the appellant
    before   the   Court.     The   appellant   wanted     to   use   the   mark  "Caltex"  in




                                                                         
    respect of watches (which came under class 14 as "Horological and other
    Chronometric   instruments   and   parts   thereof"   of   the   schedule   as   it   then
                                            
    existed).     The   application   was   opposed   by   Caltex   (India)   Ltd.,   the   well-
    known manufacturer and dealer  in petrol and other oil products, who held
                                           
    registration of the trade mark "Caltex" in classes 4 and 19.    The Court was
    essentially considering whether the appellant was disentitled to registration
      

    under     clause   (a)   of   <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_24">Section   11</a>   of   the   1958   Act,   which   prohibited
    registration of a mark, "the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause
   



    confusion". The argument of the appellant was that his goods were totally
    different from the goods of his opponent Caltex (India) Ltd.; there was no





    connection in the course of trade nor any common trade channels in respect
    of   the   goods;   and   consequently,   there   was   no   danger   of   deception   or
    confusion.     Our Court held that though the goods were totally different,
    and there was no connection in the course of trade nor any common trade





    channels, we must still consider the factors, which tend to show that there
    is a likelihood of creating deception or confusion.  The Court considered the
    fact that the opponents had been using their mark on a very large scale
    since 1937; their publicity was wide spread and large.   Though the goods
    were different, the potential market for them was similar in the sense that

    any   goods   with   the   mark  "Caltex"  on   them   would   be   the   goods   of   the
    opponents.  The Court's conclusion on the basis of the peculiar facts of the
    case is set out below:

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                        "On the facts of this case, we have no hesitation in holding that a
                                             
                        large   number   of   persons,   if   they   see   or   hear   about   the   mark
                        "Caltex" in connection with watches, would be led to think that the
                        watches were in some way connected with the opponents, or they
                                            
                        would at least wonder whether they were in any way connected
                        with the opponents.  Persons seeing the mark attached to watches,
                        which is a new class of goods, would assume, or are most likely to
                        assume,   that   they   originated   from   the   proprietor   of   the   mark,

<p id="p_27">                           The Court also considered the alternative plea of the opponent
   



    that  allowing the applicant to register the trademark "Caltex" for watches
    in   class   14   would   be   a   fraud     on   the   general   public   inasmuch   as   the





    applicant has been acting dishonestly in selecting the mark  "Caltex"  with
    the intention of trading on the wide reputation which that mark enjoyed in
    India   and   that   the   applicant's   case   was   not   founded   on   truth,   and   that
    because  of these two reasons, the applicant should be held to be disentitled





    to registration of the mark under the discretionary provisions contained in
    clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_25">Section 11</a> of the 1958 Act.  Even infringement cases under the
    old law would go by the same consideration, namely, whether or not there
    was a possibility of deception or confusion.

    in   the   present   case,   the   Plaintiffs   have   disclosed   the   circulation   of   the
    magazine "VOGUE" in India between the year 2000 and 2007. Even a bare

    any  high    or  substantial  volume  of  sales. Ditto  for  the  alleged extensive
    advertisement of the magazine, for which no details have been furnished by
    the Plaintiffs.   The Plaintiffs have relied upon some laudatory articles to
    claim   that   the   mark  "VOGUE"  is   well   known   and   enjoys   extensive

    periodicals or magazines have significant or, for that matter, any circulation

    The   Defendant,   in   the   present   case,   started   using   the   mark    "JUST   IN
    VOUGE"  during the year 2004.   There is hardly any material adduced by




                                                                         
    the   Plaintiffs   to   show   that   as   of   the   year   2004   the   Plaintiffs'   trademark
    "VOGUE" enjoyed such reputation in India that any use by a rival trader of
                                            
    a similar mark for dissimilar goods would afford any unfair advantage to
    the   rival   trader   or   cause   any     detriment   to   the   distinctive   character   or
                                           
    reputation of the mark  "VOGUE".   On the other hand, the Defendant has
    relied on material to show that the Plaintiffs have no reputation in India
      

    within  the  meaning of clause  (a) of  sub-section  (4) of  <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_31">Section  29</a>.     The
    Defendant has relied on a survey by Indian Readership Survey, which does
   



    not feature the Plaintiffs' magazine in the top 25 magazines of India.   So
    also,   a   survey   conducted   by   World   Wide   Media   Limited   for   'Femina'





    Magazine   does   not   consider  "VOGUE"  as   a   competitor   of   the   magazine
    'Femina'. The list of well-known Trade Marks released by the Registrar of
    Trade Marks does not include the mark "VOGUE".  A survey conducted by
    the very agency "Interbrand", whose survey in the year 1991 is relied upon





    by the Plaintiffs in support of their case, does not show the mark "VOGUE"
    as within the top 100 marks in India since the last ten years, i.e. at least
    since 2004 onwards.   The other factors such as nature of goods/services,
    channels of trade, price of goods, etc. are also against the Plaintiffs.  On a
    balance, there is indeed no prima facie case of a reputation in India of such
    order as to warrant any relief under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_32">Section 29(4)</a>.</p><pre id="pre_3">

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                  "30.     The   endeavour   of   ROCA   has   been   primarily   to   say   that
                                            
                  since   it   is   a   registered     trademark   proprietor,   and   has   an
                  international   reputation,   temporary   injunction   must   follow.
                  Though attractive, a bland and mechanical incantation of such
                  reputation  is insufficient.    Authorities  have  clarified   that  there
      

                  should   be   some     objective   material   to   show   that   the   brand
                  seeking protection was known to the Indian   consumer public.
                  The clear pointer here is to advertisements.  Now, in the case of
   



                  consumer   durables,   or   even   luxury   personal   items   such   as
                  toiletries, clothing, liquor, etc. circulation of magazines which are
                  not published in India, can be pointers to use, since international
                  travel has become commonplace with a sizeable section of the





                  people.     Nevertheless   the   availability   of   such   magazines   and
                  periodicals   and the nature of the product has to be considered
                  by the Court, while evaluating  the material, even for the purpose
                  of   temporary   injunction.     Now,   in   this   case,   ROCA   has
                  undoubtedly   placed   on   the   record   copies   of   some   magazines.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                  However, curiously, all the magazines are in Spanish or French.
                  ROCA has not shown if these   foreign language magazines are
                  readily   available,   or   are   accessed   by   members   of   the     public
                  generally, or even the class of consumers who normally purchase
                  such "niche" goods which it markets.   In these set of facts, to
                  solely base a decision on the   assumption of such circulation of

                 between a manufacturer and his goods.   It is an identification
                 characterised   famously   as   "a   badge   of   origin".     An  important
                 aspect here is that the mark should be distinctive; it should be
      


                 capable   of   distinguishing   the  goods  and   services   of   one  from
                 another.   The essence of trade mark protection is premised on
   



                 protection   of   consumers,   from   being   mislead.     An   essential
                 condition for  protection is that the mark should have acquired
                 some distinctiveness, and the claim for that is not founded on
                 mere continued use.  In the case of a trade mark dilution claim,





                 the degree of distinctiveness, in this Court's   opinion has to be
                 higher because of the reference to acquisition (by the Plaintiff)
                 of   "a   reputation   in   India"   -an   element   not   required   to   be

<p id="p_38">    20.                    Let us now consider if the adoption of the trade mark "JUST IN
    VOGUE"  by the  Defendant  can be said  to  be  "without  due  cause".   The
      


    Defendant's case is that the  adoption  is honest,  bona fide  and   with due
   



    cause.  The word 'Vogue'  is an ordinary English word which is descriptive.
    It means fashion or prevalent way or popular usage and is often preceded





    by "in".  (See, Webster's Dictionary.)  Being an ordinary descriptive word,
    insofar as the band of protection afforded to trade marks is concerned, it
    has  per se  the lowest potential for protection.   It may well be that even a
    descriptive word, by reason of its exclusive and extensive use by a trader,





    comes   to   acquire   a   secondary   meaning   and   is   thereby   capable   of
    distinguishing  the goods of that trader.  But that is not the case here, as I
    have   shown   above   whilst   dealing   with   the   aspect   of   distinctiveness   and
    reputation of the mark for   the purposes of a case of dilution.   If a trader
    dealing in 'fashion'   ware or publications adopts the word 'fashion' or its
    synonym 'Vogue'   to describe his product, he must be taken to adopt such

    structural, but in either case the marks must be compared as a whole and
    not   broken   into   parts   for   a   comparison.     Besides,   when   one   compares
    similarities in the various features of the marks, one also must look at the
    dissimilarities and consider whether the latter outweigh the former.  And all





    this from the standpoint of consumers who are likely to buy the goods or

    have an accepted and time-tested standard of 'deceptive similarity', evolved
                                             
    over a long time, as a relevant standard for testing similarity of  competing
    marks.  It is better to use that standard for guaging similarity even in cases
                                            
    of dilution rather than invent a new standard, say, of 'closest similarity' as
    the learned Judge of Delhi High Court seems to suggest.   The standard of
      

    deceptive similarity is stringent enough to include only such close similarity
    or  near resemblance as would  "be  likely to  deceive   or cause  confusion".
</p>   



<p id="p_46">    The "degree of resemblance" left hanging simply by the expression "closest
    similarity"   would   not   do   any   good,   for   "what   degree   of   resemblance   is





    necessary is, from the very nature of things, a matter incapable of definition
    a  priori."  (See,  Seixo  vs.   Provezende15,    used  by  the   Supreme   Court   in
    Amritdhara Pharmacy   vs. Satya Deo Gupta 16.)   We would still need an
    objective  test   to determine the "degree of resemblance" or "closeness of





    similarity" and there is no better test devised  by law so far than the test of
    "deceptive similarity".  I shall proceed accordingly.

    now consider the aspect of deceptive similarity. It is important to note that

    Defendant in its impugned mark is not using the word simplicitor but in




                                                                                               
    conjunction  with   two  other  words,    namely,   "JUST"  and  "IN  VOGUE".
    Besides, the Defendant's mark is   a device mark, which is rendered in a
    distinctive   style   of   writing   with   the   word  "JUST",   which   is   part   of   the




                                                                                              
    corporate name of the Defendant, being prominently displayed above the
    words  "IN"  and  "VOGUE"  and in a font size which is significantly larger
    (said to be four times that of the word 'VOGUE' used in the mark).   The




                                                                         
    word 'JUST' is further emphasized by an underline below it and is written in

    'VOGUE' are also not similar to the font/writing style used by the Plaintiffs
    for its trade mark 'VOGUE'.  All this indicates that there is no per se visual,
                                           
    phonetic and structural similarity between the two marks, when they are
    compared as a whole, that is to say, without breaking them into parts for
      

    comparison.     Compared   to   the   similarity   in   the   two   marks,   which   is
    signified only by the use of the word 'VOGUE' in both the marks, the word
   



    being the whole of the mark in case of one and in a combination of words
    in the other, the dissimilarities between the two, which are noted above,





    viewed in their entirety, sufficiently outweigh this singular similarity.  In the
    Plaintiffs'   own   case   decided   by   the   United   States   Court   of   Customs   and
    Patent  Appeals in  The Conde  Nast  Publications,  Inc.  vs.  Miss  Quality,
    Inc.,17   the Court refused to grant  any relief to the proprietor of the mark





    "VOGUE"  in   respect   of   a   competing   mark  "COUNTRY   VOGUES".     The
    Court held that the only similarity between the two marks was that  VOGUE
    was part of the mark "COUNTRY VOGUES" and the dissimilarities between
    the marks, viewed in their entirety, outweighed the similarity  sufficiently to
    leave no doubt.  There is no reason why the same result would not follow in

    that the words "IN VOGUE" are being used by the Plaintiffs for describing a
    distinct section in their magazine VOGUE, where the Plaintiffs describe new

    accordingly required distinctiveness and form part of the goodwill of the

    up such plea.  Even otherwise, this plea is a non-starter, since the Plaintiffs'
    registered trade mark, which alone is entitled to protection under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_48">Section

    VOGUE"  have   acquired   any   distinctive   meaning   is   completely   irrelevant
      

    insofar the case under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_49">Section 29(4)</a> is concerned.  Besides, considering the
    fact that I have come to a conclusion that prima facie there is no reputation
   



    of the  order requisite for a dilution claim  of the magazine VOGUE in India,
    there is no question of a certain section within the magazine having such





    reputation or entitling the Plaintiffs to any protection under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_50">Section 29(4)</a>.
