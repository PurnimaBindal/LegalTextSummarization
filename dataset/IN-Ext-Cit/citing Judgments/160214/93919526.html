</pre><p id="p_1">                                   (14.05.2010)
As per Dipak Misra, C.J.-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                  The present intra-Court appeal has been

                     directed against the order dated 02.04.2010 passed by the

                     learned single Judge in CWJC No. 8603 of 2009.</blockquote><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">                     2.           The expos√© of facts which are imperative to

                     be stated for adjudication of this appeal are that the writ

                     petitioners - respondents no. 37 and 38 to this appeal were

                     elected as Chief Councillor and Deputy Chief Councillor

                     of Patna Municipal Corporation under the Bihar Municipal

                     Act, 2007 (for brevity `the Act').     A requisition was

                     moved for holding a special meeting for considering No

                     Confidence Motion against them in the absence of the

                     rules as required under the Act. A circular under Memo

                     No. 2360 dated 22.06.2009 was issued by the State

                     Government stipulating that when a requisition is moved

                     for removing the Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief

                     Councillor   simultaneously, it shall be the duty of the

                     District Collector to fix a date and also his obligation to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                     5</span>




preside over the meeting. It is worth noting that at the

time the requisition was moved, the said circular had not

come into existence. The Chief Councillor fixed the date

on 14.07.2009 for holding a special meeting. The Town

Commissioner of the Corporation then informed the

District Magistrate that in view of the aforesaid circular

dated 22.06.2009, he was required to preside over the

meeting.   The District Magistrate-cum-Collector, Patna

authorized an Additional District Magistrate to preside

over the meeting. As is manifest from the material on

record, the meeting was held on 14.07.2009 and the Chief

Councillor lost the confidence of the House by 39 to 30

votes whereas the Deputy Chief Councillor lost the

confidence of the House by 42 to 28 votes. As the

vacancies came into existence, information was sent to the

State Election Commission (for short `the Commission')

and the Commission announced the date and programme

for fresh election of the Chief Councillor and Deputy

Chief Councillor.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.          The said respondents, being grieved by the

aforesaid action, invoked the jurisdiction of this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                      6</span>




under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and the writ

Court directed stay of the election by way of issuing an

interim direction.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.           It was contended before the writ Court that in

the absence of any rules, the vote of no confidence could

not have been mooted and the government circular that has

been issued on 22.06.2009 is a direct infringement of the

democratic set up of local self government. It was also

canvassed before the learned single Judge that the meeting

could not have been presided over by the District

Magistrate or the Additional District Magistrate as they

have no role under the Act. The aforesaid submissions

were combatted by the present appellants contending, inter

alia, that even if the rules have not been framed, a vote of

no confidence could be mooted against the Chief

Councillor or the Deputy Chief Councillor.

</p><p id="p_6">5.           The learned single Judge placed reliance on

the decision rendered in <a href="/doc/103726469/" id="a_2">Pawan Kumar Purvey v. The

State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>., 2010 (1) PLJR 272 wherein the

executive circular dated 22.06.2009 was declared invalid

and,   consequently,     the   proceedings   conducted    in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                    7</span>




pursuance thereof were not sustainable in law, the same

having been conducted under the said circular.

</p><p id="p_7">6.            Being of this view, the learned single Judge

allowed the writ petition and expressed the view that the

writ petitioners had not lawfully lost the confidence of the

House and shall not be deemed to be lawfully removed.

</p><p id="p_8">7.            Questioning the legal substantiality of the

aforesaid order passed by the learned single Judge, Mr.

S.B.K. Mangalam, learned counsel for the appellants, has

raised the following submissions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        (a) The learned single Judge has fallen into grave

        error by expressing the opinion that without the

        rules being in force, a vote of no confidence

        motion could have been mooted against the writ

        petitioners.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (b)      Even if the circular dated 22.06.2009 is

        invalid, the meeting had been held where the

        Councillors had participated and the requirement

        under Section 25(4) of the Act has been satisfied,

        therefore, the vote of no confidence should have

        been given the stamp of approval.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">             8</span>




<p id="p_9">(c)    The writ petitioners had participated from

the beginning till the end and at no point of time

raised any kind of protest and, therefore, they have

waived their right to challenge the proceedings

after losing the confidence of the House.

</p><p id="p_10">(d)   The right that has been waived by the writ

petitioners is the individual right and does not

involve any public interest and, therefore, their

participation would invite the doctrine of waiver

but the same has not been considered by the

learned single Judge and the impugned order has

been passed which makes it unsustainable in law.

</p><p id="p_11">(e)    The meeting once having been called and

carried to the logical end, the writ petitioners

cannot take a somersault and attack or assail the

procedure in the meeting solely on the ground that

the Additional District Magistrate presided over

the same.
</p>
<p id="p_12">(f)   The matter would have been different had the

Additional District Magistrate played any role in

the meeting by exercising his casting vote as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                      9</span>




       engrafted under Section 51 of the Act.

</p><p id="p_13">       (g) The ultimate concept of democracy lies in the

       manner in which the majority reacts and not by a

       technical flaw as such a flaw cannot destroy the

       basic democratic set up.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       (h) The learned single Judge has totally erred by

       applying the principle that if the procedure is

       prescribed to do an act in a particular manner, it

       should be done in that manner and all other modes

       are necessarily prohibited inasmuch as such a

       principle would not apply in stricto sensu to the

       case at hand as the doctrine of waiver gets

       squarely attracted.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.      Mr. Y.V. Giri, learned senior counsel for the

respondent no. 6, per contra, advanced the following

contentions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               (i)   The order passed by the learned single

      Judge cannot be faulted as he has held that the

      Government circular dated 22.06.2009 having no

      force of law, any consequent action taken on the

      basis of the said circular has to pave the path of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">               10</span>




extinction.</blockquote><p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">      (ii)    The finding of the learned single Judge

to the effect that a non-elected person cannot be

allowed or permitted to intrude in the democratic

exercise of power and be conferred the authority of

casting vote as the same is inconceivable in the

scheme of things is absolutely flawless and warrants

no interference.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      (iii) The formation of corporation and

election of the Chief Councillor and Deputy Chief

Councillor which is the sole object of the Act and

their basic source lies with the constitutional

requirement under Part 9A of the Constitution

which was introduced by the 74th Amendment and,

therefore, the democratic form of local self-

government cannot be remotely upset by executive

interference in the absence of a legislative provision

and, hence, the meeting cannot be presided over by

an outsider and, if it is done, it goes to the very root

of the matter that destroys the democratic process.

Therefore, the infrastructure being violative of law,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">              11</span>




the superstructure is bound to collapse failing which

the democracy at the grass root level is likely to be

corroded.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      (iv) The presence of the Additional District

Magistrate        in   the   meeting   being   totally

impermissible, the possibility of influence and lack

of free atmosphere cannot be totally ruled out and

when a possibility of this nature comes into

existence, the sanctity of voting, though may be a

secret one, gets vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      (v) The legislature had intended the meeting

to be presided over by a councillor and when that is

not done, the principle that if the procedure is

prescribed to do an act in a particular manner, it

should be done in that manner and not in any other

manner comes into full play.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      (vi) The doctrine of waiver which has been

highlighted by the appellant has no applicability to

the facts of the present case as an individual may by

his own conduct waive a right or a protective facet

which has been created for the protection of his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                     12</span>




       individual interest but there cannot be waiver or

       abandonment which involves public interest or

       public interest element.
</p>
<p id="p_22">               (vii) An elected candidate facing the House in

       a vote of no confidence motion waives his right by

       his conduct by participating in the meeting though

       there may not be fulfillment of certain requirements

       like issuing notice for specified period or not asking

       to address the house explaining his strength, etc. but

       when an outsider, contrary to the statutory

       provisions, intrudes and is permitted to preside over

       the meeting it falls within the realm of public

       interest element which cannot be waived by an

       individual as the meeting in its conceptual

       essentiality is the meeting of the House and cannot

       be presided over by a rank outsider and while the

       meeting is held in such a manner, the whole thing

       has to be lanceted.
</p>
<p id="p_23">9.        To appreciate the submissions raised at the Bar,

it is apposite to refer to Section 25 of the Act.

</p><p id="p_24">       "25. Removal of Chief Councillor/Deputy

</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">10.         In this context, we may refer with profit to

Section 51 of the Act which reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "51. Presiding officer of a meeting of
      Municipality.- (1) The Chief Councillor shall
      preside at every meeting of the Municipality and
      in his absence the Deputy Chief Councillor shall
      preside the meeting:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      Provided that when a meeting is held to consider
      a motion for the removal of the Chief
      Councillor, the Chief Councillor shall not
      preside at such meeting.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (2) The Chief Councillor, or the person presiding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                  16</span>




      over a meeting of the Municipality, shall also
      have, and may exercise, a casting vote in all
      cases of equality of votes".
</blockquote>


<p id="p_34">11.          The Division Bench of this Court in Ruby

Singh v. The State of Bihar &amp; Ors., (LPA No. 1564 of

2009 &amp; analogous cases), decided on 15.04.2010, has

held thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "14. On a reading of the said provision, it is
       clear as day that the Chief Councillor shall
       preside over the meeting and in his absence, the
       Deputy Chief Councillor shall do so. In the
       proviso, an exception has been carved out that
       the Chief Councillor shall not preside at such a
       meeting if the meeting has been convened to
       consider a motion for his removal. Sub-section
       (2) empowers the Chief Councillor or the
       person presiding over a meeting of the
       Municipality to exercise a casting vote in all
       cases of equality of votes. It can be stated by
       applying the deductive method that a person
       who has power to cast his vote can only preside
       over the meeting. If the scheme of the Act is
       read in proper perspective, there can be no
       scintilla of doubt that a Chief Councillor who
       has power to participate in the transaction has
       power to vote. Thus, a Chief Councillor can,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">           17</span>




under certain circumstances, be asked to
preside over the meeting. Such a contingency
can be met with if there is a requisition to moot
a motion of no confidence against the Chief
Councillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor.
</blockquote><p id="p_35">No role can be ascribed to any person from the
executive to preside over such a meeting. True
it is, there are provisions in certain statutes
where a meeting is held in the presence of the
Executive Officer of the Municipality or by a
Sub Divisional Officer or even by the District
Magistrate, but in the said provisions, no power
is conferred on them for casting vote in case of
equality of votes but Section 51 of the Act has
been differently couched and, therefore, the
only conclusion that can be arrived at is that a
meeting has to be presided over by the - 17 -
Chief Councillor or the Deputy Councillor or
the Councillor which would be in apposite and
in fitness of thing in a democratic set up regard
being had to the power conferred on the
Municipalities under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">15. In view of the aforesaid, the plea of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "27. On a scrutiny of the scheme of the Act,
       we are of the considered opinion that it cannot
       be said that without laying down of the
       procedure for conduct of business in a special
       meeting under the rules, the provision as
       engrafted under Sections 25 and 51 of the Act
       cannot really be effectively carried out. The
       procedure to be adopted has to be fair.
       Appreciating the scheme of the Act in entirety,
       we notice that the Chief Councillor has been
       empowered to convene a meeting of the
       Municipality. In fact, Section 48 of the Act
       adequate guidance and safeguard. It is a well
       settled proposition of law that a statute has to
       be read as a whole to understand its object and
       purpose. On a reading of the provisions in
       entirety, we are of the considered view that a
       vote of no confidence can be mooted and
       carried out without framing of the rules and,
       hence, the provisions of the statute are
       workable."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_41">14.         The next aspect that arises for consideration

is whether the meeting presided over by the Additional

District Magistrate would nullify the entire proceeding or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                   20</span>




the meeting has to be held invalid as the same has been

acquiesced to by the elected candidate who was facing a

vote of no confidence motion. On a perusal of the

pleadings and the material brought on record, it is

evincible that the special meeting was convened by the

Additional District Magistrate (General) and he presided

over the meeting on 14th July, 2009. The Chief Councillor

and the Deputy Chief Councillor were present and neither

absented from the meeting nor declined to attend the vote

of no confidence motion. The meeting continued and a

vote of no confidence was passed against them. Though

the learned counsel appearing for the parties have raised a

number of submissions from various spectrums, yet three

significant issues do emerge for consideration.        First,

whether when a power is required to be exercised by a

certain authority in a certain way, it should be exercised in

that manner or not at all, and all other modes of

performance are necessarily forbidden and, hence, the

meeting is null and void; secondly, whether the doctrine of

waiver would get attracted as the affected parties

participated in the meeting and being grieved by the result
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                   21</span>




thereafter have taken a somersault to challenge the same

and thirdly, whether the action taken can be sustained

regard being had to the will of the House which is a

significant bedrock in a local self governanment or would

get vitiated because of the meeting having been presided

over by an outsider, namely, the Addl. District Magistrate

(General).

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "18. It is well settled that where a power is
        required to be exercised by a certain authority in a
        certain way, it should be exercised in that manner
        or not at all, and all other modes of performance
        are necessarily forbidden. It is all the more
        necessary to observe this rule where power is of a
        drastic nature and its exercise in a mode other than
        the one provided, will be violative of the
        fundamental principles of natural justice. Now, in
        the present case, if the telephones of the appellants
        were to be disconnected on the ground of misuse,
        then they had to give, in consonance with the
        principles of natural justice, opportunity to the
        appellants to explain their conduct before taking
        action under Rule 427 read with Rules 416 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                    22</span>




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">        421. Resort to the wrong and more drastic course
        provided in Rule 422, on a ground which was not
        germane to an action under that Rule, vitiates the
        impugned order, particularly when it is manifest
        that in making the impugned order, the General
        Manager was influenced more by this ground and
        less, if at all, by the existence of 'public
        emergency' certified by the Delhi Administration."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_43">16.            Though the said principle is absolutely well

known, yet it would not get attracted to the factual matrix

of the case at hand for the simon pure reason that there

was no clear provision in the statute as to how to convene

a meeting when a vote of no confidence motion is mooted

against the Chief Councillor and Deputy Chief Councillor.

That apart, the decisions as have been stated, in principle

pertained to a different lis altogether.

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        "Be that as it may, the meeting was convened

        Neither in the requisition, nor in the notice, any
        reason in support of the motion had been
        mentioned, which appears to be a requirement of
        law. However, for that reason the petitioners did
        not suffer any prejudice inasmuch, none of the
        petitioners attended the meeting. After the
        meeting was held and they were removed, again
        a meeting was held for the purpose of supplying
        the vacancy caused by such removal and both
        the petitioners participated in the said meeting
        proceeding on the basis that the same was a valid

        participated in the meeting, the petitioner no.2

(2005) 1 SCC 31, a two-Judge Bench of the Apex Court

was dealing with the stand taken as regards waiver on the

part of the landlady by her own conduct. Their Lordships

expressed the view that waiver is a question of fact which

must be expressly pleaded, clearly proved and no such

plea had been raised by the tenant or by the sub-tenant.

Their Lordships further held that a bald plea of waiver

cannot defeat the statutory provision made in the larger

interest. In that context, their Lordships referred to the

earlier decisions rendered in <a href="/doc/869439/" id="a_13">Shalimar Tar Products Ltd.

       to waive the advantage of a law made solely for
       the benefit and protection of the individual in
       his individual capacity. We are, however, in
       this case unable to agree. Firstly, in this case
       there was no case of waiver. Waiver is a
       question of fact which has to be tested by facts
       and   evidence.   There     was   no   conscious

       relinquishment of the advantage of any statute.
       No court has gone into this fact. It does not
       seem to have been urged before the High Court
       also. Apart from this, in this requirement of the
       statute which is in the public interest there
       cannot be any question of waiver of a right,
       dealing with the rights of the tenants or the
       landlord. ...."</blockquote><p id="p_47">

       the principle of estoppel; the difference
       between the two, however, is that whereas
       estoppel is not a cause of action; it is a rule of
       evidence; waiver is contractual and may
       constitute a cause of action; it is an agreement
       between the parties and a party fully knowing
       of its rights has agreed not to assert a right for a
       consideration.

       involved therein. Whenever waiver is pleaded it
       is for the party pleading the same to show that

      if a notice is issued and no representation was
      made by either the owner, tenant or a sub-
      tenant,   it    would      amount    to   waive    the

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">       "20. Having seen the pronouncements of
       judicial fora, we can now inform ourselves as to
       the   view       of        the     reputed        authors   on
       interpretation        of         statutes    as     well    as
       administrative law. We may start with what has
       been stated in Maxwell's The interpretation of
       Statutes. This aspect has been dealt at pages
       328-330 (12th Edn.) and it has been stated that if
       the benefit be for the protection of an individual
       in his private capacity the same can be waived.
       To illustrate, reference has been made about
       waiver of the benefit of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_23">Limitation Act</a>.
       This is on the maxim of law "Quilibet potest
       renunciare juri pro se introducto", meaning "an
       individual may renounce a law made for his
       special benefit". Maxwell then says that if the
       benefit be one which has been imposed in
       public interest there can be no waiver of the
       same."</blockquote><p id="p_53">


</p><p id="p_54">       "21. Craies in his Statute Law has opined the
       same, as would appear from what has been
       stated at page 269 of 7th Edn. By drawing
       attention to the aforesaid maxim, it has been
       observed that if the object of a statute is "not
       one of general policy, or if the thing which is
       being done will benefit only a particular person
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">             30</span>




or class of persons, then the conditions
prescribed by the statute are not considered as
being     indispensable".     To     illustrate    this
principle, it has been stated that if the statutory
condition be imposed simply for the security or
the benefit of the parties to the action
themselves,       such   condition   will    not    be
considered as indispensable and either party
may waive it."
</p>
<p id="p_55">
"22. Crawford in his Interpretation of Laws
takes the same view as would appear from
pages 540-542 (1989 Reprint). The learned
author while quoting the aforesaid maxim states
at page 542 that requirement like giving of
notice may be waived as the same is intended
for the benefit of the person concerned."


"23. We may also refer to the views expressed
by      Francis    Bennion     in    his    Statutory
Interpretation (1984), wherein this aspect has
been dealt with at pages 27 et seq and it has
been stated that if the performance of statutory
duty be one which would come within the
aforesaid maxim, the person entitled to the
performance can effectively waive performance
of the duty by the person bound. As an
illustration mention has been made (at page 29)
of decisions in Toronto Corpn. V. Russell and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                   31</span>




       Stylo Shoes Ltd. v. Prices Tailors Ltd. wherein
       it was held that a duty to give notice of certain
       matters can be waived by the person entitled to
       notice, if there is no express or implied
       indication that absence of notice would be
       fatal."

<p id="p_56">
       "24. H.W.R. Wade's name is well known in the
       world of administrative law. He has dealt with
       this aspect at page 267 of the 6th Edn. of his

<p id="p_58">24.         In this context, we may refer with profit to the

       the right which is renunciated is the right of
       party alone or of the public also in the sense
       that the general welfare of the society is
       involved. If the answer is latter then it may be
       difficult to put estoppel as a defence. But if it

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">26.           The submission of Mr. Giri, learned senior

counsel, is that the concept of acquiescence would not get

attracted so far as the public interest element is concerned.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">Elaborating the said submission, Mr. Giri contended that

in a democracy meant for local self government, the

intervention of an outsider is totally inconceivable. The

learned senior counsel would submit that the statute gives

certain power to the State Government only to control the

administration of the local bodies. When the power is not

there, any intrusion will attack at the very marrow of

democracy. The aforesaid submission, on a first blush,

looks quite attractive but on a keener study and deeper

scrutiny, pales into insignificance. It has been held by their

Lordships that if it is a right of a party alone then it is

capable of being abnegated either in writing or by conduct.

Facing of vote of no confidence motion by a Chief

Councillor or a Deputy Chief Councillor, in our

considered view, is an individual right. The submission of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                    34</span>




Mr. Giri, learned senior counsel, is that when an elected

candidate is to be removed by a vote of no confidence, it

will come in the realm of public interest. We are inclined

to think that the test to determine the nature of interest -

private or public, as has been held by their Lordships of

the Apex Court, is whether the right which is re-

enunciated is the right of the party alone and the public

also in the sense that the general welfare of the society is

involved. The requirement as laid down is not in the public

interest. When an elected candidate is removed from the

office, the same cannot be compared with preparing a

budget, approving a master plan or recommending certain

aspects for imposing tax which are absolutely in the realm

of public interest affecting the general public. Thus, it has

to be treated in the realm of individual interest. As the

Chief Councillor or the Deputy Chief Councillor faces the

House for vote of no confidence motion and, if he has

participated in the proceeding and acceded to the

procedure, he/she can waive it. The doctrine of waiver,

thus, gets squarely applied.

<p id="p_61">27.          The    controversy    can   be   viewed     and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                   35</span>




appreciated from another angle. As there is no provision in

the Act, the State Government issued the notification on

22.06.2009. This Court for the first time declared that the

said notification could not have been issued and was

declared invalid in Pawan Kumar Purvey (supra). The

said judgment was delivered on 24.11.2009. The view

expressed therein was approved by the Division Bench in

Ruby Singh (supra). Prior to that date, the executive

circular was in force.
</p>
<p id="p_62">28.         In this regard, we may refer with profit to the

decision in Gokaraju Rangaraju (supra) wherein their

Lordships have held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      "12. The de facto doctrine has been recognised
      by Indian Courts also. In Pulin Behari v. King
      Emperor, (1912-15 Cal LJ 517) Sir Ashutosh
      Mookerjee, J after tracing the history of the
      doctrine in England observed as follows:

          facto doctrine was introduced into the law
          as a matter of     policy and necessity, to
          protect the interest of the public and the
          individual where     these interests   were
          involved in the official acts of persons
          exercising the duties of    an         office
          without being lawful officers. The doctrine

         in fact is necessary to maintain the
         supremacy of the law and to preserve peace
         and order in the community at large. Indeed,
         if any individual or body of individuals
         were permitted, at his or their pleasure, to
         collaterally challenge the authority of and
         to refuse obedience to the Government of
         the State and the numerous         functionaries
         through        whom it exercised its various
         powers     on      the   ground of     irregular
         existence or defective title, insubordination
         and disorder of the worst kind would be
         encouraged. For the good order and peace
         of society, their authority must be upheld
         until in some regular mode their title is
         directly investigated and determined."</blockquote>



<blockquote id="blockquote_31">          Thereafter, their Lordships referred to the

decision in <a href="/doc/1839567/" id="a_25">P.S. Menon v. State of Kerala</a>, AIR 1970

Ker. 165 and, eventually, expressed thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">           "15. A judge, de facto, therefore, is one
           who is not a mere intruder or usurper but
           one who holds office, under colour of
           lawful authority, though his appointment
           is defective and may later be found to be
           defective. Whatever be the defect of his
           title to the office, judgments pronounced
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">          37</span>




by him and acts done by him when he was
clothed with the powers and functions of
the office, albeit unlawfully, have the
same efficacy as judgments pronounced
and acts done by a Judge de jure. Such is
the de facto doctrine, born of necessity and
public        policy   to   prevent    needless
confusion and endless mischief. There is
yet another rule also based on public
policy. The defective appointment of a de
facto judge may be questioned directly in
a proceeding to which he may be a party
but it cannot be permitted to be questioned
in a litigation between two             private
litigants,      a litigation which is of no
concern or        consequence to      the judge
except as a judge. Two litigants litigating
their private titles cannot be permitted to
bring in issue and litigate upon the title of
a judge to his office. Otherwise so soon as
a judge pronounces a judgment a litigation
may be commenced for a declaration that
the judgment is void because the judge is
no judge. A judge's title to his office
cannot be brought into jeopardy in that
fashion. Hence the rule against collateral
attack on validity of judicial appointments.

appeal against the judgment is, of course,

           such a collateral attack."

<p id="p_68">This Court also further held that the validity

light of the finding that <a href="/doc/268914/" id="a_30">Section 9(7)</a> is
invalid, violative of the basic structure and
judicial independence envisaged in the
Constitution, public policy requires that the
doctrine of de facto be engrafted on
necessity to protect the interest of the public
and the individuals involved in the official
acts of persons exercising the duty of an
office without actually being one in strict
point of law.     Therefore, though, de jure

          convictions made are legal and valid. The
          de facto doctrine is not a stranger to the
          Constitution or to the Parliament and the

Gill &amp; Ors</a>., AIR 2000 SC 3425, the Apex Court also

applied the de facto doctrine to the cases which had

<p id="p_71">33.          In Dr. A.R. Sircar v. State of U.P. &amp; Ors.,

decision taken bona fide by the government is in

decision would be saved by the de facto doctrine.

</p><p id="p_72">34.           The Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief

Councillor accepted the circular and conducted the

meeting. At that juncture, the authority could preside over

the meeting. Nothing has come on record that the said

authority interdicted during the meeting or did anything

which could cause any kind of prejudice. The situation of

casting vote did not arise. We are disposed to think that

when a particular action has been taken and the said action

is not bad, the concept of de facto doctrine would come

into play on fours.    The action would not be vitiated

because the notification was afterwards declared invalid.

Thus, apart from the principle of waiver, by applying the

de facto doctrine, the vote of no confidence which has

been mooted and passed by the house cannot be found

fault with.
