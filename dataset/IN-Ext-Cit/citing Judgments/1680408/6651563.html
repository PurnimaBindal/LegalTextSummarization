                       ORAL- ORDER
                  (Passed on 3.3.2010)


</p><p id="p_2">1.    This  petition  has been filed by the  petitioner
  aggrieved on account of order dated 30th April,  1998
  (Annexure  A-3)  by  which the respondents  cancelled
  earlier  order of extension dated 31st October,  1996
  regarding   extension   of   service   and    granted
  reappointment  to the petitioner in  respect  of  the
  period from 7.11.1996 till 30.4.1998.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   Case of the petitioner is that while continuing in
  service  as  Peon  in the Department  of  Commerce  &amp;
  Industries,  petitioner retired w.e.f. 3.4.1996  upon
  attaining   the  superannuation  age  of  60   years.
  Thereafter, the respondents considered the case of the
  petitioner  for extension and vide order  dated  31st
  October  1996 (Annexure A-1), petitioner was  granted
  extension  of  service for a period of 2  years.  The
  petitioner pursuant to that order continued in service
  and finally vide order dated 30.4.1998 he was retired
  w.e.f. 30.4.1998 in view of extension of service of 2
  years earlier granted. However, the petitioner was kept
  deprived  of  benefit  of extension  of  service.  He
  preferred  representation on 4.5.1998 (Annexure  A-4)
  stating  that as the extension of service was granted
  vide order dated 31st October 1996, he was entitled to
  continue for a period of 2 years w.e.f. 31st October,
  1996  and  therefore his retirement w.e.f.  30.4.1998
  amounts to termination from service which is illegal.
  Petitioner therefore claimed that he should be treated
  as having retired from service w.e.f. 7.11.1998 in view
  of the order dated 31st October 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    Learned  counsel for the petitioner submits  that
  the  petitioner was granted extension of service vide
  order   dated  31st  October  1996  (Annexure   A-1).
  Petitioner  was  therefore entitled  to  continue  in
  service  for a period of 2 years w.e.f. 31st October,
  1996  and thus he was entitled to continue in service
  with all benefits. His submission is that action of the
  respondents  in canceling earlier order of  extension
  dated  31.10.1996, as is reflected from  order  dated
  30.4.1998 (Annexure R-2), is illegal, arbitrary and in
  utter violation of principle of natural justice. It is
  urged that once such extension has been granted, in the
  absence  it  being  contrary to the  relevant  policy
  relating to extension of service, could not have been
  recalled and the petitioner was entitled to reap  the
  benefits of order dated 31st October, 1996. His further
  submission  is  that  even if order  dated  30.4.1998
  (Annexure A-3) is taken into consideration, he has been
  treated as having retired and therefore he could not be
  treated  as having been reappointed. Learned  counsel
  argued  that  under any circumstance,  the  order  of
  recovery from the petitioner is wholly unsustainable in
  law  inasmuch  as  the  petitioner  is  entitled   to
  remuneration in respect of period during which he has
  worked. The order of extension was not an outcome  of
  any  fraud or misrepresentation on his part. As such,
  even if the order of extension is withdrawn and instead
  reappointment is given, petitioner would be entitled to
  retain the salary in respect of the period during which
  he has worked.
</p><p id="p_5">4.   Per contra, referring to the averments made in the
  return,  learned  counsel for  the  State/respondents
  submits that petitioner was not entitled to extension
  of service in view of Govt. policy dated 31st October,
  1986 (Annexure R-1) inasmuch as under Clause 5 thereof,
  it    has    been   clearly   stipulated   that    no
  extension/reappointment would be granted after 60 years
  of  age.  In  exceptional cases, if it is found  that
  continuance of Government servant in technical field is
  necessary      in      public     interest,      such
  extension/reappointment could be granted after getting
  orders  from  the Cabinet of Ministers.  His  further
  submission  is  that petitioner was not  entitled  to
  extension of service and therefore, the respondents are
  fully justified in withdrawing the order of extension.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    I  have  heard learned counsel for the respective
  parties and perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   It is not disputed that the petitioner was working
  on  the post of Peon in the Department of Commerce  &amp;
  Industries and his age of retirement was 60 on the date
  he attained age of superannuation on 30.4.1996. True it
  is  that the respondents had initially conferred  the
  benefit of extension to the petitioner by issuing  an
  order on 31st October, 1996 (Annexure A-1), I am unable
  to accept the submission that the petitioner could be
  granted extension of service in exercise of discretion
  under the policy dated 31st October, 1986 (Annexure R-
</p><p id="p_8">  1).   In   my  opinion,  the  Government  policy   of
  extension/reappointment was clear and  there  was  no
  discretion left to the authorities in case a Government
  servant  attains the age of 60 years. In the  present
  case, as the age of superannuation itself was 60 years,
  petitioner   was   not   entitled   to   benefit   of
  extension/reappointment in service.  Moreover,  under
  Clause  5  of  the aforesaid Circular,  extension  in
  exceptional  case  could be  granted  only  to  those
  Government employees who were working on the technical  
  post  and  not  otherwise and that too after  getting
  approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.     In   this  case  respondents  initially  granted
  extension of service to the petitioner, but later on,
  cancelled the earlier order and passed a fresh order on
  30.4.1998 (Annexure R-2) by which the earlier order of
  extension  of  service was changed  to  an  order  of
  reappointment. Submission of learned counsel for  the
  petitioner  that  the impugned order  and  action  of
  retiring the petitioner from 30.4.1998 is bad and the
  order  of extension of service could not be cancelled
  treating the same into reappointment as the same was in
  violation of principle of natural justice, cannot  be
  accepted in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the
  present case. Normally, before an action resulting in
  adverse  civil  consequences is  passed,  the  person
  effected  is  entitled to an opportunity of  hearing.
  However, when such action is called in question in the
  Court on such a ground, in exceptional cases, the Court
  may not be inclined to grant relief only on the ground
  of  violation of principle of natural justice. One of
  such  situation is that in case of forgone conclusion
  where no other conclusion is possible, no relief may be
  granted only on the ground of violation of principle of
  natural justice. Since in the present case, I find that
  the Circular on the face of it did not meant to extend
  any benefit of extension or reappointment to those who
  had  completed 60 years of service, in my  considered
  opinion, present is not a case where the petitioner may
  be   granted  benefit  on  account  of  violation  of
  principle  of natural justice. In the case  of  Suraj
  Prakash Chouhan Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and another   
  (W.P.(S) No.364/05), decided on 20.1.2010, this Court
  held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_10">     "(8)  It is well settled that before a person
     is  subjected  to  an  adverse  action  which
     involves civil consequences, it must  proceed
     an  opportunity of hearing as no one  can  be
     condemned  unheard. This universal  principal
     of  general application however admits of few
     exceptions  and  one  of  them  is  where  on
     admitted  or  indisputable  facts  only   one
     conclusion is possible and it would  be  only
     an empty formality or where the conclusion is
     foregone  and no other conclusion is possible
     on an admitted facts, interference may not be
     warranted  only on the ground that the  order
     was  passed without giving an opportunity  of
     hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     (9)   In the case of State of M.P. and others
     Vs.  Shyama  Pardhi  and  others,  (1996)   7
     Supreme Court Cases 118, appointment  of  the
     respondent  was cancelled on the ground  that
     even  though  she was not possessed  required
     qualification, she was wrongly  selected  and
     sent  for  training but later on her services
     were  terminated  as it was  found  that  the
     selection  was  illegal.  It  created  as  an
     admitted position that the respondent was not
     possessed    of    necessary   qualification.
     Challenge  to  the  order of  termination  by
     canceling  the  order of appointment  on  the
     ground  that  the same was done  without  any
     opportunity   of   hearing,  and   therefore,
     violative  of  principles of natural  justice
     was  negatived on the ground that the initial
     selection  itself  was per  se  illegal,  and
     therefore,  later appointments were  also  in
     violation of statutory rules.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     (10) In the case of Aligarh Muslim University
     and Others Versus Mansoor Ali Khan, (2000)  7
     Supreme  Court  Cases  529,  Hon'ble  Supreme
     Court has applied the principle that where on
     the  admitted or indisputable facts or  where
     only one view is possible, no relief could be
     granted  only because opportunity of  hearing
     was not afforded.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     (11) In the case of <a href="/doc/1680408/" id="a_1">State of Manipur &amp; others
     vs.  Y.  Tokan Singh &amp; Others</a>, 2007  AIR  SCW
     1995,  the  Hon'ble Apex Court has held  that
     where  the facts are admitted, principles  of
     natural  justice  are  not  required  to   be
     applied,  particularly, when the  same  would
     result  in futility. Further relied upon  the
     decision  in  the case of <a href="/doc/164782/" id="a_2">Kendriya  Vidyalaya
     Sangathan  and Others v. Ajay Kumar  Das  and
     Others</a>,  (2002)  4 SCC 503, it  was  observed
     that if the appointment orders are a nullity,
     the  question of observance of principles  of
     natural justice would not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     (12)  What  is discernible from the aforesaid
     decisions  of  the  Apex Court  is  that  the
     principles of natural justice are not  unruly
     horse.  The  principle of natural justice  is
     required to be applied with, having regard to
     the fact situation evident therein. Thus, the
     principle of natural justice may not  require
     to  be  followed in case where the conclusion
     on  admitted facts is foregone and  no  other
     conclusion is possible."
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.    From  the above discussion, I am unable to accept
  petitioner's submission that under the policy, he was
  entitled  to  extension of service and withdrawal  of
  extension of service and conversion of the same  into
  reappointment  was illegal or unsustainable  in  law.
  However, as far as payment of salary to the petitioner
  in  respect  of period during which he  worked  after
  attaining the age of superannuation is concerned, the
  same could not be recovered from the petitioner. It is
  not a case where the petitioner procured the order of
  extension of service by any fraud or misrepresentation.
  Respondent Authorities initially decided to grant the
  petitioner extension of service. Petitioner was allowed
  to continue in service and thereafter vide order dated
  30.4.1998, petitioner was retired by treating  period
  subsequent to his original date of superannuation  as
  reappointment instead of extension in service. This was
  not  the  fault of the petitioner. Moreover,  as  the
  petitioner worked during this period, he is entitled to
  remuneration for the work done during the said period
  and no recovery could be made from the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_16">9.     Last  contention  of  learned  counsel  for  the
  petitioner  that  in  view of the  order  dated  31st
  October,  1996  (Annexure A-1)  he  was  entitled  to
  continue in service for a period of 2 years from  the
  date of the said order cannot be accepted. Whether it a
  case  of  extension or reappointment, it was to  take
  effect from the date of superannuation and not from in
  the   subsequent  date  on  which  such  benefit   of
  extension/reappointment was granted. In view of finding
  which  I  have recorded that the said policy was  not
  applicable to the case of the petitioner because he had
  otherwise  attained  the age of 60  years,  the  said
  benefit  of continuance in service till 30th October,
  1998 could also not be claimed as of right.
</p>
<p id="p_17">10.   In  the  result,  the order  and  action  of  the
  respondents  in so far as recovery of Rs.12,154/-  is
  concerned  is declared illegal. If such recovery  has
  already been made, the same shall be refunded to  the
  petitioner with interest at the rate prevalent, within
  a period of 3 months from the date of receipt of copy
  of the order.
</p>
<p id="p_18">11.  Petition is accordingly partly allowed.
