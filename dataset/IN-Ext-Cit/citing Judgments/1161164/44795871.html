  report of this company is placed at pages 1046 of the Paper Book

  Part III.                 The Ld. Counsel further submits that this company is

  affected by a peculiar abnormal circumstance as this company

  entered into Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) during the year under

  consideration with Fiat Group Company. Ld. Counsel submits that

  profitability of this company has been impacted by Joint Venture.

  Further some of the existing production equipment was also

  transferred to the New Joint Venture Company.                                                                        Therefore, it is

  contended that this company should be excluded from comparables.
