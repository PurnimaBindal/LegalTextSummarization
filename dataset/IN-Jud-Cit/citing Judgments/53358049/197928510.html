</pre><p id="p_1">1.   Present appeal lays challenge to the interim order dated 05.12.2017
     passed by a Single Judge of this Court on an application filed by the
     appellants in a suit filed for infringement of trade mark against the
     respondents whereby the ad interim order dated 30.05.2012 was made
     absolute.     By the Order dated 30.05.2012, both the parties were
     directed to maintain status quo with respect to the use of the sub-brand
     'A+' in relation to the respective goods that the parties were
     manufacturing as on 30.05.2012 during the pendency of the suit.
</p><p id="p_2">2.   For the ease of reference, the parties are referred to in accordance with
     their position in the suit.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">     FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2018                                         Page 1 of 10</span>
<p id="p_3"> 3.   The present suit pertains to the trademark 'A+/a+' used by the parties.
     The plaintiffs are selling milk and dahi (yogurt) under the sub-brand
     'a+' in conjunction with their brand 'Nestlé'; while the defendants
     were applying the said mark 'A+' to cheese slices in combination with
     their brand name 'Amul'.
</p><p id="p_4">4.   Brief facts necessary to be noticed for disposal of this appeal are that
     the plaintiffs had filed CS (OS) 1675/2012 inter alia seeking to
     restrain the defendants from using the trade mark 'A+' with or without
     any prefix or suffix in respect of cheese, packaged milk or any other
     milk products. It was averred by the plaintiffs that pursuant to an
     internal branding study, they learnt that the plaintiff no.2 did not have
     any sub-brand for its milk and dahi products, which were sold only
     under 'Nestlé'.           Thereafter, it conducted a consumer study and
     selected 'a+' to be used as a sub-brand in conjunction with 'Nestlé' for
     milk and dahi.
</p><p id="p_5">5.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they conducted a search at the
     Trade Marks Registry and found "A+ logo" to have been registered in
     class 29 in favour of one Ajit Singh Om Prakash Ltd. The said
     proprietor assigned its rights in favour of the plaintiffs by a deed of
     assignment dated 26.08.2011 limited to the goods, i.e. "milk and milk
     products" for Re.1/-. Subsequently, application was also filed by the
     plaintiff no.1 for recording of its name as the subsequent proprietor
     and the same is pending. The plaintiff no.2 launched its milk and dahi
     products under the marks 'Nestlé a+' at a press conference on
     01.12.2011 and claims to have garnered tremendous sales.
</p><p id="p_6">6.   The plaintiffs further pleaded that in a couple of days of the launch, a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">     FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2018                                       Page 2 of 10</span>
       notice dated 05.12.2011 was received from the defendants claiming to
      be the proprietors of the mark 'A+'. The notice was received on
      07.12.2011 and replied to by the plaintiffs on 08.12.2011 drawing
      attention to the deed of assignment and calling upon the defendants to
      discontinue the use of 'A+' as it amounted to an infringement of their
      proprietary right in the mark 'a+'. It was averred that the parties tried
      to settle the matter, however, when efforts failed, the suit was filed by
      the plaintiffs. Along with the suit, the plaintiffs filed IA 10759/2012
      seeking an interim injunction against the defendants.
</p><p id="p_7">7.    The suit came for hearing before a Single Judge of this Court on
      30.05.2012 when the counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that they
      were not pressing for interim stay. However, the Single Judge while
      issuing notice directed both parties to maintain status quo about the
      use of the sub-brand 'A+' in relation to the goods as on the said date.
</p><p id="p_8">8.    The defendants filed a common written statement contending that they
      had been using the mark 'A+' in conjunction with 'Amul' since
      02.06.2011 on cheese slices and had also applied for its registration.
      The defendants have further challenged the assignment in favour of
      the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_9">9.    On 16.09.2014, issues were framed in the suit, which are mentioned in
      paragraph 13 of the order impugned before us.           Thereafter, the
      proceedings in the suit were stayed as proceedings for cancellation of
      trade mark of the plaintiffs were pending before the Intellectual
      Property Appellate Board.
</p><p id="p_10">10.   In this background, the Single Judge disposed of IA 10759/2012 by
      the impugned order confirming the order dated 30.05.2012.              The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">      FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2018                                       Page 3 of 10</span>
 Single Judge observed that the predecessor in interest of the plaintiffs,
i.e.Ajit Singh Om Prakash Ltd., was not using the mark 'A+' in
respect to milk or milk products. He further held that as the mark
'A+' was laudatory and descriptive, evidence was required to be led to
show that the mark had acquired distinctiveness and was associated
only with the plaintiffs. Observing so and noticing that the interim
order had continued for five years and disturbing it would cause
irreparable loss to both the parties. The relevant portion reads as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "20. The order dated 30.05.2012, noticing the fact that the
      Defendants have been using the Trademark A+ since
      02.06.2011 in respect of Cheese Slices and the Plaintiff with
      regard to Milk &amp; Dahi, directed both parties to maintain
      status quo about the use of sub-brand "A+" in relation to the
      goods that the respective parties were manufacturing as of the
      said date. The said order has been in force until date. The
      proceedings in the Suit have been stayed to await the outcome
      of the rectification proceedings before the Intellectual
      Property Appellate Board. Disturbing the status as on date
      would cause irreparable loss to both parties. The balance of
      convenience is not in favour of modifying the status quo that
      has continued for over five years without the parties proving
      their case by leading evidence. The order dated 30.05.2012
      not only protects the interest of the parties but also protects
      the interest of consumers who may be confused or misled (if at
      all) by the rival marks being used for identical products.
      Furthermore, if the Plaintiff were to finally succeed in the Suit,
      the Plaintiff could be adequately compensated by award of
      damages.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      21. In view of the above, the order dated 30.05.2012, is made
      absolute and both parties are directed to maintain status quo
      about the use of sub-brand "A+" in relation to the respective
      goods that the parties were manufacturing as of the said date,
      during the pendency of the Suit. The application is disposed of
      in the above terms."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                                       (Emphasis Supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">11.   Aggrieved by the said order, the plaintiffs have preferred the present
      appeal seeking an order of interim injunction against the defendants
      from using the mark 'A+' in milk or milk products. The plaintiffs
      have alternatively sought vacation of the impugned order to the extent
      it restricts the plaintiffs to using their mark 'A+/a+' for goods it is
      registered for.
</blockquote><p id="p_11">12.   Mr.Hemant Singh, learned counsel for the appellant, contends that not
      only are the appellants the registered proprietors of the trade mark
      'A+', but are also prior users since their predecessors had used the
      mark and sold goods under said trade mark. In this backdrop, learned
      counsel contended that the Single Judge could not have passed an
      order of status quo thereby injuncting the appellants from expanding
      or marketing other goods under the said mark in class 29. The counsel
      has relied upon <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_1">Sections 28</a> and <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_2">29</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999
      (hereinafter 'the Act'). He further contends that in case the defendants
      were to take advantage or claim prior user, they could have taken
      recourse to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_3">Section 34</a> of the Act and sought its legal
      remedy. In the absence thereof and in the absence of any counter-
      claim or an independent suit, the appellants could not have been
      injuncted in their own suit.
</p><p id="p_12">13.   Learned counsel has also contended that the Single Judge has erred by
      observing that no document has been placed on record to show that the
      predecessor-in-interest of the appellant was in fact using the trade
      mark with respect to the goods falling in class 29.        The learned
      counsel has relied upon some of the invoices which were filed along



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">      FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2018                                      Page 5 of 10</span>
       with the suit, more particularly, the invoice at pages 235 and 354 of
      the paper book wherein various articles have been detailed, including
      Milk Powder, Ghee and other products. Mr.Hemant Singh, learned
      counsel has also submitted that the appellants would not have any
      objection if the defendants were to continue with the mark 'A+' in
      relation to cheese during the pendency of the present suit and subject
      to final orders which may be passed. Reliance on the judgment in the
      case of <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_4">Ruston and Hornby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engineering Co</a>., AIR
      1970 SC 1649 (paragraph 5).
</p><p id="p_13">14.   Per contra, Mr.Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing for
      the respondents submitted that the appellants have, in fact, after the
      products of the respondent were launched in the month of June, 2011,
      searched for a registered proprietor and got the trade mark assigned
      for Re.1/- for milk and milk products alone. It is further contended
      that the issue with regard to prior user would only be decided by the
      evidence and there are no documents on record which would support
      the stand taken by the appellant with regard to prior user. Mr.Bhushan
      further contends that in fact the respondents are the prior user and the
      respondents are entitled to seek injunction against the appellants and,
      even otherwise, merely being a registered proprietor of the trade mark
      would not stand in the way of the respondents. The learned Senior
      Counsel has relied upon the judgments in the case of <a href="/doc/1850663/" id="a_5">Uniply
      Industries Ltd. v. Unicorn Plywood Pvt. Ltd</a>., (2001) 4 SCC 85 (paras
      7 and 8); <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_6">Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar &amp; Co., ILR</a> (1977)
      II Delhi 709 (paras 9 and 12); <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_7">N.R.Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation
      &amp; Another</a>, AIR 1995 Del 300 (paras 9 and 29) to canvass that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">      FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2018                                      Page 6 of 10</span>
       appellants may be the registered user, but they are not the prior user.
      Reliance is also placed on the judgment in the case of Smithkline
      Beecham Plc. v. Sunil Sarmalkar, 2012 (132) DRJ 880 (paras 2 and
</p><p id="p_14">      7) for the proposition that registered trade mark has no meaning unless
      goods have been sold under the said trade mark. Reliance was also
      placed on the judgments in the case of <a href="/doc/53358049/" id="a_8">FDC Limited v. Docsuggest
      Healthcare Service Private Limited</a>, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 6381
      (para 52) and <a href="/doc/1747781/" id="a_9">Vishnudas Trading v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd</a>.,
      (1997) 4 SCC 201 (para 46).
</p><p id="p_15">15.   In rejoinder arguments, learned counsel for the appellants has
      submitted that all necessary documents were filed along with the suit
      on 29.05.2012. He submits that in fact the observations in the case of
      Whirlpool Corporation (supra) would, infact, benefit the appellant.
      Mr.Singh has further relied upon the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_10">Gujarat
      Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Company</a>, AIR 1995 SC 2372.
</p><p id="p_16">16.   We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
      impugned order and the record before us. Learned counsel for the
      appellants is only pressing his alternative prayer seeking vacation of
      the portion of the impugned order restraining the plaintiffs from
      applying the mark 'A+' to goods other than those being manufactured
      on 30.05.2012.
</p><p id="p_17">17.   Accordingly, only one issue arises for our consideration: Whether the
      Single Judge could have directed the plaintiffs to maintain status quo
      in respect of the goods being manufactured by them on 30.05.2012
      during the pendency of the suit?
</p><p id="p_18">18.   By the order impugned before us, the Single Judge has directed both



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">      FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2018                                     Page 7 of 10</span>
       parties to maintain status quo about the use of sub-brand 'A+' in
      relation to the respective goods that the parties were manufacturing as
      on 30.05.2012, being the date of passing of the ad interim order. In
      effect, the plaintiffs have been restrained from applying 'A+/a+' to
      any product other than milk or dahi, while the defendants have been
      limited to cheese slices.
</p><p id="p_19">19.   We are of the view that the impugned order, to the extent it restricts
      the plaintiffs, is incorrect. The reasoning adopted by the Single Judge
      is that (1) disturbing the status would cause irreparable loss to both
      parties; (2) The balance of convenience is not in favour of modifying
      the status quo; and (3) the status quo order protected the interest of the
      consumers.
</p><p id="p_20">20.   However, the Single Judge failed to note that there was no application,
      counter-claim or suit filed against the plaintiffs by the defendants.
      The suit had been filed by the plaintiffs and it was open to the
      defendants to pursue such remedies as deemed fit to stop the plaintiffs
      from applying the mark 'A+/a+' to other products. As has been held
      by a coordinate bench of this Hon'ble Court in N.R.Dongre (Supra),
      it was always open to the defendants to file independent proceedings
      against the plaintiffs alleging passing off of their mark and proving
      prior user thereto.
</p><p id="p_21">21.   When no such proceedings were resorted to by the defendants, it was
      not open to the Single Judge to pass any order against the plaintiffs.
      On 30.05.2012, a Single Judge of this Court had while recording the
      submission of the plaintiffs that they were not pressing for interim
      orders directed the parties to maintain status quo. The said order was



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">      FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2018                                        Page 8 of 10</span>
       only ad interim in nature and was to operate until the final disposal of
      the application. It could not have been confirmed at the final disposal
      of the application, when the application was being pressed in its
      entirety by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_22">22.   We also find that while deciding the interim application, the Single
      Judge has incorrectly applied the parameters for granting interim
      reliefs. The Single Judge while doubting a prima facie case in favour
      of the plaintiffs has proceeded to pass interim orders nonetheless.
      Interestingly, no appeal has been preferred by the defendants. The
      other tests of balance of convenience and irreparable loss or injury
      have been incorrectly applied by the Single Judge. The said tests are
      to be applied to the relief, as sought by the applicant. The Single
      Judge proceeded to apply the tests in a manner as if applications
      seeking interim reliefs were filed by both parties. In case, the said
      tests were satisfied, the Single Judge could have passed interim orders
      and if not, then no orders could be passed. In no scenario, interim
      orders could have been passed against the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_23">23.   Even before us, the defendants have been unable to show as to how
      any interim order could have been passed against the plaintiffs. The
      judgments relied upon by the defendants could have come to their aid
      provided they had themselves approached the court, which is not the
      case. Thus, the alternative prayer of the plaintiffs is liable to be
      allowed.
</p><p id="p_24">24.   Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed. The impugned order, to the
      extent it directs the plaintiffs to maintain status quo about the use of
      'A+/a+' in respect of goods being manufactured on 30.05.2012, is set-
</p>

<p id="p_25">       aside. It is clarified that the order directing status quo against the
      defendants remains unaffected.
</p><p id="p_26">25.   We further clarify that all observations made in this order are in the
      context of a prima facie view and nothing should be construed as a
      final expression of opinion on the merits of the dispute. Nothing
      stated herein should be read to prejudice the claims/contentions of the
      parties in the trial of the suit or before the Intellectual Property
      Appellate Board.
</p><p id="p_27">26.   In view of the order passed in the appeal, CM 8303/2018 is rendered
      infructuous and is disposed of.
