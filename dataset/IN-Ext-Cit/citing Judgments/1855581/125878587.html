Judgment on                   : 29.03.2019


</pre><p id="p_3">      Soumen Sen,J.:-The appellant is aggrieved by a decree for a sum little over

18.50 lakhs directed to be paid towards godown rents for 18 months.

</p><p id="p_4">      Shorn of details, in or about October, 1976, the defendant nos. 1, 2 and 3

formulated a scheme to increase their hired storage capacity of Food Corporation

of India (hereinafter referred to as "FCI") by offering private parties guaranteed

occupation of such godowns for three to five years, implying a mechanism to

repay the loans that may be advanced by banks to private entrepreneurs availing

the scheme out of the rent receivable. In order to achieve the purpose, the said
 Scheme provided for constructing of godowns for storing foodgrains and other

food stuff by FCI, the nationalized banks and the defendant no.3 would meet the

financial requirement of private parties. The commitment of the banks in the

shape of financial assistance would be up to 75% of the money required, the

balance 25% would be borne by the owners of the godowns and the defendant

no.3 would give refinance assistance to banks to the extent of 80% of the loans

given. The plaintiff availed of the scheme and constructed 20 godowns for the

defendant no.1 at Burdwan. According to the plaintiff, the defendant no.1 had

agreed to take on rent 20 godowns to be constructed by the plaintiff for an agreed

period at an agreed rate. The plaintiff constructed the godowns in accordance

with the specifications of the defendant no.1. The plaintiff alleged that although

the plaintiff had constructed 20 godowns and offered all the godowns to the

defendant no.1, the said defendant, however, took on rent only two godowns and

refused to take the remaining 18 godowns. The plaintiff thereafter approached

this Court and obtained leave to let out those 18 godowns to third parties. The

18 godowns were thereafter let out to third parties on and from November 20,

1980. The plaintiff accordingly has prayed for compensation on account of rent

for a period of 19 months at the agreed rate of 40 paise per sq. ft. for the

remaining 18 godowns along with a claim for interest of the bank loans from 6th

April, 1979 to 20th November, 1980.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The defendant no.1 entered appearance in the suit and filed its written

statement. The defendant no.1 alleged that the construction of the godowns was

not as per specifications. Moreover the construction of the godowns was not
 completed within the stipulated time. There were defects in the godowns

constructed which the plaintiff did not cure and as such the defendant no.1 is

not liable to pay any rent or compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      It appears from the impugned judgment that though the plaintiff claimed

various reliefs, it limited its claim at the hearing of the suit to two claims, namely

the claim for compensation on account of unpaid rent for the period between 6th

April, 1979 and 20th November, 1980 for about 19 months at the agreed rate of

40 paise per sq. ft. for an aggregate area of 238560 sq. ft. and a direction upon

the learned Advocate on record for the defendant no. 1 holding the sums

receivable by the plaintiff as rent to be made over to the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_7">      On the basis of the pleadings and the evidence, both oral and

documentary, the learned Single Judge has arrived at a finding that the plaintiff

would be entitled to a sum of Rs.18,59,515.20p being the rent liable to be paid

for 18 months for the period from May, 1979 till October 1980. The defendant

was directed to pay the said sum within one month of the date of decree. In

default, the plaintiff would be entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum on

the said sum of Rs.18,59,515.20p on and from 1st November, 1980 till

realization.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      In so far as the two godowns are concerned, it was held that the plaintiff

would be entitled to the rent deposited in respect of two godowns of which the

defendant no.1 had possession. The plaintiff would be entitled to the proceeds of

the fixed deposits made by the Advocate-on-Record for the defendant no.1

together with all accruals thereto.
</p><p id="p_9">       This decree now under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Mr. Partha Sarathi Bose, the learned Senior Counsel representing the

appellant has submitted that the learned Single Judge has failed to appreciate

that there was no concluded contract between the parties in respect of the

remaining 18 godowns inasmuch as no agreement was executed by and between

the parties in relation to the said godowns.     Mr. Bose has referred to Exbt.D

being the agreement dated 19th March, 1977 between the plaintiff and the

defendant no.1 and submits that Clause 6 of the said agreement clearly

stipulated that upon completion of the construction of the said godowns and

after obtaining the completion certificate from the Sr. Regional Manager, FCI, the

plaintiff would hand over the godown or the godowns to the defendant no.1 under

a lease agreement to be executed between the parties in the standard form of the

FCI. Mr. Bose submits that admittedly no lease agreement in the standard form

of FCI was executed by and between the parties. The said agreement only

contemplates execution of a further agreement and in absence of any formal

agreement concerning the 18 godowns no decree could have been passed for the

18 godowns in favour of the plaintiffs. Mr. Bose submits that there is no

enforceable right as against the appellant as no agreement was, in fact, executed

by and between the parties. It is submitted that the plaintiff was required and

obliged to handover the godowns within 6 months from 19th March, 1977. From

time to time, the plaintiff requested the appellant/defendant to extend the time of

completion under the agreement and such extension was granted from time to

time. In spite thereof, the plaintiff failed and neglected to construct and complete
 the godowns and provide the required services within the said extended time. On

or about 1st September, 1978 the defendant no.1 gave notice to the plaintiff that

the godowns must be completed on 30th September, 1978 and that no further

extension of time would be granted. None of the godowns were completed or any

service was provided by 30th September, 1978.        At that stage the plaintiff

requested the defendant to take over at least 2 of the godowns, namely godown

nos. 9 and 10. At the insistence of the plaintiff, in spite of deficiency, the

defendant no. 1 agreed to take over the said two godowns. The plaintiff undertook

to remove the said deficiencies within a month from the date of taking over.

Although the defendant was not obliged to take over the said godowns from the

plaintiff, the defendant took over the possession of two godowns in view of the

urgency of the defendant's requirements. Even on 7th April, 1980 it was found

that the godowns were not completed in accordance with the terms and

conditions of the agreement and accordingly the appellant/defendant was under

no obligation to take over any of the said godowns under the said agreement

dated 10th March, 1977.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Mr. Bose submits that the learned Trial Judge has erred in relying upon

Exbt. K and L being the letter dated 20th September, 1978 and 30th January,

1979 to arrive at a conclusion that the performance of the contract was mutually

extended when the fact remains that none of these letters either was addressed

to the plaintiffs or they speak about extension of time beyond 30th September,

1978. Furthermore the letter dated 9th January, 1980 being Exhibit R upon

which the learned Trial Judge has relied in arriving at the conclusion that the
 defence of the defendant no. 1 that the construction was not in accordance with

the specifications was also without substance inasmuch as the same is an inter-

departmental letter of the defendant no. 1 in which the Zonal Manager of the

defendant no. 1 informed the Regional Manager of the defendant no. 1 that GM

(PO) is being asked to depute an officer to join his inspecting team and that there

was no need to depute any officer from the Zonal office.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      The main argument on behalf of the defendant no. 1 is that specific

performance of the agreement dated 19th March, 1977 as prayed for by the

plaintiff in the instant suit cannot be granted (although the same has not been

granted in the impugned decree) in the absence of a valid and binding contract

between the parties in respect of which parties should be consensus ad idem and

the burden of proof is on the plaintiff seeking performance of the contract.

Reference in this connection was made to Mayawanti Vs. Kaushalya Devi

reported in (1990) 3 SCC 1.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      It is submitted that in the instant suit the plaintiff has also prayed for

decree for Rs.2,49,58,068.94 in the event it is held that specific performance

cannot be had. The agreement of the defendant no. 1 in any event has to be

established to claim compensation under Section 21 sub-section (2) of the

<a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_1">Specific Relief Act</a>, 1963 which provides that if in any such suit, the Court

decides that specific performance ought not to be granted, but that there is a

contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant and that

the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him such
 compensation accordingly.     In order to invoke this provision, there must be a

valid and binding contract between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      Furthermore, as Clause 6 of the agreement dated 19th March, 1977

contemplates a lease agreement to be executed between the parties in the

standard form of FCI upon completion of the constructions of the godowns and

the service referred to in the said agreement in all respects and after obtaining a

completion certificate from the defendant no. 1.       It was further provided in

Clause 7 of the said agreement that it should be understood that in the event of

any undue delay in completion of the building or services or if there is faulty

workmanship or the construction is defective on the basis of the findings of the

FCI officers which will be final, the defendant no. 2 would not be bound to take

the structure on lease.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      Mr. Bose has referred to the Privy Council decision in Currimbhoy &amp; Co.

Ltd. Vs. L.A. Creat and others reported in AIR 1933 Privy Council 29 in

which it is stated that where the documents or letters relied on as constituting a

contract contemplate the execution of a further contract between the parties, it is

a question of construction whether the execution of the further contract is a

condition or terms of the bargain or whether it is a mere expression of the desire

of the parties as to the manner in which the transaction already agreed to will in

fact go through. In the former case there is no enforceable contract either

because the condition to enter into a contract is unfulfilled or because the law

does not recognize a contract to enter into a contract. In the latter case there is a

binding contract and the reference to the more formal document may be ignored.
 Inasmuch as in the instant case the condition mentioned in the agreement dated

19th March 1977 remains unfulfilled there is no enforceable contract here. Mr.

Bose, accordingly, submits that the decree is liable to be set aside.

</p><p id="p_16">      Per contra, Mr. Sakya Sen learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the

plaintiff has supported the judgment and submitted that the exchange of

correspondence between the parties would clearly show that the defendant no.1

has agreed to extend the time and was aware of the fact that the godowns were

made ready during the extended period but could not be made operational due to

lack of electrification. The defendant no.1, in fact, had written numerous letters

to the State Electricity Board for giving supply of electricity to the said godowns

so that the said godowns could be made operational. The defendant no.1 at no

point of time had rescinded the contract.           It was on the basis of the

representation of the FCI, that they would take on hire 20 godowns, that the

plaintiff availed the scheme and invested the amount and constructed the said

godowns to be taken on lease by FCI for a minimum period of 5 years at an

agreed rent which shall be remitted directly to the bank from which the plaintiff

had taken loan under the scheme for making construction of the said godowns.

Although the plaintiff constructed the godowns as per the specifications laid

down by the FCI under the close supervision of the engineers of the FCI, the

appellant, out of the 20 godowns, took possession of only two godowns and

thereby acted in breach in failing to take possession of the remaining 18

godowns. The plaintiff filed a writ petition praying inter alia for a direction upon

FCI to take over possession of the remaining godowns in which the interim order
 was passed on 23rd July, 1980 by which the plaintiff was granted leave to let out

the remaining godowns to third party without prejudice to the rights and

contentions. The suit was filed for specific performance of the agreement dated

19th March, 1977 and for compensation on account of rent for a period of 19

months at an agreed rent of 40 paise per sq. ft. for the area which the

appellant/defendant no.1 did not take over from the dated when it was ready till

the date they were let out to the third party as per the interim order of court.

</p><p id="p_17">      Mr. Sen submits that the terms and conditions of the agreement dated 19th

March, 1977 envisage discharge of reciprocal obligations and it constitutes a

binding contract. It was the obligation of the appellant to take possession and

entered into a lease agreement in the standard form of FCI which the plaintiff

sought to enforce in the suit.      The agreement is neither contingent nor an

executory contract.     The obligation of the appellant as envisaged by the

agreement namely, to take possession of the godowns and thereafter execute a

lease deed, is capable of being specifically enforced.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      Mr. Sen further submits that the time for completion of godowns was

mutually extended from time to time. In this regard the learned counsel has

referred to the letters dated 27th March, 1978 (Exhibit - I), 29th July (Exhibit - J),

20th September, 1978 (Exhibit - K), 30th January, 1979 (Exhibit - L) and 7th April

1979 (Exhibit - Y). It is submitted that the aforesaid letters would show that the

appellant was satisfied with the quality of the construction of the godowns and

was eager and willing to take over possession of the said godowns and put the

said godown into operation. The appellants have also realized that although the
 godowns were made ready for delivery, it could not be made operational due to

want of electricity. The said letters would show that the appellant had extended

the time for completion of construction of the godowns initially up to 30th

September, 1978 and thereafter till installation of electricity. The godowns were

constructed as per the specification laid down by the FCI well within the

extended time period. The appellant was satisfied with the quality of construction

of the godowns which were constructed under the strict supervision of the FCI

officers. The requirement of completion certificate was never insisted upon as

precondition for taking possession of godowns which according to the appellant

completed in accordance with the specifications.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      Mr. Sen also submits that as the appellant has failed and/or refused to

take possession and thus committed breach causing damages to plaintiff. The

plaintiff in order to mitigate their loss gave the godowns on rent on the basis of

the order dated 23.07.1980 at 40 paise per sq. ft. per month. The respondent

accordingly has claimed compensation on account of breach committed by the

appellant for the period from 06.04.1979 i.e. the day from which the godowns

were made ready for consumption till the date when the respondent leased out

the godown complex to the third party in terms of the interim order dated

23.07.1980 at a rate at which the godowns were let out to the third party. Had

the said godowns been taken possession of by the Appellant on 06.04.1979 when

the godowns were made ready for use, the respondent would have earned a rent

therefrom at a rate of Rs.0.40 per sq. ft. per month on and from 06.04.1979.

Even after installation of electricity connection on 06.04.1979 the appellant failed
 to take over possession of the same as a reason whereof the respondent had

suffered a loss on account of rent being earned from the said godowns. In such

circumstances it is submitted that the decree passed in favour of the plaintiff

does not suffer from any illegality and is required to be affirmed.

</p><p id="p_20">      We have perused the judgment and the evidence, both oral and

documentary.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      It is elementary that a contract is concluded when the offer is accepted.

The offer and acceptance could be oral. It need not to be in writing unless the law

requires that to be enforceable, such contract has to be in writing. An oral

agreement is also enforceable in law provided it is proved and established. What

is important is that the plaintiff has to establish that there is a concluded and

binding contract between the parties and a breach has occurred in order to claim

compensation. In a suit for specific performance under <a href="/doc/1573447/" id="a_2">section 21</a> of the Specific

Relief Act, the plaintiff, in a suit for specific performance of contract, can also

claim compensation for breach, either in addition to or in substitution of such

performance. However, as rightly pointed out by Mr. Bose, there has to be an

existence of a contract. In a concluded contract there are two elements: offer and

acceptance. Once the contract is reduced in writing and evidenced by a written

document, the task of the court becomes easier. The offer and acceptance can

also be inferred from circumstances. It need not be in writing. The Court on an

appreciation of the evidence can always come to a finding that the parties have

entered into a contract which is binding on both the parties. It is not a statutory

contract. <a href="/doc/1911494/" id="a_3">Section 8</a> of the Contract Act provides for the acceptance of the
 proposal by conduct as against other modes of acceptance. It can be divided in

two parts: (i) performance of the conditions of a proposal; and (ii) acceptance of

any consideration for a reciprocal promise which may be offered with a proposal.

The latter corresponds to general divisions of proposals into those which offer a

promise in exchange for an act or acts and those which offer a promise for

exchange for a promise.
</p>
<p id="p_22">        The requirement of a valid contract is that there should be consensus ad

idem.    It must be consensual. The agreement dated 19th March, 1977 was

followed by a communication dated 26th May, 1977 from FCI to the Branch

Manager, State Bank of India by which the appellant had promised to take on

lease after construction of the godowns for a period of 5 years on rent at an

agreed rate of 40 paise per sq. ft. per month. The said communication clearly

records that the FCI officials had inspected the land where the godowns are to be

constructed and have approved the layout, designs and estimates which must be

as per specification laid down by the FCI. The work of construction would be

supervised by the FCI's Executive Engineer from time to time and it would be

ensured that all constructions are made as per approved specification of FCI.

Item wise cost of construction was also approved by the FCI as also list of

materials for construction work of FCI estimated total cost of Rs.96 lakh. The

FCI recommended for loan to the plaintiff up to 75% of the amount that is 4 lakh

for each unit of 2500M.T. as per the model scheme formulated by FCI ARDC and

banks.    This was followed by an agreement dated 19th March, 1977. The said

agreement was acted upon.
</p><p id="p_23">       In the instant case, we have noticed that following the agreement dated

19th March, 1977 the plaintiff started constructing godowns.         The time to

complete the construction was mutually extended. Time was never the essence

of the contract. In fact, by a communication dated 27th March, 1978 the Senior

Assistant Manager, FCI had informed the Branch Manager, State Bank of India,

Burdwan that the matter relating to grant of extension of time beyond 31st

March, 1978 was under consideration and FCI was also prepared to accept

possession of the godown in phases within the extended period. On 29th July,

1978 a request was made by the District Manager, FCI to the Divisional

Engineer, State Electricity Board, Burdwan for immediate supply of electricity to

the newly constructed the godowns at Hatsimul complex so that the proposed

godown space could be brought into use as FCI was in dire need of storage space

for storing of food grains. It also acknowledged that they have taken possession

of the godown but they could not properly utilize it due to lack of supply of

electricity and it has caused heavy financial loss. There are numerous letters

addressed by the District Manager, FCI to the Divisional Engineer, State

Electricity Board, Burdwan requesting the said authority to provide electric

connection to the godowns. Copies of all such letters were marked to the plaintiff.

We may mention here few of the letters forming the plethora of correspondence

between the parties concerning the said godowns being letters dated 20th

September, 1978 (Exhibit K), 30th September, 1979 (Exhibit L) and 7th April,

1979 (Exhibit Y). In the communication dated 29th September, 1978 addressed

to the General Engineer State Electricity Board to the State Manager, FCI
 recorded that "The godowns complex ... have been constructed by M/s. Tulsi

Commercial Co. Ltd. Jahuripatty and the same will be taken over on 30th

September, 1978 by Food Corporation of India". The appellant in the said

communication has requested the State Electricity Board to provide electric

connection urgently so that the FCI would take over the charge of the godown by

30th September, 1978 which shows that the godowns were otherwise ready for

use and constructed to the satisfaction of the appellant but could not be taken

possession of due to want of electricity. On 30th January, 1979 a further letter

was issued by the District Manager FCI to the Divisional Engineer State

Electricity Board requesting the said board to provide electricity connection. In

the said letter the appellant admitted that the godowns already were constructed

under the supervision of the Senior Regional Manager FCI and the complex

would be taken over by the Joint Manager (Port Operation). By a further

communication dated 7th April, 1979 the Bank Manager, State Bank of India,

Burdwan Branch requested the District Manager, FCI to take over possession of

the godowns already completed without any further delay as electric connection

was installed at the complex on 6th April, 1979. Copies of all the said letters

were marked to the plaintiff. This correspondence would show that the godowns

were ready for possession on 30th September, 1978 and in any event by 6th April,

1979 when the electricity connection was ultimately installed. It is not alleged by

the appellant that the quality of the construction was defective or there had been

any intentional failure on the part of the appellant to obtain necessary electricity

connection. That the plaintiff had fulfilled all its obligations under the agreement
 is clearly acknowledged by the defendant and would be evident from the

correspondence referred to above. The plaintiff accordingly had discharged its

obligations under the agreement. It was then for the defendant to execute a

formal lease deed in favour of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      It is trite law once the contract is concluded orally or in writing, the mere

fact that a formal contract has to be prepared and initialed by the parties would

not affect either the acceptance of the contract so entered into or implementation

thereof even if the formal contract has never been initialed (See. Trimex

International Fze Ltd. v. Vedanta Aluminium Ltd reported in (2010) 3 SCC

</p><p id="p_25">1).
</p>
<p id="p_26">      The concept of formation of contract which has its two important limbs

namely,   offer   and   acceptance    came      up   for   consideration   in   Trimex

International (supra), where it is stated that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "Unless an inference can be drawn from the facts that the parties intended
      to be bound only when a formal agreement had been executed, the validity
      of the agreement would not be affected by its lack of formality".



      In Currimbhoy &amp; Co. (supra), at page 31 of the report, it is stated:

      "Where the documents or letters relied on as constituting a contract

      contemplate the execution of a further contract between the parties, it is a

      question of construction whether the execution of the further contract is a

      condition or term of the bargain or whether it is a mere expression of the

      desire of the parties as to the manner in which the transaction already

      agreed to will in fact go through. In the former case there is no enforceable
       contract either because the condition is unfulfilled or because the law does

      not recognize a contract to enter into a contract. In the latter case there is a

      binding contract and the reference to the more formal document may be

      ignored."</blockquote><p id="p_27">



</p><p id="p_28">      In the instant case, the parties have already agreed to the manner in which

they would perform and discharge their obligations inasmuch as the agreement

dated 19th March, 1977 was acted upon. It contains all the essential terms,

namely, the duration of the lease and the lease rent that            it needs to be

incorporated in the lease agreement.       The petitioners were ad idem on such

essential terms.     The execution of the lease deed on completion of the

construction of godowns was a mere formality. The parties by their conduct have

never intended that they would not be bound by the earlier agreement or perform

their obligations unless a formal agreement is entered into after construction of

the godowns.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      The intention of the parties in the instant case is clear, from the oral and

documentary evidence, that upon completion of the godowns the appellant would

take on hire all the godowns of lease initially for a period of 5 years. The intention

of the defendant to take on hire is also established by their conduct as well as

from the communication made by the appellant to various authorities including

the plaintiff. There was no explanation offered by the appellant for not taking

over possession of the 18 godowns out of the 20 godowns. In fact, two godowns

under the same agreement were taken over without any protest or murmur. The
 appellant did not allege that the construction of the remaining godowns were

defective or not suitable or not in accordance with the agreement. The defendant

having extended the time with the intention to take over the said godowns on hire

cannot now be allowed to contend that the time to complete construction of the

said godowns had expired.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      We have not been shown any evidence which would show that the

appellant prior to the filing of the writ or the present suit had denied their

obligation to be performed under the agreement dated 19th March, 1977 and/or

subsequent promises or any evidence to show that the godowns constructed for

the FCI were defective or not in accordance with the specifications of FCI. That

conduct can play a vital role in drawing an inference of a contract as has been

discussed in <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_4">Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited vs. Great Eastern

Shipping Company Ltd</a>. reported at (2008) 1 SCC 503. In paragraph 19 of the

report it is stated that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "It is, no doubt, true that the general rule is that an offer is not accepted by
      mere silence on the part of the offeree, yet it does not mean that an
      acceptance always has to be given in so many words.              Under certain
      circumstances offeree's silence, coupled with his conduct which takes the
      form of a positive act, may constitute an acceptance - an agreement sub
      silentio. Therefore, the terms of a contract between the parties can be proved
      not only by their words but also by their conduct."</blockquote><p id="p_31">



</p><p id="p_32">      Although the appellant did not advance any argument at the time of final

hearing of the suit, the learned Single Judge has taken into consideration the

aforesaid communications and the other evidence before arriving at a conclusion
 that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the 18 godowns that were ready

for delivery. The learned Single Judge did not allow the entirety of the claim but

restricted the claim to 18 months for the period of August, 1978 to October 1980.

The learned Single Judge has taken into consideration that the defendant by

their conduct had extended the period of completion of godowns and the

defendant no.1 having extended such period could not now refuse to accept the

said godowns on the ground of delay in construction by the plaintiff. The defence

of the defendant no.1 that the construction was not in accordance with the

specifications was also found to be without substance as the document would

speak otherwise and in this regard the learned Single Judge has referred to

Exhibit R which would show that as late as in 1980 the appellant was in

discussion for taking over of the said godowns. Although we were not shown any

deficiency in the construction but even if it is assumed that there were minor

deficiencies, the evidence would show that the deficiencies were not of such

nature which would prevent the appellant to take possession of the godowns or

to use the said godowns for storing the foodgrains. The use and purpose of the

said godowns would in no way be affected. The defendant also could not at the

trial establish any such significant deficiency which could be a reason for refusal

to take possession. On the contrary, there is evidence on record to show that the

plaintiff, in fact, had offered to rectify all the minor defects in the construction to

which there was no response from the appellant. The appellant did not produce

any evidence to show that they refused to take possession due to alleged defects

in the construction. As mentioned earlier all the godowns were constructed under
 the supervision of FCI with the intention to take over the said godowns on

completion on lease for minimum 5 years; and when all the godowns were made

ready for delivery, the defendant refused to take possession of 18 godowns out of

20 godowns. The plaintiff had immediately approached the court for mitigation

of loss and damages. The learned Single Judge has taken into consideration such

fact before determining the compensation. The learned Single Judge only allowed

compensation from May 1979 till October 1980 (incorrectly stated from August

1978 till October 1980) for 18 months and not for the balance claim. The learned

Single Judge has also directed the release of the rent in respect of two godowns

which were kept in the fixed deposit account in terms of earlier orders.

</p><p id="p_33">      On the basis of the aforesaid discussion we do not find any infirmity in the

judgment and decree passed by the learned Single Judge. The said judgment and

decree is affirmed. The appellant/defendant no. 1 is liable to pay rent @ 40 paise

per sq. ft. on 2,50,266 sq. ft. from May 1979 till October 1980 for 18 months

(0.40 X 2,58,266 X 18) aggregating to a sum of Rs.18,59,515.20. The impugned

decree stands corrected to the aforesaid extent.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      In view of the pendency of the appeal, the time for making payment of the

decreetal dues is extended by one month from date. In default, the plaintiff would

be entitled to interest at 6% per annum on the sum of Rs. 18,59,515.20p on and

from November 1, 1980 till the date of realization, as was directed by the learned

Single Judge. It is also reiterated that the plaintiff shall be entitled to release of

the rent deposited in respect of the two godowns of which the defendant no. 1

had possession. The plaintiff will, therefore, be entitled to the proceeds of the
 fixed deposit made by the Advocate-on-Record of the defendant no. 1 together

with all accruals thereto, as directed by the learned Single Judge.

</p><p id="p_35">      The appeal stands dismissed. However there shall be no order as to costs.

      Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the

parties on the usual undertakings.
