</p><p id="p_4">      3.     While considering the office objections, I have

heard learned counsel for petitioners, Sri Mathews Joseph

Nedumpara at length on the prayers sought by the

petitioners in this writ petition as the office objections

constitutional functionaries, as respondents in the writ

petition.

filed in private interest and not in public interest.

Petitioner   Nos.1 and      2 are stated       to be       practicing

advocates and claim to be eligible to be appointed as

Judges of this Court or any other High Court. Petitioner

No.3 is not an advocate, but has joined petitioner Nos.1

and 2 and they have sought the following reliefs:

Collegium system of appointment, in so far
as it denies equal opportunities to the first
generation lawyers, the sons and daughters

the High Court of Karnataka, mandates

the High Court of Karnataka has not merely
meant denial of opportunities to the first

also denied right to access to justice; so too
denial of speedy justice inasmuch as the 32
vacancies as against the total strength of 62
Judges as on today in the High Court of
Karnataka has meant literal shutting down of
the Honorable High Court; vide "Annexure-

<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">        5.       Succinctly stated, petitioners have sought a

declaration that provision of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Article 14</a> of the Constitution

of India applies in the matter of selection and appointment

of Judges of the High Courts and Supreme Court. That the

appointment of Judges of the High Courts and Supreme

Court must be through advertisement/notification of the

vacancies in the august offices by inviting applications

from        eligible        and        desirous          persons       and     on

recommendations and references from the members of the

Bar, Bar Associations, sitting and retired Judges, political

parties and other stakeholders etc. Petitioners have also

sought filling up of the vacancies in the office of the Judges

of   this    Court     by        not    denying     opportunities        to   first

generation lawyers and such other persons mentioned in

the prayer        column.          Petitioners have           also    sought a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            -: 9 :-</span>


direction to respondent Nos.1 to 6 to cause notification of

the vacancies in the august office of the Judges of the High

Court of Karnataka and invite applications from eligible

persons and thereafter to fill-up the vacancies.


</p><p id="p_12">      6.     As already noted, this writ petition is not filed

in public interest, but in private interest and in fact,

learned counsel for the petitioners has expressly stated

that petitioner Nos.1 and 2 are eligible to be considered as

Judges of this Court. But petitioner No.3 is stated to be a

common man and though his qualifications are not

mentioned in the writ petition, he is not an advocate. In

the circumstances, petitioner No.3 cannot be a person

aggrieved so as to claim the reliefs as extracted above in

private    interest.   Hence,   office   objection   regarding

petitioner No.3 is sustained. On that short ground alone,

writ petition of petitioner No.3 is dismissed by placing

reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_6">Jasbhai Motibhai Desai vs. Roshan Kumar,

Haji Bashir Ahmed and others</a> [AIR 1976 SC 578].


</p><p id="p_13">      7.     In the aforesaid decision, it has been held that

before a person can invoke a relief by way of a writ of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                           -: 10 :-</span>


certiorari as a petitioner, he should be an "aggrieved

person" and in a case of defect of jurisdiction, such a

petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of certiorari as a

matter of course. If he does not fulfill that character, and

is a "stranger", the Court will, in its discretion, deny him

the   extraordinary     remedy,     save    in    very    special

circumstances. That the expression "aggrieved person"

denotes an elastic, and to an extent, an elusive concept.

However, some general tests have been devised to

ascertain as to whether an applicant is eligible for this

category so as to have the necessary locus standi or

standing to invoke certiorari jurisdiction. One would be

held to be "aggrieved" by a decision if that decision is

materially adverse to him. Normally, one is required to

establish that one has been denied or deprived of

something to which one is legally entitled to in order to

make one "a person aggrieved".          The Hon'ble Supreme

Court has categorized three categories of persons in the

context of locus standi and at paragraph Nos.36 and 37

has opined as under:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">            "36. It will be seen that in the context of locus
      standi to apply for a writ of certiorari, an applicant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                        -: 11 :-</span>


may ordinarily fall in any of these categories; (i)
'person aggrieved'; (ii) 'stranger'; (iii) busybody of
meddlesome interloper. Persons in the last category
are easily distinguishable from those coming under
the first two categories. Such persons interfere in
things which do not concern them. They masquerade
as crusaders for justice. They pretend to act in the
name of Pro Bono Publico, though they have no
interest of the public or even of their own to protect.
They indulge in the past-time of meddling with the
judicial process either by force or habit or from
improper motives. Often, they are actuated by a
desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity; while the
ulterior intent of some applicants in this category,
may be no more than spoking the wheels of
administration. The High Court should do well to
reject the applications of such busybodies at the
threshold.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">        37. The distinction between the first and
second categories of applicants, though real, is not
always well-demarcated. The first category has, as it
were, two concentric zones; a solid central zone of
certainty, and a grey outer circle of lessening
certainty in a sliding centrifugal scale, with an
outermost        nebulous     fringe      of   uncertainty.
Applicants falling within the central zone are those
whose    legal    rights    have   been    infringed.   Such
applicants undoubtedly stand in the category of
'persons aggrieved'. In the grey outer-circle the
bounds which separate the first category from the
second, intermix, interfuse and overlap increasingly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             -: 12 :-</span>


      in a centrifugal direction. All persons in this outer-
      zone may not be "persons aggrieved".
</p>
<p id="p_18">
      After   delineating   the   tests   between    "a   person

aggrieved" and a "stranger" and discussing the tests to

identify those petitioners who are "persons aggrieved" and

those who are "strangers", the Hon'ble Supreme Court

has   in   categorical   terms    held    that   busybodies    or

meddlesome interlopers have to be thrown out at the

threshold when they seek to file petitions in the garb of

seeking justice in public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">      8.      Though the aforesaid observations have been

made in the context of persons seeking relief in the form

of writ of certiorari, those observations are equally

applicable when a writ of mandamus or declaratory reliefs

are sought, as in the instant case. Applying the aforesaid

tests, it is held that petitioner No.3 herein is only a

busybody or a meddlesome interloper who has no interest

whatsoever in the subject matter of this writ petition and

has possibly lent his name to this writ petition only to grab

some publicity without having any stakes whatsoever in

the matter. Therefore, writ petition of respondent No.3 has

to be dismissed on the ground of said petitioner lacking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                              -: 13 :-</span>


locus standi in filing this writ petition by applying the

aforesaid dictum.      Accordingly, it is dismissed vis-à-vis

petitioner No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      9.    As far as petitioner Nos.1 and 2 are concerned,

they are stated to be practicing advocates, who also claim

to be eligible to be considered to the Office of Judge of this

Court or any other High Court. Be that as it may, having

regard to the prayers sought by petitioner Nos.1 and 2, it

is noted at the outset that these prayers are prima facie

inconsistent   with   the    recent   dictum    of   the   Hon'ble

Supreme     Court     in    the   case   of    Supreme      Court

<a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_7">Advocates-on-Record Association vs. Union of India</a>

[(2016) 5 SCC 1] (Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record

Association) also known as NJAC case, but also to the

judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Second

and Third Judges case. Therefore, this writ petition would

have to be dismissed on that score.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">      10.      Be that as it may, learned counsel for

petitioners insisted on making submissions and has made

certain submissions regarding the aforesaid verdicts of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court. Hence, the same are being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                            -: 14 :-</span>


considered.    Learned counsel for the petitioners drew my

attention to the fact that the dictum of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in NJAC case cannot be considered to be a

precedent having force of law under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_8">Article 141</a> of the

Constitution so as to be binding on other Courts in India.

He submitted, in fact, the said matter could not have been

maintained by filing a writ petition before the Hon'ble

Supreme     Court.   The   Hon'ble    Court   could   not   have

entertained such a challenge in the said writ petition.

Therefore, the judgment rendered in the said case cannot

be considered to be law of the land. According to learned

counsel for petitioner Nos.1 and 2, the principle of res

judicata cannot be applied to this writ petition so as to be

dismissed on that ground. He further contended that the

said judgment in NJAC case is per incuriam and therefore,

for that reason also is not good law and therefore, not a

binding precedent.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">      11.     Learned counsel for the petitioners also drew

my attention to the dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the Second and Third Judges case, Supreme Court

<a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_9">Advocates-on-Record Association vs. Union of India</a>

[(1993) 4 SCC 441] (Nine Judge Bench) and Special
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                             -: 15 :-</span>


Reference No.1 of 1993, In re. [(1998)7 SCC 739]

(Nine Judge Bench) respectively to contend that there

cannot be judicial law making and that the provisions of

the Constitution in the matter of appointment of Judges to

the High Courts and Hon'ble Supreme Court could not have

been re-written by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.                He

contended, in the circumstances, the aforesaid dicta of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court not being law of the land under

<a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_10">Article 141</a> of the Constitution cannot operate as binding

precedent    and   hence,    they   cannot   be   relied   upon,

particularly having regard to the specific prayers sought by

the petitioners in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">      12.    Further, learned counsel for the petitioners

contended that the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the NJAC case has been rendered without issuing

notice to the general public and without petitioners herein

being heard. Therefore, the said judgment is not binding

on the petitioners and neither does it operate as res

judicata so as to disentitle consideration of this writ

petition on merits.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                             -: 16 :-</span><p id="p_29">


</p><p id="p_30">      13.     I have given my anxious consideration to the

submissions made by learned counsel for the petitioners.

As already noted, the writ petition is heard at length even

while considering the office objections raised by the

Registry of this Court as they appear to be intertwined with

the merits of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">      14.     Before answering the contentions of learned

counsel for the petitioners, it would be useful to refer to

the relevant provisions of the Constitution having a

bearing on the matter.

appointment of Judges of High Court and Supreme Court,

their transfer and other related questions arose for the first

time before a seven Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/1979462/" id="a_16">S.P.Gupta and others vs.

Union of India and others</a> [AIR 1982 SC 149]

(S.P.Gupta).   In the said case, the question regarding

locus standi of the petitioners to file those petitions was

considered at length and it was held that writ petitions

were maintainable as it was a litigation affecting the

judiciary and lawyers had interest and locus standi to file

the petitions on the strength of the above reason and

those writ petitions were considered on merits.                The

Hon'ble Supreme Court, by a majority held that in the

matter of appointment of Judges, the Executive and not

the Chief Justice of India had a primacy. All Judges of the

Bench    agreed      that   consultation      with   constitutional

functionaries must be meaningful and result oriented and

that the proposal for appointment of a Judge could
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                            -: 19 :-</span>


emanate from any of the constitutional functionaries.          It

was   also    unanimously      agreed    that   none     of   the

constitutional functionaries can exercise veto.          On the

question whether the opinion of the Chief Justice of India

enjoyed      primacy    over     the    other     constitutional

functionaries, by a majority of 4:3, it was held that

primacy should not be given to the opinion of the Chief

Justice of India, while the minority view was in favour of

the primacy with the Chief Justice of India.


</p><p id="p_37">      17.    The said decision was reconsidered in the

Second Judges case, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court

brought in the concept of participatory consultative process

by overruling the dictum in S.P.Gupta on the question of

primacy of the role of Chief Justice of India in the matter

of inter alia, appointment of Judges to the High Courts and

the Supreme Court.        The conclusions in the said case

having a bearing herein are extracted as under:

Justice of India. This is the manner in which

</p><p id="p_48">     The Supreme Court in the said case held, the

process for selecting the best and most suitable persons

available for appointment. That all the constitutional

view primarily to reach an agreed decision, subserving the

constitutional purpose, so that the occasion of primacy

does not arise.   The Supreme Court, in the said case,

enunciated several principles with regard to the manner of

initiation of the proposal for appointment and process of

appointment of Judges of the High Court and Supreme

Court. The majority opinion in S.P.Gupta's case insofar as

it took a contrary view relating to the primacy of the

opinion of the Chief Justice of Supreme Court of India in

the   Hon'ble    Supreme        Court     varied   the        extent   of

the sole or individual opinion of the Chief Justice of India

does not constitute consultation within the meaning of

Articles 217(2) and 222(1) of the Constitution.                  In the

Constitution (99th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_17">Amendment) Act</a>, 2014 and the National

Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014, which is a

subject matter of another decision by Five Hon'ble Judges

of the Supreme Court popularly referred to as NJAC case.

In the said decision, by a majority of 4:1, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court rejected the prayer for reconsideration by

way of a fresh scrutiny, the dicta in the Second and Third

Judges cases by reference to a Larger Bench. In fact, in

NJAC case, learned Attorney General for India contended

that the conclusions drawn in the Second and Third Judges

cases needed reconsideration and therefore, the matter be

referred to a Larger Bench.       The said contention was

repelled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court by observing that

such a contention could not be canvassed on behalf of the

Union of India as in the Third Judges case, the Union of

India had consciously accepted as binding the judgment

rendered in the Second Judges case. But on the insistence

of the learned Attorney General, it was suggested by the

Bench   of   the   Hon'ble      Supreme   Court   that   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                            -: 26 :-</span>


determination by the Hon'ble Court in the Second Judges

case would not prejudice the claim of Union of India, if the

Union could establish that the "basic structure" of the

Constitution, namely, the "independence of the judiciary"

would not stand compromised by the Constitution (99th

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_18">Amendment) Act</a>.       It was further observed that if the

learned Attorney General was successful in persuading the

Hon'ble Court that the Judgment in the Second Judges

case   did   not   prima    facie    lay     down   the   correct

legal/constitutional position, the matter would have to be

examined by a Constitution Bench, with the strength of

nine or more Judges, only if, the Court would additionally

uphold the challenge to the impugned constitutional

amendment, and strike down the same, failing which the

new regime would replace the erstwhile system. The

Hon'ble Supreme Court declared that the Constitution (99th

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_19">Amendment)     Act</a>,   2014     and     the    National    Judicial

Appointments Commission Act, 2014 as unconstitutional

and void. The Hon'ble Supreme Court declared that the

system of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court

and High Courts and transfer of High Court Judges as

existing prior to the Constitution (99th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_20">Amendment) Act</a>,

2014 called the Collegium system, to be operative. It is in

light of the aforesaid dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,

the   prayers   sought   by   the    petitioners   herein   and

contentions of their learned counsel are being considered,

lest it be viewed or contended that this Court refused to

consider petitioners' contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">      19.    At the outset, it is necessary to observe that

the appointment of a Judge of High Court or the Hon'ble

Supreme Court is by invitation. It is popularly called as an

elevation.   It is, having regard to the constitutional

provisions referred to above. This is because, the Office of

a Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court is a

constitutional position or Office and not a post in the

service of the State. Having regard to the scheme of the

Constitution and Constitutional Jurisprudence, it is only

where the posts are earmarked as services under a State

in the matter of filling up of such posts, the system of

recruitment or by way of promotion, as the case may be,

arises depending upon the particular rules of recruitment

or promotion, as the case may be, being applicable to a

particular post. Thus, as far as the appointment to the

post of a Judge of High Court or the Supreme Court is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                 -: 28 :-</span>


concerned, one has to be guided by the provisions of the

Constitution,    the   constitutional      conventions    and    the

verdicts of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which have been

integrated into the said constitutional provisions.


</p><p id="p_64">      20.      In the instant case, petitioner Nos.1 and 2 who

claim to be eligible and deserving to be appointed as

Judges of this Court or Judges of any other High Court

have sought for a declaration that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution     applies   in    the   matter   of   selection   and

appointment of Judges of the High Courts and Supreme

Court. The said contention is noticed only to be rejected.

As already observed, appointment to the Office of a Judge

of a High Court or Supreme Court is not a recruitment or a

promotion, but filling up of the said Office by invitation on

the basis of merit, competency and standing in the legal

profession as an advocate at the Bar or as a District Judge

in the case of a High Court Judge and on the basis of

experience, ability, competency and reputation of a Judge

of a High Court or a member of the Bar or of a person who

is considered to be an eminent Jurist in the case of

appointment of a Supreme Court Judge. The Chief Justice

of India and the Chief Justice of the High Court are, in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                          -: 29 :-</span>


words of Hon'ble Verma J., (as he then was) in the Second

Judges case, "best equipped to know and assess the worth

of a candidate, and his suitability for appointment as a

superior judge."
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">      21.   Petitioners have also sought advertisement of

the notification of vacancies and invitation of applications

from eligible persons. They have also sought that anybody

who is eligible and deserving to be appointed could be

recommended by the members of the Bar Association,

sitting and retired Judges, political parties and other

stakeholders etc., and the names thus received could be

short listed and objections received from the general public

and thereafter, be appointed as Judges of this Court or of

any other High Courts.     Such a course of action is not

contemplated either under the Constitution of India or in

any of the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

touching upon the subject. As already observed, the Office

of a Judge of Superior Judiciary (High Court and Supreme

Court) is not a post to be filled by recruitment or by way of

promotion as is the practice vis-à-vis a service under the

State. The said Offices are filled by invitation extended to

able and competent men and women based on merit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                               -: 30 :-</span>


irrespective of their class, caste, religion, place of birth or

their family background or the professions their parents

pursued or pursue.         What is of utmost importance is the

reputation the candidates to be appointed as Judges

command        and    their   ability   inter    alia,   to    uphold

independence of the Judiciary and be committed to the

cause of Justice, which are the quintessence of the duties

of a Judge at whatever level he/she may be discharging

such duties.     This is succinctly reflected in the Oath of

Office that is administered to a Judge of a High Court or

Supreme Court. It would not be out of place, but apposite

to quote from the opinion of Venkataramiah J., in

S.P.Gupta at paragraph No.1051 as under, although the

said decision is overruled on the aspect of primacy of the

role of Chief Justice of India in the matter of appointments

to the office of Judges of High Courts and Supreme Court:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "1051. It is important to bear in mind that the
      independence of the judiciary is one of the central
      values on which our Constitution is based. No other
      constitutional agency is shielded as are the superior
      courts   in    our   country   with   so   many    built-in
      safeguards. The judges can, if they choose to, be
      guided by the doctrine of conscience only while
      discharging their duties. They are not expected to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                           -: 31 :-</span>


     be under any kind of external pressure. They are
     circumscribed by 'expectations of neutrality and
     impartiality' and by the traditions of the legal
     profession which is always keeping a watchful eye
     on every action of a Judge. In all countries where
     the rule of law prevails and the power to adjudicate
     upon disputes between a man and a man, a man
     and the State, a State and a State, and a State and
     the Centre, is entrusted to a judicial body, it is
     natural that such body should be assigned a status
     free from capricious or whimsical interference from
     outside and the judges who constitute it should be
     granted a security of tenure that lifts them above
     the fear of acting against their conscience."</blockquote><p id="p_67">


</p><p id="p_68">     22.     Thus, the above prayers sought by the

petitioners herein are blatantly opposed to the law laid

down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court with regard to the

manner of appointment of Judges to High Courts and

Supreme Court and as to what has been reasoned by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the dicta referred to above.

When the Constitution has prescribed a particular mode of

appointment of Judges to the High Courts as well as

Hon'ble Supreme Court, which have been considered and a

system of appointment has been integrated into the

provisions of the Constitution by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, which has been further emphasized in the NJAC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                             -: 32 :-</span>


case, petitioners cannot seek a different method of

appointment of Judges to be adopted to High Courts as

well as the Supreme Court. The aforesaid prayers sought

by the petitioners being in absolute contradiction to the

law as it exists presently have to be rejected having regard

to the aforesaid dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.


</p><p id="p_69">       23.    Of course, learned counsel for the petitioners

contended that the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, particularly in NJAC case is not law within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_22">Article 141</a> of the Constitution and therefore,

the same cannot be relied upon by this Court so as to

thwart the prayers sought by the petitioners. It is further

contended that the Hon'ble Supreme Court could not have

entertained the said writ petition as the issues raised in

the said writ petition were not justiciable.      The aforesaid

contentions have to be out rightly rejected for the

following reasons.     Firstly, the judgment of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in NJAC case has been delivered as a

challenge was made to the Constitution (99th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_23">Amendment)

Act</a>,   2014    and    the   National   Judicial   Appointments

Commission Act, 2014 and the vires of the constitutional

amendment       and   the   Parliamentary    Legislation   were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                            -: 33 :-</span>


assailed   by    the   Supreme    Court    Advocates-on-Record

Association. The validity of the same had to be considered

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and hence, the writ petition

was entertained by the Supreme Court as the matter was

justiciable. The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

NJAC case has laid down the law by striking down the

constitutional     amendment        and     the    Parliamentary

Legislation being unconstitutional and void and declaring

that the system of appointment of Judges and of Supreme

Court and High Courts and transfer of High Court Judges

as it existed prior to the constitutional amendment and

Parliamentary     Legislation   i.e.,   through   the   Collegium

system was operative.      The law declared by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in NJAC case is a binding precedent within

the meaning of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_24">Article 141</a> of the Constitution and to be

followed by all Courts in the Country. This is particularly

so, in the absence of there being any argument advanced

in support of the contention that the said decision is per

incuriam and therefore, not a binding precedent.            Even

otherwise, this Court would not permit any such argument

to be advanced in the absence of there being any reason

to do so. The binding precedents, which are authoritative
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                           -: 34 :-</span>


in nature and are meant to be applied, should not be

ignored on application of the doctrine of per incuriam or

sub silentio without assigning specific reasons therefor vide

</p><p id="p_71">      24.   The further argument of learned counsel for

the petitioners that this writ petition cannot be rejected on

the ground of res judicata, as the petitioners herein were

not parties to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in NJAC case is wholly misconceived argument.               It is

unnecessary to elaborate on the principles of res judicata

herein, but it is emphasized that a decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme     Court   on   the   validity   of   a   constitutional

amendment and the vires of a Parliamentary Legislation is

binding on all Courts in India by virtue of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_26">Article 141</a> of the

Constitution and the doctrine of stare decisis applies in the

matter of applicability of all decisions of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court on all other Courts in India. Judicial

discipline to abide by declaration of law by the Supreme

Court cannot be forsaken under any pretext by any

authority or Court, be it even the highest Court in the

State, oblivious to <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_27">Article 141</a> of the Constitution vide

<a href="/doc/908828/" id="a_28">State of Orissa vs. Dhaniram Luhar</a> [(2004) 5 SCC

568].       Further, where the decision rendered by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court had concluded the controversy, it

is not permissible for any party or any Tribunal or Court,

including the High Court to re-open the issue and to record

a contrary finding vide <a href="/doc/456157/" id="a_29">U.P. State Road Transport

Corporation vs. State of U.P</a>. [(2005) 1 SCC 444]. In

the circumstances, the aforesaid contentions of learned

counsel for petitioners is wholly devoid of any merit and is

rejected.

<p id="p_72">
</p><p id="p_73">      25.    But   learned     counsel   for   the    petitioners

vehemently submitted that the judgments of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Second and Third Judges cases cannot

be considered to be binding precedent.          That question

cannot be considered at this point of time as the

judgments     in   the   aforementioned    cases     have   been

considered in extenso in NJAC case. Further, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court entertained the challenge in NJAC case and

has decided the matter and the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court is having regard to the ratio of the

decisions in the Second and Third Judges cases, which

have been held to be good law and followed. Moreover,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                            -: 36 :-</span>


the dicta in the Second and Third Judges cases were by

Larger Benches and the same have been held to be in

operation by a Five Judge Bench in NJAC case. Thus, the

contentions raised by the petitioners are lacking in merit

for the aforesaid reasons.

<p id="p_74">
</p><p id="p_75">        26.   No other contention was raised by learned

counsel appearing for the petitioners.


</p><p id="p_76">        27.   As I find no merit in the writ petition, the same

is dismissed.

<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">        28.   Before parting with this case, I express with a

sense    of anguish,    petitioner   Nos.1   and   2 who   are

practicing advocates have initiated this writ petition. It is

unfortunate that petitioner Nos.1 and 2 who contend that

they are eligible and seek to be considered for elevation

have filed such a petition. The filing of this writ petition is

ingenious, misconceived and possibly filed to attract

publicity and with a reckless intention to re-open what is a

closed chapter on the aspect of appointment of Judges to

High Courts and Supreme Court. I say no more and I

refrain from imposing costs.

objections do not survive for further consideration.       The

consideration of this writ petition and its dismissal shall not

be construed as giving any finding on the objection

regarding arraigning of respondent Nos.1 to 4 herein as

respondents in the writ petition.
