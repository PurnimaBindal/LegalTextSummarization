HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KAILASH GAMBHIR
IA No. 11467/2012 in CS (OS) No. 1834/2012

1.      By this order, I shall dispose of the application filed by

        the plaintiff under order 39 Rule 1&amp; 2 of the Code of Civil

        Procedure, 1908      seeking     ad interim    injunction against

        the telecast of a television commercial           of defendant‟s

        Lifebuoy Soap, which as per the plaintiff is disparaging and

        denigrating the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff in the

        commercial market.
I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 1 of 65
 2.     The plaintiff has filed the present suit for permanent and

       mandatory injunction, being aggrieved by the defendant‟s

       television commercial which allegedly depicts a child being

       sick because of the usage of Dettol as an antiseptic liquid in

       bathing water. The advertisement starts with the doctor

       entering the house of a sick child where he inquires about the

       hygiene habits of the child from his parents and also if the

       child takes bath regularly. To which the parents respond in

       affirmative and explain that they even dilute "2 dhakkans" of

       antiseptic liquid in the bucket of water. The next screen shot

       shows liquid being poured into the bucket of bathing water,

       the bottle of which is virtually identical in shape to the

       bottle used by the plaintiff for its „Dettol‟ antiseptic liquid.

       The liquid when poured into water becomes milky (cloudy)

       exactly like the plaintiff‟s product, which according to the

       plaintiff is the exclusive feature of the product. The

       advertisement thereafter proceeds to show that the plaintiff‟s

       product is completely ineffective in warding off infections

       and illness, which as per the plaintiff is a malafide on


I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                 Page 2 of 65
        defendant‟s part, trouncing the goodwill of the plaintiff in

       the market. It further proceeds to compare the defendant‟s

       cosmetic toilet soap with the plaintiff‟s antiseptic liquid as

       being "100% Better germ Protector". It is averred that

       intention behind the commercial is malicious, especially in

       view of the trade literature which shows that Dettol captures

       85% of the market and is a market leader in the segment of

       antiseptic liquid being sold in India.

3.     With the liberalization and globalization of the Indian

       economy, firms have been aggressively and          vigorously

       promoting their products and services. In a comparative

       environment, every representation of a product or service is

       about what „others are not.‟ These practices raise questions

       about candour and fairness of representation of products and

       services. In our country, the advertising industry in order to

       reconnoitre and promote a particular product, does not hold

       back in spending millions of dollars on advertising and

       marketing. Advertising is a subsection of marketing, a form

       of communication intended to persuade people to purchase


I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012               Page 3 of 65
        the products or the services of a particular brand. The

       discerning fact is that in such a competitive market, effective

       advertising techniques are being incorporated to promote

       one‟s product with addition of high profile names like

       various actors and renowned personalities, nonetheless it is

       an indubitable fact that we get swayed by the reflecting

       names in the advertisements and tend to develop a parlous

       connect with the actors endorsing the products as they are

       the idol for their aficionadas. Through the entire process,

       television makes a major contribution, beginning with

       awareness, where it makes its greatest impact. When spoken

       of media boosted awareness, a survey shows that 43% of

       those questioned said television, as in our society especially

       the middle class, relates highly to the television promotions.

       It is one of the influential modes that monitors and captures

       the major segment of the society. And particularly when the

       product is being endorsed by a well-known cinestar, the

       advertisement campaign or visual media creates an

       immediate impact on the viewers and possibly purchaser's


I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                Page 4 of 65
         mind. We as mere viewers easily get blind folded and

        „duped‟. Therefore, this medium of promotion should be

        used very carefully and painstakingly, wherein in the garb of

        promoting one‟s product, it has no right to disparage or

        denigrate its competitor‟s product. Therefore, when any such

        discrepancy is noticed, the issue in question has to be looked

        from the view point of an ordinary person of average

        intelligence.

4.      A BRIEF CONSPECTUS OF FACTS, AS PER THE

        PLAINT:

      i.       The plaintiff (Reckitt Benckiser) is an internationally

               renowned corporation and through its subsidiaries and

               affiliate companies operates in several countries around

               the world.

     ii.       The business comprises of various consumer and

               healthcare products including antiseptic liquid, toilet care

               products,    surface    care   products,   pharmaceuticals,

               insecticides, and food products which bear world famous

               trademarks including Harpic, Dettol, Mortein, Cherry

               Blossom.

I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                     Page 5 of 65
     iii.       Incorporated on July 5, 1951 Reckitt Coleman and

               Benckiser, pursuant to the world wide merger between

               Reckitt Coleman Plc and Benckiser, a Dutch company, the

               name of the Plaintiff changed from Reckitt &amp; Coleman

               India Ltd. to Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd.

    iv.        Plaintiff is the manufacturer of the famous antiseptic

               liquid DETTOL for over 70 years. „Dettol‟ antiseptic

               liquid has an unparalleled medical history of capturing

               over 85 % of the market in India in this segment.

     v.        The active ingredient of „Dettol‟ liquid is chloroxylenol

               (PCMX). The other ingredient includes isopropyl alcohol,

               pine oil, castor oil soap, caramel, water basically used for

               first aid purpose. The exclusive attribute of the said

               trademark is - its amber gold colour and the fact that it

               becomes milky when diluted in water. Also, the packaging

               of DETTOL is distinct, having a sword on the pack that

               acts as a mnemonic for fighting against germs and

               infection.


    vi.        „Dettol‟ has a vast usage, it can be added to bathing water

               in order to kill germs, used for shaving purposes, nappy

               wash, surgical, medical, midwifery and epidemics, first aid
I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 6 of 65
                purposes etc, owing to the popularity of the product, the

               plaintiff has launched a website by the name -

               www.dettol.co.in.


   vii.        The sales figure of the plaintiff „s DETTOL Antiseptic

               Liquid in the market for the last three years is as follows:


       YEAR                  SALES           FIGURES VOLUME (KILO-

                             (RUPEES/MILLION)           LITRE

       2010                  13931                            1795

       2011                  14333                             1903



     viii.    Television commercial introduced by the defendant is

              disparaging the antiseptic liquid of the plaintiff by

              comparing it with its lifebuoy bar soap, defendant‟s

              product.

    ix.        The impugned advertisement features all the aspects which

               clearly demonstrate that the defendant has copied the

               peculiar features borne by the plaintiff‟s product and in

               order to    attain market recognition over the plaintiff‟s



I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                      Page 7 of 65
                product, defendant has tried to disparage the plaintiff‟s

               product.

     x.        The peculiar features that have been copied are:

               a.     visual of a liquid that is being poured is of the same

                      colour as that of the plaintiff‟s product.

               b.     The liquid is poured from a bottle which is virtually

                      identical to that of the plaintiff‟s antiseptic liquid

                      bottle.

               c.     The liquid when poured into water becomes milky

                      exactly like the plaintiff‟s product.

               d.     Thereafter, the advertisement claims plaintiff‟s

                      product to be completely ineffective in warding off

                      germs whereas shows that lifebuoy gives "100%

                      germ protection."

    xi.        Virtually identical advertisement was issued by the

               Defendant‟s group in South Africa and by a detailed order

               passed by the Advertising Standards Authority of South

               Africa, the respondent therein (defendant herein) was</pre>

<p id="p_1">               directed to withdraw the claims made by it.
</p>
<p id="p_2">   xii.        The language used by the father of the sick child in the

               advertisement emphasising on "nahane ke paani mein „do
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                         Page 8 of 65</span>
                  dhakkan‟ antiseptic liquid" clearly indicates towards

                 Dettol.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     xiii.       No other liquid except „Dettol‟ create a cloud formation

                 when diluted in water.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     xiv.        The disclaimer flashing below the screen in the television

                 commercial is also very vague and blurred.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           A BRIEF CONSPECTUS OF FACTS, AS PER THE

             WRITTEN STATEMENT:
</p>
<p id="p_6">        i.       No reference to Dettol antiseptic liquid has been made in

                 the impugned advertisement and the impugned television

                 commercial contains no reference to the brand name or

                 product of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       ii.       The assertions of the plaintiff in its plaint are baseless and

                 their fallacy is evident from the snapshots of the

                 advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      iii.       Shape of the bottle shown in the impugned advertisement

                 is different from that of the plaintiff and the shoulders of

                 the bottle do not possess a continuous curve rather there is

                 a square curve that angles at the edges.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      iv.        Right from drinks to refreshments to cleaning liquids,

                 clouds of various colours are formed upon their being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                        Page 9 of 65</span>
                    mixed with water. As a matter of fact, such clouds are

                   formed when many other products are mixed with water

                   such as comfort fabric conditioner, milk etc. Therefore, the

                   cloud formation is not peculiarly associated to the

                   plaintiff‟s product.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       v.          The impugned advertisement also carries the disclaimer

                   that "graphic visualization does not represent any branded

                   antiseptic liquid in the market. Characteristic of generic

                   antiseptic liquid."
</p>
<p id="p_11">      vi.          Label shown in the advertisement is white in colour, and

                   not white green as contented by the plaintiff.

     vii.          Bathing with lifebuoy total soap and water removes more

                   germs than bathing with diluted antiseptic liquid.

     viii.         The defendant‟s admit that 53%of household at some

                   point use only antiseptic liquid      diluted in water for

                   bathing purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       ix.         The references to the order passed by the Advertising

                   Standards Authority, South Africa is irrelevant.

</p><p id="p_13">6.           Addressing arguments on the present application, Mr.Lall,

             learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the present case

             is filed on the three principle grounds: (i) the advertisement is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                          Page 10 of 65</span>
        against the public interest, (ii) generic disparagement of all the

       antiseptic liquids of which the plaintiff has a 85% market

       share, finally (iii) disparagement of the plaintiff‟s Dettol

       antiseptic liquid. Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff further

       added that the plaintiff is the owner of DETTOL, which is an

       antiseptic liquid, used for killing germs whereas Lifebuoy soap

       is a cosmetic product under the Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act, being a

       cosmetic product it does not bear the germ killing qualities and

       hence, comparing the two different products is out of the

       pretext of law.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">7.     Learned counsel further submitted that as far as antiseptic

       liquids are concerned, DETTOL rules over 85% of the market,

       Savalon 8.4% and Suthol 4.5%, in total 97 % of the market

       share is captured by these three antiseptic liquids and the

       survey for the same is placed on record. Referring to Page 2 of

       the plaint, which displays the screenshots of the advertisement

       in comparison to an antiseptic liquid, learned counsel

       submitted that only „Dettol‟ creates a clouding effect when

       poured in water and this is the exclusive feature stomached by

       the product that makes it so popular in the market and known
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 11 of 65</span>
        to the consumers. Ld. Counsel further submitted that on page 2

       itself the various antiseptic liquid bottles are shown, the

       recreation of Savlon and Suthol bottles- which are completely

       different if compared to „Dettol‟ and on a careful perusal, it

       would manifest that the bottle shown in the advertisement is

       quite similar to that of Dettol, it‟s quite evident from the

       structure that it‟s not Savlon, Suthol, or any other bottle of

       antiseptic liquid but „Dettol‟. The bottle of „Dettol‟ is so

       similar to that of the displayed one that the consumer would

       not be able to distinguish between the two and would presume

       the comparison is being made to the plaintiff‟s product. Also,

       the label is not clearly visible but the shape of the label, the

       curves are exactly similar and any amateur consumer would

       grasp the same to be identical in features to that of Dettol

       antiseptic liquid.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">8.     Counsel further submitted that the liquid inside the bottle is

       almost same in colour (Amber color), whereas SUTHOL is

       different (proper green) and Savlon is orange. Therefore, the

       consumers worldwide would definitely associate themselves to

       the product and the colour presence, they can relate so as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                 Page 12 of 65</span>
        what is the colour of Dettol. Counsel further submitted that the

       manner in which the lady holds the bottle in the advertisement

       and tilts it towards the bucket of water is similar to the

       advertisement of „Dettol‟ in particular, the design/label is white

       in colour which is same as that of the bottle of „Dettol‟,

       depicting another peculiar aspect of the two.


</p><p id="p_18">9.     Further, elaborating on the impugned advertisement, counsel

       submitted that the boy is repeatedly falling sick and compelling

       the parents to call the doctor, the doctor comes and asks the

       parents - "Does he take bath every day?", In reply the parents

       say - "Yes, we also put Two caps of antiseptic liquid in the

       bucket of bathing water". The Counsel submitted that to the

       general awareness of the public and going by the statistical

       report and survey, the liquid that the parents are referring to,

       can nonetheless be „Dettol‟ as Dettol alone has captured 85%

       of the market, this in itself constitutes gross disparagement.


</p><p id="p_19">10.    It is also the case of the plaintiff that the clouding effect,

       frequently used in the plaintiff‟s advertisement is the

       centrepiece of the whole story board, and is a peculiar attribute

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 13 of 65</span>
        borne by the plaintiffs product, a white cloud with the black

       background is an exclusive characteristic of the plaintiffs

       advertisement, which the defendants have copied and infringed

       upon, though there is a difference of colour (here the colour is

       yellow) and it‟s not a white cloud, however another important

       aspect is that Dettol is the only antiseptic liquid which bears

       this characteristic, none of the other antiseptic liquids so far in

       the knowledge of the plaintiffs bear this exclusive attribute of

       being transformed into the shape of cloud once diluted in

       water. The following points out ,that the defendant in their

       advertisement has copied all the peculiar features borne by the

       plaintiff‟s advertisement or its product, clearly demonstrating

       that it is the plaintiff‟s product that is being targeted and

       disparaged, following are the exclusive features that similar in

       the impugned advertisement:

<p id="p_20">
</p><pre id="pre_2">       a)      Cloud formation

       b)      Sick child

       liquid also lies where the doctor in the advertisement says-

       "ONLY TWO DHAKKANS", and that is the cause of sickness

       of the child. Counsel further submitted that it is a direct attack

       on the plaintiff‟s product. Counsel also submitted that in the

       Written Statement, the defendants have admitted that 53% of

       the population use antiseptic liquid in their bathing water.


</p><p id="p_22">12.    Counsel for the Plaintiff further submitted that in the judgment/

       order passed by the Advertising Standards Council, South

       Africa, which is a statutory body, vide order dated 30.05.2012

       has restrained the public display of defendant‟s advertisement.

       There also the same clouding effect was shown, which was

       white and in India it has been made yellow only after suffering

       an injunction in South Africa. Learned Counsel further

       submitted that the said order is under challenge, though there is

       no stay.

<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">13.     Learned Counsel further submitted that the word "dhakkan"

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       has a very adverse connotation in Hindi language, at the very

       behest that Dettol is the only antiseptic liquid capturing the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 15 of 65</span>
        major market and the only antiseptic liquid with the similar

       advertisement who promotes the liquid by showing that the

       usage of Dettol is not just restricted to bathing water, but it is

       quite vast, in hospitals, for hygiene, to maintain clean

       surroundings etc. Dettol is used in almost every genre in order

       to maintain proper hygiene and clean atmosphere.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">14.     Elaborating on the attributes of the plaintiff‟s advertisement,

       Counsel submitted that in Dettol‟s advertisement, the toys are

       lying on the side of the sick child, and it goes like, the doctor

       says "if you must not be washing your child‟s toys with Dettol

       that is why he/she is falling sick" and the similar picture is

       framed even in defendant‟s advertisement wherein the toys are

       lying next to the sick child. The whole diagnosis is based on

       bathing, in plaintiff‟s advertisement the germs turn into a green

       colour and die, in the defendants advertisement also the germs

       are shown in green but they do not die, rather in the red

       (lifebuoy) shows all the germs are killed. Counsel further

       submitted that Lifebuoy only takes care of the allergens, just

       rubs off the germs from the body; it‟s a cosmetic product and

       not an antiseptic formula. In the „lifebuoy‟ advertisement, it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 16 of 65</span>
        shown that once the child takes bath with lifebuoy, he gets

       well, as the doctor says in the advertisement that "Lifebuoy

       antiseptic liquid se zyada kitanu nikalta hai." Counsel further

       submitted that the product of the defendants is highly

       misrepresented; it‟s a complete mischief, slack tactics to

       promote his product by disparaging plaintiff‟s goodwill in the

       market and the advertisement of the defendant‟s ends - "10

       infection wale kitanu ek suraksha", is completely hypothetical,

       illusionary, not true, saying 100% better protection than any

       other antiseptic liquid which is a frivolous and vexatious

       representation of their product.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">15.    Learned counsel further submitted that the order of the

       Advertising Standards Council shows basically how the two

       products have been substantiated and if it‟s been done in a

       similar manner, then the goods of the latter cannot suffer at the

       behest of the recent one.

               plaintiffs product, as behind DETTOLS bottle it's
               clearly shown that it has germ kill ability as that
               of .33%. At the same date, same laboratory, you
               take 8% lifebuoy sample concentration to show

               it's a clear admission on the part of the

               with the said product."

<p id="p_30">       Learned Counsel thus submitted that there has been a gross

       misrepresentation wherein the defendant has shown a crooked

       way of comparison, an honest comparison is not bad in law,

       display is wrong and not acceptable.

<p id="p_42">18.    Per contra, refuting the arguments of the plaintiff, Mr.Sandeep

       Sethi , learned Senior Advocate submitted that the commercial

       advertisement actually depicts „two dhakkans‟ of antiseptic

       liquid in a bucket full of water may sanitize the water but

       would not clean the body, what is better than diluting „two

       dhakkans‟ of liquid is a bath with defendants soap. Therefore,

       the quantity of „2 dhakkans‟ does not give you hygienic bath,

       so for a better bath, the use of defendant‟s soap recommended.


</p><p id="p_43">19.    Ld. Senior Counsel further submitted that Principle of

       disparagement, requires the plaintiff to establish four aspects:


</p><p id="p_44">       a)      The impugned advertisement must refer or relate to the
               plaintiffs product.
</p>
<p id="p_45"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 19 of 65</span>
</p><p id="p_46">        b)      The statement made should be false altogether

</p><p id="p_47">       c)      That the statement should be maliciously made (intent to
               injure)

</p><p id="p_48">       d)      Plaintiff should show the actual damage suffered by the
               impugned advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_49">20.    Based on the above connotation, the learned senior advocate

       submitted that :
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">       a)      Impugned advertisement does not satisfy the first test as

               it nowhere relates or hits on the plaintiffs product Dettol.


</p><p id="p_52">       b)      Plaintiff has not even been able to demonstrate that any

               statement in their advertisement is false, as in the

               advertisement it has merely portrayed that our soap is

               better for hygienic bath. The plaintiff has not been able

               to prove that any of the statement made by the

               Defendant in the advertisement is false; therefore it also

               does not serve the purpose of the second test that has to

               be proved in order to ascertain disparagement,


</p><p id="p_53">       c)      That apart from failure of the plaintiff to prove these

               statements being false, the test reports filed by the

               plaintiffs itself, bears out the same to be true.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                         Page 20 of 65</span>
</p><p id="p_54"> 21.    Ld. Senior Counsel for the Defendant further submitted that in

       the test reports filed by the plaintiff itself, it can easily be

       made out that the statements made by the defendant in the

       advertisement are true and correct. Learned senior counsel

       further submitted that in the test report dated 6.6.2012, it is

       held that the "Dettol brown liquid diluted at 1:300 does result

       in some or no kill (3.3 log or below)."
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">22.     Learned Senior Advocate further depicting the label on

       Dettol‟s bottle, submitted that it clearly describes in what ratio

       the antiseptic liquid has to be used in various circumstances

       and it clearly illustrates the contradicting stand of the plaintiffs,

       as under the recommendation dilution level, it is given that

       only one teaspoon should be added to the bucket full of bathing

       water, instead of having 2 spoons in a mug of water. For ready

       reference, The dilution table is given below:


</p><p id="p_57">      First aid         Nappy wash           Shaving           bathing

      to   250     ml ml of water            of        shaving bucket full of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                        Page 21 of 65</span>
       water                                  water         H2O.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">23.    Learned Senior advocate further submitted that therefore, it is

       quite clear that for bathing purpose, no dilution level or ratio is

       prescribed, but it is simply written, bucket full of water, and as

       per their own criteria a bucket full of water would mean

       3000ml of water, edging the ratio to be 1:3000.This being their

       own recommendation, the test report of the plaintiffs at page

       115 is contradictory to this effect. The Ld. Senior Counsel

       further submitted that it is clearly shown that Dettol‟s advice to

       the consumers at the back of the bottle of dettol, is 1

       tablespoon in 200 ml of water (assuming the same to be a

       litre), it is quite manifest that a person if takes bath requires at

       least 15 litres of water, a minimum quantity a bucket can store,

       therefore even for bathing purposes the same ratio is given as

       what is prescribed for a mug of water for the purpose of

       shaving, i.e. 1 table spoon of Dettol in a bucket full of water.

       Counsel further submitted that if we even assume that in 1:200,

       one table spoon is diluted in 1 litre of water, that is almost a

       bottle of drinking water, one cannot take a bath with such small


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 22 of 65</span>
        quantity of water. Therefore, the plaintiffs very mischievously

       do not mention the dilution level in terms of taking a bath.


</p><p id="p_60">24.    Learned Senior counsel after placing reliance on various tests

       reports submitted that usual standard of germ kill with an

       effective antiseptic as per the European standards is 5 log

       reduction in 5 minutes. Learned Counsel further submitted that

       1 litre of water, when diluted with 1 tea spoon of Dettol, it

       achieves a 5 log reduction, therefore by this report it does not

       meet the criteria of killing 99.9% germs in 10 minutes.

       Whereas lifebuoy , the soap, when diluted in the same

       proportion, it shows 1.1 log reduction as per the European

       Standards.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">25.    It was also submitted by the Ld. Senior Counsel that this

       standard for a soap is inappropriate as dilution for a soap is

       established at 8%, and when the same is applied on the body,

       lather is formed, it is at friction with body that kills germs and

       that is how it has to be tested for determining its efficacy in

       terms of a soap. The prescribed dilution level as per the

       independent agencies referred to by the defendant, for soap is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 23 of 65</span>
        8% (being a solid substance). ANTI MICRO ACCURACY test

       shows that 8% solution in hard water is the accepted standard

       of dilution of a soap for comparison of soaps.


</p><p id="p_63">26.    Ld. Senior Counsel also brought the attention of this court on

       the technical note- related to a literature, wherein it has been

       mentioned that what quantity of commercial soaps are required

       to be tested in aqua solutions i.e. 8%.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">27.    Learned     Counsel      further      submitted   that   the   plaintiff

       inexplicably adopts a standard if 1:200 while conducting a test

       for Dettol and Lifebuoy. The said report is certainly in favour

       of the defendant because dilution of 1 ltr of Dettol soap results

       in some or no kill, and bucket of water is approximately 15

       litres, therefore, it is quite evident that there wouldn‟t be any

       killing of germs, hence standard adopted by them is in the

       favour of the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">28.    Ld. Senior Counsel further submitted that as per the

       advertisement, the defendant has to show that it is a better

       product and its efficacy to kill germs is better. The plaintiff

       however do not indicate any procedure, simply stating the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                        Page 24 of 65</span>
        dilution levels as 1:200, which is an incorrect solution in

       reference to a person taking bath with that water, the

       appropriate ratio would be 1:3000. And when the plaintiffs

       have compared the two, no dilution level or procedure has been

       prescribed for lifebuoy.
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">29.    Ld. Senior counsel also submitted that not going into the nitty-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       gritty‟s of the reports, but assuming how the test is supposed

       to be conducted as a prudent person, by applying the soap on to

       the body, creating lather for at least 30 seconds , and then wash

       away the soap and examine the log reduction is an emphatic

       way.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_70">30.    Ld. Senior placed reliance on the report given by Microchem

       Silikker wherein the test sample concentration as taken by

       them is 1:1500and 8% of the lifebuoy solution was taken for

       conducting the tests.3.58 is the log reduction that was obtained

       by the defendant‟s product , lifebuoy when brought in contact

       with water and was applied on the body with lather formation.

       Learned counsel further submitted that it clearly signifies the

       defendant‟s product being better to that of the plaintiff‟s.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 25 of 65</span>
</p><p id="p_71"> 31.    Mr.Sethi, learned senior advocate further invited the attention

       of this court to the reports submitted by the defendant , which

       ascertain that Dettol antiseptic liquid when brought in contact

       for 1 minute with water results in between 1.3 to 1.99 log

       reduction and whereas lifebuoy results inbetween3.58 to 4.74

       log reduction (being 4 times more effective). It was further

       submitted that only fact that has to be established is "We are a

       better product". Learned Counsel further submitted that an

       independent organisation - Citel Services "to compare anti

       bacterial efficacy", Dr. Paranjape conducted the "test" and it

       was opined that lifebuoy is a better germ protector. Learned

       counsel for the defendant also relied on another report by

       Hansa Research group which clarifies that 53% of the

       households in India use only antiseptic liquid in diluted water

       for bathing.
</p>
<p id="p_72">
</p><p id="p_73">32.    Relying on a letter sent by Professor K.J. Nath, President,

       Institute of public Health Engineers, India, learned      senior

       advocate further submitted that even in the letter by an expert

       on this subject says that lifebuoy soap is the most effective

       option in a bathing application to gain protection from germs.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                 Page 26 of 65</span>
        Learned senior advocate further submitted that Centre for

       Disease Control and Prevention, in its research has clarified

       that wash hand reduces catching of such harmful diseases.

       Primary recommendation for reducing germs is by using soap

       and water. Therefore, for complete protection, merely an

       antiseptic liquid in water does not give you a clean bath, " An

       acknowledgment that merely a spoon of antiseptic liquid does

       not give a complete protection against germs."


</p><p id="p_74">33.    In support of his arguments, the learned Senior Counsel for the

       Defendant placed reliance on the following judgments:


</p><p id="p_75">       a)      Imperial tobacco co. v. Albert Bonnan AIR 1928 CAC 1,
               page 17, four ingredients .

</p><p id="p_78">               , 2010 (44) 254.(Del.) (DB)
</p><p id="p_79">34.    Counsel for the plaintiff in rejoinder argued that the plaintiff is

       not complaining about the quality of the defendant's product

       rather the only issue for consideration is whether an antiseptic

       liquid can be compared to a cosmetic soap. Learned counsel

       submitted that an antiseptic- according to the drug act has a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 27 of 65</span>
        germ killing capability. Lifebuoy is a cosmetic soap, which

       definitely washes away the germs but does not kill the same

       like dettol, which is an antiseptic liquid. That an antiseptic

       liquid, according to the reports kills 99.9 % germs. This

       product is actually used on infections and wounds. The

       advertisement suggest "antiseptic liquid se zyaada kitanu

       nikalte hain", does lifebuoy kills more germs than an antiseptic

       liquid? "isse paani ke kitanu nikal jaye". Therefore, there is no

       denial of the fact, when antiseptic liquid is poured into water, it

       does make the water clean and rid of germs but the impression

       on the consumer of word „NIKAL‟ is critical, in the

       defendant‟s advertisement it is purporting to show that what

       happens to the bucket of water with DETTOL antiseptic liquid,

       the same would happen with the bar of lifebuoy soap on the

       consumer‟s body, so it is better to use lifebuoy soap. Lifebuoy

       is so much superior, even better than medicines is what they

       are showing, which can be clearly adjudged from the impugned

       advertisement. Even the depiction of the advertisement where

       it starts with a snapshot of toys and the child is shown in

<p id="p_80">35.    Learned counsel for the Plaintiff further submitted that the

       counsel for the defendant is completely digressing from the

       advertisement , the defendant in their advertisement are trying

       to manipulate the public by portraying the antiseptic liquid

       (dettol) bathing with the same causes cholera, typhoid. Counsel

       for the plaintiff stoutly raised a plea that the issue involved

       today is not the reports but the truthfulness of the

       advertisement as they are disparaging the reputation of the

       plaintiff, and the documents are to be examined at the time of

       trial, not at this interim stage.

</p><p id="p_84"> 38.    Having analysed the Television Commercial (TVC), the moot

       question before this court is: Does the commercial telecast by

       the respondent disparage the product of the plaintiff and if so,

       whether the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction against the

       telecast.
</p>
<p id="p_85">39.    There is no iota of doubt that the plaintiff and the defendant‟s

       company are individually well renowned in the Indian market.

       In the league of antiseptic liquid, as per the plaintiff it captures

       85% of the market; it is widely used in hospitals, homes,

       clinics etc. In the present petition, the plaintiff is aggrieved by

       the television commercial telecasted by the defendant, wherein

       it shows a child frequently falling sick and a few toys

       displayed in the background, followed by a doctor inquiring

       about his hygiene habits and the parents proudly telling the

       doctor that they use antiseptic liquid in the bathing water. The

       diagnosis by the doctor appears to be that the child is

       frequently falling sick owing to the use of antiseptic liquid in

       bathing water. Further the apprehension raised by the plaintiff

       is that the commercial proceeds with the lady pouring the

       antiseptic liquid in the bucket in the same manner as that has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 33 of 65</span>
        been shown in the plaintiff‟s „Dettol‟ advertisement, which

       would raise doubts in the mind of prudent users about the

       efficacy of „Dettol‟, portraying the very antiseptic to be less

       effective, thereby ridiculing and disparaging its reputation in

       the market. It is the case of the plaintiff that in the impugned

       advertisement, the defendant reproduced a clouding effect

       which is only visible when pouring „Dettol‟ as it is the

       exclusive feature borne by „Dettol‟. It is also the case of the

       plaintiff that the colour of the liquid used in the impugned

       advertisement is also similar to that of Dettol and even the

       shape of the bottle clearly resembles the plaintiff‟s bottle of

       Dettol antiseptic liquid. Thus the reputation and goodwill of

       the plaintiff‟s product is suffering at the cost of the impugned

       advertisement wherein very mischievously, the defendant

       portrays that Lifebuoy is better than an antiseptic liquid having

       100% germ protection quality.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">40.    There are various test reports that have been relied upon by the

       defendant as well as the petitioner, which appear to be relevant

       in supporting the comparative study to determine which is a

       better germ protector but the authenticity of the same cannot

       these reports or depend upon the same as they are the reports

       given by the agencies engaged by both the parties individually,

       who have conducted these tests and research. However, for

</p><p id="p_93">41.    As per the report given by Michrochem Silliker, the Dettol

       product (the antiseptic liquid) was tested at two concentration

       levels - 1:1500 and 1:3000. The Lifebuoy soap was tested at a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                  Page 35 of 65</span>
        test sample concentration of 8%. If one converts the

       concentration levels of the Dettol product in the tests into

       percentages, they come to about 0.067% (1:1500) and 0.033%

       (1:3000). This is significantly less than the concentration level

       (8%) at which Lifebuoy was tested. To put it differently, the

       concentration level at which Lifebuoy soap was tested was

       approximately 120 and 240 times as strong as the

       concentration levels of the Dettol product.

</p><p id="p_94">42.    This appears at a first glance to be a grossly unfair basis for

       comparison. Although there does not seem to be any suggested

       pack dilutions for testing or comparing the two products or

       explaining as to why the 8% concentration level is an

       appropriate use concentration for Lifebuoy or .33 % for Dettol,

       nor does it say why it would be appropriate to compare with

       these dilution levels, as for Dettol its significantly lower.

       However, I do not find the arguments of the counsel for the

       defendant convincing in the said regard. Nevertheless, the

       efficacy of these tests reports submitted by both the parties

       would be well decided by this Court after the trial.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 36 of 65</span>
</p><p id="p_95"> 43.    Be that as it may, the television commercial should be

       construed and tested from the perspective of a common man

       and user of the product which would be the ultimate analysis as

       on viewing the said television commercial, whether a common

       man of ordinary prudence would understand or analyse the

       same on the same notions as that of the plaintiff‟s. Therefore,

       the technicalities in the reports establishing the efficiency of

       the two products would not suffice the purpose of deciding the

       present application, as the validity of the same can only be

       established at the stage of trial. The reason for this is the fact

       that television advertisements unlike print advertisements make

       an instant bearing across consumer classes and the level of

       impact of such advertisements on the consumer is much greater

       than a print advertisement where each word has to be read,

       analysed and understood. Advertisers therefore will have to

       tread much more carefully when creating comparative

       advertisements for television.
</p>
<p id="p_96">44.    The law in regard to commercial disparagement is crystal clear

       i.e. a trader can puff up his goods in comparison to his

       competitors goods but he cannot denigrate or disparage his

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                   Page 37 of 65</span>
        competitors while doing so. Meaning thereby that comparative

       advertising is allowed to the extent of a trader comparing his

       goods with the goods of another trader and establishing

       superiority of his goods over that of others, but while doing so

       he cannot say that the goods of his competitor are bad, inferior,

       or undesirable. In case he makes any such nuances, it would be

       an act of constituting „product disparagement‟. Such

       comparison leading to disparagement of rival‟s product is not

       allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_97">45.    According to Garner Bryan, A Black's           Law Dictionary,

       seventh edition(West Group Minnesota) 1999,            the word

       „disparage‟ means        to connect unequally, or to dishonour

       (something or someone)           by comparison: or to discredit

       unjustly or detract from the reputation of (another‟s property,

       product or business): or false and injurious statement that

       discredits or detracts from the reputation of another‟s property,

       product or business. That implies that , „disparagement‟ being

       a false and injurious statement that discredits or detracts from

       the reputation of another‟s property , product or business.

</p><p id="p_102">49.    The law relating to fictitious advertisements, causing injury

       to a rival trader's goods, was expounded in several decisions

       in the past. The initial common law position on the point was

       determined by a decision of the Chancery Division in De

       Beers Abrasive v. International General Electric Co. 1975

       (2) All ER 599 where the Court summarized the correct legal

       position as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_103">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                "What precisely is the law on this point' It is a
           blinding glimpse of the obvious to say that there
           must be a dividing line between statements that
           are actionable and those which are not; and the
           sole question of a dry point of law such as we are
           discussing here is; where does the line lie' On the
           one hand, it appears to me that the law is that
           any trader is entitled to puff his own goods, even
           though such puff must, as a matter of pure logic,
           involve the denigration of his rival's goods. Thus
           in the well known case of the three adjoining
           tailors who put notices in their respective
           windows reading: 'The best tailor in the world',
           'The best tailor in this town', and 'The best tailor
           in this street', none of the three committed an
           actionable offence.</blockquote><p id="p_104">

</p><p id="p_105">               Where, however, the situation is not that the
           trader is puffing his own goods, but turns to

           denigrate those of his rival, then, in my opinion,
          the situation is not so clear cut. Obviously the
          statement: 'My goods are better than X's' is only
          a more dramatic presentation of what is implicit in
          the statement: 'My goods are the best in the
          world'. Accordingly, I do not think such a
          statement would be actionable. At the other end
          of the scale, if what is said is: 'My goods are
          better than X's, because X's are absolute rubbish',
          then it is established by dicta of Lord Shand in the
          House of Lords in White v. Mellin (1895) AC 154,
          which were accepted by counsel for the
          Defendants as stating the law, the statement
          would be actionable.
</p>
<p id="p_106">              Between these two kinds of statements there
          is obviously still an extremely wide field; and it
          appears to me that, in order to draw the line, one
          must apply this test, namely, whether a
          reasonable man would take the claim being made
          as being a serious claim or not. A possible
          alternative test is to ask whether the Defendant
          has pointed to a specific allegation of some defect
          or demerit in the plaintiff's goods. This is, I think,
          the test favoured by the learned editors of the

      causing injury to a rival traders group pithily and in a nutshell

      lay down the following principles:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           "I) A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to
           be best in the world, even though the declaration
           is untrue.

           the best in the world or his goods are better than
           his competitors' he can even compare the
           advantages of his goods over the goods of others.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           IV) He however, cannot, while saying that his
           goods are better than his competitors', say that
           his competitors' goods are bad. If he says so, he
           really slanders the goods of his competitors. In
           other words he defames his competitors and their
           goods, which is not permissible.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           V) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the
           manufacturer of such goods no action lies, but if
           there is such defamation an action lies and if an
           action lies for recovery of damages for

<p id="p_108">51.   The aforesaid law found resonance in <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_8">Reckitt and Colman

      of India Ltd. v. M.P. Ramchandran and Anr</a>. 1999 (19 )

      PTC 741 (Cal), wherein the Calcutta High Court considered

      the concept of negative advertisement. In the said case, the

      plaintiff was a manufacturer of whitener sold under the

      brand name „Robin Blue‟. The defendants were also

      manufacturing a whitener and selling their product under the

      brand name „Ujala‟. The advertisement of the defendants

      depicted that the colour blue (which was of plaintiff's

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                Page 42 of 65</span>
      product) was uneconomical and the average blue was the

     most expensive to whiten the clothes. It had further been

     added `what is more, you have to use lots of blue per wash'.

     While making the said comment the container of the

     plaintiff had been shown upside down and it had further

     been shown that the liquid was gushing out. The court

     observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_109">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">           "The object is obviously to show that the product
           of the petitioner priced at Rs.10/- gushes out as a
           quirt and not in drops while using and Therefore, it
           is an expensive way to whiten clothes. The
           container of the petitioner as produced by Mr.
           Chakrabotry was put by me up-side-down and I
           found that the liquid packed in the container comes
           out drop unless one squeezes the container, which
           is made of plastic. It has then been shown in the
           advertisement that blue is a product of obsolete
           technology and Therefore, it cannot dissolve
           completely in water and as such forms sediments
           at the bottom of the wash bucket. The said
           assertion it appears to me is not a presentation of
           a technological disadvantage of the product of the
           petitioner as was asserted by Mr. Chakraborty but
           an insinuation to the product itself. The same is
           clarified by the last assertion contained in
           advertisements to the effect that blue leaves dirty
           blue patches on clothes because it forms
           sediments. The insinuation, Therefore, is sediment
           of blue leaves blue patches on freshly washed
           clothes since blue cannot dissolve in water.

               disparage / disparagement to mean, "to speak
               of slightingly, undervalue, to bring discredit or
               dishonor upon, the act of deprecating,
               derogation, a condition of low estimation or

               dis-credit on, slightingly of and depreciate.....
               To decide the question of disparagement we
               have to keep the following factors in mind

       target group of consumers. A tradesman is entitled to declare

       that his goods are the best in the world- even if such a

       declaration is untrue. Mere puffing is permissible, but slighting

       or rubbishing or otherwise denigrating or disparaging another's

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">               What precisely is the law on this point? It is a
               blinding glimpse of the obvious to say that there
               must be a dividing line between statements that
               are actionable and those which are not; and the
               sole question upon a dry point of law such as we
               are discussing here is: where does that line lie?
               On the one hand, it appears to me that the law
               is that any trader is entitled to puff his own
               goods, even though such puff must, as a matter
               of pure logic, involve the denigration of his
               rival's goods. Thus in the well-known case of the
               three adjoining tailors who put notices in their
               respective windows reading: "The best tailor in
               the world", "The best tailor in this town", and
               "The best tailor in this street", none of the three
               committed an actionable wrong.

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">               This is, I think, a proposition which extends to a
               much wider field than the slander of goods; for
               example I think it extends to other vague
               commendatory statements about goods or
               services     on    offer.  Principal  among     its
               applications has been the case of auctioneers,
               who, within limits, have always been allowed to
               use language which has been strictly perhaps
               not literally true; thus for example to take note
               of one instance, in Hope v. Walter [1900] 1 Ch
               257: "I do not attach any importance to the
               word `eligible': it is the ordinary auctioneer's
               language". In other words, in the kind of
               situation where one expects, as a matter of
               ordinary common experience, a person to use a
               certain amount of hyperbole in the description of
               goods, property or services, the courts will do

               namely, take it with a large pinch of salt.

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">               Where, however, the situation is not that the
               trader is puffing his own goods, but turns to
               denigrate those of his rival, then, in my opinion,
               the situation is not so clear cut. Obviously the
               statement: "My goods are better than X's" is
               only a more dramatic presentation of what is
               implicit in the statement: "My goods are the
               best in the world". Accordingly, I do not think
               such a statement would be actionable. At the
               other end of the scale, if what is said is: "My
               goods are better than X's", because X's are
               absolute rubbish", then it is established by dicta
               of Lord Shand in the House of Lords in White v.
               Mellin [1895] AC 154, which were accepted by

               one must apply this test, namely, whether a
               reasonable man would take the claim being
               made as being a serious claim or not.

               vague that it will be understood as merely the
               seller's expression of opinion. It was further
               noted that an exaggerated advertising claim
               which is placed with an intent to influence the

               as mere puffing.

               rival's product there may yet be a wide field of
               cases and (b) the dividing line in such cases
               would have to drawn based on the test whether
               a reasonable man would take the claim of the

               proverbial 'large pinch of salt' and dismiss it as

       not actionable. Tradesman can say his goods are best or better.

               also can compare the advantages of his product
               over the products of the others. However, while
               doing so, he cannot say his competitors are bad

                disparaging the product of the plaintiff, then an
               action would lie. From the storyline and the
               manner of the advertisements in question, it can
               clearly be seen that the message that is sought
               to be given in the advertisements, is that even
               after the machine with product containing label
               alike plaintiff's product is put on, it has no effect
               and the mosquitoes go on troubling which
               require the person in the room to indulge in
               acrobatics etc. It is to be noted that the
               advertisement campaign or visual media has an
               immediate impact on the viewers and possibly
               purchaser's mind, particularly, when a well
               known cinestar is endorsing it. It is further to be

               view point of the ordinary person of average
               intelligence. Though the advertisements in
               question may show the product having a label
               alike that of plaintiff's product for a few seconds,
               the possibility of the same being registered in
               the mind of an average consumer and linking it
               with the ineffectiveness of the product cannot be
               ruled out."

       the following principles which could be summarized as

       under:
</p>
<p id="p_129">
</p><p id="p_130">       a)       A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be the

</p><p id="p_133">       d)       He, however, cannot, while saying that his goods are
                better than his competitor‟s , say that his competitor‟s
                goods are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the
                goods of his competitors and their goods, which is not
                permissible in law.
</p><p id="p_134">       e)       If there is no defamation to the goods or the
                manufacture of such goods no action lies, but if there

                is such defamation, an action lies for recovery of
               damages for defamation, then the court is also
               competent to grant an order of injunction restraining
               them to perform such acts.
</p>
<p id="p_135">
       In order to satisfy the test of comparative disparagement, the

       plaintiff has to establish the following key elements:


</p><p id="p_136">       a)      A false or misleading statement of fact has been made
               about his product;
</p>
<p id="p_137">       b)      That the statement is deceiving or has the potential to
               deceive, the substantial segment of           prospective
               consumer and;
</p>
<p id="p_138">       c)      The deception is likely to influence consumer‟s
               purchasing decisions. The court has to also bear in
               mind     while    deciding    whether   the    displayed
               commercial is disparaging or not, the intent of the
               advertisement, its manner and the effect of            the
               telecast of such a television commercial. The manner
               in which the same is telecasted is of prime importance,
               the same should not be in the manner to ridicule or
               condemn the product of the competitor , resulting in
               disparagement or disrupting them in the market.

</p><p id="p_139">61.    In determining the meaning in the impugned advertisement,

       one cannot lose sight of the fact that exaggeration in promoting

        one‟s product is permissible only to an extent where the public

       at large can digest the same. The test is whether a reasonable

       man would take the claim being made, as one made seriously.

       The more precise and specific the claim, the more likely it is

       for the public to take it seriously.

               that the statement complained of was made of
               and concerning his goods; (2) that it was false,
               (3) that it was published maliciously i.e. With
               the intention of injuring him and (4) that he has
               suffered special damage thereby. A trader is
               entitled to commend his own goods and state

               and if he does so, no action will lie against him,
               whatever damage may ensue from such

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">               It is otherwise where a trader does not limit
               himself to a comparison of his goods with those

               statement that they are inferior in quality to his
               own, but goes further and makes an untrue
               statement of fact about his rival's goods, for
               example, where he states that they are rotten
               or unmerchantable. In a case like this, an action

<p id="p_143">63.    Adverting to the facts of the present case, having gone through

       the commercial not only in its text (as reproduced above) but

       also having watched it on a DVD, the question here is whether

       the advertisement disparages or denigrates the antiseptic liquid

       of the plaintiff and also whether it only seeks to project the

       superiority of the defendant's LIFEBUOY soap over an

       ordinary antiseptic liquid? The advertisement begins with the

       scene showing a sick child lying with a few toys around in the

       display and the doctor entering the house and commenting that

       he has been invited yet again. Thereafter, the doctor inquires

       about the hygiene habits of the child and the doctor asks: "kya

       ye nahata hai roz", to which the mother of the child replies: "

       haan nahane ke paani mein do dhakkan antiseptic liquid be

       daltehai" and the doctor mocking and ridiculing in reply says: "

       aap bhee nahane mein sirf do dhakkan, use balti toh bimar nai

       padegi, paani ke kitanu shayad nikal jayen, lekin body ke, yeh

       yahan se yahan , fir zukam, khansi, flu" . In the meanwhile, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                 Page 57 of 65</span>
        commercial runs to demonstrate a lady pouring brown liquid

       with a tilted bottle in the bucket of water. The mother of the

       child then proceeds to ask the doctor: "to nahane mein isse

       better? And the doctor replies: "100% germ protection,

       Advanced Lifebuoy" and then appears two different shields of

       protection, green signifying Dettol and Red signifying

       Lifebuoy wherein , the green side is left with a few germs and

       the red shows "kill of all". Once again lifebuoy is shown to

       have excellent germ killing capability whilst an antiseptic

       liquid is completely ineffective. The voice-over also indicates

       the same. It is obvious that the advertisement displays the said

       so called " antiseptic liquid" in bad light and as something

       harmful. Thereafter, the advertisement proceeds with the

       introduction of the defendant's LIFEBUOY soap and the

       manner in which it spreads a protective        red wall thereby

       removing and dissipating the germs.
</p>
<p id="p_144">

</p><p id="p_145">64.    The advertisement can be viewed in two parts. One part is

       where as the advertisement begins, its showing display of a

       few toys with the sick child which is a similar aspect to that of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                  Page 58 of 65</span>
        the plaintiff‟s advertisement. The other part is the "two

       dhakkans" of liquid is shown as being harmful and ineffective,

       which as per the visualisation of the television commercial,

       does lay an adverse connotation and a lady pouring a brown

       liquid in the bucket, in the same manner and display as that of

       the plaintiff‟s television commercial and where the defendant's

       product is shown as having the qualities of providing a 100 %

       germ protection. There can be no grievance in respect where

       the qualities of the defendant's soap are sought to be

       demonstrated: whether those qualities exist or not is not an

       issue. That part, even if untrue, would be mere puffery.

       However, the part of the advertisement, where the antiseptic

       liquid has been slighted and shown in bad light and in fact, as

       something which is ineffective, cannot but be construed as

       disparagement and denigration of the antiseptic liquid shown in

       the advertisement. It is one thing to say that a person's product

       is the best or that his product is better than somebody else's

       product, but, it is entirely a different matter to say that his

       product is good whereas another's product is bad and harmful.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                  Page 59 of 65</span>
</p><p id="p_146"> 65.    With aforesaid discussion, it is ostensibly clear that the

       advertisement disparages the plaintiff's antiseptic liquid and it

       is not an advertisement which seeks merely or only to promote

       the superiority of the defendant's „LIFEBUOY‟ soap over an

       ordinary antiseptic liquid. When the commercial is displayed

       before the public at large, the basic principle that is followed is

       that the public tries to find the connectivity and the impact that

       advertisement probably creates on them. If „X‟ would raise the

       standards of its product by claiming the rivals products „Y‟ to

       be bad and not effective displaying similar/ comparative

       attributes of the two, the same would be bad in law. If it were a

       case of mere promotion of superiority of the defendant's

       product, alone, the plaintiff would not have had a case as that

       would have only betokened a permissible "better" or "best"

       statement. The advertisement comprises of two parts; one

       which denigrates and disparages the product of the plaintiff

       and the other which promotes the purported superiority of

       defendant's LIFEBUOY soap. There is thus a hint of some

       malice involved in the commercial in respect of the

       defendant‟s product - indeed, it would be appropriate to delete

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 60 of 65</span>
        certain relevant attributes of the defendant‟s advertisement

       which clearly hits on the plaintiff‟s product and portrays the

       same in bad light. Without a doubt comparative advertising is

       beneficial as it increases consumer awareness and therefore, it

       is permissible but not by pulling down the reputation of your

       competitor by showing its product in debauched light.

       Moreover, advertising is a medium through which an

       advertiser can establish his brand in the market, but at the same

       time there are certain set of laws that cannot be deserted.

       Denigrating or causing direct harm to one‟s product which has

       attained appreciation in its genre in terms of usage and

       application, would amount to slander, which would also cause

       great prejudice to the public interest, as the question is not of

       deciding which product is better, but also of public awareness.

       Because, misleading and disparaging advertisement would not

       only mellow down the faith of the public but would also result

       in misleading them.
</p>
<p id="p_147">

</p><p id="p_148"> 66. Therefore, the question determined by the Court is whether the

     advertisement merely puffed the product of the advertiser, or in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                  Page 61 of 65</span>
      the garb of doing so, was denigrating the product of the plaintiff.

     It is palpable to state as per the assertions made by the plaintiff

     and the aforesaid discussion, it is clear that the advertisement

     aims at denigrating the product of the plaintiff by indicating to

     existing and future customers that the product of the plaintiff is

     ineffective. A significant aspect of the manner in which puffery

     should be interpreted in this case is the broadly liberal attitude

     adopted towards untrue and imprecise statements. The emphasis

     of the Court in this regard is to prevent any loss or injury to the

     interests of the competing manufacturer or seller, with any active

     disparagement of a competing product being impermissible.



</p><p id="p_149"> 67. In the light of the above discussion and based on the triple test

     for the grant of ad-interim injunction viz (1) whether the plaintiff

     has strong prima facie case to succeed on merits (2) whether the

     balance of convenience lies in favour of the plaintiff and (3)

     whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury if the

     injunction is not granted in its favour, this court finds that all the

     three principles lean in favour of the plaintiff and against the

     defendant. The plaintiff has been able to establish a prima-facie

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">I.A.No.11467/2012 in C.S.(OS) No.1834/2012                    Page 62 of 65</span>
      case in its favour. If the plaintiff is not granted interim

     injunction, the telecast of the television commercial by the

     defendant in the aforesaid manner definitely pose disparagement

     against the plaintiff‟s product, and is definitely detrimental to

     plaintiff‟s interest and would also cause an irreparable loss and

     injury to the plaintiff. The balance of convenience also lies in

     favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.



</p><p id="p_150">68. Therefore, I am of the view that the defendant can telecast the

   advertisement only after deleting the following attributes as under:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">       a.      remove the „toys‟ in the advertisement.
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_36">       b.      remove the phrase "two dhakkans" and the particular

               portion featuring the lady shown pouring liquid in the

               bucket by holding the bottle of the antiseptic liquid in

               her hand.

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">       c.      Remove the shot showing the cloud formation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">        d.      Since green is the colour majorly associated with

               „Dettol‟, therefore also change the colour scheme

               showing the comparison between the two products in the

               television commercial and change the green colour to a

               different shade.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_151">69. I am, therefore, inclined to grant ad interim relief to the plaintiff

   and as against the defendant thereby restraining the defendant

   from telecasting the impugned advertisement.           However, the

   defendant will be well within its rights to telecast the same only

   after following the conditions as envisaged in paragraph 68 (a) to

   inserting or adding any such kind of piece/feature in the

   disposal of the case at hand.
