JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">          By this common order I shall dispose of both the appeals

bearing nos. 96/2009/2008 and 97/2009/2008 as common questions

of facts and law are involved in these two appeals arising out of same

judgment of conviction of Ld. Court below. Criminal Appeal bearing

No. 96/2009/2008 is taken as the leading case and the common

judgment is being dictated in it.
</p>
<p id="p_2">          The present appeals are filed under<a href="/doc/1903086/" id="a_1"> S. 374</a> of Criminal

Procedure Code against the Judgment dated 6/5/2008 and the order

on sentence dated 17/5/2008, passed by the Ld. ACMM, whereby the

appellants, in both the appeals herein, were convicted for offence

under<a href="/doc/1264755/" id="a_2"> S. 326</a> r/w<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3"> S. 34</a> IPC and were sentenced to undergo R.I. for a

period of 5 years along with fine of Rs. 10,000/-, failing which they

were directed to undergo further S.I. for 2 months period.
</p>
<p id="p_3">PROSECUTION CASE

          The brief facts of the case relevant for deciding the cases

are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_4">          On     5/1/1997     at    about   9:00    am       when   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>

complainant/injured Netra Pal went in the jungle in front of Nuclear

Science Centre, Aruna Asaf Ali Road, New Delhi and was easing out

himself, at that point of time accused Jai Prakash armed with Pharsa,

accused Sanjay and accused Arjun armed with Lathi, accused

Hambeer with danda and accused vivek armed with Gandasa

attacked the complainant. The accused Jai Prakash hit him with

pharsa causing amputation of his left leg and other accused persons

also hit him with the weapons in their hand causing him multiple

injuries. When the complainant shouted for help all the accused

persons ran away. PCR van on receipt of message of the incident

went to the place of offence and took the complainant to the

Safdurjung Hospital. DD No. 18-B was registered and handed over to

SI Diwan Chand Sharma, I.O. of the present case. On the rukka sent

by I.O. FIR No. 10/1997 was registered at P.S. Vasant Kunj under

<a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_4">Section 147</a>/<a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_5">148</a>/<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_6">149</a>/<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_7">307</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">34</a> IPC. During investigation site plan was

laid, MLC was collected, statements of witnesses were recorded and

the accused persons were arrested and their disclosure statement

was recorded. After completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     4</span>

filed in the court of Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate. However, matter was

committed to Sessions Court by Ld. MM. vide order dated 1/4/1998

the Sessions Court the matter was remanded back for trial to the

court of Ld. MM as the charge-sheet disclosed commission of offence

under<a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_9"> S. 326</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_10">34</a> IPC and trial proceeded in the court of Ld. MM. On

completion of trial Ld. MM referred the matter under <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_11">Section 325</a> (1)

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">CrPC</a> for enhanced punishment to the court of Ld. ACMM. After

hearing the matter vide Judgment dated 6/5/2008 and the order on

sentence dated 17/5/2008, the Ld. ACMM, convicted the appellants,

in both the appeals mentioned hereinabove, for offence under<a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_13"> S. 326</a>

r/w<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_14"> S. 34</a> IPC and were sentenced to undergo R.I. for a period of 5

years along with fine of Rs. 10,000/-, failing which they shall undergo

further S.I. for 2 months period. Aggrieved with the said judgment and

order on sentence, present appeals are preferred by the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_5">ARGUMENTS:
</p>
<p id="p_6">          The contention of learned counsel for the appellants is that

in the statements given by the appellants/accused persons under S.
</p>
<p id="p_7">313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">CrPC</a>, the trial court did not put the questions regarding injuries to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span>

them. It was urged by the Ld. counsel that the doctor who examined

the injured/complainant was not examined thus, the defence was not

given right to cross-examine the said doctor. The Ld. counsel also

pointed out that non-recovery of the amputated leg and the

pharsa/weapon of offence is a good circumstance in favour of the

defence. The Ld. counsel also contended that the complainant/victim

on being shown the pieces of broken cricket wickets/danda denied in

his examination-in-chief that the same were not the danda with which

he was assaulted by the accused Sanjay. The Ld. counsel also

averred that on mere statement of the complainant/victim, the

accused persons cannot be held guilty especially when other three

accused persons were acquitted and only present two appellants

have been convicted. The Ld. counsel also pointed out that in another

case the complainant was convicted u/S. 324 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">IPC</a> for causing injuries

to appellant Jai Prakash &amp; his parents and since upon testimony of

mother of the appellant Jai Prakash he was convicted thus, herein as

a counter-blast the complainant gave evidence falsely implicating the

appellants. The Ld. counsel also stated that civil disputes between the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>

appellants and the complainant are also pending adjudication.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           The Ld. counsel submitted that the appellant Sanjay was

not present at the site of the offence and was in the village, which is

supported by the testimony of DW 2 Vishal. The Ld. counsel also

submitted that I.O., PW4 stated on oath that he did not know where

he prepared the seizure memo of the amputated leg and later stated

he did not make the seizure memo of the amputated leg, also the

prosecution did not examine the PCR man PW 5 and did not put the

question as to who caused the injuries to the complainant, nor does

the MLC disclose as to who caused the injuries to the complainant,

thus, the appellants/accused persons have been wrongly convicted by

the Ld. Trial court. The Ld. counsel relied on decisions in <a href="/doc/1518366/" id="a_17">Mamu Lal

vs. State-1995</a> (1) C.C. Cases 199 (HC) (Del); Rajesh @ Vimal

in support of his contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_10">          Refuting the said contentions of Ld. counsel for the

appellants, Ld. Addl. Public Prosecutor for the State submitted that as

regards amputated leg of the complainant, the I.O. stated that he

seized the amputated left leg and submitted it to the doctor at the time

of preparation of the MLC. But since the said doctor expired during

the trial of this case so he could not be examined. He further

submitted that in any event of the matter, the statement of the PCR

man wherein he stated that the left leg of the complainant, below knee

was amputated proves that the left leg was amputated. It was also

urged that the I.O. in the rukka also made an endorsement that he

saw the amputated leg, which also proves the case of the

prosecution. Furthermore, he submitted that<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_21"> S. 313</a> CrPC has no

applicability and it was for the Ld. Magistrate to give gist of the case

under<a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_22"> S. 281</a> CrPC to appellants and record their replies.

</p>
<p id="p_14">          The hon'ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in Sham Sunder

Jalan v. State of U.T. Chandigarh, 1997 (3) R.C.R. (Criminal) 366,

based upon the decisions of the Apex Court has beautifully explained

the purpose and object of<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_23"> S. 313</a> CrPC as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "8. The provision is salutary and is not an idle
         formality. As already pointed above the same has
         been enacted to ensure that no prejudice is
         caused to the accused. The said purpose had
         been explained by the Supreme Court in the case
         of <a href="/doc/648928/" id="a_24">Rama Shankar Singh and others v. State of
         West Bengal</a>, AIR 1962 SC 1239. While noting
         that opportunity to explain the evidence appearing
         against the accused is not an idle formality and
         that it is a duty imposed on the Court, the
         Supreme Court explained the purpose of <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_25">Section
         313</a> Cr.P.C. (in fact <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_26">Section 342</a> of the Code of
         1898) in the following words :-</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">         "Duty is thereby imposed upon the Court to
         question the accused generally in a case after the
         witnesses for the prosecution have been examined
         to enable the accused to explain any circumstance
         appearing against him. This is a necessary
         corollary of the presumption of innocence on which
         our criminal jurisprudence is founded. The object
         of the Section is to afford to the accused an
         opportunity of showing that the circumstance relied
         upon by the prosecution which may be prima facie
         against him, is not true or inconsistent with his
         innocence. The opportunity must be real and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            9</span>

adequate. Questions must be so framed as to give
to the accused clear notice of the circumstances
relied upon by the prosecution, and must give him
an opportunity to render such explanation as he
can of that circumstance. Each question must be
so framed that the accused may be able to
understand it and to appreciate what use the
prosecution desires make of the evidence against
him. Examination of the accused under <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_27">Section
342</a> is not intended to be an idle formality; it has to
be carried out in the interest of justice and fairplay
to the accused: by a slipshod examination which is
the result of imperfect appreciation of the
evidence, idleness or negligence the position of
the accused cannot be permitted to be made more
difficult than what it is in a trial for an offence."
</p><p id="p_16">           9. At the outset it deserves to be
mentioned as noted above that purpose of
examination of an accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_28">Section 313</a>
Cr.P.C. is to enable him to explain the
circumstances appearing in evidence against him.
If the prosecution witnesses have deposed to any
incriminating circumstances from which the guilt of
the accused can be inferred, the accused person
must be given an opportunity to explain the said
incriminating circumstance. The accused need not
be questioned about every important statement
made by the witness in the witness box. It is only
the portion of the evidence of the witness on which
the accused person can give and explain that
should be put to the accused. The questions
should be put in such a manner as to be easily
understandable and they should not be lengthy. In
one of the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court
in the case of <a href="/doc/1912825/" id="a_29">Tara Singh v. The State</a>, AIR 1951
SC 441 the importance of <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_30">Section 342</a> of the Code
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                          10</span>

of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was considered. It
was stressed that questions should be put in such
a manner that an ordinary person can understand
the same. In paragraph 30 the Supreme Court
held :-
</p><p id="p_17">"It is not a proper compliance to read out a long
string of questions and answers made in the
Committal Court and ask whether the statement is
correct. A question of that kind is misleading. It
may mean either that the questioner wants to
know whether the recording is correct, or whether
the answers given are true, or whether there is
some mistake or misunderstanding despite the
accurate recording. In the next place, it is not
sufficient compliance to string together a long
series of facts and ask the accused what he has to
say about them. He must be questioned
separately about each material circumstance
which is intended to be used against him. The
whole object of the section is to afford the accused
a fair and proper opportunity of explaining
circumstances which appear against him. The
questioning must therefore be fair and must be
couched in a form which an ignorant or illiterate
person will be able to appreciate and understand.
Even when an accused person is not illiterate, his
mind is apt to the perturbed when he is facing a
charge of murder."
</p><p id="p_18">Some question was again considered by the
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_31">State of Andhra
Pradesh v. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao and
another</a>, AIR 1963 SC 1850. It was again
emphasized that question should be put to the
person in small precise form so that accused can
explain each of the circumstances and evidence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                           11</span>

against him.
</p><p id="p_19">10. The effect of non-compliance of such a
provision had also been noted in a string of
judgments from the Supreme Court. Reference to
some of them would be in the fitness of things. In
the case of <a href="/doc/1912825/" id="a_32">Tara Singh v. The State</a> (supra) the
Supreme Court held that if there is an omission to
comply with the provisions pertaining to recording
the statement of the accused, then it would fall
within the category of curable irregularity. It was
held :-
</p><p id="p_20">"I am of opinion that errors of this type fall within
the category of curable irregularities. Therefore,
the question in each case depends upon the
degree of the error and upon whether prejudice
has been occasioned or is likely to have been
occasioned. In my opinion, the disregard to the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_33">Section 342</a>, Criminal P.C., is so
gross in this case that I feel there is grave
likelihood of prejudice."
</p><p id="p_21">Same view prevailed with the Supreme Court in
the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/952560/" id="a_34">Chikkarange Gowda and others v.
State of Mysore</a>, AIR 1956 SC 731. In paragraph
17 the Court held :-
</p><p id="p_22">"It is necessary now to say a few words about the
failure to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_35">Section
342</a>, Criminal P.C. This Court has, on more than
one occasion, stated that compliance with the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_36">Section 342</a> is not a mere idle
formality and we are in agreement with the
comment made by the learned Judges of the High
Court that in this case the examination of the
appellants to enable them to explain the
circumstances appearing against them was neither
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                          12</span>

full nor very statisfactory. We also agree with them
that no serious prejudice was caused - such as to
vitiate the whole trial."
</p><p id="p_23">11. Similarly, in the case <a href="/doc/719254/" id="a_37">C.T. Muniappan v. The
State of Madras</a>, AIR 1961 SC 175 detailed
questions had been asked by the Magistrate. The
Supreme Court noted that there was an omission
to question the accused specifically about what the
witnesses said. Finally, it was concluded that no
prejudice was caused and in paragraph 8 held :-
"We do not think that the omission to question the
appellant specifically about what the witnesses
said about informing him of such collection has
caused any prejudice to him. Even if there was
any defect in his examination under <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_38">section 342</a>
Cr.P.C., the defect amounts merely to an
irregularity and is not such as to call for our
interference with the orders passed by the Courts
below - especially when no complaint on this
ground was raised before the High Court."
In the same direction further light is thrown by the
decisions in the case of <a href="/doc/1495607/" id="a_39">Rama Shankar Singh and
others v. State of West Begal</a> (supra). In the cited
case    the    prosecution     relied    upon    two
circumstances against the accused. They were
that when the accused came out of the house of
one Ram Deo, she had blood-stained knife in her
hands and that when she was arrested from the
godown, the knife was in her hands. During the
statement of the accused this matter of evidence
was not put to her and her attention was not drawn
towards it. The Supreme Court held that beyond a
bare denial, there is nothing else that the counsel
could suggest. There was no prejudice that had
been caused and thereupon the conclusions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                            13</span>

drawn were :-
</p><p id="p_24">"Failure to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_40">Section
342</a> is an irregularity; and unless injustice is shown
to have resulted therefrom a mere irregularity is by
itself not sufficient to justify an order of retrial. The
appellate Court must always consider whether by
reason of failure to comply with a procedural
provision, which does not affect the jurisdiction of
the Court, the accused have been materially
prejudiced. In the present case, we are of the
view, having regard to the circumstances, that the
appellants have not been prejudiced because of
failure to examine them strictly in compliance of
the terms of <a href="/doc/1243353/" id="a_41">Section 342</a> of the Code and that view
is strengthened by the fact that the plea was not
raised in the High Court by their counsel who had
otherwise raised numerous questions in support of
the case of the appellants."
</p><p id="p_25">12. A year later in the case <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_42">State of Andhra
Pradesh v. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao and
another</a> (supra) one of the arguments pertaining to
the defective recording of the statement of the
accused under <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_43">Section 342</a> Cr.P.C. 1898 was that
long and involved questions were put to the
accused and reference was made to a number of
documents and the documents were not made
available to the accused. After going through the
record, the Supreme Court held that the accused
understood the questions and no prejudice,
therefore, was caused. In paragraph 42 it was held
:-
</p><p id="p_26">"While we are disposed to agree with the learned
counsel that the questions embrace a number of
matters and that it would have been better if those
matters had been made the subject of separate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                           14</span>

questions, the answers given by the respondents
clearly show that they understood the questions
and wherever possible they have given complete
answers to those questions. That is to say, they
have given their explanation regarding the
circumstances appearing in the evidence set out in
the questions and wherever that was not feasible
they have said that they would do so in their
written statements. In fact written statements have
been filed by each of them in which every point left
over has been fully answered."
</p><p id="p_27">13. In this regard the ratio of the decision in the
case of <a href="/doc/1296709/" id="a_44">Makan Jivan and others v. The State of
Gujarat</a>, 1971 Cri.LJ 1310 also is illuminating.
While recording the statement of the accused, the
trial Court had read out the statement made by the
accused in the committal Court and asked them as
to what they had to say about the prosecution
evidence. The various circumstances and
evidence was not put to the accused in different
questions. Once again the Supreme Court noted
that it was a curable irregularity and prejudice
must be shown to have caused. In paragraph 15
the Court held :-
</p><p id="p_28">"In the instant case what the trial Court has done is
that after reading out the statements made by the
accused in the committal Court, it merely asked
them as to what they had to say about the
prosecution evidence recorded in their presence.
This is a wholly unsatisfactory way of questioning
the accused. The trial Court had a duty to put to
each of the accused the various circumstances
appearing against them and further put the
prosecution case generally for the purpose of
affording the accused an opportunity to explain the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                            15</span>

circumstances appearing against them. There is
no doubt that the examination of the accused
under <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_45">Section 342</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_46">Cr.P.C</a>. in this case is highly
defective. But that does not by itself vitiate the trial.
It is for the defence to satisfy the Court that
because of the defect in the procedure adopted,
accused have been prejudiced."
</p><p id="p_29">Reference with advantage may also be made to
the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/299576/" id="a_47">Ajit Kumar Chowdhry v. State of Bihar</a>,
1972 Cri.LJ 1315. In the cited case the
prosecution alleged that the accused had
committed a theft of the railway property. The said
accused had denied the recovery of the same. It
was not put to the accused that the said property
was stolen and there was an omission in this
regard. Once again the Supreme Court concluded
that no prejudice had been caused and held :-
"Unless injustice results from an irregularity in
complying with <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_48">Section 342</a>, interference on this
ground would not be justified. In the present case
when the appellant denied the recovery of railway
mirror in answer to question No. 1 no prejudice or
injustice can be considered to have been caused
to him by the Court's failure to refer to the fact of
the mirror being stolen."
</p><p id="p_30">Same view prevailed with the Supreme Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1035123/" id="a_49">Shivaji Sahebrao Bobade and another
v. State of Maharashtra</a>, 1973 Cri.LJ 1783 where
the answer given to the said question was :-
"It is also open to the appellate Court to call upon
the counsel for the accused to show what

circumstances established against him but not put
to him and if the accused is unable to offer the

appellate Court any plausible or reasonable
explanation of such circumstances, the Court may
assume that no acceptable answer exists and that
even if the accused had been questioned at the
proper time in the trial Court he would not have
been able to furnish any good ground to get out of
the circumstances on which the trial Court had
relied for its conviction. In such a case, the Court
proceeds on the footing that though a grave
irregularity has occurred as regards compliance
with <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_50">Section 342</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_51">Cr.P.C</a>. the omission has not
been shown to have caused prejudice to the
accused. In the present case, however, the High
Court, though not the trial Court has relied upon
the presence of blood on the pants of the blood
group of the deceased. We have not been shown
what explanation the accused could have offered
to this chemical finding, particularly when we
remember that his answer to the question
regarding the human blood on the blade of the
knife was 'I do not know'. Counsel for the
appellants could not make out any intelligent
explanation and the 'blood' testimony takes the
crime closer to the accused. However, we are not
inclined to rely overmuch on this evidentiary
circumstance, although we should emphasise how
this inadvertence of the trial Court had led to a
relevant fact being argued as unavailable to the
prosecution. Great care is expected of Sessions
Judges who try grave cases to collect every
incriminating circumstance and put it to the
accused even though at the end of a long trial the
Judge may be a little fagged out."
</p><p id="p_31">More close to the facts would be the decision of
the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/514616/" id="a_52">Labhchand
Dhanpat Singh Jain v. State of Maharashtra</a>, 1975
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    17</span>

        Cri.LJ 246. Herein also the Supreme Court held
        that the Court has to determine whether the
        prejudice had been caused to the accused or not.
        In the cited case after recording the entire
        evidence, the accused was simply asked as to
        whether he had heard the evidence and what he
        has to say in this regard. He filed a reply in the trial
        Court. The Supreme Court noted that since the
        accused was fully aware of the nature of the
        allegations, no prejudice was caused and rejected
        a similar plea by holding :-
</p><p id="p_32">        "It is clear to us that the appellant was fully aware
        of the nature of the allegations made against him.
        He had not merely given a detailed explanation
        under Section 108 of the Act, of the circumstances
        in which he said he was arrested with the gold
        bars, but, he had also filed an elaborate written
        statement. He had indicated that this is the only
        form in which he would give his explanation. It is
        true that the general form of questions put does
        not strictly comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_53">Section
        342</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>. But, we are unable
        to hold that the appellant suffered any injustice for
        this reason. Indeed, he had not even raised such a
        question in the trial Court or before the High Court.
        If he had done so, the alleged defect could have
        been easily cured. The objection seems to us to
        be most technical and flimsy. The defect could not
        have possibly vitiated the conviction of the
        appellant.""
</p>
<p id="p_33">         The Hon'ble Apex court observed as under as regards S.
</p>
<p id="p_34">313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_55">CrPC</a> in <a href="/doc/1792943/" id="a_56">State of Punjab vs. Hari Singh</a> - A.I.R. 2009 SC 1966:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                           18</span>

<p id="p_35">"29. Contextually we cannot bypass the decision of
a three-Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1035123/" id="a_57">Shivaji
Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra</a> (1973
(2) SCC 793) as the Bench has widened the
sweep of the provision concerning examination of
the accused after closing prosecution evidence.
Learned Judges in that case were considering the
fallout of omission to put to the accused a question
on a vital circumstance appearing against him in
the prosecution evidence. The three-Judge Bench
made the following observations therein :
"It is trite law, nevertheless fundamental, that the
prisoner's attention should be drawn to every
inculpatory material so as to enable him to explain
it. This is the basic fairness of a criminal trial and
failures in this area may gravely imperil the validity
of the trial itself, if consequential miscarriage of
justice has flowed. However, where such an
omission has occurred it does not ipso facto vitiate
the proceedings and prejudice occasioned by such
defect must be established by the accused. In the
event of evidentiary material not being put to the
accused, the court must ordinarily eschew such
material from consideration. It is also open to the
appellate court to call upon the counsel for the
accused to show what explanation the accused
has as regards the circumstances established
against him but not put to him and if the accused is
unable to offer the appellate court any plausible or
reasonable explanation of such circumstances, the
court may assume that no acceptable answer
exists and that even if the accused had been
questioned at the proper time in the trial court he
would not have been able to furnish any good
ground to get out of the circumstances on which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                            19</span>

the trial court had relied for its conviction."
</p><p id="p_36">30. The above approach shows that some dilution
of the rigour of the provision can be made even in
the light of a contention raised by the accused that
non- questioning him on a vital circumstance by
the trial court has caused prejudice to him. The
explanation offered by the counsel of the accused
at the appellate stage was held to be a sufficient
substitute for the answers given by the accused
himself.
</p><p id="p_37">31. What is the object of examination of an
accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_58">Section 313</a> of the Code ? The
section itself declares the object in explicit
language that it is "for the purpose of enabling the
accused personally to explain any circumstances
appearing in the evidence against helm". <a href="/doc/1046645/" id="a_59">In Jai
Dev v. State of Punjab</a>, (AIR 1963 SC 612)
Gajendragadkar, J. (as he then was) speaking for
a three-Judge Bench has focussed on the ultimate
test in determining whether the provision has been
fairly complied with. He observed thus :
"The ultimate test in determining whether or not the
accused has been fairly examined under <a href="/doc/697591/" id="a_60">Section
342</a> would be to inquire whether, having regard to
all the questions put to him, he did get an
opportunity to say what he wanted to say in
respect of prosecution case against him. If it
appears that the examination of the accused
person was defective and thereby a prejudice has
been caused to him, that would no doubt be a
serious infirmity."
</p><p id="p_38">32. Thus it is well settled that the provision is
mainly intended to benefit the accused and as its
corollary to benefit the court in reaching the final
conclusion:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                    20</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         33. At the same time it should be borne in mind
         that the provision is not intended to nail him to any
         position, but to comply with the most salutary
         principle of natural justice enshrined in the maxim
         audi alteram partem. The word "may" in clause (a)
         of sub-section (1) in <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_61">Section 313</a> of the Code
         indicates, without any doubt, that even if the court
         does not put any question under that clause the
         accused cannot raise any grievance for it. But if
         the court fails to put the needed question under
         clause (b) of the sub-section it would result in a
         handicap to the accused and he can legitimately
         claim that no evidence, without affording him the
         opportunity to explain, can be used against him. It
         is now well settled that a circumstance about which
         the accused was not asked to explain cannot be
         used against him."</blockquote>

<p id="p_39">          Therefore, from the aforesaid discussion it is clear that it is

well-settled that the statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_62">Section 313</a>, Cr PC must be

specific and all the circumstances under which the accused are facing

trial should be put so that a definite and clear explanation may come

from the mouth of the accused/ appellants. It is also well established

that the circumstances in respect of which an accused was not

examined under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_63">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure

cannot be used against him. It is equally well settled that even if some

question is omitted by the trial court during examination of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                      21</span>

accused under<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_64"> S. 313</a> CrPc, then unless any prejudice is shown to

have been caused to the accused regarding circumstance not put to

the accused, such omission would not be fatal to the prosecution

case.
</p>
<p id="p_40">          In the case at hand, the trial court had put question, viz.
</p>
<p id="p_41">Question no. 2, regarding amputation of the leg of the complainant

and also regarding disclosure statements of the appellants/accused

persons. Although no direct question regarding injuries inflicted by

appellants   were   put   to   the   appellants/accused   persons   but

considering the totality of the circumstances put to the accused under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_65">Section 313</a> CrPC, facts stated in charges framed against the

accused, I feel that the questions put to the accused were sufficient to

explain them the case of the prosecution, more so, when the

appellants have produced defence evidence also. The plea of alibi

taken by the accused Sanjay and plea of false implication by accused

Jai Prakash due to pending civil and criminal litigations with

complainant certainly show that no prejudice is caused to the

appellants by omission of such incriminating questions under<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_66"> S. 313</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                    <a href="/doc/1316937/" id="a_67">22</a></span>

CrPC. In any event of the matter, the counsel for the defence did not

show any prejudice having been caused to the appellants by not

putting a direct question on injuries inflicted by appellants to the

complainant and thus, I do not feel that this contention of counsel for

the defence has any merits.
</p>
<p id="p_42">          Non-recovery of weapon of offence, viz. pharsa/farsa is not

fatal to the prosecution case. In this regard, the Hon'ble Apex court

observed as under in <a href="/doc/69242/" id="a_68">Lakshmi v. State of U.P</a>., AIR 2002 SC 3119:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         "6. Undoubtedly, the identification of the body,
         cause of death and recovery of weapon with which
         injury may have been inflicted on the deceased
         are some of the important factors to be
         established by the prosecution in an ordinary
         given case to bring home the charge of offence
         under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_69">Section 302</a> IPC. This, however, is not an
         inflexible rule. It cannot be held as a general and
         broad proposition of law that where these aspects
         are not established, it would be fatal to the case of
         the prosecution and in all cases and eventualities,
         it ought to result in the acquittal of those who may
         be charged with the offence of murder. It would
         depend on the facts and circumstances of each
         case. A charge of murder many stand established
         against an accused even in absence of

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         "34. We also do not find any force in the
         submission of the learned counsel that the

         event, non-recovery of incriminating material from
         the accused cannot be a ground to exonerate
         them of the charges when the eye-witnesses
         examined by the prosecution are found to be
         trustworthy.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         35. <a href="/doc/439549/" id="a_71">In Krishna Mochi &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar</a>,

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         "It has been then submitted on behalf of the
         appellants that nothing incriminating could be

         they had no complicity with the crime. In my view,
         recovery of no incriminating material from the
         accused cannot alone be taken as a ground to
         exonerate them from the charges, more so when
         their participation in the crime is unfolded in ocular

<p id="p_44">          Thus from the foregoing discussion and considering the

facts of the present case, I do not find that mere non-recovery of

pharsa/farsa with which the left leg of the complainant was amputated

would not throw the case of the prosecution to the winds.

<p id="p_45">          As regards the statement of the complainant in his

examination-in-chief that the danda's shown to him, which were kept

in duly sealed pulanda were not the one's with which he was

assaulted, I feel that the same cannot lead to discrediting the

testimony of the said witness/complainant. In the instant case, the

incident took place on 5/1/1997 and the said complainant deposed as

PW2 on 23/9/1998. Due to such a long gap of time, it is obvious that

the complainant would not have remembered the exactness of the

weapon of offence. But at the same time the I.O. of the case, PW 4

and PW 2 Ct. Shailender PW2 have proved that the said broken

danda's/cricket   wickets   were   found   from   the   spot   of   the

incident/offence and they duly proved it. Be that as it may, it is well

settled that if the testimonies of the witnesses on the whole inspire

confidence then the minor descrepancies do not affect the

prosecution case. <a href="/doc/1400194/" id="a_72">In Sukhdev Yadav v.State of Bihar</a> AIR 2001 SC

of the Evidence Act provides scope for
impeaching the credit of a witness by proof of an

section is extracted below :

         inconsistent with the evidence need not
         necessarily be sufficient to amount to
         contradiction. Only such of the inconsistent

(Supra), the doctor who prepared the MLC was examined but the

doctor who gave the x-ray report could not be examined but in the

present case, the doctor who prepared the MLC has expired. This is a

different situation and thus, the judgments relied upon by the counsel

for the appellants do not benefit them as it is well settled that the

decisions of the higher courts cannot be applied like Euclid's theorem

and same should be applied having regard to the facts and

circumstances of the case.

<p id="p_59">          As regards the issue that the trial court based its judgment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                  30</span>

on the sole/solitary testimony of the complainant, the law as regards

sole witness is explained by the Apex court as under in <a href="/doc/224760/" id="a_81">Seeman @

Veeranam v. State</a>, by Inspector of Police-AIR 2005 SC 2503:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         "4. It is now well settled that the evidence of
         witness cannot be discarded merely on the
         ground that he is a related witness or the sole
         witness, or both, if otherwise the same is found
         credible. The witness could be a relative but that
         does not mean to reject his statement in totality.
         In such a case, it is the paramount duty of the
         court to be more careful in the matter of scrutiny
         of evidence of the interested witness, and if, on
         such scrutiny it is found that the evidence on
         record of such interested sole witness is worth
         credence, the same would not be discarded
         merely on the ground that the witness is an
         interested witness. Caution is to be applied by the
         court while scrutinizing the evidence of the
         interested sole witness. The prosecution's non-
         production of one independent witness who has
         been named in the FIR by itself cannot be taken
         to be a circumstance to discredit the evidence of
         the interested witness and disbelieve the
         prosecution case. It is well settled that it is the
         quality of the evidence and not the quantity of the
         evidence which is required to be judged by the
         court to place credence on the statement."</blockquote>

<p id="p_60">         Therefore, if the evidence of the solitary witness inspires

confidence and has been duly corroborated by the testimony of other

prosecution witnesses, then the same can be basis for the conviction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                     31</span>

of the accused persons. Injured in the incident is always an important

witness in the criminal case. Be that as it may, it is well settled that it

is not the quantity/count of the evidence but the quality/weight of the

evidence, which is to be seen by the courts while appreciating

evidence, in this regard, in <a href="/doc/504893/" id="a_82">Sunil Kumar v. State Govt. of NCT of

Delhi</a>-AIR 2004 SC 552, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as under:

         with approval in the case of <a href="/doc/1673242/" id="a_83">Jagdish Prasad and
         Ors. v. State of M.P</a>. (AIR 1994 SC 1251). This
         Court held that as a general rule the court can and
         may act on the testimony of a single witness
         provided he is wholly reliable. There is no legal
         impediment in convicting a person on the sole
         testimony of a single witness. That is the logic of
         <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_84">Section 134</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in
         short the `<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_85">Evidence Act</a>'). But, if there are doubts
         about the testimony the courts will insist for
         corroboration. It is for the Court to act upon the
         testimony of witnesses. It is not the number, the
         quantity, but the quality that is material. The time
         honoured principle is that evidence has to be
         weighed and not counted. On this principles
         stands the edifice of <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_86">Section 134</a> of the Evidence
         Act. The test is whether the evidence has a ring of
         truth, is cogent, credible and trustworthy, or
         otherwise."</blockquote>

<p id="p_61">          Now what remains to be seen is what charges are proved

against the accused persons. The accused Sanjay had hit the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                    32</span>

complainant with the danda/cricket wicket and accused Jai Prakash

had hit the complainant with pharsa/farsa and amputated the left leg

of the complainant. In the MLC apart from amputation various other

injuries and fractures on the body of the complainant have been

mentioned. On use of farsa/pharsa, which is a sharp weapon of

offence, the left leg of the complainant was amputated. But same

injury cannot be caused with a danda/cricket wicket. With the

danda/cricket wicket other injuries mentioned in the MLC like fracture

of fingers etc. may be caused. Clearly, both the accused persons

shared common intention although one has used sharp edged

weapon and the other a blunt object to inflict injuries on the person of

the complainant/victim.

        <a href="/doc/800773/" id="a_92">Section 33</a> which makes it clear that the "act"
        spoken of in <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_93">Section 34</a> includes a series of acts

        34</a>, may be construed to mean "when criminal acts

        by different confederates in the criminal action may
        be different but all must in one way or the other
        participate and engage in the criminal enterprise,
        for instance, one may only stand guard to prevent
        any person coming to the relief of the victim, or
        may otherwise facilitate the execution of the
        common design. Such a person also commits an
        "act" as much as his co-participants actually
        committing the planned crime. In the case of an
        offence involving physical violence, however, it is
        essential for the application of <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_95">Section 34</a> that the

        venture. Such presence of those who in one way
        or the other facilitate the execution of the common
        design, is itself tantamount to actual participation
        in the `criminal act'. The essence of <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_96">Section 34</a> is

of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The
section is only a rule of evidence and does not

for an offence committed by another in the course
of criminal act perpetrated by several persons

proof of common intention is seldom available

<p id="p_74">          As regards the plea of alibi of the appellant/accused

Sanjay, the said appellant examined DW2, Vishal Singh. In this

regard, the concept of alibi has been explained by the Hon'ble Apex

Court in <a href="/doc/1460988/" id="a_127">Binay Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar</a>, A.I.R. 1997 SC 322,

in following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">          "22. The Latin word alibi means "elsewhere" and
          that word is used for convenience when an
          accused takes recourse to a defence line that
          when the occurrence took place he was so far
          away from the place of occurrence that it is
          extremely improbable that he would have
          participated in the crime. It is basic law that in a
          criminal case, in which the accused is alleged to
          have inflicted physical injury to another person,
          the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                          39</span>

accused was present at the scene and has
participated in the crime. The burden would not be
lessened by the mere fact that the accused has
adopted the defence of alibi. The plea of the
accused in such cases need be considered only
when the burden has been discharged by the
prosecution      satisfactorily.   But    once     the
prosecution succeeds in discharging the burden it
is incumbent on the accused, who adopts the plea
of alibi, to prove it with absolute certainty so as to
exclude the possibility of his presence at the place
of occurrence. When the presence of the accused
at the scene of occurrence has been established
satisfactorily by the prosecution through reliable
evidence, normally the Court would be slow to
believe any counterevidence to the effect that he
was elsewhere when the occurrence happened.
</blockquote><p id="p_75">But if the evidence adduced by the accused is of
such a quality and of such a standard that the
Court may entertain some reasonable doubt
regarding his presence at the scene when the
occurrence took place, the accused would, no
doubt, be entitled to the benefit of that reasonable
doubt. For that purpose, it would be a sound
proposition to be laid down that, in such
circumstances, the burden on the accused is
rather heavy. It follows, therefore, that strict proof
is required for establishing the plea of alibi. This
Court has observed so on earlier occasions (vide
<a href="/doc/42851/" id="a_128">Dudh Nath Pandey v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>,
(1981) 2 SCC 166: AIR 1981 SC 911; <a href="/doc/1042222/" id="a_129">State of

<p id="p_76">Keeping in view, the aforesaid legal position, let us consider
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                    40</span>

the statement of DW2. The said witness, DW2, deposed that the

accused was in his village Kondu on the date of the incident and only

when the mother of Jai Prakash, who is mother-in-law of the sister of

accused Sanjay, came to the village and told that Sanjay has been

falsely implicated in some case, then upon decision of Panchayat, the

said witness along with one Shiv Pd. Brought accused to Delhi at his

sister's residence from where he surrendered along with accused Jai

Prakash before the Police. The said story of DW2 does not inspire

any confidence for two reasons. Firstly, he did not bring on record any

document/tickets to show that accused Sanjay, Shiv Pd. and DW2

Vishal travelled from village Kondu to Delhi and also the said other

person, Shiv Pd. was not examined in this regard. Secondly, why did

he take him to the residence of his sister instead of taking him straight

away to the Police Station. Thus, the plea of alibi of appellant/accused

Sanjay is not sustainable.
