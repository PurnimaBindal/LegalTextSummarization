 present suit.
</p>

<p id="p_3">Proceedings in the Suit
</p><p id="p_4">2. Along with the suit, the Plaintiff filed an interim application [I.A No.
10869/2018] and sought restraining orders in respect of (a) Print
Advertisement and (b) Television Commercial (TVC) [Collectively referred
as 1st Impugned Advertisements]. This Court vide it‟s order dated 27th
August 2018 directed the Defendant not to publish the advertisement and to
remove the TVC from the website www.youtube.com. The Court also
directed the Defendant not to publish the „new advertisement‟ which was yet
to be aired. Aggrieved by the said order, the Defendant filed an Appeal
bearing FAO (OS) (COMM) No. 209/2018. In then said appeal, the Division
Bench vide order dated 5th September 2018, permitted the Defendant to
publish its „new advertisement‟. Pursuant to the said order, the Defendant
aired it‟s TVC in and around 13th November 2018. The Plaintiff aggrieved
by the said TVC, filed another application bearing No. 16105/2018 seeking
an injunction against the Defendant from airing, broadcasting or publishing
its New Television Commercial aired on 13th November, 2018 [2nd
Impugned Advertisement]. The Application came up for hearing before this
Court on 27th November 2018 and the Court was pleased to grant an ad-
interim injunction in favour of the Plaintiff. Aggrieved by the aforenoted
order dated 27th November 2018, the Defendant preferred an Appeal bearing
FAO (OS) (COMM) No. 285/2018. The Division Bench of this Court vide
its judgement dated 3rd December 2018 permitted the Defendant to publish
its advertisement in the modified form, incorporating the changes suggested
by its counsel during the course of hearing. The operative portion of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                           Page 2 of 41</span>
 order reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "4.We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. During the
     course of his submissions, Mr. Rajiv Nayar, learned Sr. Counsel
     appearing for the appellant submits that the basis for the
     respondent to file the suit seeking injunction on the alleged
     ground that the appellant's advertisement is misleading unfair,
     deceptive and is sought to be issued with a dishonest intention to
     disparage the respondent's product is because of the depiction of
     the bottle in white and red colour, which according to the
     respondent herein depicts it's bottle of Chyawanprash. He
     submits that the appellant herein is ready and willing to replace
     the said bottle in the advertisement with a bottle of the appellant's
     own product / Zandu Chyawanprash wherever it occurs in the
     advertisement. He states that the very basis on which the
     allegations as afore-stated are being made shall not subsist and
     the stay needs to be vacated. He states, the appellant shall
     continue this depiction in the advertisement till the next date of
     hearing before the learned Single Judge on 8th January, 2019 as
     according to him, it is this period where there is maximum
     consumption of Chyawanprash.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     5. Mr. Hemant Singh, learned counsel appearing for the
     respondent, on this submission of Mr. Nayar, states that the
     appellant must also ensure that the printing on the bottle of the
     appellant", as proposed to be used in the subject commercial,
     should also depict the words "Zandu Chyawanprash". If this
     being the submission made by Mr. Singh, we are of the view that
     even the bottle of red and white depicted in the impugned
     advertisement, supposed to be relating to the respondent herein,
     does not depict any words on the same.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     6. There is no denial of the fact that the colour of green and
     yellow is the colour of the bottle of the appellant herein and is
     different from the bottle of the respondent herein. We take the
     submission of Mr. Nayar on record. The appellant shall carry out
     necessary changes in the advertisement and thereafter proceed to
     advertise the product. This arrangement shall continue till the
     next date, i.e., 8th January, 2019, when the suit is listed before
     the learned Single Judge. The order dated 27th November, 2018
     is modified to that extent.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      The appeal stands disposed of."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">3. Consequently, the Defendant after making the changes as directed by the
Division Bench replaced the red bottle shown in the TVC with its own bottle
and aired its modified TVC on 12th December 2018. This aforesaid modified
advertisement has been impugned in the Interim Application bearing No.
3084/ 2019 under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 read with Rule 2A of CPC [3rd
Impugned advertisement]


</p><p id="p_6">4. Arguments on all the pending applications were heard and concluded on
13th May 2019. During the course of the arguments, Mr. Bhandari stated that
without prejudice to Defendant‟s rights and contention, for the purpose of
disposal of the present application, it is willing to make certain
modifications in the advertisement. Pursuant thereto, as directed, an affidavit
dated 14th May 2019 was filed wherein the Defendant gave an undertaking
not to publish the advertisement as well as the TVC without making certain
modifications. The relevant portion of the affidavit reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "3. The Defendant shall during the pendency of the suit as an
     interim measure modify the two print advertisements annexed at
     51-54 of the List of Documents (Part IV) dated 16.08.2018 filed

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     5. I state that the Defendant shall run the TVC annexed at page
     14-17 of the note dated 25.04.2019 filed by the Plaintiff during
     the pendency of the Suit as an interim measure after replacing the
     Red bottle shown in the said TVC with a bottle of Green and
     Yellow ion colour. Furthermore, the Defendant shall also
     remove the word "Baaki" from the voiceover in the said TVC at
     page 16 of the Note dated 25.04.2019 only as an interim measure
     during the pendency of the captioned Suit. For avoidance of any

     at page 48 to 49 of the note dated 25.4.2019 filed by the Plaintiff,
     in addition to the above. It is stated that the Defendant shall
     increase the intensity of the colour scheme of bottle shown in the
     said TVC at page 48-49 so that it looks more like a green and
     yellow bottle. Please find attached the said TVC annexed which
     the Defendant shall modify hereto as Document III.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     7. The Defendant undertakes not to publish the above mentioned
     TVC‟s without making the modifications as set out hereinabove."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">5. Noticing this categorical stand of the Defendant, the matter was then
listed for directions on 28th May 2019. On the said date, Mr. Singh reiterated
that the modifications suggested by the Defendant do not address the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                              Page 5 of 41</span>
 grievance of the Plaintiff and the proposed amendments are also liable to be
impugned. However, on 31st May 2019, as directed, the Plaintiff filed an
additional response/written submissions to the affidavit dated 14th May
2019.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6. In view of the above, it is evident that during the pendency of the present
suit, the Defendant has undertaken not to publish the print advertisement or
the TV Commercial except in the modified form. Thus, at this stage, the
Court is only required to appraise the proposed modified advertisements as
suggested in the affidavit. The order/injunctions granted in the applications
under consideration that are in force are only ad-interim injunctions and
express a prima facie view. The same are pending final adjudication and are
now being finally disposed of by this common order.
</p>

<p id="p_9">Facts in Brief
</p><p id="p_10">7. The present suit is for permanent injunction restraining the Defendants, its
directors, associates, assignees in business, sister concerns, distributors,
dealers, stockiests and agents from broadcasting, printing and publishing the
ZANDU CHYAVANPRASHAD advertisements, in any electronic or print
media or in any manner which is disparaging and injurious to the goodwill
and reputation of Chyawanprash which includes Plaintiff‟s DABUR
CHYAWANPRASH. Further, the Plaintiff is also seeking a permanent
injunction against the Defendant from using the Plaintiff‟s registered
trademark DABUR CHYAWANPRASH or any other similar trademark
which may amount to infringement of the Plaintiff‟s registered trademark.
Plaintiff as well as the Defendant both sell the traditional „Chyawanprash‟.

<p id="p_15"> Case of the Plaintiff
</p><p id="p_16">9. Mr. Hemant Singh, learned Counsel for the Plaintiff argued that the
Defendant‟s product depicted in the advertisement is meant for diabetic
patients. The Defendant is not comparing its sugar free Chyavanprashad
with other like products, but is instead, comparing it with non-diabetic
traditional Chyawanprash. The Defendant is thus mischievously comparing
different categories of products as comparables which is not permissible in
law. It is further urged that the Defendant is misleading and misrepresenting
to the consumers that Chyawanprash is harmful, even to non-diabetic




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                            Page 15 of 41</span>
 consumer which is a false statement. The Defendant‟s advertisement
nowhere discloses that its product is for diabetic patients. Therefore the
entire campaign of the Defendant is a misrepresentation of facts, misleading,
malicious and disparaging. The intent of the impugned advertisements is to
demean and disparage Chyawanprash as a category of product. The Plaintiff
has provided details of the ingredients which are required to make
Chyawanprash in Ayurvedic recipe. The use of various herbs including amla
to manufacture Chyawanprash requires high quantity of sugar to make the
product palatable, otherwise it will be too sour or bitter to be consumed. Mr.
Singh has also placed reliance on the affidavit of Dr. J.L.N Shastri who has
confirmed that Chyawanprash is not harmful. Chyawanprash is prescribed in
Ayurveda for enhancing immunity apart from other uses by physicians and
hence cannot be considered as harmful. Chyawanprash is not like a Cola
drink where the whole bottle is consumed by a consumer on purchase. The
prescribed dosage of Chyawanprash is merely 2 tea spoons a day which is
not harmful. Further, it was argued that the issue of disparagement is should
be ascertained by taking into account the factors laid down by this Court and
as well as the Supreme Court. The Defendant's impugned advertisements fall
foul of all those requirements. To support his case, Mr. Hemant Singh has
strongly relied upon the following judgements:
</p><p id="p_17"> <a href="/doc/930422/" id="a_1">Dabur India Limited v. Emami Limited</a> (2004 (29) PTC1 (Del))

Case of the Defendant
</p><p id="p_18">10. On the other hand, Mr. Bhandari argued that the Plaintiff has miserably
failed to make out a case for interim injunction. The Defendant vide its
advertisements only intends to inform the public at large, the availability of
a sugar-free Chyawanprash. The advertisement of the Defendant aims at
informing the sugar conscious consumers that all conventional or traditional
chyawanprash has sugar content and the product of the Defendant does not
have any sugar. The advertisement nowhere depicts that intake of sugar is
bad for health. The said advertisement only provides an option to buyers
who want to avail the benefits of chyawanprash without sugar.
</p>


<p id="p_19">11. It is further argued that Plaintiff herein itself manufactures and sells a
sugar free version of Chyawanprash known as "Dabur Chyawanprakash"
with the tagline "goodness of Chyawanprash with no added sugar" thereby
implying that one can enjoy the benefits of Chyawanprash even without
sugar. Mr. Bhandari points out that infact, the Plaintiff itself had used
various advertisements to promote other products like Honey by
highlighting negative effects of sugar on our body. Thus, the impugned
advertisement in no manner tarnishes /disparages/ slanders the product of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                             Page 17 of 41</span>
 Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_20">12. It is also argued that the Defendant in its advertisements nowhere tends
to disparage Chaywanprash, since the Defendant itself manufactures and
sells Chyawanprash which contains sugar. Disparaging the category of
"Chyavanprash" as a whole would also have an adverse affect on the
Defendant‟s own brand- Zandu Chyavanprashad.
</p>
<p id="p_21">13. The learned counsel for the Defendant has relied on the following
judgements to elucidate the law on disparagement:
</p><p id="p_22">    <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_7">Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. v. M.P. Ramchandran &amp; Anr</a>. 1998

</p><p id="p_23">14. Mr. Bhandari urges that assuming arguendo, the first impugned
advertisement and TVC are disparaging, the modified advertisements and
TVC surely cannot be held to be disparaging by any stretch of imagination.
</p>
<p id="p_24">Reasoning and Analysis
</p><p id="p_25">15. Before evaluating the rival contentions of the parties, it would be apt to
reflect on the law relating to comparative advertising, which has been




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                             Page 18 of 41</span>
 explicated in several judgments of this Court. While doing so, it would
suffice if reference is made to just a few. This Court in <a href="/doc/91815858/" id="a_13">Havells India Ltd. v.
Amritanshu Khaitan</a>, (2015) SCC Online Delhi 8115, has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     "24. In Mc Donalds Hamburgers Ltd. v. Burgerking (UK) Ld.
     [1987] F.S.R. 112 followed in <a href="/doc/89585883/" id="a_14">Glaxosmithkline Consumer
     Healthcare Ltd. v. Heinz India</a> (supra), it has been held that
     advertisements are not to be read as if they are some testamentary
     provision in a Will or a clause in some agreement with every
     word being carefully considered and the words as a whole being
     compared. <a href="/doc/131750016/" id="a_15">In Marico Ltd. v. Adani Wilmar Ltd. CS (OS) No</a>.
     246/2013 it has been held that in determining the meaning of an
     advertisement, the Court has to take into account the fact that
     public expects a certain amount of hyperbole in advertising and
     the test to be applied is whether a reasonable man would take the
     claim being made as one made seriously.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">     IN COMPARATIVE ADVERTISING, A CERTAIN AMOUNT
     OF DISPARAGEMENT IS IMPLICIT

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     36. A comparison, which is unfavourable to a competitor, does
     not necessarily mean that it is dishonest or unduly detrimental. A
     Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/134483884/" id="a_16">Colgate Palmolive Company v.
     Hindustan Unilever Ltd</a>., 2014 (57) PTC 47 [Del] (DB] has held
     that in comparative advertising, a certain amount of
     disparagement is implicit and as long as the advertisement is
     limited only to puffing, there can be no actionable claim against
     the same. The relevant portion of said judgment reads as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">     "27. The law relating to disparaging advertisements is now well
     settled. While, it is open for a person to exaggerate the claims
     relating to his goods and indulge in puffery, it is not open for a
     person to denigrate or disparage the goods of another person. In
     case of comparative advertisement, a certain amount of
     disparagement is implicit. If a person compares its goods and
     claims that the same are better than that of its competitors, it is
     implicit that the goods of his competitor's are inferior in

     the Act, 1999 and the ASCI Code which lists the conditions
     under which comparative advertising is permitted is to stimulate
     competition between suppliers of goods and services to the
     consumer's advantage, by allowing competitors to highlight
     objectively the merits of the various comparative products while,
     at the same time, prohibiting practices which may distort
     competition, be detrimental to competitors and have an adverse
     effect on consumer choice.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     39. This Court is of the view that it is duty bound to interpret the

     consumers are protected from possibly misleading advertising.

     highlight a special feature/characteristic of his product which sets
     it apart from its competitors and to make a comparison as long as
     it is true. For instance, if a chocolate biscuit manufacturer issues
     a comparative advertising highlighting that his product has the
     highest chocolate content and the lowest price, then in the
     opinion of this Court the rival manufacturer cannot seek an
     injunction on the ground that fibre content or calorific value or

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     49. In other words, it is open to an advertiser to objectively

     which may include price. There is no requirement in law to
     disclose each and every factor/characteristic in comparative
     advertisement. No reasonable observer would expect one trader
     to point to all the advantages of its competitor's business and
     failure to do so does not per se take the advertising outside what
     reasonable people would regard as 'honest'."

<p id="p_38">19. The words "advertising" and "comparative advertising" have also been
defined in the Advertising Directive of EEC. In terms of Articles 2(a) of the
said Directive, advertising means "the making of a representation in any
form in connection with a trade, business, craft or profession in order to
promote the supply of goods or services". Comparative advertising is
defined in Clause 2(c) of the said Directive as "any advertising which
explicitly or by implication identifies a competitor or goods or services
offered by a competitor".

<p id="p_39">20. In view of the afore-noted provisions and the case laws, there cannot be
any dispute that comparative advertising is permissible in law. There are
however certain guidelines that the Courts have recognized when it comes to

<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      49. A Division bench of this Hon'ble Court in Dabur India Ltd.

     permissible limits of puffery would surely be in the realm of
     false, misleading, unfair and deceptive representation and may
     not be entitled to any constitutional protection."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">22. Keeping the aforenoted principles in mind, which appear in all the
judgments dealing with question of disparagement by comparative
advertisement, the Court shall now proceed to critically analyze whether in
the present case, the Defendant should be restrained from carrying on with
the impugned print advertisement and the TVC in the modified form as
suggested in the affidavit dated 14th May 2019.
</p>

<p id="p_42">Whether the Defendant, while advertising its product, can be permitted
to compare its sugar free variant Chyavanprashad with the
Chyawanprash which contains sugar?
</p>

<p id="p_43">23. The Plaintiff's case is that of generic disparagement. Plaintiff admits that




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                               Page 25 of 41</span>
 the Defendant is not directly disparaging Plaintiff's Chyawanprash, but
alleges that the disparagement is of "Chyawanprash" generically which
includes Plaintiff's product which has a significant market share. Plaintiff
alleges that the proposed modified changes are wholly irrelevant, as the
disparagement is of the entire category of Chyawanprash generically. Mr.
Hemant Singh argued that the advertisements mislead the consumers and
gives an impression that Chyawanprash is not healthy and is rather harmful
because 50% of its composition is sugar. He argues that the intent of the
advertisements is to denigrate and devalue Chyawanprash in the garb of
educating the consumers.
</p>

<p id="p_44">24. On the other hand, the thrust of the argument of Mr. Bhandari is that the
products of the Plaintiff are not being disparaged and there is also no generic
disparagement of Chyawanprash. He argued that the Defendant's right of
commercial speech has to be protected and the story line and the intention of
the impugned advertisement is only to inform the public at large about the
intake of sugar and the availability of a sugar free variant.
</p>

<p id="p_45">25. Undoubtedly, the impact of advertisements in electronic media cannot be
understated. The visual impact of the telecast and imprint has immense
effect. The Supreme Court in Tata Press Ltd. v. MTNL &amp; Ors (1995) 5
SCC 139 has held that commercial speech is a part of the freedom of speech
and expression guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_21">article 19(l)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.
An advertisement was taken to be a species of commercial speech. In
paragraph 23 of the aforesaid case, the Supreme Court elucidated as
follows:--

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                              Page 26 of 41</span>

     is nonetheless dissemination of information regarding the product
     advertised. Public at large is benefited by the information made
     available through the advertisement. In a democratic economy
     free flow of commercial information is indispensable. There
     cannot be honest and economical marketing by the public at large
     without being educated by the information disseminated through
     advertisements. The economic system in a democracy would be
     handicapped without there being freedom of "commercial
     speech"..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">26. It is to be borne in mind that both Plaintiff as well as the Defendant sell
Chyawanprash and also the sugar free variants. The Plaintiff does not
dispute that Chyawanprash contains 50% sugar, but contends that the same
is as per the ayurvedic recipe. In support of this submission, the Plaintiff has
also relied upon certain authoritative textbooks. Relying upon the same, it
has been contended that the composition of Chyawanprash contains sugar as
an important ingredient. The Defendant also claims that it has developed the
sugar free variant as per authoritative textbooks. It is claimed that its product
uses all the ingredients as prescribed in the recipe except for 6 ingredients
out of which 3 are sources of sugar and other three are suitably replaced for
benefits.
</p>

<p id="p_47">27. In view of the competing rights of the parties, the Courts have
enunciated several tests to determine and decide the question of
disparagement. The decision of the Division Bench in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_22">Dabur India Ltd. v.
M/s Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd</a>. (2010) SCC Online Del 391 is relevant
in this context, wherein the Court inter alia held as under:-

      guiding principles for us should be the following:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">     (i) An advertisement is commercial speech and is protected by
     <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_23">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.

<blockquote id="blockquote_41">     (iii) Of course, there would be some grey areas but these need not
     necessarily be taken as serious representations of fact but only as

<blockquote id="blockquote_42">     To this extent, in our opinion, the protection of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_24">Article 19(l)(a)</a> of
     the Constitution is available. However, if an advertisement
     extends beyond the grey areas and becomes a false, misleading,
     unfair or deceptive advertisement, it would certainly not have the
     benefit of any protection.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">     15. There is one other decision that we think would give some
     guidance and that is <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_25">Pepsi Co. Inc. &amp; Ors. v. Hindustan Coca
     Cola Ltd. &amp; Another</a>, 2003 (27) PTC 305 (Del.) (DB). In this
     decision, a Division Bench of this Court held that while boasting
     about one's product is permissible, disparaging a rival product is
     not. The fourth guiding principle for us, therefore, is: (iv) While
     glorifying its product, an advertiser may not denigrate or
     disparage a rival product. Similarly, in Halsbury‟s Laws of
     England (Fourth Edition Reissue, Volume 28) it is stated in
     paragraph 278 that "[It] is actionable when the words go beyond
     a mere puff and constitute untrue statements of fact about a
     rival's product." This view was followed, amongst others, in
     <a href="/doc/1357815/" id="a_26">Dabur India Ltd. vs. Wipro Limited, Bangalore</a>, 2006 (32) PTC
     677 (Del). "[It] is one thing to say that the defendant's product is
     better than that of the plaintiff and it is another thing to say that
     the plaintiffs product is inferior to that of the defendant."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">     16. In Pepsi Co. it was also held that certain factors have to be
     kept in mind while deciding the question of disparagement.
     These factors are: (i) Intent of the commercial, (ii) Manner of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                               Page 28 of 41</span>
      commercial, and (iii) Story line of the commercial and the
     message sought to be conveyed. While we generally agree with
     these factors, we would like to amplify or restate them in the
     following terms:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">     (1) The intent of the advertisement - this can be understood from
     its story line and the message sought to be conveyed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">     (2) The overall effect of the advertisement - does it promote the
     advertiser's product or does it disparage or denigrate a rival
     product?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">     In this context it must be kept in mind that while promoting its
     product, the advertiser may, while comparing it with a rival or a
     competing product, make an unfavorable comparison but that
     might not necessarily affect the story line and message of the
     advertised product or have that as its overall effect.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">     (3) The manner of advertising - is the comparison by and large
     truthful or does it falsely denigrate or disparage a rival product?
     While truthful disparagement is permissible, untruthful
     disparagement is not permissible."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">28. From the reading of the above noted judgement, it emerges that the
Court has to necessarily examine the intent and overall effect of the
advertisement. The "look and feel" of an advertisement and the message
conveyed by the story line to an average person, are the critical factors
which assist the Court to come to a right conclusion. If one were to view the
proposed modified print advertisement, it can be clearly discerned that the
Plaintiff's product is not the subject matter of comparison. The comparison
is with Chyawanprash as a generic product. As discussed earlier the law
permits comparison. While making a comparison, a competitor can declare
his goods to be the best in the world even though the declaration is untrue,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                             Page 29 of 41</span>
 however, while claiming that its goods are better than his competitor, he
cannot say that the competitor‟s goods are bad. Thus, puffery is allowed,
but slander and defamation of the goods of the competitor is impermissible.
The proposed Print advertisement is only making a comparison with the
generic product "Chyawanprash" where a declaration is being given that the
product of the Defendant does not contain sugar. The impugned
advertisement in its modified version is highlighting the benefits       of the
sugar free variant. Plaintiff's contention that Chyawanprash has been shown
to be bad or unhealthy is misplaced.       The way I see it, the modified
advertisement only gives the information and a choice or option to the
viewers/consumers who would like to buy a product that is giving the
benefit of Chyawanprash without sugar. The comparison in the present case
is inevitable. The benefit of a product without sugar can be best showcased
by juxtaposing with the variant that has sugar in it. The question whether
the sugar free variant is indeed a healthier option, is being left for the
consumer to decide. But, certainly it cannot be said that the advertisement is
in any manner implying disparagement of "Chyawanprash" generically.
</p>

<p id="p_49">29. Though the original versions of the advertisements are not subject matter
of discussion in the present judgment, however, it needs to be understood
that even if there was any hint of unwarranted depiction, the same has been
removed in the proposed modified advertisement. Mr. Bhandari is also right
in saying that the statement made in the print advertisement is factually
correct. The declaration in the advertisement to the effect "Chyawanprash
mein 50% se zyada cheeni hai" [Chyawanprash contains more than 50%
sugar] is factually correct, and this is not a disputed fact. The message "zara




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                              Page 30 of 41</span>
 sochiye apke Chyawanprash mein 50% se zyada cheeni hai [thinkover:
Chyawanprash contains more than 50% sugar]/dyan de ji ye apke
Chyawanprash mein 50% se zyada cheeni hai [pay attention Chyawanprash
contains more than 50% sugar] is along with a picture where a glass bottle
has been split open into two halves: one half is shown containing a white
substance suggesting it to be sugar and the other half containing a dark
colored substance suggesting it to be the herbal ingredients of
Chyawanprash. These are cautionary/informative messages to the viewers
that the product Chyawanprash contains 50% sugar. This is followed by a
claim made by the Defendant that its product has all the benefits of
Chyawanprash without sugar. The visualization of the advertisement does
not in any way suggest that Chyawanprash is unhealthy or is bad for
consumption. It only sends an impactful message that Chyawanprash, as a
matter of fact, contains 50% sugar. The Defendant‟s right of free speech
permits it to state the benefit of its product and is also entitled to make a
comparison to the extent it has been done in the advertisement in question.
</p>

<p id="p_50">30. Likewise, the story board of the TV Commercial, the one which is
presently continuing and also the proposed TVC has no component of
comparison with the Plaintiff's product. The comparison in both the TVCs
is again with Chyawanprash. The story board of the advertisement shows an
actor, eating the contents from a bottle with a spoon. A child portraying to
be his son confronts him and enquires if he is eating "cheeni" [sugar]. The
mother of the child steps in and points out that the content of the bottle
consumed by the father contains more than 50% sugar and at that stage, the
Defendant's product is shown with the message that it does not contain




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                             Page 31 of 41</span>
 sugar. This message is then repeated by showing a spoon loaded with
ingredient with a voice over message to the effect "cheeni wali immunity
bhagae [give away sugar based immunity]. This is followed by depicting
the Defendant's product with a voice over message "immunity bina cheeni
ke [immunity without sugar]. The story line emphasizes that there is a sugar
free variant which gives the same benefit of immunity that comes from
Chyawanprash. Again, the comparison here is only limited to show that
Chyawanprash traditionally contains 50% sugar and that Defendant has a
sugar free variant. This comparison, is not slanderous or denigrating the
generic product Chyawanprash and is therefore permissible.
</p>

<p id="p_51">31. I also do not find any merit in the contention of the Plaintiff that the
advertisement is misleading and malicious, as the same does not compare
Defendant's sugar free diabetic product with other sugar free similar
products in the market including Plaintiff's Chyawanprakash which is also
sugar free. In fact, the advertisement is not comparative in a strict sense. It
only gives a message that the Defendant's product which is a sugar free
variant is available for the consumers.        In this process, no doubt a
comparison has been done with the sugar based product; however, there is
no misleading aspect to it. The main thrust of the advertisement is to
showcase the benefit of Chyawanprash without sugar and therefore the
Defendant was not required to compare the product only with other similar
products as has been contended by the Plaintiff.

<p id="p_52"> Is the Defendant misleading and misrepresenting the consumers that
Chyawanprash is harmful?
</p><p id="p_53">32. Mr. Hemant Singh has argued that the formulation of the Defendant is a
diabetic sugar free Chyawanprash and since there is no comparison being
done with diabetic Chyawanprash, the entire campaign is mischievous and
misleading. He also argued that comparing different categories of product
as comparable is not permissible in law. He also urged that the Defendant is
misleading and misrepresenting to the consumer that Chyawanprash is
harmful even to non-diabetic consumers which is a false statement.
However, I am unable to perceive any such misrepresentation or misleading
declarations or statement in the advertisement in question.        In fact the
Defendant is not stating that the product "Chyawanprash" is harmful.
Defendant is clearly highlighting that a healthier option is available. This
does not render the Plaintiff's product as unhealthy or bad. No material has
been shown to say that the Defendant's product Chyawanprashad is only
meant for diabetic patients. It may be suitable for them is altogether another
aspect. It does not mean that a non-diabetic patient cannot consume the
Defendant's product.

<p id="p_54">Is the Defendant disparaging the entire category of Chyawanprash by
stating in its advertisement that it contains high level of sugar?

<p id="p_55">33. The law relating to disparagement has been laid down by several Courts
in numerous judgments and both the parties have cited quite a few
judgments in support of their stand. The definition of disparagement as
given in Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">     "A derogatory comparison of one thing with another; the act or




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                             Page 33 of 41</span>
      an instance of castigating or detracting from the reputation of,
     esp. unfairly or untruthfully; a false and injurious statement that
     discredits or detracts from the reputation of another's property,
     product or business."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_56">Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition, defines "Trade Disparagement" to
inter-alia mean:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">     "The common-law tort of belittling someone's business, goods, or
     services with a remark that is false or misleading but not
     necessarily defamatory. To succeed at the action, a plaintiff must
     prove that; the defendant made the disparaging remark; the
     defendant intended to injure the business, knew that the
     statement was false, or recklessly disregarded whether it was
     true; and the statement resulted in special damages to the
     plaintiff, by passing off."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_57">34. Amongst the judgments cited by the parties, the learned counsel for the
Plaintiff has urged that the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/55113949/" id="a_27">Hindustan Unilever Ltd.
vs. Gujarat Co</a> operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. &amp; Ors (supra) is
squarely applicable to the present case wherein the Court has held that
generic disparagement of a rival product without specifically identifying or
pin pointing rival product is equally objectionable. Even if there is no direct
reference to product of Plaintiff and only a reference is made to entire class
of products in its generic sense, even in those circumstances disparagement
is possible. However, during the course of arguments, the counsel for the
Defendant pointed out that the said judgment has been appealed and the
Division Bench of High Court of Bombay has held that a blanket injunction
could not have been granted by the learned single judge and that the TVC




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                              Page 34 of 41</span>
 cannot be said to be of objectionable nature. Nonetheless, the Court has to
take an independent view in each case having regard to the Commercial in
question.   The Courts have also said that the Plaintiff ought not to be
hypersensitive. Ultimately, the Consumer is the one who has to decide
which is best suited for him or her. After having carefully analyzed the
advertisement and the TVC, the Court does not find that the Defendant is
targeting the Plaintiff or the generic product 'Chyawanprash'. There is also
nothing to suggest that the modified advertisement disparages or denigrates
the Plaintiff's product or Chyawanprash either overtly or covertly. The
advertisement does not send a negative message, as is being perceived by
the Plaintiff.   The Defendant‟s limited comparative analysis cannot be
comprehended to be depicting the rival product negatively. As discussed
above, there is nothing factually incorrect in the advertisement.            The
Defendant is thus entitled to say that the advertisements in question and the
story line portray truthful claims. The Defendant is also entitled to invite the
consumers, who are avoiding sugar, to opt for its product which has no sugar
component at all. The story line of the TVC shows a man in his mid 30's
who is trying to avoid sugar. The female actor is shown rejecting all
products which have sugar. When the person at the check out counter,
apprises her of the fact that traditional Chyawanprash has more than 50%
sugar, she rejects that as well. There is no depiction of the product of the
Plaintiff and the Defendant is only stating a fact and comparing its sugar free
variant with traditional/regular Chyawanprash which comparison as
discussed above in detail, is permissible in law. There is no statement to the
effect that Chyawanprash is bad for health and should not be consumed. The
sugar free variants are normally targeted for consumers who are conscious




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                               Page 35 of 41</span>
 of sugar consumption in the food and day-to-day life. Avoiding sugar may
not be necessarily on account of a medical ailment. Consumers often adopt
sugar free variants by choice. Plaintiff's contention that sugar is not harmful
and therefore the Defendant cannot denigrate Chyawanprash because of high
content of sugar is misconceived. There are several studies in public domain
conducted by health organizations that suggest the harmful effects of sugar.
The World Health Organization in its report dated 7th August 2018 warns
about the ill effects of sugar. At the same time there is also sufficient
material available that highlights the negative effect of sugar free
alternatives. The authenticity and source of such studies would need deeper
scrutiny as the topic is highly controversial and debatable. The Court need
not deliberate on this issue, as both the parties manufacture and market both
range of products. The question before the Court concerns whether the
impugned advertisements are disparaging or not. At this stage, the Court is
to examine if the "look and feel" of the advertisements conveys a message
that paints Plaintiff‟s sugar based health supplement - Chyawanprash in bad
light. This is the pivotal aspect in the present case. To arrive at a just
conclusion, the Court has to examine and synthesize the advertising material
and adjudge if the same presents a message that influences the mind against
the competitors in a negative way. The theme of the advertisements is to
focus on the benefits of healthy sugar free alternatives, not to target the
Petitioner‟s product in particular. There is no direct reference to the
Plaintiff‟s product per se. The key differentiator of the product is indeed
"sugar" and that is the striking feature of the Defendant‟s product.
Defendant has also assured the Court that the colour in the TVC does not
create any doubt in the mind of the viewers that the comparative product is




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                              Page 36 of 41</span>
 of the Plaintiff. The comparison of sugar free product would necessarily be
with a sugar based one, as the absence of sugar is the unique selling
attribute. In order to send a message that is effective and long lasting,
impugned advertisements convey a message comparatively, highlighting the
benefits of a sugar free product. Petitioner interprets the warnings in the
advertisements as disparaging the class of sugar based products and that it is
vindictively targeted. Court cannot ignore Defendant‟s right to free speech,
which includes right to ensure widespread awareness of the benefits of its
products. The parties should not be hyper sensitive about the messages. If
there is no clear case of disparagement, the Court would not like to interfere.
In the present case, the intent of the Defendant is not eschewed, as the
Plaintiff views it.
</p>

<p id="p_58">35. The Court also has to recogonize that the framework of the
advertisements is designed with the objective to sway the consumers and
coax them to buying a particular product or service. Advertisements are used
to artistically express and convey the messages to the public. There is bound
to be creativity, pun and a storyline in such messages, so that it creates an
impact on the viewers or the readers. To keep the story engrossing,
companies indulge in making comparisons, to claim that they are better than
the rest. Some leeway has always to be given to the advertiser, but at the
same time right to free speech cannot be stretched to allow them to become
defamatory, disparaging or denigrating. One cannot ignore the fundamental
characteristic of comparative advertisements is appraisal by contrasting the
products. There will often be an element of negative or adversarial
comparison. This is the natural outcome or byproduct of "comparison".
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">CS (COMM) 1074/2018                                              Page 37 of 41</span>
<p id="p_59"> Defendant has to be allowed to manifest the differentiators in the competing
products and also to give justifications for encouraging the consumers to
prefer its product over that of the competitors. The intent behind the
comparative advertisements will invariably be to persuade the consumers to
give preference to one of the competing products. Such advertisements
either expressly or subtly make a claim that the product of the advertiser is a
better choice. This is permissible in law. The advertisements in question do
nothing more than that. The paramount consideration for the Court to
discern disparagement is to go into the heart of the matter and see the impact
and impression the advertisements create. This simple aspect should not be
made complex. I am not suggesting that Court should take a view
instinctively. Of course, in order to decide the question, the Court would
have to reflect, inquire and assimilate all the relevant factors, but the crux of
the matter is always the intent and effect, that I have described as "look and
feel". The Courts, guided by principles enunciated in judicial precedents,
should test the merits of the claims of challenge by evaluation of the
message and effect of the advertisements. The comparative advertising
campaign should thus be „comparison positive‟. Advertisements often
contain valuable information for the consumers and can promote healthy
competition in the market. If this is the message conveyed, the courts would
be resilient and allow the negative derivatives of comparison. This is
because the final outcome is positive. However if it can be gauged that the
message broadly demonstrates slanderous or indiscriminate negative
comparison or insinuation, Courts should not be slow in ensuring that such
messages do not spread. If it does hurt or annoy the Plaintiff, it is nothing
but display of an over sensitive approach, that can‟t be helped.

<p id="p_60"> 36. Mr. Singh asserts that the recipe of Chyanwprash requires the inclusion
of sugar in large portion and relies upon the ayurvedic texts to contend that
sugar is an essential ingredient and the Plaintiff‟s product cannot thus be
denigrated because it contains sugar. This to my mind is a pedantic and is an
extremely narrow view. Defendant is not portraying that Chyanwprash is a
harmful product. The focus is only on one of the ingredients. Defendant
claims that the merits and benefits of Chyanwprash can be absorbed and
drawn from an alternative which does not contain sugar. Its selling point is
that it does not contain sugar. Defendant would like this to be the focal issue
in the advertisements in print and TVC. The Courts should not stifle
innovation and fair competition. If the Defendant claims that its product
solves the needs of the present times where public is shunning sugar based
products, it should be allowed to inform the public about the same. It claims
that sugar free product achieves the same level of efficacy without the
harmful or negative effect of sugar, if any. The Court should not restrain the
Defendant, merely because the stakeholders in the industry feel that
advertisement is hurting them. The impending challenge faced by the
Plaintiff on account of Defendant‟s product cannot be allowed to be
achieved by muffling or smothering the message of the Defendant. The
Courts should not be asked to suffocate the competitors on a perceptive
understanding of the competitor that the message delivered through the
advertisements is disparaging. Defendant‟s right of free speech needs to be
weighed upon and protected. Defendant should be allowed to use marketing
skills and sell its products, as along as they are not disparaging. In the
present case, the cautionary messages of sugar content cannot be termed as

 disparagement.

<p id="p_61">37. In view of the above discussion, the Court does not find any ground to
restrain the Defendant from publishing the proposed modified print
advertisement or the modified TVC and also the TVC which is currently
running.    Accordingly, the applications bearing I.A. Nos. 10869/2018,
16105/2018 &amp; 3084/2019 are dismissed with a direction that the Defendant
shall remain bound by the undertaking given in the affidavit dated 14th May
2019 during the pendency of the present suit, with no orders as to cost. The
Defendant shall publish/telecast the modified advertisements strictly in
accordance with the changes proposed in the affidavit. For the sake of
clarity, it is noted that the print advertisement and TVCs, shall be aired/
published in the following manner:
</p><p id="p_62">   i) Print advertisement if published should be as per "Document I" of the
      affidavit.
