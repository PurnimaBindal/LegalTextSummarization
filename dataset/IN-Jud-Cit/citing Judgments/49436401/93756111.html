                           no. CS(COMM.) 340/2021. Reckitt is aggrieved to the limited extent
                          that the learned Sigle Judge has rejected its prayer for restraining the
                          respondent (hereafter &#x27;HUL&#x27;) from broadcasting a TV Commercial
                          (hereafter &#x27;the impugned TVC-I&#x27;) which according to Reckitt was

</p><p id="p_4">                          2.    Reckitt (Reckitt Benckiser India Private Limited) is a company
                          engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, sale and distribution of
                          various fast moving consumer goods. Reckitt&#x27;s business comprises of
                          various consumer and healthcare products including antiseptic liquid,
                          toilet care products, surface care products, pharmaceuticals, insecticides
                          and food products.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                          3.    Reckitt states that it has been involved in the manufacturing of a
                          well-known toilet cleaner under the trade mark &#x27;HARPIC&#x27; in India,
                          since the year 2001. It claims that Harpic is a household name in the
                          category of toilet cleaners and the most widely used toilet cleaner brand
                          in the country. Its use dates back to its original launch in England in
                          1920 and subsequently it is being sold in over 47 countries worldwide.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                          4.    Reckitt states that on 15.03.1979, it registered the word mark
                          &#x27;HARPIC&#x27; (Application No. 347055) under Class 3. The said trade
                          mark registration is valid and subsisting as of date. Reckitt also obtained
                          registration for the shape of their bottle used for packaging Harpic
                          branded products in India. It claims that the shape of the bottle is unique

                           and distinctive. Since its launch, the shape of the bottle has become a

<p id="p_7">                          5.    HUL is engaged in the business of fast moving consumer goods
                          (hereafter &#x27;FMCG&#x27;), consisting primarily of manufacturing, marketing
                          and/or selling of various consumer products, including food and
                          refreshments, cosmetics, toiletries, floor cleaners, toilet cleaners, toilet
                          soaps, washing soaps and detergents.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                          6.    HUL also manufactures and markets a toilet cleaner, which is
                          sold under the trademark &#x27;DOMEX&#x27;. The present dispute pertains to
                          certain advertisements launched by HUL for its product Domex. HUL
                          claims that its product is superior in fighting bad odour in comparison
                          to Reckitt&#x27;s product Harpic. Reckitt disputes this claim. As stated
                          above, Reckitt has instituted the present action, as it claims that HUL&#x27;s
                          advertisement campaign disparages and denigrates its product Harpic.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                          7.    Reckitt has filed the said suit [CS(COMM.) 340/2021], inter alia,
                          seeking a decree of permanent injunction restraining HUL from
                          telecasting, broadcasting and publishing five advertisements (referred
                          to as &#x27;the impugned advertisements&#x27;). The impugned advertisements
                          includes the impugned TVC-1, three commercials that were available
                          for viewing on the internet channel, YouTube, and an advertisement in
                          print, published in a newspaper. According to Reckitt, the impugned
                          advertisements are denigrating and disparaging the products
                          manufactured by it, and infringes its trademarks. Reckitt also filed an
                          application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the CPC (IA No.

                           8999/2021) seeking interim injunction, restraining HUL from
                          publishing or airing the impugned advertisements. The said application
                          was disposed of by the impugned judgement

</p><p id="p_10">                          8.    The learned Single Judge found that the advertisement published
                          in the newspaper and the three commercials available for viewing on
                          YouTube appeared to disparage Reckitt&#x27;s products. However, the court
                          did not accept that the impugned TVC-1 indicated a prima facie case of
                          disparagement. Accordingly, the learned Single Judge restrained HUL
                          from publishing or broadcasting four of the impugned advertisements
                          (one published in print and three available for viewing on the YouTube
                          Channel) but declined Reckitt&#x27;s prayer to interdict HUL from
                          broadcasting the impugned TVC-1.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                          9.    The present appeal is confined to the decision of the learned
                          Single Judge to decline Reckitt&#x27;s request to interdict the impugned
                          TVC-1.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                          10.   In view of the above, the only controversy that arises in the
                          present case is whether the prima facie view of the learned Single Judge
                          that the impugned TVC-1 does not disparage Reckitt&#x27;s products or
                          infringes Reckitt&#x27;s trademark is palpably erroneous and warrants
                          interreference by this Court.

                           it not only seeks to promote HUL&#x27;s product &#x27;Domex&#x27; but disparages
                          Reckitt&#x27;s product Harpic. He submitted that the clear message of the
                          advertisement is that Harpic is ineffective as a toilet cleaner; it is
                          ineffective to combat bad odour.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                          12.    He referred to the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_1">Dabur India Ltd. v.

                          said decision, he contended that although puffery and hyperbole to
                          promote one&#x27;s product is permissible, it is not open for any person to
                          denigrate or disparage the goods of another.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                          13.    He submitted that as clarified by this Court in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_3">Dabur India Ltd.
                          v. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.3, it is impermissible for any
                          advertiser to make any untruthful statement in its advertisement. And,
                          the impugned advertisements were untruthful.

<p id="p_17">                          14.    He also referred to the decision of the Madras High Court in

                          that in a suit for disparagement, it would be necessary that the
                          disparaging advertisements be restrained as pecuniary compensation at
                          a later stage would be insufficient to compensate the loss suffered and
                          damage caused due to disparagement.

                          in <a href="/doc/1722050/" id="a_5">Colgate Palmolive Company &amp; Anr. v. Hindustan Liver Ltd</a>. 5 as

                          and found that the impugned TVC-1 was not disparaging. He submitted
                          that the said view is a plausible one, if not the correct one, and therefore,
                          did not warrant any interference in these proceedings. He referred to the

                          that it is impermissible for the Appellate Court to interfere with the

                          the discretion was exercised arbitrarily, capriciously or perversely. He
                          submitted that in the present case, the learned Single Judge had rightly
                          applied the law and declined the interim injunction as, in his view, the
                          impugned TVC-1, viewed as a whole, did not disparage and denigrate
                          Reckitt&#x27;s product.

                           decision was rendered in the context of publication of &#x27;Tata Press
                          Yellow Pages&#x27; - which was a buyer&#x27;s guide comprising of a compilation
                          of advertisements given by businessmen, traders and professionals duly
                          classified according to their trade business or profession - the court also
                          accepted, in unambiguous terms, that advertisements were a part of
                          commercial speech. It is, thus, necessary that fair amount of latitude be
                          available to advertisers. [See: <a href="/doc/1722050/" id="a_9">Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v.
                          Hindustan Lever Ltd</a>.9].

                          misrepresentation or where the advertisements fall foul of the validly
                          enacted law. In cases where competing rights are involved, finding an
                          apposite balance is necessary. <a href="/doc/752455/" id="a_10">In Tata Press Limited v. Mahanagar
                          Telephone Nigam Limited10</a>, the Supreme Court noted the decision of
                          the US Supreme Court in Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia
                          Citizens Consumer Council11, whereby the Court had held that the
                          Virginia statute that proscribed a pharmacist from advertising the price
                          of prescription drugs, violated the First amendment protection.
                          However, the Court also observed that &quot;untruthful speech, commercial
                          or otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake.&quot; and that it saw
                          no obstacle for a State to deal effectively when the commercial speech
                          is &quot;deceptive or misleading&quot;.

                                                     However, if an advertisement extends beyond

                                                 understood from its story line and the message
                                                 sought to be conveyed.

                                                    disparage or denigrate a rival product?
                                                   In this context it must be kept in mind that
                                                   while promoting its product, the advertiser
                                                   may, while comparing it with a rival or a

                                                by and large truthful or does it falsely denigrate
                                                or disparage a rival product? While truthful
                                                disparagement is permissible, untruthful

                          context of statements of fact and not statements or assertions that are
                          apparent puffery or hyperbole. The propositions as stated in <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_18">Reckitt and

                          that hold out representations of facts. Such representations of facts are
                          required to be true and not misleading. Puffery and exaggerated
                          opinions are merely intended to attract the attention of targeted

<p id="p_37">                          23.        This Court also referred to the following passage from the
                          decision of the Chancery Division in the case of De Beers Abrasive
                          Products Ltd. and Others v. International General Electric Co. of New
                          York Ltd. and Another22:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                            &quot;the law is that any trader is entitled to puff his own
                                             goods, even though such puff must, as a matter of
                                             pure logic, involve the denigration of his rival&#x27;s
                                             goods..... &quot;The best tailor in the world,&quot; &quot;The best
                                             tailor in this town,&quot; and &quot;The best tailor in this
                                             street,&quot; none of the three committed an actionable
                                             wrong ..... Where, however, the situation is not that
                                             the trader is puffing his own goods, but turns to
                                             denigrate those of his rival, then, in my opinion, the
                                             situation is not so clear cut. Obviously the
                                             statement: &quot;My goods are better than X&#x27;s&quot; is only a
                                             more dramatic presentation of what is implicit in
                                             the statement: &quot;My goods are the best in the world.&quot;
                                             Accordingly, I do not think such a statement would
                                             be actionable. At the other end of the scale, if what
                                             is said is: &quot;My goods are better than X&#x27;s, because
                                             X&#x27;s are absolute rubbish.&quot; then it is established by
                                             dicta of Lord Shand in the House of Lords in White
                                             v. Mellin [1895] A.C. 154, 171, which were
                                             accepted by Mr. Walton as stating the law, the
                                             statement would be actionable.&quot;

                           for him to claim that the goods of his competitors are bad, undesirable
                          or inferior. As an illustration, in a comparative advertisement, it is open
                          for an advertiser to say his goods are of a good quality but it is not open
                          for an advertiser to send a message that the quality of the goods of his
                          competitor is bad. As observed by the Chancery Division in the case of
                          De Beers Abrasive Products Ltd. and Others v. International General
                          Electric Co. of New York Ltd. and Another23, it is open for a person to
                          claim that he is the best seller in the world or a best seller in the street
                          but it is not open for him to denigrate the services of another. Thus, it is
                          not open for an advertiser to say &quot;my goods are better than X&#x27;s, because
                          X&#x27;s are absolutely rubbish&quot;. Puffery and Hyperbole to some extent have
                          an element of untruthfulness. If a tailoring shop claims that he provides
                          the best tailored suits in the city, the same may be untruthful. However,
                          it is apparent to anyone who reads or hears this statement that it is
                          puffery. Such statements or taglines are neither held out nor understood
                          as a representation of unimpeachable fact. It is obvious that the person
                          availing services from the tailoring shop, as mentioned above, cannot
                          maintain an action of misrepresentation. However, when it comes to
                          statements made by an advertiser in respect of the goods of his
                          competitors and other persons, the latitude available to an advertiser is
                          restricted. Whilst it is open for the tailoring shop to state that it provides
                          the best tailored suit in the city; it is not open for it to advertise that the
                          other tailoring shops in the street lack the necessary skill and their suits
                          are ill tailored.

</p><p id="p_40">                           25.   A comparative advertisement would always involve the
                          statement that the goods of the advertiser are better in some aspects than
                          that of the competitor. But there is line that an advertiser cannot cross.
                          He cannot disparage or defame the goods of his competitor.
</p>
<p id="p_41">                          26.   There may be cases where certain features of an advertiser&#x27;s
                          product may be demonstrably better than the features of his competitor.
                          In such cases, it is permissible for an advertiser to advertise and
                          highlight these features. The message must clearly be to highlight the
                          superior features of his product while ensuring that the product of his
                          competitor is not disparaged or defamed.
</p>
<p id="p_42">                          27.   In the facts of the present case, the learned Single Judge
                          examined the impugned TVC-1 and concluded that the advertisement
                          did not denigrate Reckitt&#x27;s product. The Court also observed that an
                          advertiser has to be given &quot;enough room to play around&quot; in the
                          advertisement and Reckitt ought not be hypersensitive to an
                          advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                          28.   We have visually seen the advertisement and have little doubt
                          that HUL has crossed the permissible limit. There is no cavil that an
                          advertiser must have enough elbow-room to advertise its products. But
                          in the present case, HUL has clearly crossed the line. It not only claims
                          that its products are better than Reckitt&#x27;s but it also, prima facie,
                          disparages Reckitt&#x27;s product.

                          in a departmental store. The mother is looking for household goods. It
                          is also apparent that the mother is shown to be a regular customer who
                          purchases Harpic (Reckitt&#x27;s product) and is looking for the same. This
                          is clear because the child quizzes her &quot;Ab kya le rahe hain?&quot;, which
                          freely translated means &quot;what are we buying?&quot;. The mother responds
                          by informing him that they are buying a toilet cleaner. This conversation
                          is in the backdrop where HUL&#x27;s product Domex is shown lining a
                          number of shelves while Reckitt&#x27;s product (Harpic) occupies a
                          relatively small portion of a single shelf and shares the same with other
                          products.

<p id="p_58">                          31.   The mother then picks up a bottle of Harpic - apparently because
                          that is what she is looking for - and puts it in her shopping cart. At the
                          time, she also informs the child that she is buying Harpic.

</p><p id="p_60">                           32.   The child then quizzes her &quot;Kyon&quot; (freely translated &quot;why&quot;). The
                          child is curious and wants to know why his mother is buying Harpic.
                          While he is asking this question, another shopper who prefers Domex
                          is shown to be drawn into the exchange between the mother and child.
                          She too has a quizzed and a concerned look. Apparently, the message is
                          why the mother is buying Harpic. The mother then responds to the child
                          by saying &quot;Kyoki ye toilet saaf kare?&quot; Freely translated means &quot;because
                          this cleans the toilet&quot;. In response to this, the child holds his nose and
                          with a disturbed look (bordering an expression of disgust) and questions
                          his mother: &quot;to toilet se badbu nahi aayegi&quot;, which freely translated
                          means &quot;whether the toilet will not emanate bad odour&quot;. The look on
                          the child&#x27;s face while holding his nose is a strong message. The
                          mother&#x27;s facial expression changes to one of concern. She is disturbed
                          by her child&#x27;s question. She picks up a Harpic bottle and looks at it,
                          concerned and somewhat confused.          At the same time, the other
                          shopper, who is Domex&#x27;s loyal customer, turns around and says to the
                          child that he has raised the correct question [&quot;sahi sawal&quot; freely
                          translated &quot;the correct question&quot;]. She then picks up a bottle of Domex
                          from one of the shelves where it is displayed, presents it forward and
                          states &quot;Behtar jawab hai DOMEX&quot;.

<p id="p_61">                          33.   On a plain viewing, it is clear that the message sent by the
                          advertiser is that Harpic does not address the problem of bad odour. The
                          astonished expression of the child and his gesture of holding his nose
                          while asking the question whether the toilet will not stink and the

                           message that if you use Harpic, the toilet will continue to stink because
                          the mother, who is otherwise regularly using Harpic, has not been able
                          to address the problem of foul odour persisting in their toilet. The latter
                          part of the impugned TVC-1 then shows a toilet bowl with
                          discolouration possibly reflecting bad odour and the voice over saying
                          &quot;Kyoki toilet ki badbu se ladne ke lie DOMEX me hai fresh guard
                          technology&quot;. The remaining part of the impugned TVC-1 is about the
                          product Domex and its quality to combat bad odour for a longer period
                          of time.
</p>
<p id="p_62">                          34.   The impugned TVC-1 not only projects a message that Domex
                          fights odour for a longer period of time, it also sends a clear message
                          that Harpic does not address the problem of foul smell that emanates
                          from toilets. The manner in which the impugned TVC-1 is structured,
                          first, sends a message that Harpic only cleans without addressing the
                          problem of bad odour and thereafter, sends the message that whoever
                          chooses Harpic would have to live with their toilets smelling foul. This
                          is a message that disparages Reckitt&#x27;s product and, in our view, cannot
                          be permitted.
</p>
<p id="p_63">                          35.   The finding of the learned Single Judge that the impugned TVC-
                          1 does not denigrate Reckitt&#x27;s product is erroneous and cannot be
                          sustained. The latitude available in advertising is wide but does not
                          extend to denigrating the product of one&#x27;s competitor.

<p id="p_64">                          36.   By an order dated 01.12.2021 passed by this Court, HUL was
                          restrained from airing the impugned TVC-1. We make the said order
                          absolute. The same shall continue till disposal of the suit.
