accused appellant Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram but

they denied the charges levelled against them and

prayed for trial.      In the trial, statements of 16

prosecution witnesses were recorded, thereafter, the

learned trial court proceeded to record statement of

the accused appellants under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_12">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. In

reply to the allegations levelled by the prosecution

witnesses, the accused appellants denied all the

charges. The accused appellant Aasu Ram gave

explanation that on the date of incident, the person

who was working upon his agricultural field, went on

tractor with trolley in the village and while coming

back informed that accident took place in between the

way in which injury has been caused to one Moola

Ram from trolley upon head, therefore, Moola Ram fell

down and further said that Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana

Ram was not sitting upon the said tractor on the date

of incident.

<p id="p_12">      The accused appellant Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana

Ram    denied   all   the   allegations   levelled   by    the

prosecution witnesses and said that I was not sitting

on the tractor and trolley on the date of            incident.

Further it is said by him that there was no enmity in

between him and deceased Moola Ram.                  No oral

evidence is produced in defence by the accused

appellants.

     The learned trial court heard final arguments and

decided the case vide judgment dated 1.9.2008

whereby held accused appellant Aasu Ram guilty for

offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_13">Section 302</a> IPC and held accused

appellant Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram guilty for the

offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_14">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_15">34</a> and passed sentence

mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     Although the appellants have challenged the

validity of the judgment on various grounds but at the

threshold   learned   counsel        for   the   appellants

vehemently argued that although both the accused

appellants have been falsely implicated in this case,

but even if the evidence of prosecution is accepted

then also no offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_16">Section 302</a> IPC is made

out against the accused appellant Aasu Ram because

the allegations levelled in the FIR are not corroborated

by any evidence including medical evidence. Further it

is argued that accused appellant Bhaga Ram @

Bhagwana Ram has been          falsely implicated on the

ground that allegations are levelled by the author of

the FIR knowingly well that Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana

Ram was not driving the vehicle as per his statement.

The learned trial court has committed a serious error

of law while convicting the accused appellant Aasu

Ram for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_17">Section 302</a> IPC because

even if the allegation of prosecution is accepted then
                               (7 of 22)
                                                        [CRLA-711/2008]



the offence cannot travel beyond offence under

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_18">Section 304</a> Part I IPC against the accused appellant

Aasu Ram. For the accused appellant Bhaga Ram @

Bhagwana Ram it is submitted that there is false

implication of Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram because

was not present at the time of occurrence took place

and, therefore, the allegation levelled by the PW--1

Kailash and PW--2 Mangala Ram cannot be accepted

in   view   of   the   fact      that     allegations     are     not

corroborated by any cogent and trustworthy evidence,

therefore, if Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram was not

present at the time of incident took place, then

uncorroborated allegation made against the accused

appellant Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram that he used

filthy words after hitting the deceased while coming

down from the tractor cannot be accepted.

</p><p id="p_15">      Learned counsel for the accused appellant Aasu

Ram, submit that the appellant is not challenging the

incident but prayed that even if the whole prosecution

evidence is accepted then also no offence under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_19">Section 302</a> IPC is made out because there is no

allegation of the prosecution that deceased was hit

from front side of the tractor.               The case of the

prosecution is that injury was caused when Aasuram

was driving the tractor negligently with intention to

cause death of deceased, when it was going towards
                          (8 of 22)
                                             [CRLA-711/2008]



Siyana. Admittedly, deceased was hit from left side of

trolley where there is a hook which is evident from the

fact that blood was found upon the hook of the trolley.

According to the learned counsel for the accused

appellants, if the allegation of prosecution is accepted

that there was intention to kill Moola Ram then

obviously he was to be hit from front side of the

tractor but as per prosecution case injury was caused

from left side of trolley not the tractor, therefore,

obviously it is not possible for driver, Aasu Ram, to

see backside because for driving any vehicle, the

driver is required to see in front. Learned counsel for

the appellants further argued that as per allegation of

FIR after hitting the deceased 2-3 times, the tractor

and trolley were played on road to press the body of

the deceased but a bare perusal of the statement of

the doctor who performed the post mortem no such

injury of pressing the body of deceased, Moola Ram,

was found upon his body, therefore, it is a case in

which the medical evidence is not corroborating the

allegations of by the complainant that there was any

intention of the accused appellant Aasu Ram to kill

Moola Ram, more so, it is a case of rash and negligent

driving.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     Learned counsel for the appellants submits that

as per basic principle of criminal law if any allegation
                           (9 of 22)
                                                  [CRLA-711/2008]



is levelled by the prosecution          for murder then it is

required to be proved by the evidence but by here in

this case, medical evidence is not supporting the

allegation of   complainant that injuries were caused

not   once but 2-3 times while pressing the body by

tractor when deceased fell down. The learned counsel

for the appellants submits that no blood was found

upon the tries of wheels of the tractor. The blood was

found upon hook fixed on left side of trolley only,

therefore, it is obvious that injury was caused from

the left side of trolley which resulted into the death.

</p><p id="p_17">      Learned   counsel   for     the    appellants   submits

Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram has been falsely

implicated in this case because tractor can be driven

by one person not by two persons, and as per facts

accused, Aasu Ram was driving the tractor. The

witnesses PW--1 Kailash and PW--2 Mangala Ram

stated before the court that after hitting deceased

Moola Ram, accused Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram

who was sitting upon the tractor come down and after

giving injury by kick used filthy words, but there is no

corroboration of such allegation by the independent

witness, so also, there is no evidence of motive on

record, therefore, it is prayed that conviction of the

accused appellant Aasu Ram for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_20">Section

302</a> IPC may be altered for offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_21">Section 304</a>

Part I <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22">IPC</a> and sentence of life imprisonment may be

reduced to already undergone.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     With regard to accused appellant Bhaga Ram @

Bhagwana Ram it is submitted that there is no

allegation against him for inflicting injury by rash and

negligent driving. The only allegation against him is

that he was sitting on tractor and after hitting when

deceased fell down, accused appellant Bhaga Ram @

Bhagwana Ram came down from the tractor and gave

2-3 kicks to the deceased and used filthy words, but

there is no corroboration of such evidence, therefore,

it is a case of false implication of Bhaga Ram @

Bhagwana Ram, hence, his conviction may kindly be

set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     Per      contra, learned Public Prosecutor and the

learned     counsel   for   the    complainant   vehemently

argued that it is a case of murder because there was

enmity in between the parties because before this

incident,     the   deceased      was    assaulted      by     the

appellants previously, therefore, there is no substance

in the       argument of the learned counsel for the

appellants that Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram has

been falsely implicated in this case, more so, both the

accused appellants intentionally caused injuries to the

deceased by rash and negligent driving with intention
                                (11 of 22)
                                                        [CRLA-711/2008]



to cause death, therefore, no interference is called for

in the finding of conviction given by the trial court to

punish the accused appellants for offence under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_23">Section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_24">302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_25">34</a> IPC respectively.

</p><p id="p_20">     After hearing the learned counsel for the parties,

we have perused the FIR, so also, the statement of

doctor and other witnesses. In the FIR, there is

allegation that after hitting the head of deceased by

tractor and trolley, 2-3 times, the tractor was plied on

road to press the body of the deceased to kill him by

the accused appellant Aasu Ram, but this fact is not

corroborated by medical evidence. In the post mortem

report   (Ex.P/11),      the      doctor    give    opinion      that

deceased Moola Ram died due to shock and syncope

as a result of multiple injuries.

<p id="p_21">     The statement of Dr. Kan Singh were recorded

during trial as PW--6. The said witness stated that on

21.11.2007 when I was working as Junior Specialist at

     Upon      appreciation         of       the   medical      evidence

coupled with the allegations levelled in the FIR it is

obvious that allegations levelled in the FIR for causing

injury 2-3 times by pressing the body under the tries

has not been proved by the doctor. According to

doctor injury was caused upon the head because

blood was found upon the hook fixed on the left side

of the trolley. As per facts, the doctor made inspection

of tractor and trolley on which there was not blood nor

any injury was found upon the body of the deceased

caused by pressing               tries of wheels 2-3 times,

therefore, we are of the opinion that if there is no

corroboration for the allegation levelled in the FIR to

establish    the        intention        to    cause      death,       then

obviously, the finding of the learned trial court to hold

accused appellant Aasu Ram guilty for offence under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_26">Section 302</a> IPC is not sustainable in law.</blockquote><p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">                          (14 of 22)

     It is worthwhile to observe that in the FIR

(Ex.P/1) specific allegation was        levelled by the eye

witness/complainant     that    after      hitting   to    the

deceased by trolley, accused appellant Bhaga Ram @

Bhagwana Ram who was sitting on the tractor, come

down and inflicted injury by legs and use filthy words

and author of the FIR watch the incident from the site

where he was standing, but PW--2 Mangala Ram who

was present at the time of occurrence stated before

the court that near Sangwa well one tractor was going

up and down on the road and Aasu Ram was sitting

upon the tractor but in the medical evidence there is

no corroboration with regard to allegation that Aasu

Ram was caused injuries time and again by pulling

tractor up and down, but this witness made the

allegation that Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ramwas

using filthy words and     was causing injury by kick.

For the allegation of inflicting injury by kick, we have

again perused the      post mortem report as well as

statements of PW--6 Dr. Kan Singh Kachhawaha. In

the statement Dr. Kan Singh Kachhawaha, said that

there was no evidence of mud upon the injuries so

also, there were no external injury upon the chest,

both the legs and front side of hands. Meaning

thereby, allegation of inflicting injury while kicking the

deceased has not been proved by the prosecution,
                            (15 of 22)
                                                  [CRLA-711/2008]



therefore, it is a case in which Bhaga Ram @

Bhagwana Ram has       been falsely        implicated in this

case so as to hold him guilty for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_27">Section

302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_28">34</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_26">     After taking into            consideration the entire

evidence    on    record      conviction     including      the

statements of prosecution witnesses, we are of the

opinion that     finding of the learned trial court for

commission of offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_29">Section 302</a> IPC against

the accused appellant Aasu Ram is not sustainable in

law because admittedly, no injury was caused to the

deceased by hitting him from front side of the tractor,

so also, it is established from the evidence that the

injury was caused to the deceased by the hook fixed

upon left side of the trolley and there is no sign of

mark of injury made by using the vehicle upon the

body of the deceased, therefore it might be a case of

causing injury which is sufficient to cause death, but it

is not a case that said injury was caused with

intention to kill deceased. In the post mortem report

(Ex.P/11), the following opinion was given by the

doctor for cause of death, which reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           "Deceased Moola Ram S/o Veera Ram
     Purohit 45 Yr H.M. R/o Siyana whose p.m. was
     conducted by me died due to shock and syncope
     as a result of multiple injuries."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                             (16 of 22)

      Upon perusal of above opinion it is revealed that

no assertion has been made by the doctor that

injuries sustained to the deceased were sufficient to

cause death, more so, as per opinion of the doctor,

the deceased died due to shock and syncope as a

result of multiple injuries. There is no mention about

any injury which can be caused by pressing body to

pull the tractor and trolley upon the body of the

deceased, so also,        it is evident from the injuries

mentioned in the post mortem report that none of the

injuries were caused by wheels of the tractor or

trolley.</blockquote><p id="p_27">


</p><p id="p_28">      We have also perused the Ex.P/9 and P/10

whereby tractor and trolley were taken in possession.

In those documents it is nowhere observed by the

investigating officer that blood was found upon the

wheels of tractor or trolley. The only assertion is made

that "Vªksyh ds vxys fgLls ds ck;s dksus ds gqd ij gYdk [kwu yxdj

Meaning thereby, there was no mark of injury of

vehicle upon the body of the deceased so also no

blood was found upon the tries of the wheels of the

vehicle, therefore, main ingredient of murder which is

intention, is absent.

          requirements must be satisfied, namely, (i)
          it was a sudden fight; (ii) there was no
          premeditation; (iii) the act was done in a
          heat of passion; and (iv) The assailant had
          not taken any undue advantage or acted in
          a cruel manner. The cause of the quarrel is
          not relevant nor is it relevant who offered
          the provocation or started the assault. The
          number of wounds caused during the
          occurrence is not a decisive factor but what
          is important is that the occurrence must
          have been sudden and unpremeditated and
          the offender must have acted in a fit of
          anger. of course, the offender must not
          have taken any undue advantage or acted
          in a cruel manner. Where, on a sudden
          quarrel, a person in the heat of the
          moment picks up a weapon which is handy
          and causes injuries, one of which proves
          fatal, he would be entitled to the benefit of

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     18. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked
     if    death    is   caused     (a)    without
     premeditation; (b) in a sudden fight; (c)
     without the offender's having taken undue
     advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
     manner; and (d) the fight must have been
     with the person killed. To bring a case
     within Exception 4 all the ingredients
     mentioned in it must be found. It is to be
     noted that the 'fight' occurring in Exception
     4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_35">Section 300</a> Indian Penal Code is not
     defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_36"> the Penal Code</a>, 1860. It takes
     two to make a fight. Heat of passion
     requires that there must be no time for the
     passions to cool down and in this case, the
     parties had worked themselves into a fury
     on account of the verbal altercation in the
     beginning. A fight is a combat between two
     and more persons whether with or without
     weapons. It is not possible to enunciate
     any general rule as to what shall be
     deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a
     question of fact and whether a quarrel is
     sudden or not must necessarily depend
     upon the proved facts of each case. For the
     application of Exception 4, it is not
     sufficient to show that there was a sudden
     quarrel and there was no premeditation. It
     must further be shown that the offender
     has not taken undue advantage or acted in
     cruel or unusual manner. The expression
     'undue advantage' as used in the provision
     means 'unfair advantage'.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     28. ...Records   clearly   establish that there
     was indeed a     scuffle   between the parties

                                        [CRLA-711/2008]



     with regard to the availability of electricity
     in a particular room and during the course
     of scuffle the Appellant also received an
     injury which was simple in nature and that
     there was heated exchange of words and
     scuffle between the parties before the
     actual incident of stabbing took place.
     There is, therefore, provocation and the
     incident happened at the spur of the
     moment. That being the factual position,
     we are of the considered view that the
     present case cannot be said to be a case
     Under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_40">Section 302</a> Indian Penal Code but it
     is a case falling Under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_41">Section 304</a> Part II
     Indian Penal Code. It is trite law that
     Section 304 Part II comes into play when
     the death is caused by doing an act with
     knowledge that it is likely to cause death
     but there is no intention on the part of the
     accused either to cause death or to cause
     such bodily injury as is likely to cause
     death.

<p id="p_32">Thus, if there is intent and knowledge then the
same would be a case of Section 304 Part I and
if it is only a case of knowledge and not intention
to cause murder and bodily injury then the same
would fall Under Section 304 Part II. We are
inclined to the view that in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, it cannot be
said that the Appellants/accused had any
intention of causing the death of the deceased
when they committed the act in question. The
incident took place out of grave and sudden
provocation and hence the accused are entitled
to the benefit of Section 300 Exception 4<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_42"> of
Indian Penal Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_33">Thus, in entirety, considering the factual
scenario of the case on hand, the legal evidence
on record and in the background of legal
principles laid down by this Court in the cases
referred to supra, the inevitable conclusion is
that the act of the accused-Appellants was not a
cruel act and the accused did not take undue
advantage of the deceased. The scuffle took
place in the heat of passion and all the
requirements Under Section 300 Exception 4,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_43">
Indian Penal Code</a> have been satisfied.
Therefore, the benefit of Exception 4 Under

     <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_44">Section 300</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_45"> Indian Penal Code</a> is attracted to
     the fact situations and both the Appellants are
     equally entitled to this benefit."
     Upon assessment of entire evidence of present

case in the light of the aforesaid judgment, we are of

the opinion that finding of the learned trial court so as

to convict the accused appellant Aasu Ram for offence

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_46">Section 302</a> IPC is not sustainable in law

because upon careful reading of as per evidence, the

offence cannot travel beyond offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_47">Section

304</a> Part I IPC against accused appellant Aasu Ram.

With regard to evidence against accused appellant

Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram upon            which fiidng is

given by the learned trial court to convict        him for

offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_48">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_49">34</a> IPC, we are of the

opinion that     prosecution has failed to prove the

allegation   against   him   beyond   reasonable    doubt

because admittedly, as per prosecution case, Aasu

Ram was driving tractor and trolley and the incident

which is narrated by author of the FIR Kailash and

Mangala Ram for causing injury with intention has not

been supported by the medical evidence, therefore,

the finding of guilt arrived at for the accused appellant

Bhaga Ram @ Bhagwana Ram under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_50">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_51">34</a>

record, therefore, not sustainable in law.

     Upon    assessment     of    entire   evidence,   it   is

abundantly clear that no weapon was used by the any

of accused. The allegation of the prosecution is that

the injury was caused to the deceased by hitting from

the trolley, attached to the tractor, obviously, trolley

is back part of tractor and driver is required to sit

upon the tractor and at the time of driving he is to see

front side and not the back side. In the site plan it is

nowhere mentioned that injury was caused from front

side of the tractor, so also, upon inspection of tractor

and trolley the blood was found upon the hook fixed in

the left side of the trolley, therefore, from the facts it

cannot be gathered that there was any intention to

inflict injury to cause death. After perusing entire

statements of all prosecution witnesses, including

PW.1 Kailash, and PW.2 Mangala Ram, so also, Dr.

Kan Singh Kachhawaha, we have no hesitation to hold

that prosecution has failed to establish any evidence

of intention for causing death, therefore, finding of

guilt to commit offence u/s 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_52">IPC</a> in the judgment

impugned against the accused appellants, is totally

perverse and contrary to the evidence on record.

Therefore, conviction of accused appellant, Aasu Ram

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_53">Section 302</a> IPC is not sustainable in law, but at

the same time, this Court cannot lose sight of the fact

that it is a case for commission of offence u/s 304 Part
                              (22 of 22)
