     the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial
     Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, is directed against the
     order dated 30.10.2018 passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court
     in O.M.P. (COMM) 169/2018, by which the learned Single Judge has
     set aside the arbitral award dated 11.01.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.   Brief facts required to be considered for disposal of this appeal are that
     an agreement dated 25.01.2008 (hereinafter referred to as the 'said
     agreement') was executed between Shriram Value Services Pvt. Ltd.

      ('SVS') and the respondent for supply of the approved food products
     for the locations set out in Schedule 'A' to the said agreement. The said
     agreement was to be effective for the period between 25.01.2008 to
     25.01.2009. The appellant submits that vide e-mail dated 18.12.2009,
     the respondent had been informed that all rights and obligations under
     the said contract are now to be discharged by the appellant herein.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   The appellant is a business process management Company leveraging
     its domain knowledge in the field of supply chain in the food service
     industry, primarily in the Quick Service Restaurant segment.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.   In the year 2009, the Foods Division of Shriram Value Services was
     hived off into the newly formed appellant Company.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   The respondent company, inter-alia, owned and operated restaurants
     under the franchisee/brand name of KFC, having their outlets in Delhi
     and at other locations in North India. Being a franchisee of Yum Brands
     Inc., the respondent under its agreement with Yum Brands Inc. assigned
     to the appellant sole distributorship for managing the supply chain.
     Therefore, the respondent under an obligation to procure all the
     materials required for running the KFC restaurants from the appellant,
     entered into the said agreement with SVS.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   By the third quarter of the financial year 2013-2014, the balance
     amounts due to the appellant were totalling Rs.12,00,00,000/- and were
     unpaid. Subsequently, the appellant again approached the respondent
     for clearing of the dues, against which the respondent issued 24 cheques
     of Rs. 50,00,000/- each, as an assurance for clearance of the unpaid
     balance amounts. The respondent however requested the appellant not

      to encash the same for the present, keeping in mind the respondent's
     financial situation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   The appellant in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2013-2014,
     refused to make further supplies to the respondent company until the
     previous dues amounting to approximately Rs.12,00,00,000/- were
     cleared. Pursuant to this stand of the appellant Company, one of the
     Directors of the respondent company agreed to execute a Personal
     Guarantee for the abovementioned amount, and a Personal Guaratnee
     Agreement dated 21.01.2014 for the same was signed by the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.   Thereafter in February 2014, the appellant received communication
     from the respondent to present the earlier cheques for payment.
     However, all 24 cheques on presentation were returned with an
     endorsement, "payment stopped by drawer". Against the said
     dishonouring of cheques, separate criminal proceedings have been
     initiated against the respondent by the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.   Dishonouring of the said cheques also led to the appellant herein filing
     O.M.P. 647/2014 before this Court, under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Act, wherein
     this Court vide order dated 30.05.2014 restrained the respondent herein
     from creating any third party rights in respect of certain immovable
     properties.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10. The appellant vide notice dated 03.07.2014, invoked the Arbitration
     Clause, in the said agreement dated 25.1.2008, requesting the
     respondent to appoint an Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute with
     respect to the outstanding dues from the respondent. The respondent in
     reply to said notice, while appointing an Arbitrator in the matter, raised

      the objection that the said agreement stood expired by efflux of time.
     Further, the respondent herein, even during the course of the Arbitral
     proceedings, moved an application under <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_4">Section 16</a> of the Act for
     dismissal of the arbitration proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11. The appellant raised a claim of Rs.16,29,05,341/- before the Arbitral
     Tribunal, which comprised of the following claims: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           a. Rs.12,86,85,209/- as the amount due for goods supplied till
           the date of 30.09.2014;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           b. Rs.2,79,70,132 in lieu of Sales Tax 'C' Forms not issued by
           the respondent for the goods and raw materials supplied to
           them up till the month of March;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           c. Rs.12,50,000/- on account of Arbitrator's fee and;
           d. Rs.50,00,000/- on account of compensation for harassment
           and mental agony caused to the appellant.
</blockquote><p id="p_13">12. The respondent raised objections to the claims of the appellant on the
     grounds that, firstly, the agreement stood expired by efflux of time and
     secondly, that the agreement only related to the locations mentioned in
     Schedule 'A' to the agreement, and thus the claims made for additional
     locations would not be maintainable before the Arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13. The      Arbitrator   vide   Award    dated   11.01.2018       rejected     the
     objections/defence of the respondent, and allowed the claims of the
     appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14. Thereafter, the respondent herein filed a petition under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> of the
     Act against the Award dated 11.01.2018, being O.M.P. (COMM)

     30.10.2018 set aside the Arbitral Award, leaving it open for the parties

               after expiry of the Agreement by efflux of time. The claims
               being for a period of the contract and beyond, right till
               2014, were not arbitrable and the Award is liable to be set

               of Section 43(4) of the Act."
</blockquote><p id="p_16">15. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the learned Single Judge
     exceeded his jurisdiction in going beyond the Award, to declare that the
     claims of the appellant herein were not covered by the Arbitration
     Clause in the said agreement. Learned counsel further contends that the
     Single Judge has erred in bifurcating the business relationship between
     the parties into the period of the said agreement i.e. 25.01.2008 to
     25.01.2009 and the 'post agreement arrangement'. It is also contended
     that even after the expiry of the said agreement by efflux of time, the
     parties continued their business relations and conducted regular
     transactions on the same business model as was agreed to in the said
     agreement.
</p>



<p id="p_17">FAO(OS) (COMM) 293/2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                     Page 5 of 12</span>
</p><p id="p_18"> 16. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that despite the large
     outstanding sums owed to the appellant by the respondent, and the
     subsequent representations by the appellant to clear the same, the
     respondent continued to place regular orders with the appellant in the
     same terms as that of the said agreement with the addition of other
     locations which were orally agreed to between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17. It is further contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that
     despite the said agreement having expired by efflux of time on
     24.01.2009, the transactions between the parties continued to be
     governed by the terms of the agreement till 2014 on account of various
     correspondences, more particularly the email dated 18.12.2009;
     issuance of C-Forms by the respondent against the goods supplied to
     them; and conveyance of Personal Guarantee by Mr. Ashok Sharma, a
     Director of the respondent company, which amounted to written
     amendments to the said agreement. Learned counsel also submits that
     the email dated 18.12.2009 sent by SVS Private Limited to the
     respondent informing it of hiving of the business from SVS Pvt. Ltd. to
     SDS/appellant and the subsequent change in responsibilities under the
     said agreement was not replied to by the respondent, showing their tacit
     consent and acceptance with regard to extension of the terms of the said
     agreement. Reliance is placed on the judgement in the case of <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_6">Bharat
     Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Great Eastern Shipping Company
     Ltd</a>. AIR 2008 SC 357, (paras 19 and 20).
</p>
<p id="p_20">18. Learned counsel contends that since the parties never terminated the
     said agreement until 2014, as a corollary the Arbitration Clause would
     govern all disputes arising until 2014. Learned counsel relies on a

      judgment of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/138493047/" id="a_7">Shine Travels &amp; Cargo Pvt. Ltd. v.
     Mitsui Prime Advanced Composite India Ltd</a>., (2016) 232 DLT 499, in
     support of this contention.
</p>
<p id="p_21">19. Learned counsel for the appellant further relies on Clause 12.4 of the
     said agreement to submit that the words 'arrangement' and 'agreement'
     have been intentionally used interchangeably in the covenants and the
     cross examination of respondent's witness Mr. Rakesh Aggarwal,
     mentioned at page 34 of the paper book, referring to an arrangement
     between the parties must be seen as an acknowledgment of extension of
     the terms of the said agreement. His testimony may further be seen as
     an assertion of the fact that no communication was made on part of the
     respondent for termination of the agreement. The said Clause 12.4 of
     the said agreement is reproduced hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              "Supersedes prior agreements or arrangements
              This Agreement supersedes any prior agreement between
              the Parties whether written or oral and any such prior
              agreements or arrangements are cancelled as at the date of
              execution of this Agreement but without prejudice to any
              rights which already accrued to either of the Parties"
</blockquote><p id="p_22">20. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that, even assuming that the
     said    agreement    expired   by   efflux   of   time,   the   Arbitration
     Clause/Agreement would continue to subsist independently, regardless
     of the expiry of the said agreement. Learned counsel further submits
     that the parties continued to transact business in terms of the said
     Agreement, and consequently the Arbitration Clause/Agreement
     survived the expiry of the said agreement and would govern any dispute
     arising out of these transactions. Therefore, in the present case the

FAO(OS) (COMM) 293/2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                     Page 7 of 12</span>
      Arbitration Clause would continue to govern the post expiry
     transactions. Reliance is placed on the judgement in the case of <a href="/doc/233181/" id="a_8">Reva
     Electric Car Company Private Limited v. Green Mobil</a>, AIR 2012 SC
     739, which inter alia relies on <a href="/doc/847144/" id="a_9">Everest Holding Limited v. Shyam
     Kumar Shrivastava</a>, (2008) 16 SCC 774.
</p>
<p id="p_23">21. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent contends that there is no
     infirmity or illegality in the order passed by the learned Single Judge,
     and the same is based on settled principles of law which would not
     require any interference by this Court in an appeal under <a href="/doc/1656413/" id="a_10">Section 37</a> of
     the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">22. It is further contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that
     there does not exist any evidence to show that the parties were ad idem
     with regard to the extension of the Arbitration Clause. Furthermore,
     learned counsel submits that it is clear from the terms of the said
     agreement that any amendments to the said agreement were to be
     necessarily made in writing.
</p>
<p id="p_25">23. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have carefully
     examined the Arbitral Award, the order dated 30.10.2018 passed by the
     Single Judge as well as the terms of the agreement and the rival
     contentions of the learned counsels appearing in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_26">24. The two questions which arise for our consideration are (i)Whether
     there exists a valid Arbitration Clause between the parties, governing
     the disputes arising between them, post the expiry of the said agreement
     in the year 2009; and (ii)Whether the Single Judge exceeded his
     jurisdiction in holding that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to

FAO(OS) (COMM) 293/2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                    Page 8 of 12</span>
      adjudicate over the disputes, arising between the parties, in the 'post
     agreement arrangement' phase.
</p>
<p id="p_27">25. As regards the first question, learned counsel for the appellant has
     labored hard to contend that the agreement dated 25.01.2008 despite
     having a term of one year, subsisted till the year 2014 and had not
     expired due to efflux of time for the reason that the respondent
     continued to carry on business transactions with the appellant as per the
     terms of the said agreement by placing orders for supplies. In our view,
     the said contention is without any merit. As per Clause 7.1 of the said
     agreement the parties were at a liberty to extend the term of the
     agreement, but the same was to be done in writing. Moreover, Clause
     12.8 of the said agreement provides that the modification, amendment
     or rescission to the said agreement must also be done using a written
     instrument signed by the authorized persons of the both parties.
     Therefore, the contention of the appellant that the addition of locations
     for supplying the material was made under the terms of the said
     agreement is ill-founded for the reason that the additional locations
     were originally not a part of the said agreement and for addition of the
     new locations for the supplies, a modification or amendment had to be
     made to the said agreement, in writing. However, in the present case,
     admittedly, the new locations were not added by any agreement in
     writing. Thus, in the present case, though there was exchange of
     correspondences with respect to the transactions of the business, post
     the expiry of agreement dated 25.01.2008 but this cannot be regarded as
     extension of the agreement. Clause 7.2 and Clause 12.8 are reproduced
     hereunder: -</p><pre id="pre_2">

</p>
<p id="p_30">26. Learned counsel for the appellant also contended that even if the said
     agreement expired, the Arbitration Clause, being independent of the
     main agreement, would survive the termination of the main agreement.
     In response to the said contention, the Single Judge while relying on
     Clause 11.2 of the said agreement, has rightly held that the Arbitration
     Clause would only govern disputes arising in connection with and in
     relation to the terms of the agreement for the year 2008 - 2009. The
     relevant paras 13 and 14 are reproduced hereunder:

              Agreement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">              14. It must be remembered that resolution of disputes
              through arbitration, unless mandated through a statute, is a
              matter of volition of the parties to an Agreement. The
              parties have to agree to have their disputes adjudicated
              through Arbitration. Such Agreement has to conform to
              Section 7 of the Act and is a sine-qua-non. It cannot be oral.
              There has to be a consensus ad idem. It must therefore, be
              shown that parties not only agreed that their post-
              Agreement arrangement would be governed by the general

              also that any dispute in relation to such post Agreement
              arrangement would be adjudicated through arbitration."

<p id="p_31">27.   In the light of the above discussion, we find no infirmity in the order
      passed by the Single Judge in setting aside of the arbitral award, as
      without the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, no dispute can be
      referred to the arbitrator, and thus the award passed would be without
      jurisdiction.

               settled by the Supreme Court, or vitiated by an
              apparently untenable interpretation of the terms of the
              contract, requires to be eviscerated. In view thereof,
              the decision of the ld. Single Judge that reasoning of
              the arbitral award in this regard was based on no
              material and was contrary to the contract, cannot be
              said to be deserving of any interference at our hands
              under Section 37 of the Act. In a pronouncement
              reported at MANU/DE/0459/2015, MTNL v. Fujitshu
              India Pvt. Ltd. (FAO(OS) No. 63/2015), the Division
              Bench of this court has held that "an appeal under
              Section 37 is like a second appeal, the first appeal
              being to the court by way of objections under Section
              34". Being in the nature of a second appeal, this court
              would be hesitant to interfere, with the decision of the
              learned Single Judge, unless it is shown to be palpably
              erroneous on facts or in law, or manifestly perverse.
              The impugned judgement dated 11th April, 2017 of the
              ld. Single Judge cannot be said to suffer from any such
              infirmity."

<p id="p_33">29. In view of the law laid down in the abovementioned judgement, and
      applying the same to the facts of the present case, we find the arbitral
      award to be without jurisdiction. There is no infirmity in the judgement
      impugned before us.
