           as the same are between the same parties and no prejudice would be

           caused to the respondents. It was also the ground in the application that

           all the cheques were drawn at Bank of India, Pune as well as Solan

           Branch. Reply to the application was filed by the respondents and after

           hearing counsel for the parties, the application was dismissed on

           complaints are between the same parties and the offence is also the same,

           which has been committed within a period of 12 months from the first to the

           last offence.           Learned counsel further contends that offence was

           committed between 4.2.2012 and 11.5.2012 but instead of filing joint

           complaint relating to all the cheques in dispute, separate complaints were

           filed. Learned counsel also contends that if all the complaints are tried

           together, it will not only be convenient for the parties but will save the

           precious time of the Court as well and would also result in speedy

           dispensation of justice in view of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

           Learned counsel has also relied upon Division Bench judgment of Madras

           High Court in the case of Manjula Vs. M/s Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd.

           2007 (1) RCR (Criminal) 174, in support of his contentions.

           within a period of 12 months can be clubbed together. He has relied upon

           judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of K.R. Indira Vs. Dr. G.

<p id="p_16">                               The argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that

           the dispute is between the same parties, which relates to same transaction

           and no prejudice is going to be caused to the other party in case all the

           complaints are clubbed together. The argument of learned senior counsel

           for the respondents is that as per provisions of <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_21">Section 219</a> Cr.P.C., only

           three complaints arising within a period of 12 months can be clubbed

           together and beyond that period and number of complaints, no more

           complaints could be clubbed together.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                               The short controversy for decision in the present case is that in

           case of dishonour of 8 cheques between the same parties, all complaints

           can be tried together or not.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                               On perusal of details of cheques reproduced above, it is clear

           that complaints mentioned at Sr. Nos. 1 to 4 arise out of the cheques

           dishonoured on 4.2.2012, whereas, complaints at Sr. Nos. 5 to 8 arise out

           of cheques dishonoured on 11.5.2012.                 Admittedly, the offence was

           committed on two dates i.e. 4.2.2012 and 11.5.2012 but different

           complaints were filed within a period of eleven months. The cheques are

           of different dates and amount but the date of dishonouring of the cheques

           is within a period of 11 months.

           justice by clubbing together a number of offences for making it possible for

           determined herein is as to whether dishonour of cheque on each occasion

           'charged' in the ordinary parlance. The concluding words of the section

           appear to contemplate that in a summons trial, there is a charge of an

           offence, which is not necessary to be mentioned in writing in accordance

           to trial in summon cases under chapter XX of the Code. <a href="/doc/889533/" id="a_42">Section 218</a> of the

           more offences than one committed in the course of same transaction. The

           expression 'distinct offence' has been interpreted by Hon'ble the Apex

           Court in the case of Banwarilal Vs. Union of India AIR 1963 Supreme

           Court 1620, wherein, it has been held as under:-

                               content from the expression 'every offence' or 'each offence'. A

                               separate charge is required for every distinct offence and not

                               necessarily for each separate offence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                               The question is, what is meant by 'every distinct offence' ?

                               'Distinct' means 'not identical'. It stresses characteristics that

                               distinguish 'two things not being the same'. Two offences

                               would be distinct if they be not in any way inter-related. If it is

                               inter-related, there would be no distinctness and it would

                               depend on the circumstances of the case in which the offences

                               were committed whether there be separate charges for those

                               the same would necessarily depend upon the particular facts

                               of each case and it seems to us to be a difficult task to

                               undertake a definition of that which the Legislature has

                               deliberately left undefined. We have not come across a single

                               decision of any Court, which has embarked upon the difficult

                               task of defining the expression. But it is generally thought that

                               where there is proximity of time or place or unity of purpose

                               and design or continuity of action in respect of a series of acts,

                               it may be possible to infer that they form part of the same

                               transaction. It is however not necessary that every one of

                               these elements should co-exist for a transaction to be

                               regarded as the same. But if several acts committed by a

                               person show a unity of purpose or design that would be a

                               strong circumstance to indicate that those acts form part of the

                               same transaction. The connection between a series of acts

                               seems to us to be an essential ingredient for those acts to

                               constitute the same transaction......Now a transaction may

                               consist of an isolated act or may consist of a series of acts.

                               The series of acts which constitute a transaction must of

                               necessity be connected with one another and if some of them

                               stand out independently they would not form part of the same

                               transaction but would constitute a different transaction or

                               principal and subsidiary, so as to result in one continuous

                               action. Thus, where there is a commonality of purpose or

                               design, where there is a continuity of action, then all those

                               persons involved can be accused of the same of different

</p><p id="p_37">                               Accordingly in view of continuity of action and common

           purpose, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_58">Section 219</a> of the Code will not be a bar to such

           recourse. As such, I am of the considered view that all the complaints can

           be tried together in one trial for several such offences because of series of

           acts which are inter linked or inter connected. The very object of <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_59">Section

           219</a> of the Code is to prevent miscarriage of justice by clubbing together a

           number of offences and making it impossible for the accused to defend

           them. <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_60">Sections 219</a> and <a href="/doc/1595114/" id="a_61">220</a> of the Code lay down different and distinct

           exceptions to the General Rule contemplated under <a href="/doc/889533/" id="a_62">Section 218</a> of the

           Code in framing charges. Number of three offences underlined in <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_63">Section

           219</a> of the Code cannot control <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_64">Section 220</a> (1)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_65"> of the Code</a>. In the case in

           hand, the offences committed by the same person in respect               of eight

           cheques must certainly be held to be part of the same transaction

           considering the purpose, the sequence, events, nature of allegations,

           proximity of commission, unity of action etc. Offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_66">Section 138</a> of

           the Act in respect of eight cheques can be held to be offences committed in

           the course of same transaction. <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_67">Section 219</a> (1)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_68"> of the Code</a> refers to

           identical offences committed on different dates during a span of twelve

           months. It permits joinder of those charges provided they are offences of

           the same kind.

<p id="p_38">                               In the present case total eight cheques were dishonoured on

           two dates and only three complaints have been clubbed together keeping

           in view the provisions of <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_69">Section 219</a> of the Code. The offence in all the

           complaint cases relate to <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_70">Section 138</a> of the Act and between the same

           parties and cause of action arose on the date of dishonouring of the

           cheques. Moreover, this is a procedural law and complainant is not going

           to be prejudiced in any manner as it will not only avoid multiplicity of the
