Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Gurugram, has been transferred to

Municipal Corporation, Hisar and respondent No.3 has been transferred as

Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Gurugram.

Divisional Officer) in 1987. In 2010, he was promoted as Executive

Engineer. Vide order dated 27.09.2017 (Annexure P-1), the petitioner was

promoted to the post of Superintending Engineer and was transferred from

the Municipal Corporation, Faridabad to the Municipal Corporation,

Yamuna Nagar. In 2018, the petitioner was promoted as Chief Engineer.

Vide order dated 22.10.2018 (Annexure P-2), the petitioner was transferred

as Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Karnal. Vide order dated

07/08.08.2019 (Annexure P-3), the petitioner was transferred from

Municipal Corporation, Karnal to Municipal Corporation, Gurugram with

additional charge of Municipal Corporation, Faridabad on a newly created

post of Chief Engineer. By the same order (Annexure P-3), respondent No.3

was promoted as Chief Engineer and posted in the Municipal Corporation,

Karnal in place of the petitioner. Vide order dated 15.01.2021 (Annexure

P-4), the petitioner has been transferred from Chief Engineer, Municipal

Corporation, Gurugram to Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Hisar, on

administrative grounds. By the same order (Annexure P-4), respondent No.3

has been transferred from Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Sonipat to

Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Gurugram.

</p><p id="p_5">             Learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner has

contended that the impugned order (Annexure P-4) is illegal and arbitrary in

as much as the petitioner has already been transferred three times in the last

four years and the present transfer is just 1 year 5 months after the last

transfer. He further submitted that the petitioner is due to retire in 1 year 9

months and therefore, no practical purpose will be served by posting him to

Hisar for the remaining period of his service. Counsel for the petitioner

further submitted that the impugned transfer would cause great hardship and

suffering to the petitioner whose wife is suffering from certain health issues

and needs constant support and care. He pressed into service medical

prescriptions (Annexures P-5 and P-6) to support his stand. Learned Senior

counsel contended that the impugned order (Annexure P-4) is a colourable

exercise of power since the transfer of respondent No.3 as Chief Engineer,

Municipal Corporation, Sonipat with Municipal Corporation, Faridabad in

addition has already been stayed by this Court vide order dated 27.11.2020

(Annexure P-7) passed in CWP No.20361 of 2020 and thus the impugned

transfer has been ordered only to accommodate respondent No.3. It has been

contended that one Birender Kumar Kardam was Chief Engineer with

Municipal Corporation, Faridabad. Vide order dated 22.11.2020 the said

Birender Kumar Kardam was relieved of this charge and respondent No.3

was given this posting in addition to the post of Chief Engineer, Municipal

Corporation, Sonipat which he already held. Birender Kumar Kardam

challenged the order dated 22.11.2020 in this Court vide CWP No.20361 of

2020 in which this order stands stayed (Annexure P-7). According to the

learned Senior counsel, respondent No.3 is the blue-eyed boy of the State

Government and since his posting as Chief Engineer, Municipal

Corporation, Faridabad was stayed by this Court, he (respondent No.3) was

favoured and transferred to Municipal Corporation, Gurgaon and in this

process the petitioner has been transferred to Municipal Corporation, Hisar.

Lastly, the learned Senior counsel submitted that the petitioner has an

unblemished service record and therefore the impugned transfer was for

extraneous and mala fide reasons. The learned Senior counsel appearing for

is an incidence in service and an employee can be transferred anywhere

where his services are required in public interest and no employee can claim

a place of posting of his own choice as a matter of right. It is further stated

that it is for the employer to see where the services are required and that the

also longer stay than other Chief Engineers in all Municipal Corporations. It

is contended that an urgency has taken place in Faridabad due to extension

of municipal limits and increase in work and there is a necessity to allow the

Municipal Corporation, Faridabad to have another post of Chief Engineer

and that earlier too there were two Chief Engineers in Municipal

Corporation, Faridabad and due to urgency one post was transferred from

Faridabad to Panipat. As such it had been decided that one post of Chief

Engineer in Municipal Corporation, Faridabad be re-designated as Chief

Engineer (Horticulture) and the post of Chief Engineer in Municipal

Corporation, Sonipat be also transferred to Municipal Corporation,

Faridabad and the second post at Municipal Corporation, Faridabad be

designated as Chief Engineer (Works). Respondent No.1 in it&#x27;s reply has

further submitted that the petitioner belongs to the State Level Cadre of

Service and is governed by the Haryana Municipal Corporation Employees

(Recruitment and Conditions) Service Rules, 1998 and as per Rule 12, &quot;A

member of the service shall be liable to serve at any place, in any Municipal

Corporation in the State of Haryana on being ordered so to do by the

appointing authority or the State Government&quot;. It is also stated in the short

reply that the petitioner has been relieved from Municipal Corporation,

Gurugram on 15.01.2021 vide office order of even date and respondent No.3

has joined Municipal Corporation, Gurugram on 15.01.2021 after relieving

from Municipal Corporation, Sonipat. Another Chief Engineer (Ramji Lal),

who was also covered by the impugned order dated 15.01.2021 (Annexure

P-4) has joined Municipal Corporation, Faridabad on 18.01.2021. As per the

short reply dated 05.02.2021, the petitioner had not joined Municipal

Corporation, Hisar till 04.02.2021. Regarding the illness of the petitioner&#x27;s

petition are from Ludhiana and Old Faridabad and that the petitioner had not

brought his wife&#x27;s illness to the notice of the Department prior to filing of

the writ petition. The State counsel has also contended that there is no

favouritism towards respondent No.3 and that the writ petition filed by

Birender Kumar Kardam challenging the order dated 22.11.2020 is being

contested. Learned State counsel has relied upon the decisions in

&#x27;<a href="/doc/108213/" id="a_6">Government of Andhra Pradesh vs. G. Venkata Ratnam</a>&#x27; [(2008) 9 SCC

345] and &#x27;<a href="/doc/89299133/" id="a_7">Parminder Singh vs. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.&#x27;

<p id="p_8">            In his replication to the short reply filed by respondent No.1 the

petitioner has denied that he has had a tenure longer than any other Chief

Engineer in Municipal Corporation, Gurugram. The petitioner has contended

that there was favouritism displayed by respondent No.1 towards respondent

No.3 to benefit and accommodate him which smacked of mala fide and a

colourable exercise of power. The petitioner has mentioned the service and

posting of respondent No.3 and the pendency of CWP No.20361 of 2020 to

further contend that the impugned transfer order (Annexure P-4) was mala

fide. The fact that respondent No.3 joined the Municipal Corporation,

Gurugram the same day when the impugned transfer order (Annexure P-3)

was passed was also pointed out to contend that respondent No.3 was all

along aware of the proceedings and the transfers had been ordered only to

accommodate him. In the replication a new point regarding the experience of

respondent No.3 to be transferred/deputed as Chief Engineer has also been

raised.

            Respondent No.1 in it&#x27;s rejoinder to the replication filed by the

petitioner has denied the allegations of mala fide and also stated that

No.21285 of 2018 which was still pending.

relieved from Municipal Corporation, Sonipat on 15.01.2021 and has since

taken charge at Municipal Corporation, Gurugram. Respondent No.3 has

also relied upon Rule 12 of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Employees

(Recruitment and Conditions) Service Rules, 1998. It has also been

contended by respondent No.3 that the petitioner is not even eligible to be

appointed as Chief Engineer since he did not possess the requisite

qualifications and that his eligibility to be appointed as a Chief Engineer was

under challenge in CWP No.22459 of 2018 which was still pending.

Reliance has also been placed upon the decision by the Supreme Court in

Government of Haryana. According to the petitioner, as per the said

guidelines the minimum period for continuously serving on a post should

normally be 3 years and that an employee should not be transferred from a

post earlier than the stipulated 3 year period unless essential on exceptional

grounds of public interest. However, the petitioner had completed only 1

year 5 months at his posting in Municipal Corporation, Gurugram without

completing his 3 year period without recording any exceptional grounds in

the impugned transfer order (Annexure P-4). Averments similar to those

made by the petitioner in his replication to the short reply of respondent

No.1 have also been made in his replication to the reply filed by respondent

No.3.

has been relieved from Municipal Corporation, Gurugram on 15.01.2021

stated that as per the service rules the petitioner was required to maintain his

Headquarter at Gurugram whereas, according to his own averments, he was

residing in Faridabad. It has been stated that there was no record regarding

the illness of the petitioner&#x27;s wife available in the office of respondent No.2.

</p><p id="p_14">             I have heard learned counsel for the parties. The law is well

settled that it is within the domain of an employer to transfer an employee

and no employee can claim continuance at a particular place of posting. The

exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court to interfere with the power of an

employer to transfer an employee is very limited and can be exercised in

case the transfer has been ordered without there being any jurisdiction with

suffers from mala fide, which has to be proved on the basis of specific

averments made in the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             The present case does not disclose any justifiable reason for this

Court to interfere in the impugned transfer order dated 15.01.2021

(Annexure P-4). There is no challenge in the writ petition to the power of

respondent No.1 to order the transfer of the petitioner. There is also no

averment that there has been any violation of any statutory rules. Though in

the replication to the reply filed by respondent No.3 the petitioner has placed

reliance upon Policy and Guidelines for Posting and Transfers dated

07.04.1989 (Annexure P-11), there is no reference to the same in the writ

petition. Moreover, a Division Bench of this Court in &#x27;<a href="/doc/80278157/" id="a_12">Parveen Kumar vs.

State of Punjab &amp; Ors</a>.&#x27; [2008(4) SCT 596] inter alia held that :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               &quot;The guidelines laid down by the State for the transfer of its

               employees from one place to another are for the guidance of

               officers and are not enforceable for the purposes of assailing

               their transfer. These do not vest any immunity in an employee

               from transfer in Government service. Besides, transfer of an

               employee from one station to another is a normal feature and

               incidence of service which does not, in any manner, alter the

               conditions of his service. No Government servant can claim

               to remain at a particular post or a station of his choice&quot;.</blockquote><p id="p_16">

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> unless the Court finds that either the order is mala fide or that the

service rules prohibit such transfer, or that the authorities who issued the

orders, were not competent to pass the orders. These parameters, for this

Court to interfere in the impugned transfer order (Annexure P-4), are not

attracted in the present case and in fact none of these grounds are attracted in

the present case. The petitioner is governed by the Haryana Municipal

Corporation Employees (Recruitment and Conditions) Service Rules, 1998

and Rule 12 thereof makes it patent that he is liable to serve at any place, in

any Municipal Corporation in the State of Haryana, on being ordered so to

do by the appointing authority or the State Government. This is not the first

time that the petitioner is being transferred. As far the contention by the

petitioner&#x27;s counsel that the petitioner has already been transferred three

times in the last four years and that the present transfer is just 1 year 5

months after the last transfer, suffice is it to say that the petitioner has served

at other places for shorter periods without protest and demur. Another

argument raised by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner is that the

impugned transfer would cause great hardship and suffering to the petitioner

whose wife is suffering from certain health issues and needs constant

support and care. The petitioner in support of this contention has placed

reliance upon medical prescriptions (Annexures P-5 and P-6). However, the

transfer of the petitioner cannot be set aside on this count by the Court. It is

for the employer to consider any personal inconvenience that a transfer may

cause to an employee and/or his family and the Court cannot be guided by

emotions.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                &quot;Transfer of a government servant appointed to a particular

                cadre of transferable posts from one place to the other is an

                incident of service. No government servant or employee of

                Public Undertaking has legal right for being posted at any

                particular place. Transfer from one place to other is

                generally a condition of service and the employee has no

                choice in the matter. Transfer from one place to other is

                necessary in public interest and efficiency in the public

                administration. Whenever, a public servant is transferred he

                must comply with the order but if there be any genuine

                difficulty in proceeding on transfer it is open to him to make

               violation of any mandatory statutory rule or on the ground of

               mala fide. A government servant holding a transferable post

               has no vested right to remain posted at one place or the

               not violate any of his legal rights. Even if a transfer order is

               passed in violation of executive instructions or orders, the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                &quot;It is a well settled proposition of law that transfer is an

                incidence of service. The Courts shall not interfere with the

                transfer of an employee which will affect adversely the

                effective administration by the employer. The employer is

                entitled to effect transfers in case of administrative exigencies

                and also in best public interest. Of course, if the transfer

                order was effected in violation of any mandatory statutory

                Rule or on the foundation of proved mala fide on the part of

                the employer, the question of challenging the transfer by an

                employee may arise. In case a transfer was effected in terms

                of the policies and executive instructions or orders, the Court

                shall not ordinarily interfere with the order of transfer. Of

                course, the employee may challenge the transfer on the

                ground that the service Rule prohibits such a transfer or that

                an incompetent Authority has effected transfer. As the

                transfer is a necessary concomitant of every service in case

                of administrative exigencies, the High Court should restrain

                itself from exercising its supervisory jurisdiction&quot;.</blockquote><p id="p_25">

Posting and Transfers dated 07.04.1989 (Annexure P-11), there is no

reference to the same in the writ petition. Even otherwise a Division Bench

of this Court in Parveen Kumar&#x27;s case (supra) has held that such guidelines

are only for the guidance of officers and are not enforceable for the purposes

of assailing the transfer and do not vest any immunity in an employee from

transfer in Government service.
</p>
<p id="p_27">             There are no specific allegations of malafide against any

particular officer in the writ petition. There are no mala fides alleged against

any officer who may have ordered the transfer of the petitioner. No officer

against whom mala fide is alleged, or even assumed, has been impleaded by

name. The pleadings by the petitioner only mention that the impugned

transfer order (Annexure P-4) has been passed to favour respondent No.3

which is not the same as alleging mala fide. Further, there is nothing in the

petition which spells out any reason for respondent No.3 to harbour any

mala fide against the petitioner. Mere general statements will not be

sufficient for the purposes of indication of malafides. There must be cogent

evidence available on record to come to the conclusion as to whether in fact

there was existing a bias which resulted in the passing of the impugned

transfer order. In the present case there is none.

2020 filed by Birender Kumar Kardam stayed the order dated 22.11.2020

whereby respondent No.3 was given additional charge as Chief Engineer,

Municipal Corporation, Faridabad and after about two months he

(respondent No.3) was transferred to Municipal Corporation, Gurgaon does

not by itself show that the State Government has favoured respondent No.3.

The order dated 22.11.2020 (Annexure P-8) shows that respondent No.3

continued to retain the post of Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation,

Sonipat and was given additional charge of Chief Engineer, Municipal

Corporation, Faridabad. However, now vide the impugned transfer order

(Annexure P-4) respondent No.3 has been transferred as Chief Engineer to

Municipal Corporation, Gurugram. He no longer holds the charge of Chief

Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Sonipat. The sweep of the two orders i.e.

the order dated 22.11.2020 (Annexure P-8) and the impugned transfer order

(Annexure P-4) is different.

Board &amp; Ors</a>.&#x27; [1991(1) SLR 378], the Division Bench found that the

transfers had been made on the basis of some complaints and adverse

remarks and that there did not seem to be any public interest in transferring

the petitioners and the power to transfer seemed to have been used for

collateral purposes to avoid disciplinary proceedings. The case of &#x27;Dr.

(Mrs.) Pushpa Mehta vs. Rajasthan Civil Services Appellate Tribunal &amp;

Ors.&#x27; [2000(5) SLR 598 Raj.] arose from the decision given by the

Rajasthan Civil Services Appellate Tribunal where, in the opinion of the

Tribunal, the order of transfer was mala fide for the reasons that it has been

passed in order to accommodate the appellant in place of the second

respondent. Further, the second respondent therein was on the verge of

retirement. However, in the present case no mala fides have been established

by the petitioner nor any statutory provisions have been shown to be

violated. The petitioner still has his service till 31.10.2022. The case of

notice to the State and only the private-respondent, who was a caveator,

brought back to Patiala in place of the petitioner without any administrative

exigency. In the present case respondent No.1 has in it&#x27;s short reply spelt out

the exigency for passing of the impugned transfer order (Annexure P-4).

decided by relying upon the decision in Dr. (Mrs.) Pushpa Mehta&#x27;s case

(supra) which has already been distinguished above. In &#x27;Dr. Dev Parkash

Chugh vs. State of Punjab &amp; Ors.&#x27; [2005(4) SCT 726] the Court was

interpreting the transfer policy of the State of Punjab notified on

20.04.2005. No such transfer policy of the Government of Haryana has been

referred to in the writ petition and it is only at the stage of filing the

replication to the reply filed by respondent No.3 that the petitioner put his

reliance on the Policy and Guidelines for Posting and Transfers dated

07.04.1989 (Annexure P-11). This policy has not even been relied upon by

the petitioner in his replication filed to the short reply filed by respondent

No.1. The present case is also not a case where an employee has been

singled out for adverse treatment. Therefore, the decision of the Division

Bench of this Court relied upon by the Senior counsel for the petitioner is

distinguishable on facts. The decision in &#x27;<a href="/doc/12325723/" id="a_24">Birender Kumar Kardam vs.

State of Haryana &amp; Ors</a>.&#x27; [2017(1) SCT 384] operates against the

petitioner as the transfer of the petitioner therein was upheld by this Court.

The reliance upon certain interim orders passed by the Court in the matter of

&#x27;<a href="/doc/61685760/" id="a_25">Rajesh Kumar &amp; Ors. vs. State of Haryana &amp; Ors</a>.&#x27; is also misplaced

since that case pertained to deployment/deputation of employees of one

             Respondent No.3 has questioned the petitioner&#x27;s qualifications

this issue is already pending. Needless to say, this Court is not seized of any
