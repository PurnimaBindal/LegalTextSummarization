    and the order passed by the Trial Court by urging that there exists no 

    cogent evidence on the record establishing guilt of the appellants. It is 

    the crux of his submission that the Trial Court after rightly discarding 

    evidence of PW-6 and PW-8 manifestly erred in resting the conviction 

    upon the sole evidence of PW-4. According to him, the evidence of PW-4 

                                                                                          6of 29

    warranting   to   discard   the   evidence   of   both   the   witnesses.   He   further 

    urged   that   even   in   the   evidence   of   PW-4   hardly   any   evidence   has

    causing an injury to the deceased, muchless, injuries resulting into his 




                                                            
    death.  Thus, he contended that the appellants deserve to be acquitted or 

    at   least   deserve   to   be   given   benefit   of   doubt   by   allowing   the   appeal

    injuries   Nos.   1   to   4   mentioned   in   Column   No.17   of   the   postmortem

    record that  injuries Nos. 7,8 and 9  described in the said column  were 




                                                             
    possible   by   hard   and   blunt   object   like   stick.     It   was   also   brought   on

    death.  Significantly enough PW-5 ruled  out the possibility of an alcohol 
                             
    being cause of the said death.  She also ruled out the possibility that due 
                            
    to  excessive   alcohol  the  deceased   having   met  with  death   and   he  was 

    assaulted thereafter.  Thus considering the said evidence it can be safely 

    said, without any dilation that the evidence of PW-1 considered along 
      


    with said medical evidence and so also similar matters  regarding nature 
   



    of   injuries     sustained   by   the   deceased   as   revealed   from   the   admitted

    he was near the house of Leelabai Vadar.  Similarly, the further answer

<p id="p_32">    17.          The position regarding the further submission canvassed that 

    the   conduct   of   PW-4   is   unnatural   or   contrary   to   the   claim   of   having 




                                                           
    witnessed the incident is also not different.  We are unable to accept the 

    said submission as PW-4 being at a spot from which the incident was 




                                              
    visible, there was no worthy reason for him to rush to the spot to observe 
                            
    the happening and particularly when the assailant was armed with lethal 
                           
    weapons like sword and was assaulting the deceased.  The answer given 

    by PW-4 being to the effect that he had not rushed to the spot and the 

    position  being not brought on record that from the  said place he had 
      


    returned to his house and the omission brought regarding matters told 
   



    by him to PW-1 being of insignificant nature, we do not find any fault in 

    his conduct of either not going to the house of deceased or to the police 





    station for informing about the incident.  It is difficult to visualize that in 

    event of brothers of the deceased having arrived at the spot there would 





    have   been   any   such   necessity.     Thus,   after   careful   scrutiny   of   the 

    evidence of PW-4, we do not find any embellishment in his evidence for 

    not accepting the same regarding part of the incident witnessed by him 

    and consequently we do not find that any error was committed by the 

    Trial Court in accepting the same.</p><pre id="pre_6">

    occurred on middle road, the Trial Court found it unsafe to rely upon his 
                           
    evidence.   After considering the reasoning given thereon we are unable 

    to find  any  fault within   it,  as the  same  is  apparently  based  upon the 

    evidence  surfaced at the trial or more particularly the vital improvement 
      


    made   at   the   trial   by   PW-6.     Hence,   we   do   not   propose   to   recite   the

    returning to house  at 6.30 p.m.   He  deposed about deceased  and his

    deposed that the appellants then were standing under Umber Tree, they

    Rakesh.   Rakesh began running away but fell down  on the road near 

    house of Kallavva Jadhav.  Appellant No.2 told appellant No.1 "to finish

    said   road   before   Rakesh   and   in   turn   renders   testimony   of   PW-4 

    unreliable.  We are unable to accept the said submission as perusal of the 

    evidence of PW-8 does not give such impression inasmuch as the same is 

    wholly silent regarding the duration for which PW-8 was standing on the

    stained with blood from drainage and the same was seized by the police 

    under panchanama Exh.32.  Similarly, the relevant part of the evidence 

    of PW-2 also reveals that the police has seized the clothes on the person 
      


    of   the   appellants.       Similarly,   through   the   evidence   of   PW-3   and   the 
   



    evidence of PW-10, the prosecution has established that the articles as 

    stated   in   panchanama   Exh.33   were   seized   from   spot   of   offence.   The 





    evidence of PW-10 also reveals that the relevant articles were sent to the

    not find any infirmity in said evidence, except the evidence pertaining to 

    discovery and seizure at the behest of appellant No.1, for not accepting 

    that   such   facets   were   established   by   said   evidence.     However,   with 

    regard   to   the   evidence   pertaining   to   discovery,   we   find   that   the   trial

                  The learned counsel for the appellants tried to canvass that 
                            
    the investigation in the present case was not proper one.   It was urged 

    that, it is apparent from the statement of PW-8 being recorded at belated 

    stage and/or the other independent witnesses from the vicinity of the 
      


    spot were not examined by the investigating agency and ultimately by 
   



    the prosecution.  It was urged that the same reveals that one sided story 

    was   tried   to   be   placed   before   the   Court.   It   was   urged,   hence   the 





    appellants are entitled for benefit of doubt due to conviction being rested 

    upon the evidence of single witness. We are unable to agree with the said 





    submission,   as   it   is   fairly   settled   legal   position   that   the   follies   of   an 

    investigating   officer   by   itself   cannot   be   said   to   be   detrimental   to   the 

    prosecution and/or the accused being entitled to derive benefit due to 

    follies of investigating officer same unless and until it is shown that the 

    said   faulty   investigation   has   caused   prejudice   to   the   accused   and   the 

                                                                                             21of 29

    information report was lodged by a person who was not eye witness to

    by him and hence crime being initially registered against two known and 

    unknown   persons   and   due   to   the   same,   inspite   of   recovery   of   one 

    weapon at the behest of appellant No.1, the investigating officer seeking 
      


    the remand for recovery of further weapons would not establish that the 
   



    investigation was faulty and/or tainted.  The same is the case regarding 

    the statement of PW-8 being not recorded earlier.  Needless to add, that 





    even   in   the   aforesaid   context   our   attention   was   not   drawn   to   any

    investigating officer justifying such submission.

                   Now,   considering   the   earlier   part   of   evidence   of   PW-4   and 
                             
    emphasized portion from the further part, it is clear that the act of an 

    assault upon Rakesh was a planned assault. Such an inference is obvious 

    as the available evidence of PW-4 does not reveal that the assault had 
      


    commenced due to occurring of some event of altercation/quarrel prior 
   



    to   commencement   of   the   same.   The   evidence   of   PW-4   denoting   that 





    earlier he had seen the appellants near Ashirwad Building, deceased in 

    Chowk and while returning at 8.10 p.m., appellants beneath the Umber 

    Tree (but without making reference about weapon, if any, in the hand of 





    appellant No.1), and his attention being drawn to the spot after hue and 

    cry clearly denotes that it was a pre-planned attack upon the deceased 

    and force the appellants were waiting beneath the Umber Tree. </p><pre id="pre_9">

    PW-4 which denotes that when he had witnessed towards the spot he 

    had seen Rakesh lying and appellant No.2 telling appellant No.1 to finish 




                                                           
    Rakesh. It reveals that thereafter appellant No.1 had assaulted four in 

    number by means of a sword. The further part reveals that appellant No1 




                                                          
    had   ran   away   and   so   also   appellant   No.2.   All   the   said   evidence 

    considered in proper perceptive denotes that the criminal act in-question 




                                             
    was to assault the Rakesh and to murder him, i.e. to cause him injuries to 
                           
    cause his death. Same is apparent from the weapon used and the injuries 
                          
    caused. The presence of appellant No.2 since beginning uptil end and 

    fleeing away after the assault denotes   that the criminal act committed 

    was   outcome   of   the   common   intention   of   both   the   appellants.

<p id="p_60">    Additionally, the directions given by appellant No.2 to appellant No.1 is 
   



    self reflective of his active participation in the said criminal act. In view 

    of the same, we do not find any merit in the submission canvassed that 





    as appellant No.2 was not armed with the weapon, nor he had assaulted 

    Rakesh denotes that he was not entertaining the same intention as that 





    of appellant No.1.  Hence, we are of considered opinion that as the said 

    criminal act was committed in furtherance of common intention, the case 

    of appellant No.2 would be covered within the four corners of <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_18">Section 34</a> 

    of I.P.C. making him equally liable for the offence of murder irrespective 

    of   fact   of   himself   having   not   assaulted   the   victim.   Hence,   both   the
