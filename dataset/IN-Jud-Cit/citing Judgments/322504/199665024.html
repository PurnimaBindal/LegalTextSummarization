                          ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">           (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)


      Petitioners have challenged the vires of the Gujarat
Agricultural Lands Ceiling Act, 1960 ('the Act' for short) as being
ultra vires the Constitution of India. Consequently, they have prayed
for quashing the proceedings undertaken by the competent authority
under the Act qua the petitioners' agricultural land of village Ladvi,
Taluka Kamrej, Dist: Surat.
</p>

<p id="p_2">      Few facts may be noted at the outset.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The petitioners hold agricultural lands situated in village
Ladvi, Taluka Kamrej. Since the land held by the petitioners was in
excess of the ceiling limit prescribed under the Act, necessary
declaration in this respect was made before the competent authority.
The Mamlatdar and ALT held certain lands to be in excess of ceiling
limit. The petitioners lost in further appeal and revision before the
Gujarat Revenue Tribunal when the revision petition was dismissed
on 20th June 1993. Such decision of the GRT was challenged by the
petitioners by filing Special Civil Application No.10507 of 1993
which was dismissed by a judgment dated 21.3.2007. Against the
said judgment of the learned Single Judge, the petitioners preferred
Letters Patent Appeal No.52/09 which was dismissed on 17 th
February 2009. SLP filed by the petitioners before the Supreme

         C/SCA/16103/2013                                 JUDGMENT



Court also came to be dismissed on 27 th August 2010.                 The
petitioners thereafter sought review of the said order which also
came to be dismissed by the Supreme Court on 1st February 2011.
We are informed that a curative petition has been filed before the
Supreme Court which is pending. At that stage, the petitioners have
filed this petition and challenged the vires of the said Act.
</p>

<p id="p_4">      Learned counsel Shri Mehta for the petitioner                 raised
following contentions:
</p>

<p id="p_5">   (1)That no assent and at any rate no separate assents were
      obtained from the President, one as required under <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_1">Article
      31-A</a> of the Constitution and another under <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_2">Article 254(2)</a> of
      the Constitution. The first assent was necessary because the
      Act was in abrogation of the fundamental rights.              Assent
      under <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_3">Article 254(2</a>), would be necessary because the State
      was enacting a law with reference to the entry in the
      concurrent list where the Union legislation was already in
      existence.
</p>

<p id="p_6">   (2)Counsel further submitted that the said Act made provisions
      divesting the petitioners and other agricultural land-holders of
      their properties without payment of any compensation.          Such
      provisions would be opposed to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the
      Constitution. He, therefore, argued that the same affects the
      basic features of the Constitution. He contended that Articles
      14, 19 and 21 form a triumvirate and any law which abridges


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                Page 3 of 14</span>
        C/SCA/16103/2013                                JUDGMENT



      these articles would be opposed to the basic structure of the
      Constitution and therefore should be declared as null.
</p>

<p id="p_7">      Faced with the situation that the said Act is placed in the Ninth
Schedule right from the year 1964, the counsel contended that many
provisions were added to the said Act subsequently.        Significant
changes were made by the amendments brought into by Gujarat Act
No. 2 of 1974 with effect from 23 rd February 1974. He, therefore,
submitted     that as held by the Supreme Court in the case of
<a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_4">I.R.Coelho v. State of T.N</a>., (2007) 2 SCC 1 such amended
provisions would be open to challenge on the limited ground of
destroying the basic features of the Constitution.
</p>

<p id="p_8">      On the other hand, learned Advocate General Shri Kamal
Trivedi appearing for the respondents opposed the petition on the
ground that the petitioners having failed in the proceedings under the
said Act now cannot at a belated stage challenge the vires of the
Act. He submitted that the challenge to the validity of the Act is an
afterthought and it would not be open to the petitioners to challenge
the same at this stage. In this respect, he relied on a decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/87054134/" id="a_5">P.G.F. Ltd v. Union of India</a>, AIR
2013 SC 3702.
</p>

<p id="p_9">      The learned Advocate General further contended that the said
Act was placed in the Ninth Schedule way back in the year 1964.
By virtue of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
I.R.Coelho (supra), challenge to the validity of the Act even on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               Page 4 of 14</span>
         C/SCA/16103/2013                                 JUDGMENT



limited ground of destroying the basic features therefore would not
be available.      With respect to the amendments made          post the
decision of Kesavananda Bharati [(1973) 4 SCC 225] he submitted
that   there is nothing pointed out to suggest that any of the
amendments are opposed to the basic features of the Constitution.
</p>

<p id="p_10">       He relied on the affidavit in reply filed by the State
Government to contend that the assent of the President was obtained
at the relevant time. He further placed on record certain documents
in this respect. One of them is a copy of a communication received
from the Government of India              by the Governor of Gujarat
conveying the assent of the President to the said Act.
</p>

<p id="p_11">       As noted above, the petitioners lost at all stages in their
litigation under the said Act. Having failed upto the level of the
Gujarat Revenue Tribunal, their petition and LPA came to be
dismissed     by this Court.    SLP and Review Petition were also
dismissed by the Supreme court. At that stage, we have serious
doubt whether the petitioner can file an independent petition calling
in question the vires of the Act under which such action was
initiated.   In this respect, we may refer to the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of P.G.F. Ltd. (supra) in which following
observations have been made by the Supreme Court:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "31. Before adverting to the various contentions raised in
       challenging the vires of Section 11AA of the SEBI Act, we feel
       that it is worthwhile to state and note certain precautions to be
       observed whenever a vires of any provision of law is raised before


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                Page 5 of 14</span>
  C/SCA/16103/2013                                     JUDGMENT



the Court by way of a writ petition. It will be worthwhile to lay
down certain guidelines in that respect, since we have noticed that
on very many occasions a challenge to a provision of law, as its
constitutionality is raised with a view to thwart the applicability
and rigour of those provisions and as an escape route from the
applicability of those provisions of law and thereby create an
impediment for the concerned authorities and the institutions who
are to monitor those persons who seek such challenges by abusing
the process of the Court. Such frivolous challenges always result in
prolongation of the litigation, which enables such unscrupulous
elements who always thrive on other peoples money to take
advantage of the pendency of such litigation preferred by them and
thereby gain, on the one side, unlawful advantage on the monitory
aspect and to the disadvantage of innocent victims, and ultimately,
gain unlawful enrichment of such ill-gotten money by defrauding
others.     In effect, such attempts made by invoking the
extraordinary jurisdiction of the writ Courts of many such
challenges, mostly result in rejection of such challenges. However,
at the same time, while taking advantage of the long time gap
involved in the pending proceedings, such unscrupulous litigants
even while suffering the rejection of their stand at the end as to the
vires of the provisions, always try to wriggle out of their liabilities
by stating that the time lag had created a situation wherein those
persons who were lured to part with huge sums of money are either
not available to get back their money or such unscrupulous
petitioners themselves are not in a position to refund whatever
money collected from those customers or investors. It is, therefore,
imperative and worthwhile to examine at the threshold as to
whether such challenges made are bona fide and do require a
consideration at all by the writ courts by applying the principle of
'lifting the veil' and as to whether there is any hidden agenda in
perpetrating such litigation. With that view, we lay down some of
the criteria to be kept in mind whenever a challenge to a provision
of law is made before the Court.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">32. The Court can, in the first instance, examine whether there is
a prima facie strong ground made out in order to examine the vires
of the provisions raised in the writ petition. The Court can also
note whether such challenge is made at the earliest point of time
when the statute came to be introduced or any provision was
brought into the statute book or any long time gap exist as between
the date of the enactment and the date when the challenge is made.
It should also be noted as to whether the grounds of challenge


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           Page 6 of 14</span>
        C/SCA/16103/2013                                    JUDGMENT



      based on the facts pleaded and the implication of provision really
      has any nexus apart from the grounds of challenge made. With
      reference to those relevant provisions, the Court should be
      conscious of the position as to the extent of public interest involved
      when the provision operates the field as against the prevention f
      such operation. The Court should also examine the extent of
      financial implications by virtue of the operation of the provision
      vis-a-vis the State and alleged extent of sufferance by the person
      who seeks to challenge based on the alleged invalidity of the
      provision with particular reference to the vires made. Even if the
      writ Court is of the view that the challenge raised requires to be
      considered, then again it will have to be examined, while
      entertaining the challenge raised for consideration, whether it calls
      for prevention of the operation of the provision in the larger
      interest of the public. We have only attempted to set out some of
      the basic considerations to be borne in mind by the writ Court and
      the same is not exhaustive. In other words, the Writ Court should
      examine such other grounds on the above lines for consideration
      while considering a challenge on the ground of vires to a Statute or
      provision of law made before it for the purpose of entertaining the
      same as well as for granting any interim relief during the pendency
      of such writ petitions. For the above stated reasons it is also
      imperative that when such writ petitions are entertained, the same
      should be disposed of as expeditiously as possible and on a time
      bound basis, so that the legal position is settled one way or the
      other."

<p id="p_13">      Otherwise also, we do not find that the petitioners have made
any case for the declaration as prayed for.

shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the
consideration of the President, has received his assent. It is in this
context,    counsel for the petitioners      raised the question of
Presidential assent.
</p>

<p id="p_15">      We may also notice that <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_12">Article 254(2)</a> of the Constitution
requires    assent of the President where the law made by the
legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated

provisions of an earlier law made by the Parliament or an existing
law with respect to that matter.
</p>

<p id="p_16">      Such assent was duly obtained at the relevant time as is
apparent from the affidavit in reply of the State Government as well
as the documents produced before us by the respondents. We have
no reason to doubt the official version. Especially in absence of any
contrary material, we proceed on the basis that the assent of the
President as required under <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_13">Article 31A</a> was obtained.

<p id="p_17">      The question can be looked from a slightly different angle.

inconsistent with or in any manner abridging the rights conferred
by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_15">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_16">19</a> of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_17">Article 31-B</a> on the other
hand pertains to validation of certain Acts and Regulations. It reads
as under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "31.B Validation of certain Acts and Regulations - Without
      prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in
      <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_18">article 31A</a>,none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the
      Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be
      deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground
      that such Act, Regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or
      takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any
      provisions of this Part, and notwithstanding any judgment,
      decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary, each of
      the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of
      any competent Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in
      force."</blockquote>

<p id="p_19">      Accordingly, none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the
Ninth Schedule would be void on the ground that the same takes
away or abridges any of the rights conferred in Part III of the
Constitution.     <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_19">Article 31-B</a> starts with the expression "without
prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_20">article 31A

placed in the Ninth Schedule is without prejudice to the generality

purposes mentioned in sub-clauses (a) to (e) to clause (1) would not
be deemed to be void as being inconsistent with or taking away
or abridging any of the rights conferred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_24">19</a> as long

immunity to any law placed in Ninth Schedule against being
declared void as being opposed to any of the fundamental rights.
</p>

<p id="p_20">      Under the              circumstances, when the Act in question has
already been placed in the Ninth Schedule since 1964, the question
of any of the provisions being framed with the assent of the
President in order to save the law against unconstitutionality on the
ground of being inconsistent with or taking away or abridging any of
the rights under Articles 14 and 19 would pale into insignificance.
</p>

<p id="p_21">      We notice that the Supreme Court in the case of I.R.Coelho
(supra)      examined the various issues pertaining to the Ninth
Schedule of the Constitution and the question whether          any of the
laws placed in the Ninth Schedule could be called in question as
being ultra vires. In conclusion, it was held as under:

underlying them. To put it differently even though an Act is put in
the Ninth Schedule by a constitutional amendment, its provisions
would be open to attack on the ground that they destroy or damage
the basic structure if the fundamental right or rights taken away or
abrogated pertains or pertain to the basic structure.

protection, on the laws included in the Ninth Schedule by

reflected in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_29">Article 21</a> read with <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_30">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_31">Article 19</a> by
application of the "rights test" and the "essence of the right" test
taking the synoptic view of the Articles in Part III as held in Indira

      Accordingly, the law which has been placed in the Ninth
Schedule     prior to 24.4.73 would not be open to challenge.
However, if any law is placed in the Ninth Schedule after 24.4.73,
same may be         open to challenge on the limited ground that it
destroys the basic features of the Constitution. It was in this context
that the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the law
taking away the private property without any compensation was
wholly arbitrary and was thus opposed to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of
the Constitution. It was in this context, he argued that the law
breaches the basic structure of the Constitution.

<p id="p_29">      Preamble to the said Act reads as under:
</p>

<p id="p_30">      "Whereas the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948
      (Bom. LXVII of 1948) imposes a restriction upon holding
      agricultural land in excess of certain limits in the Bombay area of
      the State of Gujarat:
</p>
<p id="p_31">             And Whereas it is expedient in the public interest to make a
      uniform provision for the whole of the State of Gujarat in respect
      of restrictions upon holding agricultural land in excess of certain
      limits and it is also expedient for so securing the distribution of
      agricultural land as best to subserve the common good to provide
      for the acquisition of surplus agricultural land for the allotment
      thereof to persons who are in need of lands for agriculture
      (including co-operative farming societies, landless persons,
      agricultural labourers and small holders) or for the allotment of
      such surplus agricultural lands the integrity of which is maintained
      in compact blocks to a department of Government or to co-
      operative farming societies or corporations owned or controlled by
      the State, for ensuring the full and efficient use thereof and to
      provide for other consequential and incidental matters hereinafter
      appearing: It is hereby enacted in the Eleventh year of the
      Republic of India as follows:-"

      The Act was thus enacted                  for equitable distribution of
</pre><p id="p_32">agricultural land as best to subserve the common good to provide
for the acquisition of surplus agricultural land for the allotment
thereof to persons who are in need of lands for agriculture.                With
this object in mind, various provisions have been made in the Act
under which a land holder who owns land in excess of the ceiling
limit has to surrender such land to the State Government, which in
turn would be distributed amongst different categories of cultivators.
We do not see how such Act breaches the provisions of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_35">Article 14</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_36">,
19</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_37">21</a> of the Constitution.                      An agriculturist who holds
agricultural land in excess of the ceiling limit specified under the
Act forms a distinct and separate class as against those who hold
agricultural land less than the said limit. Divesting agricultural lands
of such agriculturists who hold land in excess of the ceiling limit
therefore cannot be termed as an act of inequality. From the early
days of the Constitution it has been recognized that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_38">Article 14</a>
prohibits     class legislation but not               reasonable classification.
Reference in this regard be made to the decision of the Constitution
Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1905739/" id="a_39">Budhan Chaudhry v.
State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1955 SC 191. The agriculturist concerned is
not prevented from carrying on his trade or business. It merely
restricts his land holding which is found to be in excess of ceiling
area prescribed.       Such ceilings are prescribed for different areas
depending on its fertility and the nature of land use. Different units
are provided for           dry-crop lands, seasonally irrigated lands and
perennially irrigated lands. What the Act thus seeks to achieve is
more equitable distribution of agricultural lands to agriculturists.

<p id="p_33">          C/SCA/16103/2013                                      JUDGMENT



Instead of allowing a single agriculturist to own and possess vast
tracks of land far in excess of agricultural area which he can
personally cultivate and would be required for his sustenance, the
land is sought to be distributed amongst landless labourers, poor
agriculturists and agriculture co-operative societies.
</p>

<p id="p_34">        We fail to understand how such provisions can be said to be
opposed to the petitioners' right to life and liberty. It is true that
right to life and liberty flowing from <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_40">Article 21</a> contains various
features.    It includes right to live with dignity.           Right to basic
education, to clean environment, freedom from noise pollution are
all considered part of right to life. But to live in luxury is not a part
of right to life. The argument that the Act being opposed to Articles
14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution                 therefore opposed to    basic
features of the Constitution must fail.
