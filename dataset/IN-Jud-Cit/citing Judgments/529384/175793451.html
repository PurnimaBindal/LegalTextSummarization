    confusion having been caused.   The packaging, cartons, etc. also reduce   any 
                                
    chances of confusion. It is submitted that the Defendant is an established player 

    of high repute  in pharmaceutical preparation and not a fly by night operator

    copies of merely two invoices, both of the year 1996, no evidence of sales has 

    been furnished by the Plaintiff.   Even the Plaintiff's figures of sales produced 

    from the year 2004 are neither certified by a Chartered Accountant nor by any 





    authorized signatory and are not even on the Plaintiff's letterhead, thereby giving 

    reason to doubt the credibility of the same. It is submitted that  such material is

          questions arise; for then the infringement is made out. When the two marks
          are not identical, the, plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used
          by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiffs registered trade mark as




                                                                 
          is likely to deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods in respect of
          which it is registered (Vide <a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_24">Section 21</a>). A point has sometimes been raised
          as to whether the words "or cause confusion" introduce any element which
          is not already covered by the words "likely to deceive" and it has




                                                    
          sometimes been answered by saying that it is merely an extension of the
                                  
          earlier test and does not add very materially to the concept indicated by
          the earlier words "likely to deceive". But this apart, as the question arises
          in an action for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish
                                 
          that the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of trade in the
          goods in respect of which his mark is registered, is deceptively similar.
          This has necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two marks-
</p>       


<p id="p_56">          the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception
          not being capable of definition by laying down objective standards. The
    



          persons who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods
          and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of
          consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic





          idea represented by the plaintiffs mark. The purpose of the comparison is
          for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff's trade mark
          are to be found in that used by the defendant. The identification of the
          essential features of the mark is in essence a   question   of   fact   and  





          depends on the judgment of the Court based on the evidence led before  
          it as regards the usage of the trade. It should, however, be borne in  
          mind that the object of the enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the  
          mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of  
          the registered mark of the plaintiff.

    one from the other.   Neither of the distinctive prefixes can be slurred over.  As 

    regards   the   Plaintiff's   trade   mark     THYROX     (which   is   not   a   registered

    monopoly over the words 'Thyro' , the distinctive letters 'Le' in the prefix of the

    also the part of the body 'thyroid' for which the drugs are meant.   The word 

    'thyro' has become publici juris  and the material produced by the Defendant No.

    a   proprietor   adopts   a   trade   mark   on   the   basis   of   name   of   generic   drug   or 

    ingredient, it will be safe to assume that he is aware that other proprietors are

    same  generic  drug  or  ingredient.   In  such  a   case,  the   first user  cannot claim 

    exclusivity in his trade mark or in the name which is derived from the generic 




                                                     
    drug.  At the most such proprietor can claim exclusivity in those added features 
                                  
    which   differentiates   his   trade   mark   from   the   name   of   the   generic   drug   or 

    ingredient. When two  trade  marks are  coined  from the  same  generic  drug  or 
                                 
    ingredient, there are bound to be similarities between the two and in such a case, 

    even if the differences between the two trademarks are minor or small, then also 
        


    at least at the prima facie stage no injunction can be granted." This judgment in 
     



    paragraph 12 also deals with and distinguishes the judgment in Cadila.  The clear 

    dictum  of the said judgment on law cannot  be diluted by the fact that in that 





    case the drugs were bulk drugs and administered by doctors. This was only an 

    additional factor considered.

    while dealing with the rival marks 'trivedon' and 'flaredon' held that since the 

    marks start with distinct dissimilarities so far as the first syllable is concerned, 




                                                       
    there was no similarity between the mark.

    LETHYROX  of Defendant No.1 is not deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's marks 

    THYROX  and ANTI  THYROX.  The Defendants having coined and invented their 
        


    mark   from   the   invented   molecule,   the   adoption   of   the   said   mark   by   the 
     



    Defendants appears to be honest, independent and bona fide.

<p id="p_78">    33.                 Apart from the fact that the marks are distinct   and different, 

    even otherwise the Plaintiffs have not established the ingredients of passing off 

    action. Except for adducing copies of only two invoices, both for the year 1996, 





    no evidence of sales has been furnished by the Plaintiff. As submitted on behalf 

    of the Defendant No. 1, even the Plaintiff's figures of sales produced from the 

    year 2004 are neither certified by a Chartered Accountant, nor by any authorized 

    signatory,   and   are   not   even   on   the   Plaintiff's   letterhead.   The   sales   figures   of

    of   the   Plaintiff's   products   sold   under   THYROX   is   the   same   as   that   of   the 

    Defendant's   products,   there   cannot   be   any   disastrous   consequences.       The 




                                                         
    submission of the Plaintiff that the Defendants have not established extensive use 
                                    
    of the other products is also incorrect.   The same is set out extensively in the

    figures of various other products derived from a licensed software IMS Plus have
