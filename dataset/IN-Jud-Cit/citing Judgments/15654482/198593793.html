</pre><p id="p_1">            (on Suit for Damages, Permanent and Mandatory Injunction}



Plaintiff's Case ­ 
1.1            The   plaintiff   M/s.   Mankind   Pharma   Limited,   a   company 

incorporated, a legal entity through its Company Secretary and authorized 

representative Shri Sanjeev Kumar Singh by virtue of authorization (now Ex. 

PW­1/1), filed Suit for Permanent and Mandatory Injunctions and Damages 

that plaintiff is registered proprietor of trademark ZADY (vide trademark No. 

1214559   dated   16.07.2003   in   Class­05,   copy   of   registration   is   now   Ex. 

PW­1/5), against the defendant M/s. Four Square Pharmaceuticals and two 

others that it is manufacturing other pharmaceutical products with trademark 

XYDI   and   defendant   is   required   to   be   restrained   by   way   of   permanent 

injunction from selling, manufacturing, using or selling, exhibiting for sale or 

advertising   pharmaceutical   and   medical   preparation   under   the   trademark 

XYDI vis­a­vis the other mark, which is identical with or deceptively similar to 

the trademark of plaintiff ZADY, so as to injunct them from passing off goods 

of defendant as of plaintiff, besides damages of Rs. 15 lacs. 


1.2            The   plaintiff   has   been   manufacturing   various   pharmaceutical 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">TM No. 132/2011                                                            Page 2 of 15</span>

products with distinct trademark ZADY, which is neither a descriptive word 

nor an indicative word but is is an arbitrary and invented word, which has 

been   coined   and   conceptualized   by   plaintiff   company.   It   is   registered 

trademark,   protected   by  the   provisions   of   the   Trademarks   Act,   1999.   The 

plaintiff has been extensively using the trademark ZADY from the year 2003 

and has incurred substantial expenses in popularizing the mark, which came 

to be identified with the company. Moreover, besides making the trademark a 

household   name,   it   has   associated   with   certain   intrinsic   qualities   of   the 

company, which infusing confidence in public at large, it provides a degree of 

comfort concerning its utility, efficacy and effectiveness. 


1.3             The   plaintiff   has   been   carrying   its   business   activities   and   its 

success   can   be   gauzed   from   the   sale   figures,   certificate   has   also   been 

issued by Charted Accountant with regard to account carrying sales figures 

(the same is now Ex. PW­1/3), besides tax invoices [now Ex. PW­1/4 (colly.)] 

also reflects that the plaintiff has been continuously and because of long use, 

has gained goodwill of its trademark ZADY because of its distinctiveness in 

terms of its commercial value.

1.4             However, in the month of April 2010, the plaintiff came to know

that   the   defendant   is   using   the   mark   XYDI   having   the   same   active 

pharmaceutical   ingredient,   as   of   plaintiff.   The   mark   XYDI   besides   being 

phonetically   similar   to   that   of   the   trademark   of   the   plaintiff   ZADY   is   also 

similar to the extent that the letter Z appearing in the mark of the plaintiff has 

been   replaced   by   X   besides   shuffling   some   of   the   letters.   Both   the 

trademarks   sound   similar,   the   trademark   used   by   the   defendant   is   if   not, 

identical, is deceptive similar to that of the plaintiff company. By using the 

mark XYDI, the defendant has intentionally and deliberately intended not only 

to reap commercial benefit from the goodwill and reputation enjoyed by the 

mark of the plaintiff by passing off its product as that of the plaintiff company 

but has also intentionally designed to mislead the public at large by inducing 

them to believe that the product having the mark XYDI hails from the stable 

of the plaintiff company. The defendant has been making used of mark XYDI 

since 2009 as appearing from record.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">                 Whereas,   in   a   developing   country   like   India,   companies   like 

defendant always tend to take advantage of the frail memory of the public by 

deliberately   using   the   mark   which   is   deceptively   similar   to   that   of   an 

established mark having acquired a distinctiveness due to its uniqueness and 

association with a particular company. There is no plausible reason as to why 

the defendant chose to use the mark XYDI for its product particularly when 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">TM No. 132/2011                                                                    Page 4 of 15</span>

the same is neither descriptive nor indicative. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">
1.5            The   plaintiff   is   a   registered   proprietor   of   trademark   ZADY, 

whereas mark XYDI of defendant is identical with or deceptively similar with 

the trademark of plaintiff; the defendants' medicinal preparations have similar 

ingredients and for the same treatment of disease as that of plaintiff. The 

defendant has also applied for registration of trademark XYDI in Class­05 

with the Registrar Trademark (the same is now Ex. PW­1/7), the facts may be 

discerned from the said letter / application that the defendant is making an 

attempt to get the mark XYDI registered, which is identical and deceptively 

similar   to   the   plaintiff's   trademark   ZADY.   The   defendant   was   warned, 

however, it is appearing from its letter (now Ex. PW­1/2; in fact reply to legal 

notice of plaintiff), reflecting that the defendant is using mark XYDI, which 

has similarity with the plaintiff trademark. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">               The   plaintiff's   product   bearing   trademark   ZADY   are   sold   out 

throughout   India,   including   Kerela,  therefore,  defendant   is  well   aware  and 

knows about the plaintiff's trademark ZADY, otherwise being in the field of 

pharmaceutical   business,   the   defendant   must   have   been   knowing   the 

plaintiff's trademark ZADY. The plaintiff's product is sold in a carton bearing 

trademark ZADY (more particularly demonstrated in carton, now Ex. PW­1/6, 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">TM No. 132/2011                                                            Page 5 of 15</span>

ZADY­500,   Azithromycin   Tablets   IP,  containing   strips   of   three   tablets)   and 

defendant's product Amoxicillin Trihydrate and Dicloxacillin Sodium Capsules 

under the mark XYDI are sold (its carton is now Ex. PW­1/9, containing strips 

of ten capsules). That is why, the present suit. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">
Defendant's Case ­ 
2.1             The   summons   were   sent   to   all   the   defendants,   however, 

defendant no. 1 files its written statement. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">
2.2             The defendant denies all the allegations of plaint, which have 

been narrated in paragraph 1, above, and the defendant no. 1 requests to 

dismiss the suit. The defendant no. 1 further pleads that product ZADY and 

XYDI are entirely different and is used in two different fields. The defendant's 

product are sold under prescription by doctor, those who are learned man in 

the field. There is no scope for the defendant by any means to substitute its 

product   for   the   product   of   plaintiff.   Therefore,   plaintiff's   plea   of   causing 

confusion in the mind of general public or misleading them is absurd and 

incorrect. Product XYDI of defendant is published in the journal No. 1443 

dated   01.07.2010,   the   appropriate   remedy   with   the   plaintiff   was   to   apply 

before   the   Registrar   of   Trademarks   within   four   months   from   the   date   of 

knowledge   or   publication.   The   defendant   has   exercised   all   due   care   and 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">TM No. 132/2011                                                                  Page 6 of 15</span>

caution while accepting brand name XYDI for its product. The defendant is 

dealing   in   pharmaceutical   products   and   is   also   dealing   a   product   with 

trademark XYDI and has applied for the same in Class­05 with the Registrar 

Trademark under the Trademark Act in the year 2009. The product XYDI is a 

combination   of   AMOXICILLIN   250Mg   with   DICLOXACILLIN   250Mg   and   is 

primarily   used   as   an   antibiotic.   Moreover,   defendant   company   sells   its 

product in State of Kerela. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">
2.3              The phonetic pronunciation of ZADY and XYDI is distinctively 

different.   The   defendant   also   denies   that   plaintiff's   trademark   ZADY   is 

identified  with  plaintiff's  company that  mere  mention   of  same   or  its  sheer 

glance, flashes up the name of plaintiff company. There are imaginary and 

tall   claims,   by   way   of   which   the   present   suit   has   been   filed.   There   is   no 

possibility   or   likelihood   that   a   customer   intending   to   buy   product   having 

trademark ZADY might end up buying XYDI. The defendant company is well 

established in the market for its name and fame, hence, there is no necessity 

or  need   of  any  kind  for   defendant  to   make   it  big   by  taking  pillion   on   the 

goodwill and reputation of trademark ZADY. The plaint is without cause of 

action and it is liable to be dismissed.

DGM (Legal) &amp; Company Secretary Shri Sanjeev Kumar Singh / PW­1, he 

tendered four documents (Ex. PW­1/1 to Ex. PW­1/4) and then evidence was 

closed,   none   from   the   defendant   came   forward   to   cross   examine   him.

led   his   additional   evidence   on   08.09.2014,   and   during   this   phase   of   his 

statement,   he   further   tendered   documents   (Ex.   PW­1/5   to   Ex.   PW­1/9). 

Again, additional evidence was closed. There was no evidence on behalf of 

defendant, although opportunity was given, inclusive of last opportunity but 

for want of appearance and evidence, it was closed.

Final Hearing ­ 
5.1              At the juncture of final hearing, Counsel Shri Hemant Daswani, 

Advocate for the plaintiff argued. The contentions are coupled with reasons 

given in various case laws but in nutshell, the plaintiff's case rest on three 

aspects   that   it   is   registered   proprietor   of   trademark   ZADY,   in   the   field   of 

pharmaceuticals;   secondly,   the   defendant   is   also   using   mark   XYDI   for   its 

medical preparations, however, it is deceptively similar to plaintiff's trademark 

if   not   exactly   identical;   thirdly,   there   is   similar   appearance   and   phonetic 

sound, while pronouncing defendant's mark, which creates confusion to the 

consumer, as if, they are buying plaintiff's goods. The medicines are also 

sold at chemist and pharmacy shops, and because of similar pronunciation, 

the defendant's goods are expected to be passed off as of plaintiff. In order

to avoid repetitions, the reasons derived by Ld. Counsel for plaintiff, the case 

law is as follows :­ 
</p><p id="p_21">   1. <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_1">Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. AIR 2001 SC 
      1952   -   the   appellant   had   brand   name   falcigo   for   its   drugs   and 
      respondent sold medicines under the brand name falcitab, similar to 
      appellant's, while discussing <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_2">Section 17B</a> of the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_3">Cosmetics 
      Act</a>, 1940, the authorities were required to consider nature of mark, 
      degree of resemblance between mark, nature of goods in respect of 
      trademark used and performance goods of rival traders. Further, held 
      that   "confusion   and   mistake   is   likely,   even   for   prescription   drugs 
      prescribed   by   doctors   and   dispensed   by   pharmacists,   where   these 
      similar goods are marketed under marks which look alike and sound 
      alike".   .....   "Physicians   are   not   immune   from   confusion   or   mistake. 
      Further   more   it   is   common   knowledge   that   many   prescriptions   are 
      telephoned   to   the   pharmacists   and   others   are   handwritten,   and 
      frequency   handwriting   is   not   unmistakably   legible.   These   facts 
      enhance   the   chances   of   confusion  or   mistake   by  the   pharmacists  in 
      filing   the   prescription   if   the   marks   appear   too   much   alike   when 
      handwritten or sound too muck alike when pronounced". ......... The 
      products   of   the   parties   are   medicinal   and   applicant's   product   is 
      contraindicated   for   the   disease   for   which   opposer's   product   is 
      indicated.   It   is   apparent   that   confusion   or   mistake   in   filing   a 
      prescription for either product could produce harmful effects. Under 
      such   circumstances,   it   is   necessary   for   obvious   reasons,   to   avoid 
      confusion or mistake in the dispensing of the pharmaceuticals.

      that   there   was   no   resemblance   or   similarity   between   the   two   trade 
      marks in question i.e. SECEF and CECEF, marks used by the parties 
      have been shown in English language and the defendant has used the

</p><p id="p_23">          the parties have been shown in English language and the defendant 
          has used the first letter "C" in place of "S" of the plaintiff. The rest of 
          the mark is the same as that of the plaintiff. It cannot be denied that if 
          both the marks are written and read in other languages, then both the 
          marks are identical. Therefore, the contention of the defendant cannot 
          be accepted that the two trade marks are dissimilar.

         reasonable probability of confusion between the words both from the 
         visual and phonetic point of view. It is not a matter for microscopic

         view of a customer walking into a shop.

6.2              Both the issues are taken together, since it involves common 

discussion.   The   onus   to   prove   both   the   issues   lies   on   plaintiff.   As   per 

Certificate of Registration of trademark (Ex. PW­1/5), read with application 

form   [Ex.   PW­1/7   (colly.),   of   plaintiff],   the   registered   mark   is   ZADY­word, 

which also find mention in the Certificate and as per this application form, the 

date   of   application   is   16.07.2003.   The   application   [Ex.   PW­1/7   (colly.),   of 

defendant]   is   for   trademark   XYDI­word,   vide   application   dated   06.07.2009 

with user detail 28.01.2009. The reply dated 11.05.2010 (Ex. PW­1/2), is in 

respect of response to plaintiff's notice dated 20.04.2010 (copy of legal notice 

has not been filed) but defendant has denied the allegations of legal notice. 

By taking stock all these relevant facts, for the following reasons, it is held 

that plaintiff could not establish both the Issues No. 1 and 2 in its favour and 

against the defendants :­
