    Detaining Authority and which were relied upon by the
    Detaining Authority.      In the grounds of detention, it was

    had left the value of dutiable goods blank in the said Pass

    he had brought goods worth Rs 20,000/- and had cleared

    Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner on the point of

    non-application of mind by the Detaining Authority. So far as




                                           
    the first ground of delay in issuing the order of detention is
    concerned, it is necessary to see the chronology of events.
    The Customs Officer had seized the goods at the Airport on




                                          
    02/03/2011.   It is an admitted position that the said goods
    are dutiable goods.    It is also admitted that detenu was
    arrested on 03/03/2011 and prior to his arrest he had never




                                 
    been arrested, though he had travelled on 21 earlier
                      
    occasions. The detenu was released on bail on 04/03/2011.
    The statements of detenu were recorded on 03/03/2011,
                     
    23/03/2011, 24/03/2011, 25/3/2011 and 25/05/2011. In his
    first statement dated 03/03/2011, the detenu had admitted
    that he had travelled on 22 earlier occasions and that he
       


    used to take spices from India which are not prohibited to
    



    Hongkong and he used to sell spices there and bring dutiable
    goods upto the permitted amount below Rs 25,000/- and on





    the date on which his goods were seized, on that date since
    the goods were given on credit, he had brought those
    dutiable goods above Rs 25,000/-. He also admitted that he
    used to sell dutiable goods which were brought by him and





    earned profit of Rs 5000/- to rs 10,000/- per trip.                   This
    statement was not retracted by the detenu in his subsequent
    statements. Thereafter, after a lapse of about three months
    i.e. on 30/08/2011, show-cause notice was issued to the
    detenu. Reply was given to the said show-cause notice on

    after the goods were detained, samples were drawn and sent
    for valuation and examination report was received on
                      
    21/05/2011.    It is stated that only after ascertaining the
    active role of the detenu in smuggling of goods, the
    detention order was issued and, therefore, there was no
       


    delay. It is further stated in the affidavit that the propsoal for
    



    detention was sent by his office on 23/06/2011 to the
    Screening Committee and the meeting of the Screening





    Committee was held on 04/08/2011 since the office of the
    Screening Committee was shifted from Lower Parel to Worli

    was sent by the Screening Committee granting approval to





    the proposal which was received on 10/08/2011 and it was
    forwarded on 12/08/2011 to the Detaining Authority.                      It is
    further submitted that after the approval was granted by the

    forwarded to the Detaining Authority and, thereafter, the
    order of detention was passed on 25/10/2011. It is further
    stated in the reply that the Detaining Authority had passed
       


    the impugned order of detention after screening all the
    



    papers contained in the proposal and time was spent for
    better verification of the material placed before the said





    Authority in the form of proposal for detention. It is further

    statements of the detenu given voluntarily under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_24">section 108</a>
    of the Customs Act. Then it is mentioned in the affidavit that

    occasion since he had received credit he had brought these
    goods above Rs 25,000/-.        This statement had not been

    contextual facts, the Detaining Authority had failed to apply
    its mind as regards the issue of unreasonable delay in

    passing the order of detention. In our view, the ratio of these
    judgments of the Apex Court is squarely applicable to the

<p id="p_35">                  The detenu was arrested on 3/3/2011.              He was
    released on bail on 04/03/2011. In his first statement dated




                                           
    3/3/2011 which was recorded under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_29">section 108</a> of the
    Customs Act, he had admitted having brought dutiable goods
    above the limit of Rs 25,000/- on 02/03/2011. This fact was




                                    
    not retracted by him in his subsequent statements.

    background, delay caused of about 9 months has not been
    satisfactorily explained by the Detaining Authority and,
    therefore, on this ground alone the order of detention is
          


    liable to be set aside.

<p id="p_38">          There cannot be any dispute regarding the ratio laid
    down in the said judgments relied upon by the learned APP
    appearing on behalf of the State. However, as has been held




                                                     
    in   Kamarunnissa (Supra), the question of delay has to be
    answered in the facts and circumstances of each case and
    similarly while deciding the said issue whether delay is




                                          
    caused or not and whether proper explanation has been
                           
    given also would depend upon the facts and circumstances
    of each case. The Apex Court in the facts of the said case
                          
    came to the said conclusion that the delay had been
    explained satisfactorily.         Similarly in Senthamilselvi (supra),
    the Apex Court, after having                examined the explanation,
       


    came to the conclusion that the delay had been explained
    



    satisfactorily and in para 6 of the said judgment it has been
    observed as under:-

            that it is the duty of the Court to see that

            detention is not lost in mechanical routine,
            dull casualness and chill indifference, on the
            part of the authorities entrusted with their




                                     
            application.   When
                            ig       there   is     remissness,
            indifference or avoidable delay on the part of

            vulnerable. That is not the case at hand. It
            may be noted that the writ petition was filed
            on 22-12-2005, even before the order of
       


            rejection was served.         That being so the
    



            detenu cannot make grievance that the
            State had not explained the position as to





            how his representation was dealt with."

<p id="p_39">    Thus in Senthamilselvi (supra) also, on facts, the Apex Court
    came to the conclusion that the delay was explained





    satisfactorily.   In   Vinod K. Chawla (supra) also, on facts,
    explanation given was considered and same is the case in
    respect of other judgments on which the reliance is placed
    by the learned APP appearing on behalf of the State.

</p><p id="p_41">    14. The second ground on which the order of detention is
    being challenged is that there was non-application of mind

    detention.     In our view, there is much substance in the
    submission made by the learned Counsel appearing on
    behalf of the Petitioner.   In the present case, detenu was




                                          
    arrested on 03/03/2011. After his two checked-in-bags were
    opened in the presence of two independent witnesses it
    revealed that he did not make any declaration regarding




                                  
    value of the dutiable goods in his Customs Gate Pass. It is
                        
    an admitted position that the goods which were found in
    these two bags were dutiable goods and not contraband
                       
    goods or prohibited goods. The valuation of the said goods
    was made and it was found that the goods were valued at Rs
    11,82,920/-.     The penalty was also imposed for non-

    had taken spices from India and sold them in Hongkong and

<p id="p_43">    In view of this violation of Baggage Rules, additional penalty
    was imposed and the Petitioner was permitted to take away

    is abundantly clear that for the said violation of the Baggage
    Restriction Rules, for non-declaration of the goods and for
    non-payment of customs duty, the detenu could have been




                                       
    tried under the ordinary law and, there was no need to pass
                            
    the order of preventive detention and that too after a lapse
    of 9 months during which period the detenu had not come to
                           
    the adverse notice of the Customs Authorities and, therefore,
    the Detaining Authority did not consider whether this was a
    case fit for detention when, in fact, the detenu could have
        


    been dealt with under the ordinary law of the land for
     



    violation of Baggage Rules and or under <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_30">section 111</a> (l)(m) of
    the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_31">Customs Act</a>. In our view, therefore, on this ground also,
