           3.1        It is necessary to decide   whether a survey of 
           goods reported lost or damaged is to be arranged.
           3.2        Claim   exceeding   Rs.20,000/­   should   be 
           surveyed by a duly licensed surveyor.
           3.6        In   marine   insurance   unlike   other   classes   of  
           insurance,   survey   fee   is   initially   paid   by   the 
           claimant. The survey fee will be reimbursed to the 
           claimant along with the claim amount, if the claim  
           is   admissible   under   the   policy.   This   should   be 
           brought to the notice of the claimant whilst advising  
           him about appointment of surveyor.


           3.7 The dealing office shall also arrange for surveys 
           'without prejudice' on losses reported under policies  
           issued by other policy issuing offices which are not  
           under its jurisdiction. Thereafter, the dealing office 
           shall process the entire claim upto final settlement  
           keeping   the   policy   issuing   office   informed   of   all 
           developments.

<p id="p_269">
           3.10  Normally, the survey report should be finalized  
           within three weeks. The surveyor shall be instructed  
           to keep the dealing office informed of the progress of

           been contended that  he was 23 years of age

           age.   That   his   wife,   although,     is   gainfully 

           employed  and at times she has to travel in 

           connection with her job and that no one is 

           there   to   look   after   during   that   period   his 

           daughter.     That his role was limited as he 

           was   only   the   partner   of     the   claimant 

           company   and   that   his   partner   might   have
