<p id="p_1">1.     The plaintiffs have filed the present suit for permanent
injunction,    restraining    infringement   of   copyright,   passing        off,
dilution, and various other reliefs against the defendants. Along with
the said suit, the plaintiffs have filed the above said application for
seeking various interim reliefs against the two defendants namely
M/s. Kiddiland and M/s. Cybershop Marketing Pvt. Ltd. The suit along
with the said application was listed for the first time before this
Court on 8th October, 2010. On 28th October, 2010 this Court passed
an ex-parte ad interim order restraining the defendants from using
the label, which is similar to or identical with the plaintiff's label or

 packaging or offering or displaying for sale the cubes being
marketed by the defendants.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     The     defendant   No.2   thereafter,   had   filed    FAO      (OS)
No.692/2010 before the Division Bench of this Court, challenging the
order dated 28th October, 2010. The Division Bench by an order
dated 8th December, 2010 had clarified the order passed by this
Court on 28th October, 2010. The order dated 8th December, 2010
passed by the Division Bench has been reproduced here as under :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "FAO(OS) No.692/2010 and CM No.22019/2010 (Stay)
     The appellant is aggrieved by the impugned order dated
     28.10.2010 passed by the learned Single Judge on IA
     No.13750/2010 filed by the respondents/plaintiffs under
     Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
     Learned counsel for the appellant, at the inception itself,
     fairly states that it would be appropriate that the appellant
     file their written statement and reply to the stay application
     so that the interim application can be heard on the date
     already fixed before the learned Single Judge of 14.01.2011.
     Similarly, learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs
     states that they would be pressing for a larger injunction
     when the application is taken up for hearing. Learned
     counsel for the appellant, however, states that there
     appears to be some confusion arising from the wording of
     the injunction granted in terms of order dated 28.10.2010
     inasmuch as it restrains the appellant from using the label
     which is similarly to or identical with the respondents' label
     or packaging or offering or displaying for sale the cubes in
     such labels and packaging but the order also seems to
     suggest, in view of the letter annexed as Annexure A (Colly)
     starting from page 225, that there is a ban on sale of cubes.
     Learned counsel for the respondents fairly states that
     interim injunction already granted on 28.10.2010 is not for
     sale of cubes though he would press for injunction in that
     respect on the next date of hearing.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            We thus clarify that the injunction order dated
     28.10.2010 as it stands today is only in respect of label or

      packaging and all other aspects will be urged by the
     respective parties before the learned Single Judge.
     The appeal is accordingly disposed of.

claimed as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "10.    Rubik's Cube has a distinctive trade dress which
     comprises a black border/cage consisting of lines of a
     particular width along with each of the six faces of the cube
     covered with nine square stickers with rounded edges, the
     stickers consist of particular shades of six solid colors
     namely red, blue, orange, green, white and yellow. Also,
     the specific size and shape of the Rubik's Cube forms an
     integral part of the distinctive trade dress. Moreover, the
     overall impression of the Rubik's Cube including its look
     and feel is an artistic work within the meaning of <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_1">Section

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     10A. The packaging and label inside which Rubik's Cube
     is sold in India is an integral part of the trade dress of
     Rubik's Cube. Additionally, as the packaging and label are
     highly artistic, copyright vests in these under the meaning
     of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_2">Section 14</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957. The distinctive
     features of the packaging include the diagonal shape of the
     box which gives an impression that 3-dimensional triangles
     are bulging out of the front and the back of the packaging,
     the indentations on the packaging forming a grid
     corresponding to the grid on the faces of the Rubik's cube,
     the transparent nature of the packaging as well as the hook
     provided on top of the packaging. The distinctive features
     of the label include the combination of the colours red,
     blue, green, orange and yellow as well as other artistic
     features like the distinct comic font with each letter of the
     mark in a different colour and the placement of the words
     "Ages 8 to Adult" on the lower left hand corner of the
     label."

          claiming rights behind the Rubik's cube but merely claiming
          proprietary rights in the expression of that idea as there
          are a number of different ways in which a puzzle cube can
          be made and it is not necessary for the Defendant's to use
          an identical shape and size for the cube nor it is necessary
          for the Defendants to use identical colours on the stickers
          or the Identical shape of the stickers or the identical shape

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">4.         In view of the order of the Division Bench, the plaintiffs at

limited prayer.

<p id="p_4">THE CASE OF THE PLAINTIFFS AS PER THE PLAINT

</p><p id="p_5">5.         Brief facts of the case as per the plaintiffs are as under :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     i)       The   plaintiff    No.1, Seven Towns Ltd. is a company
              incorporated under the laws of England and is world
              renowned      in   connection   with   the   manufacture          and

       commercial operations of plaintiff No.2 began in 1988 with
       the establishment of a factory in Goa with all the requisite
       machineries and equipments to manufacture high quality
       toys. To cater to increase in demand, a second factory was
       set up at Ranipet, about 100 miles from Chennai, in the
       year 1999. The plaintiff No.2 is a result of the joint venture
       between the Indian tyre giant MRF and Hasbro Inc., a

        Turner International India Pvt Ltd (Cartoon Network) as well
       as from the plaintiff No.1.
</p><p id="p_9">v)     In the year 1974, a first proto type of the working cube was
       invented by Mr. Erno Rubik (a lecturer in the Department of
       Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts)
       in Budapest, Hungary. Mr. Erno Rubik named this cube as
       the "Magic Cube" and obtained a patent for the Cube in
       1975. It is a puzzle game comprising of twenty six
       individual little cubes which together make up a single and
       larger cube. Each layer of nine cubes can twist and the
       layers can overlap. Any three squares in a row, except
       diagonally, can join a new layer. In a classic Rubik's Cube
       each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, among six
       solid colors (traditionally white, red, blue, orange, green,
       and yellow) being distinctive trade dress.
</p><p id="p_10">vi)    The first mass production of this Cube started in 1975 by a
       Hungarian toy manufacturer Politechnika and by the year
       1977, the Magic Cube (as it was then called) hit the toy
       shops of Budapest, Hungary. Without any promotion or
       publicity, the Magic Cube started to make its way through
       the hands of fascinated youths into homes, playgrounds
       and schools and also drew attention of various western
       world academicians. Embezzled by the mass attention the
       Magic Cube attracted, Mr. Erno Rubik renamed the game
       puzzle after his own name from "Magic Cube" to "Rubik's
       Cube" in 1980. By the end of 1980, Rubik's Cube had
       gained a sufficient degree of popularity to        be    seen
       occasionally in the street, on trams, in cafes, each time in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                  Page 6 of 50</span>
         the hands of someone turning and twisting it, completely
        absorbed. In the year 1981, inspired by the interesting
        Rubik's Cube, a publication entitled 'You Can Do the Cube'
        was produced by Patrick Bossert (a 12 year old schoolboy
        from England) which sold 1.5 million copies.
</p><p id="p_11">vii)       In India, the Rubik's Cube was first sold in 1981 by Ideal
        Toys Corporation and Matchbox Games. However, both
        these companies do not exist anymore as on the current
        date. Plaintiff No.1 licensed the distribution of Rubik's Cube
        in India to plaintiff No.2 in August, 2007 and the licensing
        agreement subsists till date. The Rubik's Cube continues to
        sell extremely well in the country as 44,062 Rubik's Cubes
        have been sold between the period from April, 2010 to
        August, 2010 itself.
</p><p id="p_12">viii)   The distinctive trade dress of plaintiff No.1 has been
        accepted for registration as a 3D trademark in the following
        countries: Australia, Benelux, Canada, China, Denmark,
        Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary,
        Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway,
        Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain,
        Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United states of America and
        United Kingdom to name some. Copies of certificates of
        registrations in some of these countries as well as a list of
        worldwide registrations have been filed.
</p><p id="p_13">ix)     The   Rubik's    Cube's    trade   dress,      which   is   inherently
        distinctive    and   by   virtue   of   long    use,   has    become
        synonymous with the plaintiff No.1 and no other party can
        use this for its toys and puzzles without infringing upon



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                            Page 7 of 50</span>
        plaintiff No.1's established rights. The trade dress of the
       Rubik's Cube is completely distinctive of the plaintiff No.1
       and any unauthorized use of the same by any party will
       result in passing off and blurring of its distinctiveness, and
       will tarnish the image of the plaintiff No.1.
</p><p id="p_14">x)     The plaintiff No.1 has always been very vigilant about
       protecting its proprietary rights and has filed and won many
       legal proceedings around the world against those found
       infringing its marks and copyright including Rubik's Cube,
       the associated three dimensional device, its trade dress and
       the copyright subsisting in it. The plaintiff No.1 has from
       time to time investigated and prosecuted several infringing
       parties in countries such as Holland, Great Britain and USA
       and elsewhere. For example, between the years 1980 and
       1982, when the demand for the Rubik's Cube greatly
       exceeded supply, a number of pirated, low quality copies
       came into the markets which were manufactured by
       opportunistic traders from Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong.
       In order to curb such infringing activities, Ideal Toy, the
       licensed manufacturer of Rubik's Cube filed lawsuits against
       such infringers and won a number of lawsuits in Holland,
       Great Britain, the USA and other countries. The distinctive
       trade dress of the Rubik's Cube has already been upheld in
       the context of these cases. Judgments passed by the Courts
       in Paris, France upholding plaintiff No.1's rights in Rubik's
       Cube have been filed along with the plaint.
</p><p id="p_15">xi)    To identify the source, origin and sponsorship of the plaintiff
       No.1's Rubik's Cube, the plaintiff No.1 has extensively



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                     Page 8 of 50</span>
            employed, caused to be advertised, and publicized certain
           distinct trade dress elements for its Rubik's Cube. The
           plaintiff No.1's trademarks and               trade    dress are           also
           promoted via its website namely www.rubiks.com.                            This
           website of the plaintiff No.1 was launched several years ago
           to     facilitate      public   awareness      and      serves        as     a
           comprehensive guide to its Rubik's Cube. The plaintiff No.1
           regularly hosts advertising campaigns warning third parties
           about misuse of its trademarks and trade dress in Rubik's
           Cube in order to safeguard and monitor the use of its
           marks/trade         dress. A     magazine     extract depicting             the
           cautionary notice published by plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 has
           been filed along with the plaint. Apart from the publicity
           generated through the above mentioned activities for the
           trademarks/dress, the plaintiff No.1 also actively promotes
           its     Rubik's        Cube     through      various        print     media
           advertisements,            electronic       media      advertisements,
           international tours and events and by sponsoring events all
           over the world.

 manufacturing, marketing and distribution of toys and games, upon
information and belief, within the territory of India.
</p>
<p id="p_17">7.      The plaintiffs in support of their claim in respect of trade dress
submit that their product which they ostensibly sell as Rancho's
Cubes (the "infringing product) as being the plaintiff No.1's Rubik's
Cube. It is stated that the defendants' infringing product are
identical in every respect and comprises of 36 smaller cubes
comprising a larger cube; each layer of nine cubes, as in the plaintiff
No.1's product who alleged that the label on the packaging is
deceptively similar, including in terms of the colors used and the
font, which leaves no room for any distinction between the two. It is
alleged by the plaintiffs that defendants are using a deceptively
similar trade dress. As a result of such blatant copying, confusion is
certain and thus, the defendants conduct constitutes the tortuous act
of passing off. The chances of confusion are glaring as stocks of its
Rubik's Cubes and that of the plaintiffs products are available on the
same shelf and is sold in the same market and consumers are also
the same type of children, that they are bound to get misled into
thinking that there is some connection between both the parties and
they may pick the infringing product confusing it to be originating
from the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_18">8.      The plaintiffs submit that the defendants have also copied the
original artwork found on the label of the packaging, including the
distinctive combination of the colours red, blue, dark green, light
green and orange as well as other artistic features like the distinct
comic font with each letter of the mark in a different color and the
placement of the words "AGES 8 to Adult" on the label. The said
deliberate act of the defendant by copying is nothing but an attempt


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">     CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                    Page 10 of 50</span>
 to free ride on the plaintiff No.1's marks/trade dress and copyright.
The use of the trade dress elements of the plaintiff No.1's Rubik's
Cube will inevitably create confusion and deception as to the source
and origin of defendants' infringing product.
</p>
<p id="p_19">         It is submitted that defendant No.2's act of adopting without
authorization, the well known trade dress and marks reflects an
obvious intention to unfairly benefit from the goodwill and reputation
built by plaintiff No.1. Copyright subsists in the artwork of the label
found on the packaging which comprises the mark RUBIK'S CUBE in
a distinct comic font with each letter of the mark in a different color
corresponding to the different colors present on each face of Rubik's
Cube and the placement of the words "AGES 8 to Adult on the label.
The copying of the artistic features of the plaintiffs' Rubik's Cube's
label found on the packaging amounts to infringement of Copyright
under <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_5">Section 51</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957. The said adoption of
the trade dress by the defendant No.2 is not honest as both the
parties are in the same industry and packagers and shopkeepers are
also the same. The defendants must be aware of the plaintiff No.1's
reputation in the trade dress. Thus, the plaintiffs are entitled to relief
against the defendants from using the similar trade dress.

</p><p id="p_21">9.       Both    the    defendants   have   filed   their   separate    written
statements. The main defences are raised by defendant No.2. The
defendants have also restricted their arguments on the issue of
trade dress only.

 the averments made in the plaint and in the injunction application.
It is denied by the defendant No.2 that the trade dress of the
plaintiff's product is distinctive and is well recognized in India and
the same has acquired goodwill in the Indian market. It is also
denied that the Rubik's Cube owing to its superior quality and
excellence has gained any sort of exclusivity over the trade dress of
its product.
</p>
<p id="p_23">11.      It is submitted by the defendants that if the trade dress of the
plaintiffs' product itself is not distinctive and is not recognized then
issuance of any such cautionary notice in the said respect has no
relevance whatsoever. The defendants have also invested substantial
amounts of monies for advertising their own products. It is denied
that the packaging of the plaintiff's product and the defendants'
product is deceptively similar in terms of colour and font used. It is
submitted that the trade dress of the plaintiffs' product and the
defendants' product is different. The product (Rancho's Cube)
manufactured by the defendant No.2 by no stretch of imagination
can it be said that the trade dress of the defendant No.2's product is
deceptively similar to the trade dress of the plaintiffs' product.

products of the parties in the trade dress/packaging have provided

deceptively similar trade dress and/or is copying the product of the
plaintiffs which action constitutes the act of passing off as alleged by
the plaintiff. The defendant No.2 submits that the puzzle in terms of
the cubes is sold by it in the market and the consumers would not be
confused or misled while purchasing any of the two products in view
of the aforesaid distinct dissimilarities prevailing in the said two
products.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                       Page 13 of 50</span>
<p id="p_27">          It is submitted that the trade dress of the defendant No.2's
product      is   different.   Thus,   the   same   does   not    amount         to
infringement of the copyright under the provisions of Section 51 of
the Copyrights Act, 1957 as claimed by the plaintiff No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_28">14.      It is mentioned that the units sold by the defendant No.2 of its
products are approximately double the units sold by the plaintiffs of
their products. The defendant No.2 has sold approximately 80,000
units in the last 9 months. It shows that the quality of the defendant
No.2's product are far more superior to the quality of product of the
plaintiffs and the pricing of the same is also much to the advantage
of the defendant No.2 since its product is being manufactured and
sold at a price less than half of that of the plaintiffs as the price of
product of the defendant No.2 is Rs.129/- per unit as against the
price of Rs.275/- per unit of the plaintiffs' product. Therefore, the
plaintiffs do not wish that the defendants' business should continue.
The defendant No.2 manufactures its goods in India whereas the
plaintiff's product is manufactured in China and imported in India.
The plaintiffs have only used different base colours in its product and
the same cannot be said to be distinctive. Mere use of different base
colours which in any event are limited in number cannot be said to
be distinctive unless some exclusivity or distinctiveness is shown in
respect of the colours being used by the plaintiffs on their products.
</p>
<p id="p_29">15.      It is submitted that the trade dress of the plaintiffs' product is
not a well known mark and plaintiff No.1's product fails to qualify the
tests of the provisions of <a href="/doc/98765/" id="a_6">Section 11(6)</a> and <a href="/doc/899174/" id="a_7">Section 2(1)(zg)</a> of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999. It is submitted that the plaintiffs have failed
to produce any document to show that their product was widely
recognized in India.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                        Page 14 of 50</span>
<p id="p_30"> 16.      In replication, the plaintiffs have denied the contents of the
written statement and stated that all the defences raised are
baseless and misconceived. The trademark registrations in other
countries would show that the trade dress of the Rubik's Cube
enjoys      statutory       protection,   recognition   and    popularity    in    a
significant number of countries worldwide.                    The goodwill and
reputation as part of products of plaintiff No.1 in India and its
recognition and popularity has seeped into India on account of trans-
border reputation. It is denied that the plaintiffs have not produced
any document to show that the Rubik's Cube has acquired a distinct
reputation.
</p>
<p id="p_31">17.      It is reiterated that the plaintiffs do not claim any right over
any functional elements of the Rubik's Cube, i.e. the geometrical
shape of Cube. The plaintiffs simply claim rights in and to the trade
dress of the Rubik's Cube which includes the colour combination
used and cage consisting of lines of a particular width. Therefore, if
the defendant No.2 is allowed to continue to copy these essential
features in its product, it would lead to confusion and deception in
the minds of the consuming public.
</p>
<p id="p_32">18.      It is submitted that the plaintiff No.2 has been licensed to
distribute Rubik's Cube in India since August 2007. Prior to that also
the Rubik's Cube had been selling in India since 1980 through other
licensees and distributors. The plaintiffs have provided sales figure
spanning over five months and on the other hand, the defendant
No.2 has provided sales figures spanning over 9 months. Therefore,
the sale of the plaintiffs' Rubik's Cube is more than the sales of the
defendant No.2's cube. Even otherwise, it is argued by the learned
counsel for the plaintiffs that if a party who is infringing the product


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                          Page 15 of 50</span>
 and has sold more products than the genuine party, it does not
mean that the party who has appropriated rights of rightful party
has better rights.           It is further submitted that the pricing of the
defendant No.2's cube shows that their cost of production is lower on
account of cheaper and low quality raw materials used and the cube
of the defendant No.2 is of low quality. The fact that the defendant
No.2's product is cheaper than the plaintiffs' product will only result
in injury to the plaintiffs' reputation as the products are not of
similar quality. The submission made by defendant No.2 that the
plaintiffs products are manufactured in China while its products are
manufactured in India or price factor, is of no relevance.
</p>
<p id="p_33">19.      It is reiterated that the defendant No.2 has used an identical
combination of colours which directly infringes the trade dress of the
plaintiffs. There are a number of ways in which a puzzle cube can be
made. There are a number of combinations of colours that can be
used in relation to it. In fact, a cube can be expressed in ways other
than by use of colors. Instead of requiring a person to match six
different colours, a puzzle cube can require a person to match six
different numbers, shapes, fruits, vegetables etc. (for instance,
instead of having to match nine squares that have a particular colour
and combination thereto for e.g. the colour green, the cube can be
made to match nine squares that have a particular fruit, for e.g. a
banana or a geometrical shape, for e.g. a triangle). It is stated that
the use of an identical combination of colours by defendant No.2
shows its bad faith and its malafide intention to free ride on the
goodwill      created       by   the   plaintiffs   in   the   Rubik's    Cube.      The
combination of colours used by the plaintiffs in its product Rubik's
Cube has become distinctive of the plaintiffs cubes.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                                Page 16 of 50</span>
<p id="p_34">       It is denied in the replication that the trade dress of the
plaintiffs' Rubik's Cube is not a well known mark and fails to qualify
the tests of the provisions of <a href="/doc/98765/" id="a_8">Section 11</a> (6) and <a href="/doc/899174/" id="a_9">Section 2(1)(zg)</a> of
the Trade Marks Act, 1999. In this regard, the contents of paragraph
30 of the plaint are reiterated. It is submitted that the fact that the
defendant No.2 has used the identical colour combination itself
shows malafide intention. A mere combination of colours has been
recognized as a valid trade dress by various courts in India. If a
combination of 6 different colours is used and this combination
becomes distinctive of the product on which it is used and becomes
an indicator of source, then no other person should be allowed to
use the same combination of colours to try to pass off its goods as
those of another and subsequently free ride on the goodwill of
another. It is denied that the plaintiffs have only sold goods outside
India and it is submitted that the plaintiffs' Rubik's Cube has in fact
being sold in India since 1980. It is denied that the plaintiffs have
failed to produce any evidence regarding their goodwill in India and
in this regard, the plaintiffs' lay great emphasis and reliance on the
documentation filed along with the plaint. It is denied that the
number of products sold by the defendant No.2 is higher than that
sold by the plaintiffs. While the plaintiffs have provided a sales figure
for 5 months, the defendant No.2 has submitted sales figures for 9
months. This is a possible attempt to mislead the quote into
believing that it is selling more than the plaintiffs. In principle, the
sale of the plaintiffs' Rubik's Cube is higher than the sales of the
defendant No.2's product.     It is further submitted that the plaintiff
No.1 does enjoy trans-border reputation and in this regard, the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">   CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                     Page 17 of 50</span>
 contents of paragraph 30 of the plaint as well as the documentation
filed along with the plaint have been reiterated.
</p>
<p id="p_35">20.      It is submitted by the plaintiffs that the copyright subsists in
the highly distinct label found on the packaging of Rubik's Cube
which is original and artistic in nature which comprises of artistic
features like the placement of the mark in a distinct comic font with
each letter of the mark in a different color corresponding to the
different colors present on each face of Rubik's Cube and the
placement of the words "AGES 8 to Adult". The trade dress of the
Rubik's Cube qualifies as an arbitrary trade dress and merits the
highest degree of protection under Trademarks Law. The defendants
are using an identical trade dress on identical goods and this
completely attacks the common law rights of the plaintiff No.1. Since
the trade dress used by the plaintiff No.1 and the defendants are
identical and their products are also identical, there is apparent harm
to the original trade dress proprietor namely the plaintiff No.1. By
copying the trade dress, the defendants are trying to create an
impression of association with the plaintiff No.1. The use of an
identical     trade     dress   in   relation   to   identical   services    is    a
misrepresentation in the course of trade to customers that the goods
of the defendants are that of the plaintiff No.1 or are connected with
the plaintiffs. Such an act on part of the defendants amounts to
passing off and is completely unlawful. Such unlawful act of
continuing misrepresentation also amounts to unfair competition as
it creates a likelihood of confusion, mistake and deception as to the
source of the cubes and creates a mistaken association between the
plaintiffs and the defendants. The fact that some retailers refer to
Rancho's Cubes as Rubik's Cubes and that some of the invoices for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                          Page 18 of 50</span>
 the sale of Ranchos Cubes have "R Cube" printed on them which
shows prima facie evidence of downright confusion in the minds of
the retailers.
</p>
<p id="p_36">21.      It is stated in the plaint that if the defendants are allowed to
use the said trade dress in this manner it will completely dilute the
brand equity of the plaintiffs and tarnish the high reputation they
command amongst their customers. It is submitted the trade dress
of the plaintiff No.1 is distinctive and the intentional and subsequent
use by the defendants dilutes this distinctiveness. Due to its
worldwide, long and continuous use, the plaintiff No.1's trade/brand
name RUBIK, the 3 dimensional trademark and trade dress have all
acquired the status of a well known trademarks under <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_10">Section 2</a>

          Supreme Court of New South Wales. In that case,
          the plaintiffs were selling lemon squash under the
          name 'Sole' in greenish-yellow cans with a medallion
          type label. The defendants launched a lemon squash
          called 'Pub Squash' and the label was of medallion
          type bearing the words 'Pub Squash' on it. The cans
          were of the same size and shape and colour as those
          of the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought the proceedings
          on the ground of passing off, unfair trade practice
          etc. The same was dismissed. It was held that the
          defendants had sufficiently differentiated their
          product by their 'name'. On appeal to the Privy

          advertised description of a product might indeed lead
          to stifling of competition. It was held:

          words, that he has succeeded by such methods in

                from the classic case of the defendant selling his
                goods as and for those of the plaintiff to cover other
                kinds ofdeception, e.g that the defendant's goods are

well settled proposition that similarity in trade dress (i.e. packaging
and labelling) is to be adjudged on the overall look and not individual
elements. It is submitted that the overall look of the packaging and
labelling used by the plaintiffs and defendant No.2 are entirely

<p id="p_51">          It is also argued by the counsel for the defendants that by
virtue of <a href="/doc/991805/" id="a_15">Section 15(2)</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957, copyright in any
unregistered design capable of being registered ceases to exist after
any article to which the design has been applied has been
reproduced more than fifty times by an industrial process by the
owner of the copyright or, with his license, by any other person. The
same was reiterated by this Court in <a href="/doc/1210059/" id="a_16">Microfibres Inc. v. Girdhar
and Co</a>., (2006) 128 DLT 238. Thus, the purported copyright
infringement claimed by the plaintiff in its 'artistic work' is
misplaced.
</p>
<p id="p_52">24.      It is also argued that there could not be monopoly/exclusivity
to be claimed on a single colour, as the plaintiffs' claim over the
exclusive right to use the colours Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White
and Orange, as well as the Black cage/grid is misplaced. Firstly, the
colours sought to be monopolized are primary colours and not
distinct colours which the plaintiffs have created using any creative
or artistic input. Allowing the plaintiffs to do so would deprive any
other person from using all 7 primary colours. Secondly, it has been
held on multiple occasions that no monopoly can be granted over a
particular      colour      and      protection    may        be   afforded     to     a
specific/particular combination of colours or a colour when combined
with definite arbitrary symbol or design.
</p>
<p id="p_53">25.      Reliance     is    placed    on   the    case   of    <a href="/doc/664493/" id="a_17">Colgate-Palmolive
Company Limited &amp; Anr. v. Patel and Anr</a>, 2005 (31) PTC 583
wherein this Court extensively dealt with the issue of monopoly in
colours. At Para 42 of the said judgment, this Court held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "42. The above texts and the colour diagrammes also
       indicate that the exclusivity and monopoly of a colour and a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                              Page 22 of 50</span>
        colour scheme is not favoured. Not only in the red colour
       one of the seven primary colours but it along with white and
       black colours has in fact been described as one of the three
       basic clours in nature. Furthermore, even though the colour
       combination of the registered mark indicates red and white,
       in essence the carton of the plaintiffs for which registration
       has been granted is entirely in red except the logo in the
       form of the word 'COLGATE' and other small ancillary words
       such as the price, quality etc which are printed in white. It is
       this placement of small print in white containing the word
       'COLGATE' in a small area placed on the back ground in red
       which contributes to the commercial impact of the plaintiffs
       carton in the market place and indeed gives exclusivity and
       distinctiveness to the plaintiffs mark. Thus, the mark
       COLGATE in white on a red background highlights the
       plaintiffs product and gives a distinct identity to the
       combination, and such a combine is certainly entitled to
       protection from not only passing off but infringement too.</blockquote>
<p id="p_54">       However, I am also of the view that the red and white
       colour combination per se without the word/mark
       'COLGATE'      is   not    entitled   to    protection    from
       infringement."                   (Emphasis supplied)

       It is submitted by her that the combination of colours used by
the defendant No.2 on its product Rancho Cube are not identical to
those combination of colours used by the plaintiffs on its Rubik's
Cube. Thus, the plaintiffs' claim for the exclusive right to use the
colours Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, White and Black is
untenable.
</p>
<p id="p_55">26.      It is canvassed by her that the puzzle cube is a toy/game and
is essentially a memory and problem-solving exercise which requires
a person to twist the parts of the cube with a view to the align the 6
different colours exclusively on each side of the cube. The primary
colours of Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White and Black provide the
ultimate contrast of hue and the greatest luminosity, thereby being
optimal for the purposes of the present puzzle cube, promoting


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                    Page 23 of 50</span>
 memory retention. The use of the colour Black for the cage of the
puzzle cube and acting as the base of each square face/tile of the
cube provides the greatest contrast to whatever other colour is put
before it, more specifically, the primary colours of Red, Blue, Green,
White, Yellow and Orange. Thus, the said colours being a functional
element of the puzzle cube, cannot be monopolized by virtue of a
trade dress.
</p>
<p id="p_56">27.      It is also argued that the customers of the impugned products
are not moved to buy by source. The defendants have referred the
case of Hodgkinson &amp; Corby Limited (supra) wherein it was held
as under:-

             no manifest badge of trade origin such as a trade mark
             becomes hard. This is so in the case of descriptive or
             semi-descriptive words such as "camel hair." It is
             perhaps even more so where one is concerned simply
             with the appearance of the article with no self-evident

             to buy the article because of what it is, not in reliance
             on any belief of any particular trade origin. This is so
             whether they buy it for its eye-appeal (e.g glass dogs)

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "All of these - i.e cases where a secondary meaning has

       public mind with the first comer as manufacturer or

       exactly, that the public will believe his goods to have
       come from the first, and will buy, in part, at least,
       because of that deception. Therefore it is apparent that
       it is an absolute condition to any relief whatever that
       the plaintiff in such cases show that the appearance of

       particular person -- the plaintiff may not be individually

             when the plaintiff is complaining, in a passing off

<p id="p_57">28.      It is alleged by the counsel that the impugned puzzle cube is
sold under the name "Rubik Cube" by the plaintiffs and "Rancho
Cube" by the defendant No.2 was originally developed by Mr. Erno
Rubik under the name "Magic Cube" and obtained a patent for the
Cube in 1975. The patent in the said 'Magic Cube' (later re-named as
'Rubik's Cube' by Ideal Toy Corporation in 1980) has indisputably
expired. Thus, the said 3x3x3 puzzle cube with its shape, size, form
and configuration is in public domain. However, the very fact that
multiple other brands successfully sold the said puzzle cube, under a
variety of different names, shows that the average consumer is not
moved to buy by source for the impugned puzzle cube [as laid down
in Hodgkinson's case, (supra)].
</p>
<p id="p_58">         While admittedly the impugned puzzle cube is popularly known
as Rubik's Cube', however, the same is not a necessary reference to
the plaintiffs' product, but a generic reference to the 3x3x3 Puzzle
Cube which the parties both manufacture and sell, along with
various other manufacturers and sellers in the market. A similar
phenomenon is experienced while buying packaged bottled water,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                  Page 26 of 50</span>
 which is popularly known as 'Bisleri', as being the first name in the
field. However, 'Bisleri', over the time has become merely the
generic name used by customers as a substitute for 'packaged
drinking water', which is also sold by a variety of other brands such
as Aquafina, Kinley, Himalaya, Bailleys. There is no 'confusion as to
source even if a customer is given 'Aquafina' or 'Kinley' or any other
packaged drinking water. Another such example would be the word
'Xerox' having per se become synonymous with the photocopying
and photocopying machines.
</p>
<p id="p_59">         It is submitted that in the present case, the defendant No.2
has a distinct packaging on its puzzle cube, sells the same with the
commercial/market name 'Rancho Cube', as opposed to 'Rubik's
Cube', and the same are sold at different rates. The success of the
defendant No.2's cube is solely because it is a product of superior
quality, similar functionality at a cheaper price, and the defendant
No.2 is in no way 'passing off its puzzle cube as being of the
plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_60">29.      It is argued by Mr.Pritesh Kapur, learned counsel for the
plaintiffs that by virtue of user of over 40 years prior to filing of the
present suit as well as sale of over 350 million cubes until filing of
the suit, the plaintiffs has over the years acquired immense
reputation and goodwill in its trade dress and get up. In case of
acquired distinctiveness of trade dress by virtue of long and
extensive user, a deceptive imitation or even a close resemblance is
likely to cause confusion/association in the minds of consumers - in
this case parents of school going kids or school going kids. The trade
dress of the plaintiffs' Rubik's cube has been recognized as being
distinctive and as being associated in the minds of the public with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                  Page 27 of 50</span>
 the plaintiffs, by courts in various jurisdictions, including in the
United States. In the plaintiff's own case (predecessor-in-interest),
titled Ideal Toy Corp. v. Plawner Toy Mfg. Corp. 685 F.2d 78
(1982) the United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, accepted
that the trade dress of the plaintiffs' Rubik's Cube {described in para
34 therein} had, by virtue of user {at that time only a couple of
years}, acquired distinctiveness and "served no purpose other than
identification" of the source. It was further held that "although the
fact of copying itself is persuasive evidence of secondary meaning",
the facts as established, including sales of over 5 million cubes,
showed that the trade dress had acquired secondary meaning and
that the public associated the appearance of the cube with the
plaintiffs only.
</p>
<p id="p_61">       Mr.Kapur submits that there are many other 3-D cubic puzzles
of the same kind in the market which have a completely different
trade dress and use different color combinations/stickers. In the
present cube also, if the defendant No.2 wishes to have the trade
dress in that manner, the plaintiffs may not be having any objection
to the combinations of various colours/ stickers/grid that could have
been depicted on the faces of the cube, but the defendants have
deliberately chosen a get up which is similar or closely resembles to
that of the plaintiffs. As held by the Supreme Court an injunction
must necessarily follow "if it prima facie appears that the adoption of
the mark was itself dishonest". It was again reiterated in <a href="/doc/1335881/" id="a_18">Heinz
Italia v. Dabur India Ltd</a>., (2007) 6 SCC 1 that "if it can be prima
facie shown that there was a dishonest intention on the part of the
defendant in passing off goods, an injunction should ordinarily
follow."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">    CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                   Page 28 of 50</span>
<p id="p_62"> 30.      He argued that the overall look and trade dress of the Rubik's
cube has become associated with the plaintiff by user of over 40
years prior to filing of the present suit as well as sale of over 350
million cubes as at the time of filing of the suit. Thus, the plaintiffs
have over the years acquired immense reputation and goodwill in its
trade dress and get up.
</p>
<p id="p_63">         He submits that it is thus clear that a deliberate attempt by
the defendants to ensure that their trade dress closely resembles the
trade dress of the plaintiffs, when there was absolutely no necessity
for doing so, shows dishonest adoption which is evidently calculated
to deceive and convey to the consumer that the goods emanate from
the plaintiffs or that there is some sort of an association with the
plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_64">31.      After passing the order by the Division Bench, the plaintiffs
have restricted their claim only with regard to trade dress on the
basis of alleged rights acquired under the law of passing off and
infringement of copyright. As far as the rights claimed under the
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_19">Copyright Act</a>, I am of the view that the plaintiffs have to prove the
same at the time of trial in view of defence raised by the defendants.
However, at this stage, I am inclined to decide the injunction
application on the basis of distinct rights claimed under the law of
passing off which do not depend upon the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_20">Design Act</a> and Copyright
law and is thus available.
</p>
<p id="p_65">32.      Even the Full Bench, in its majority ruling in <a href="/doc/76636976/" id="a_21">Microlube India
Ltd. v. Rakesh Kumar Trading</a> as Saurabh (2013) 198 PTC 120
declared that regardless of subsistence of design right or its
exhaustion, a passing off action can lie, in given cases.

<p id="p_66"> 33.      In the light of above referred law and facts and circumstances
of the present case, it is to be decided as to whether the defendants
are passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs or not.
</p>
<p id="p_67">         The test of confusion and deception in order to prove the case
of passing off has been very well discussed in the case of
Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhat Shah and Another, reported
in (2002) 3 SCC 65, wherein the Supreme Court while considering a
plea of passing off and grant of ad interim injunction held in no
uncertain terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his
services under a trading name or style which, with the passage of
time, may acquire a reputation or goodwill and may become a
property to be protected by the Courts. It was held that a competitor
initiating sale of goods or services in the same name or by imitating
that name causes injury to the business of one who has the property
in that name. It was held that honesty and fair play are and ought to
be the basic policy in the world of business and when a person
adopts or intends to adopt a name which already belongs to
someone else, it results in confusion and has the propensity of
diverting the customers and clients of someone else to himself and
thereby resulting in injury.
</p>
<p id="p_68">         It was also held that the principles which apply to trademark
are applicable to trade name also. Para 10 of the aforesaid judgment
reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      "The law does not permit any one to carry on his
      business in such a way as would persuade the customers
      or clients in believing that his goods or services
      belonging to someone else are his or are associated
      therewith. It does not matter whether the latter person
      does so fraudulently or otherwise. The reasons are two.
      Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                   Page 30 of 50</span>
       basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when a
      person adopts or intends to adopt a name in connection
      with his business or services which already belongs to
      someone else it results in confusion and has propensity
      of diverting the customers and clients of someone else to
      himself and thereby resulting in injury."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">         In this case, it was further observed that:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      "Where there is probability of confusion in business, an
      injunction will be granted even though the defendants
      adopted the name innocently."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">34.      In passing off, undoubtedly trade dress and get up of the
packaging, presentation of the product through label, etc constitute
essential components of the goodwill and reputation of a commercial
enterprise. The case of William Grant &amp; Sons Ltd v McDowell &amp;
Co Ltd (1994) 55 DLT 80 also supports such a proposition. Yet, for
seeking even prima facie protection in the nature of interim
injunction there should be material disclosing that the general public
associates the shape in question (which is asserted by the plaintiff as
their distinctive mark or get up) only with the plaintiffs. Whilst in the
case of trade dress in the form of label or mark, distinctiveness is
easily discernable in the case of shape based trade dress, the
plaintiffs have to necessarily show that the get up of the product or
article    has    an    integral   association   only   with   it.   Unless      this
requirement is pleaded and established, (and for interim injunction
purposes, at least prima facie) every product with a commonplace
shape would "ride" on the reputation of an exclusive trademark,
based on a distinctive name, label or color combination of the
packaging or label, etc. In this case, the distinctiveness of the shape
of the product asserted to be unique or solely associated with the
plaintiffs has not been so pleaded and established.

discussing the similar issue, it was observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "....I agree that the get-up of the plaintiffs' bags was of such
       a simple and elementary character that it was perhaps the
       cheapest form possible, and any differentiation might
       possibly have involved some expense, but differentiation
       within reasonable and economical limits was undoubtedly
       possible and was omitted because the defendants said they
       were entitled to take, and certainly meant to take, and did
       take, the design as it stood.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">                However, they urge that they put their name on the
       labels stuck on the bags, and so differentiated their goods
       from those of the plaintiffs by the most direct and conclusive
       of all methods. In fact, the attachment of their name to the
       plaintiffs' design or get-up amounted, in the circumstances
       of this case, to a deliberate appropriation of that get-up as
       their own. The bags of the plaintiffs had been unnamed.
       They were sold on their appearance or get-up alone, so
       when the name of the defendants was put on them, with an
       intimation that the design, by which the public were
       accustomed to identify them, was their property and an
       indication of their goods, customers would naturally suppose
       that, in buying them, they were getting the same goods as
       they had previously bought in the unnamed bags. Instead of
       differentiating their goods from those of the plaintiffs the
       name of the bags had the effect of making the customers
       believe that they were the same people as the plaintiffs."

  Blackburn observed in R. Johnston &amp; Co. v. Archibald Orr
 Ewing &amp; Co. (1882) 7 App.Cas. 219, 229:
</p><p id="p_75">    "If the plaintiffs had proved that purchasers had actually
    been deceived by the use of the mark B and that the
    defendants after being told of this had persisted in using
    this mark B, the plaintiffs would surely have been entitled
    to an injunction to prevent the continued use of B; and it
    could be no answer that the purchasers, so deceived,
    were incautious; the loss to the plaintiffs of the custom of
    an incautious purchaser is as great a damage as the loss
    of that of a cautious one."

 for instance, British Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd. v.
 Armstrong Patents Co. Ltd. [1986] A.C. 377 and In re Coca
 Cola Co. [1986] 1 W.L.R. 693 have stressed the suspicion
 with which this House regards any attempt to extend or
 perpetuate a monopoly and it is suggested again that,
 because it is not easy in the circumstances of this market
 effectively to distinguish the appellants' products for the
 respondents' except at          considerable   expense,    the
 respondents are achieving, in effect, a perpetual monopoly
 in the sale of lemon juice in lemon-shaped squeeze packs. I
 do not accept at all that this is so, but in any event the
 principle that no man is entitled to steal another's trade by
 deceit is one of at least equal importance. The facts as
 found here establish that, unless the injunction is continued,
 that is what the appellants will be doing and it is not
 necessary for them to do so in order to establish their own
 competing business for there is nothing in the nature of the
 product sold which inherently requires it to be sold in the
 particular format which the appellants have chosen to
 adopt. I would dismiss the appeal.

<p id="p_79">  .........(2) Monopoly assumption invalidates evidence. My
 Lords, if I had been asked to express my views on this
 matter without the aid of able argument and copious citation
 of authority but guided by common sense, I should have
 stated the following propositions:
</p><p id="p_80">    (1) Where a trader has established a reputation for his
    goods in the market and where those goods are identified
    by a particular get-up which is peculiar to him, the public
    are likely to be motivated by his de facto monopoly in
    get-up to purchase the goods.
</p><p id="p_81">    (2) If another trader seeks to imitate the get-up which
    the first trader uses, a successful passing-off action at the
    instance of the latter will necessarily recognise his de
    facto monopoly in that get-up.
</p><p id="p_82">    (3) Where trader A enters the market to compete with
    trader B whose goods have acquired a reputation and are
    identified by a particular get-up it will be a question of
    degree to what extent trader A must differentiate his get-
    up from that of trader B in order to avoid deception. If B's
    goods have been in the market for a relatively short time
    with a get-up which is not particularly distinctive, the
    steps required to differentiate may not be very
    substantial. If, on the other hand, those goods have been
    in the market for a long time with a particularly distinctive
    get-up then A, seeking to market his goods with a similar
    get-up, will require to take far more drastic steps to
    inform the public that his goods are not those of B, since
    the public, having long become used to such a get-up as
    identifying the goods of B, are likely to be less mindful of
    differences in detail.
</p><p id="p_83">    (4) If the monopoly assumption proposition is correct it
    could follow that the more commanding a position a
    trader had established in the market by reason of the
    reputation of his goods and the distinctive character of
    their get-up, the more difficult would it be for him to
    establish deception by an incoming trader with a similar
    get-up. Surely an anomalous result.

 recognising that the shape and configuration of the article
 could be protected against deception.

<p id="p_85">        In my view these two cases are merely examples of the
       general principle that no man may sell his goods under the
       pretence that they are the goods of another. This principle
       applies as well to the goods themselves as to their get-up.
       "A" markets a ratchet screwdriver with a distinctively
       shaped handle. The screwdriver has acquired a reputation
       for reliability and utility and is generally recognised by the
       public as being the product of "A" because of its handle. "A"
       would be entitled to protection against "B" if the latter
       sought to market a ratchet screwdriver with a similarly
       shaped handle without taking sufficient steps to see that the
       public were not misled into thinking that his product was
       that of "A". It is important to remember that such protection
       does not confer on "A" a monopoly in the sale of ratchet
       screwdrivers nor even in the sale of such screwdrivers with
       similarly distinctive handles if other appropriate means can
       be found of distinguishing the two products. Once again it
       will be a question of fact whether the distinguishing features
       are sufficient to avoid deception."

copyright has been made out or not, still the passing off action
would lie if a valid case is made out. In the facts and material placed
on record, it appears to the Court that the passing off action would
lie.
</p><p id="p_99">46.       While overruling the decision of <a href="/doc/44410582/" id="a_31">S.M.Dyechem v. Cadbury
India Ltd</a>.         reported in (2000) 5 SCC 574 in the case of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_32">Cadila
Healthcare Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals              Ltd</a>. reported in
(2001) 5 SCC 783, the principles laid down in Dyechem case
(supra) that the prominence must be given to the dis-similarities,
the Supreme Court in Cadila case (supra) after discussing the law
laid down by the Supreme Court for the last years and the Supreme
Court had come to the conclusion that while comparing the two
products, it is essential that prominence should be given to
similarities rather, dis-similarities. In Dyechem case (supra) the
similar view was taken as in Kelloggs case. Thus in a way the view
taken in Kelloggs case (supra) and Dyechem case (supra) was not
approved in the subsequent judgment i.e. Cadila case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_100">47.       The arguments of the defendants are that no exclusivity can
be claimed in basic colors or the color black which forms the
border/cage. The said submissions have no force as the plaintiffs are
not seeking protection in any single feature but in the combination of
all these features which constitutes the get up of a product namely
the combination of shape/size/color-combination/black border of the
squares etc.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">       CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                  Page 42 of 50</span>
</p><p id="p_101"> 48.      There is also no force in the submission with regard to black
grid not being distinctive. The main question being considered was
whether the trade dress is inherently distinctive. In order to compare
the two products with regard to trade dress, the overall look and
appearance of the products and general "impression &amp; idea" left in
the mind by the consumer is to be kept in the mind.
</p>
<p id="p_102">49.      The second submissions of the defendants have also no force
when it is argued that by affixing their own label on the trade-dress
as the defendants have taken steps to distinguish the goods. In
Reckitt &amp; Colman v. Borden, (1990) R.P.C. 341 the House of
Lords, while elaborating upon the fundamental principle that "no
man may sell his goods under the pretence that they are the goods
of another", held that "where a particular get-up of goods has been
for a long time, for many years, on the market so as to become
identified in course of time with the plaintiff's goods . . . in such a
situation the label plays only an ancilliary part in the get-up."
</p>
<p id="p_103">         It has been accepted by the House of Lords that if the
defendant attaches his own label to the prior user's trade dress then
in such event far from serving to distinguish the goods, the label
would actually tantamount to "..a deliberate appropriation of that get
up as their own". In other words, merely using their own label on the
plaintiffs' trade dress not only causes deception but also has the
consequence of diluting the plaintiffs' goodwill in the trade dress.
</p>
<p id="p_104">50.      In support of her submission learned Senior counsel appearing
on behalf of the defendants seeks to rely upon the judgment in
Kellogg and the dicta of Lord Halsbury in Schweppes [1905 (22)
RPC 601] to the effect that a person who does not treat the label
fairly by giving it enough attention, cannot be said to have been


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                   Page 43 of 50</span>
 deceived. As a matter of fact the judgment rendered in Kelloggs
matter is decided inter-alia on the text laid down in Schweppes
case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_105">51.      The above observations of Lord Halsbury [relied upon in
Kelloggs] were specifically held by the House of Lords in Reckit &amp;
Colman to have been made in the peculiar facts of that case and
not representing any principle of law and has been distinguished.
The view taken in Kelloggs' case was retreated in the case of
Dyechem and incidentally the author of both the judgments is the
same Judge but significantly, while overruling the judgement in
Dyechem, the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_33">Cadila Health Care Ltd. v.
Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>., (2001) 5 SCC 73 as specifically held
in relation to the above observations of Lord Halsbury that "these
observations appear to us to be contrary to the decision of this Court
in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta (reported in AIR
1963 SCC 449)."
</p>
<p id="p_106">52.      Furthermore, it has also been held by this Court in <a href="/doc/767356/" id="a_34">N. Ranga
Rao v. Anil Garg</a>, 2006 (32) PTC 15 (Del.) that the dictum in
Kellogg's case to the extent it relied on the Schwepps case, would
not hold good in view of the subsequent development of the law in
Cadilla. It was further held that in any case the reasoning in
Kellogg would apply only where the customers can readily be
characterised as "sophisticated and discerning" and not in a case as
the present.
</p>
<p id="p_107">53.      Again in <a href="/doc/20352166/" id="a_35">Sanjay Kapur v. Dev Agri Farms</a>, 2014 (59) PTC 93
the Single Judge of this Court distinguished the judgment in
Kellogg's case as having been passed in the peculiar facts of that
case namely the trade dress being entirely different. The Division


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                Page 44 of 50</span>
 Bench upheld this finding of the Single Judge and further observed
that it would not be correct to say that "merely because a trademark
[or label] is displayed on the packaging material [or trade dress],
even then notwithstanding a striking similarity in the packaging
material there would be no likelihood of deception".
</p>
<p id="p_108">54.      It is rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs
that marks/trade dress will always have points of dissimilarities.
Where these dissimilarities outweigh the differences, then it might
be correct to say that the trademarks/trade dress is not similar.
Public interest is of utmost concern in these cases and despite
dissimilarities, if there is bound to be consumer confusion, then
trademarks/trade dress must be held to be similar. Moreover, this
argument goes totally contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme
Court in Cadila (supra) wherein it was laid down that while
comparing trademarks/ trade dress, the focus has to be on
similarities and not dissimilarities, particularly when the trade dress
has acquired immense goodwill and worldwide reputation by virtue
of long and extensive user. It was further observed that it would be
incorrect to say that differences in essential features are at all
relevant as has been sought to be urged by the defendants. In other
words all that is relevant and has to be compared are the similarities
in the trade dress and not the dissimilarities.
</p>
<p id="p_109">55.      The same view has been taken by this Court in <a href="/doc/652828/" id="a_36">Cadbury
India v. Neeraj Food</a>         (supra) wherein it was observed that the
points of similarity which have to be given greater attention to than
those of dissimilarity and that one has to pay great attention to the
items of similarity, and less to the items of dissimilarity (paras 31 &amp;
</p><p id="p_110">32).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                    Page 45 of 50</span>
<p id="p_111"> 56.      Reliance     placed   by   the   defendants   on   <a href="/doc/1127455/" id="a_37">Cipla   v.    M.K.
Pharmaceuticals</a>, (2001) 5 SCC 73 is wholly misconceived as the
argument is based on the erroneous premise that factors that
influence a consumer's decision to purchase a toy is akin to that of a
person who goes to a chemist to purchase prescription drugs.
Further, unlike the instant case, the facts of Cipla were confined to a
passing off action in respect of a single colour as opposed to a
combination of colors that is in question in this present case.
</p>
<p id="p_112">57.      In view of the facts and circumstances in the matter, I am of
the view that the plaintiffs have been able to establish a strong case
of passing off as there is no justification given by the defendants as
to how the similar trade-dress hit upon them. It is evident that on
the date of adoption they must be aware about the game of the
plaintiffs and the defendants have created the trade dress by placing
the trace of the plaintiffs, otherwise, it was not possible for anyone
to have the similar trade dress/colour combination and layout. Thus,
the plaintiffs are entitled for infringement as prayed in the
application in relation to the trade dress.
</p>
<p id="p_113">58.      Lastly, it was mentioned by the counsel for the defendants that
without prejudice, the defendants have offered to change the size of
the coloured stickers on the 6 faces of the cube from present
'square' to 'circular'. On such change to circular stickers, not only is
the impression of any alleged "black border/cage" completely
unfounded, but also the look of the defendants' product will become
materially different from that of the plaintiffs. The sample of the
same was shown. The plaintiffs have rejected the offer given by the
defendants to alter/change its trade dress as counsel for the
plaintiffs upon instruction submits that the changes suggested by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                      Page 46 of 50</span>
 defendants may also amount to confusion and deception. He says
that the black colour used in change/alter would create confusion
and deception as in many cases a child is bound to identify a toy by
its trade dress.
</p><p id="p_114">59.      He says that if the defendants are ready to change the trade-
dress in the same manner as used by other parties, the plaintiffs
may not be having any objection.       He gave colour photocopies of
trade dress of third party. Scanned copy has been reproduced here
as under:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                Page 47 of 50</span>
<p id="p_115"> 60.      However, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the
plaintiffs that the present case is a classic example of how a
defendant first seeks to adopt the trade dress of the plaintiffs in
entirety and then to satisfy the Court seeks to introduce "variations
in detail". This approach is totally flawed inasmuch as, it is observed
by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_38">Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. and Co</a>.
(1972) 1 SCC 618 that:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      "Moreover, variations in detail might well be
      supposed by customers to have been made by the
      owners of the trade mark they are already
      acquainted with"</blockquote>
<p id="p_116">         The above observations have been followed by this Court in
<a href="/doc/652828/" id="a_39">Cadbury v. Neeraj Foods</a> (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_117">      The said approach is also totally contrary to the law laid down by
this Court in <a href="/doc/1306228/" id="a_40">Colgate Palmolive v. Anchor Health</a> (supra)
wherein it was laid down that that a second comer has to make



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">      CS(OS) No.2101/2010                                  Page 48 of 50</span>
 every effort to stay as far away as possible from the trade dress of a
prior user and create its own goodwill.
</p>
<p id="p_118">61.      In view of the above explanation given on behalf of the
plaintiffs and the changes suggested by the defendants, I am of the
view that without going into the controversy as to whether the
changes suggested about the trade dress by the defendants or it
should not be used in the market, it is proper that the Court should
not express any opinion at this stage as it is the duty of the Court to
decide the dispute in hand which is to be decided. If the defendants
wish to use any changed version, it is upto them and in case of any
complaint by the plaintiffs, it would be decided at that time. An
opinion cannot be expressed at this stage in view of non-agreement
on behalf of the plaintiffs. Thus, the present interim application is
being decided on the basis of material and facts before the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_119">62.      As far as the impugned trade dress used by the defendants at
the time of filing of the suit, the plaintiffs have made a prima facie
good case; the balance of convenience also lies in favour of the
plaintiffs and against the defendants. The interim orders against the
defendants have been operating since about 5 years and 9 months.
In case, the interim order is not passed, the plaintiffs would suffer
irreparable loss and injury. Under these circumstances, the trial of
the suit is expedited.
