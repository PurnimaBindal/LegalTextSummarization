                             JUDGMENT ON BOARD
13/07/2022

</p><p id="p_3">    1. Assailing the legality, correctness, judicial propriety of the

         judgment dated 28/11/2019 passed in Sessions Trial No.

         74/2017 by the Sessions Judge, Kondagaon, District Kondagaon

         (C.G.)     by which the appellant was convicted for an offence

         under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_1">Section 307</a> of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, &#x27; <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>&#x27;)

         and directed to undergo three years rigorous imprisonment and

         fine of Rs.25,000/- and in default of payment of fine additional

         rigorous imprisonment for six months was added.

</p><p id="p_4">    2. Prosecution story in brief is that the complainant was married

         with the appellant three years prior to the date of incident. The

         complainant Sangeeta Patel was working in Sharma Hotel with

         her father. One day appellant came to her house after

         consuming liquor and quarreled with her and since then the

         complainant was residing with her mother in Naveen Colony,
 Farasgaon. A day prior to the date of incident i.e. 10/02/2017 the

appellant had come to the house of the complainant at

Farasgaon and when she was having lunch, he asked her to

accompany him to the Jungle for cutting of woods. Despite her

refusal, the appellant forcibly took her to Patoda jungle and near

Sai Temple he assaulted her with axe from sharp side. The axe

was seized vide seizure memo (Ex.P/5). On account of the

assault on her head and ears, she fell down on the ground. Even

thereafter the appellant inflicted injuries with axe on her thigh

(near her private part) and then ran away in the jungle with the

axe. The injury was bleeding profusely. The victim somehow

came to the road staggering where the passers-by shifted her to

the Farasgaon Hospital by 108 Ambulance. On the intimation

being given by the Community Health Center, Farasgaon, Ajay

Jha (PW-4) recorded dehati nalishi (Ex.P/9) and thereafter she

was medically examined. Thereafter on the basis of dehati

nalishi (Ex.P/9) First Information Report (Ex.P/10) was registered

at Crime No. 03/2017 against the accused/appellant under

<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_3">Section 307</a> of IPC. During the course of investigation, spot map

was prepared, statements of the witnesses were recorded, blood

stained soil and plain soil was seized from the place of incident,

the statement of the complainant was recorded and cloths worn

by her were seized. The axe seized under (Ex.P/5) on the

memorandum of accused (Ex.P/4) was sent for examination to

the doctor (PW-9), who while answering the query had stated

that the injuries noticed by him could have been caused by the

axe    presented     before    him     for   examination.     The
   medical examination report (Ex.P/13) shows incised wounds on

  the pinna of the ear, left temporal region, right temporal region

  and labia majora which were caused by hard and sharp object.

  According to the opinion given by the doctor (PW-9), injury No. 1

  was grievous in nature and the rest are simple in nature. After

  completion of investigation, charge-sheet was filed before the

  competent Court and vide order dated 15/09/2017 the case was

  committed to the Sessions Court for trial. The appellant was

  charged for offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_4">Section 307</a> of IPC where he abjured

  his guilt and claimed for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3. Prosecution has examined as many as 11 witnesses Hardik

  Shrivastava (PW-1), Krishna Patle (PW-2), Bhanupratap Yadav

  (PW-3), Ajay Jha (PW-4), Smt. Sangeeta Patel (PW-5), Chaitram

  (PW-6), Sukhiyarin Bai (PW-7), Smt. Jaishri Dhruv (PW-8), Dr.

  Lakhanlal Jurri (PW-9), Samluram Karanga (PW-10) and Bajaru

  Ram Pardhi (PW-11) to prove as the case and exhibited 14

  documents. Statement of the appellant under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_5">Section 313</a> of

  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, &#x27; <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">CrPC</a>&#x27;) was also

  recorded in which he pleaded his innocence and false

  implication in the case. The appellant however did not examine

  any witness in support of his defence. The learned Sessions

  Court after appreciating the evidence brought before it convicted

  and sentenced the appellant as stated above. Hence, this

  appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4. Counsel for the appellant vehemently argued that the impugned

  judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the

  learned trial Court is contrary to the evidence adduced by the
    prosecution and therefore not sustainable in law. He further

   submits that the learned trial Court has failed to appreciate the

   evidence in its proper perspective and erroneously passed the

   impugned judgment. He further submits that there are major

   omissions and contradictions in the statements of the witnesses

   which makes their statement untrustworthy and therefore no

   conviction can be based on such testimony. Counsel for the

   appellant further submits that even assuming that the appellant

   was the author of the crime, but looking to the injuries sustained

   by the complainant-injured and the evidence collected by the

   prosecution, the appellant cannot be convicted under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_7">Section

   307</a> of IPC. Accordingly, the submission of counsel for the

   accused/appellant is that the accused/appellant is entitled for

   acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5. On the other hand learned State counsel supports the impugned

   judgment and submits that the findings recorded by the learned

   trial Court holding the accused/appellant guilty is based on

   proper appreciation of the evidence brought before it. He further

   submits that the prosecution by adducing the cogent and prudent

   evidence was able to bring home the guilt of the appellant. The

   medical evidence so collected by the prosecution and the

   statement of the complainant goes to show that it is the appellant

   who committed the crime in question and therefore the finding

   recorded by the trial Court convicting the appellant as aforesaid

   does not require any interference by this Court and therefore the

   appeal being without merits is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_8">6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered the
   rival contentions raised at bar and also perused the records

  meticulously and with utmost circumspection.

</p><p id="p_9">7. The question which is to be determined by this Court is that

  whether on the basis of evidence adduced by the prosecution

  the learned Sessions Court was justified in convicting and

  sentencing the appellant as aforesaid? Complainant Smt.

  Sangeeta Patel (PW-5) is the injured and the sole eye-witness to

  the incident. In her statement in para 2, she has categorically

  stated that her husband (appellant) assaulted her with axe on

  ears, head and near the private parts because of which blood

  started oozing and she became unconscious. In paragraph 6 of

  her statement she has categorically denied that somebody from

  behind had assaulted her and because of which she had

  become unconscious. She further denied that the injury

  sustained by her is on account of falling from the tree. Though

  this witness was declared hostile and was cross-examined by

  the prosecution, however, meticulous examination of her entire

  statement, this witness remained firmed and her statement

  inspires confidence of this Court. Chaitram (PW-6), Suhkiyarin

  Bai (PW-7), Bajaru Ram Pardhi (PW-11) also corroborated the

  statement of complainant Smt. Sangeeta Patel (PW-5). Chaitram

  (PW-6) in paragraph 2 of his statement has stated that he along

  with his wife Sukhiyarin Bai took the complainant Smt. Sangeeta

  Patel for treatment to Kanker hospital where she told him that

  the appellant had assaulted her with axe in jungle. Though this

  witness has also been declared hostile, he appears to be a

  natural witness and there is no reason to disbelieve his version.
   Similar statement was also given by Sukhiyarin Bai (PW-7). The

  learned trial Court has in detail appreciated the testimony of the

  witnesses and came to a finding that it is the appellant who had

  caused the injuries to the complainant Smt. Sangeeta Patel.

  From the discussion above, this Court is of the opinion that the

  injured complainant Smt. Sangeeta Patel (PW-5),           Chaitram

  (PW-6) and Sukhiyarin Bai (PW-7) their testimony inspire

  confidence and the conviction so recorded by the trial Court on

  the basis of their testimonies cannot be said to be perverse or

  illegal. Hence the finding recorded by the trial court convicting

  the appellant is hereby affirmed. Now the next submissions of

  the appellant with regard to the fact that the present is not a case

  of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_8">Section 307</a> of IPC. In order to appreciate the submission

  testimony of Dr. Lakhan Lal Jurri (PW-9) is important. PW-9 who

  has conducted the MLC of the injured Smt. Sangeeta Patel

  found following injuries :- (i) incised wound 1&quot; x ½&quot; Pinna of left

  ear hard and sharp (ii) incised wound 1&quot; x ½&quot; Left temporal

  region hard and sharp (iii) incised wound 1½ x1&quot;x ½&quot; Right

  temporal region hard and sharp (iv) 1&quot;x ½&quot; x ½&quot; Right labia

  majora hard and sharp. He states that injury No. 1 was grievous

  in nature and rest of the injuries were simple in nature. He

  further states that in para No. 5 that the injuries sustained by the

  injured Smt. Sangeeta Patel may be caused from the seized

  axe. Query report is (Ex.P/14) and MLC is (Ex.P/13).

</p><p id="p_10">8. The statement of PW-9 also reveals that such injury can be

  caused by hard and sharp edged weapon and he also advised

  for X-ray and neurological and gynecological treatment.
    According to the X-ray report injury No. 1 was grievous and

   other injuries were simple in nature. He further states that injured

   was advised for treatment in the higher medical center. From

   perusal of the statement of PW-9 it appears that injury No. 1 was

   grievous in nature and rest of the injuries was simple in nature.

   This witness has not stated that the injured would have died if

   proper treatment was not given to her. It has come on record

   from the statement of Chaitram (PW-6) that on the advice of the

   doctor, the injured was taken to Kanker hospital where she was

   treated for about a week. On examination of the statement of

   Smt. Sangeeta Patel (PW-5) it appears she has not stated that

   the appellant caused injuries to her in order to kill her. On the

   contrary in para 4 she states that she does not know why her

   husband has assaulted. Except MLC (Ex.P/13) and evidence of

   Dr. Lakhan Lal Jurri (PW-9) no cogent evidence is available on

   record to substantiate that if the proper treatment was not given

   to the complainant, she would have died.

<p id="p_12">10.     In order to sustain of conviction under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_10">Section 307</a> of IPC

  others v.State of Haryana</a> (2015) 11 SCC 366 has laid down the
   ingredients of the offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_13">Section 307</a> of the IPC and held as

  under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">             &quot;12.For the purpose of conviction under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_14">Section 307</a>
             IPC, prosecution has to establish (i) the intention to
             commit murder; and (ii) the act done by the accused.
             The burden is on the prosecution that the accused had
             attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution
             witness. Whether the accused person intended to
             commit murder of another person would depend upon
             the facts and circumstances of each case. To justify a
             conviction under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_15">Section 307</a> IPC, it is not essential that
             fatal injury capable of causing death should have been
             caused. Although the nature of injury actually caused
             may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the
             intention of the accused, such intention may also be
             adduced from other circumstances. The intention of the
             accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like
             the nature of the weapon used, words used by the
             accused at the time of the incident, motive of the
             accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused
             and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given,
             etc.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_16">12.     The trial Court came to a conclusion that the appellant has

  committed the said crime on the basis of injury sustained by the

  complainant and after assaulting the injured PW-5 he run away

  which goes to indicate that the dying declaration of PW-5 was

  also recorded and she remained in the hospital for the long

  period and on these basis the appellant was convicted for the

  offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_16">Section 307</a> of IPC. On deep analysis of the

  medical evidence available on record the following facts are

  reflecting :- four injuries was caused to the appellant, out of

  which incised wound 1&quot; x ½&quot; Pinna on left ear hard and sharp

  was grievous in nature and rest of the injuries were simple. The

  injured herself has stated that she was admitted in the

  Farasgaon hospital and subsequently in Kanker hospital where

  she remained under treatment for about seven days. It is to be

  seen that looking to the conditions of injured her dying
           declaration was recorded. The appellant left the injured after

          causing injuries to the injured. From the deep analysis of the

          entire evidence, intention of the appellant can be gathered.
