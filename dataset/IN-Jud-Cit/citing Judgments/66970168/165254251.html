      It is the specific contention of the petitioner that, when the

grant is in favour of the inamdar for performing Bhajantri services,

and ryotwari patta was issued under <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_11">Section 7</a> of A.P.Act 1956 on

18.10.1982 to the inamdar would not confer any right on the

inamdar, the successor in interest by virtue of amendment brought

to statue i.e. <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_12">A.P. Act</a> of 1956 by <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_13">A.P. Act</a> No.16 of 2013 and such

amendment would take away the right vested on the inamdar,

giving retrospective effect from the year 1956 i.e. from the date of

advent of conversion of inams abolition Act and it is nothing but

an arbitrary exercise of the power of the State in contravention of

Articles 13(2), 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India and

against the rigor of abolition of imams in Andhra area.

</p><p id="p_12">      The ryotwari patta issued in favour of Chunduri and

Kalavakuri families, though is an inam for rendering services

connected with the religious institutions i.e. for performing

Bhajantri service and not in support of any religious institution, it

was not a grant made in favour of the temples, but in favour of the

individual inamdars. Therefore, pleaded that giving retrospective

effect to the amended provisions is in derogation of <a href="/doc/1256023/" id="a_14">Article 43</a> of

the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_15">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution of India prohibits passing

any legislation which takes away the rights conferred by Part-III of

contravention of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_16">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India, inasmuch

as, by virtue thereof, persons granted ryotwari patta under Inams

Abolition Act or their successors-in-interest for the land granted

as inam in connection with erstwhile services rendered to a

differently   vis-à-vis    other    grantees        of   ryotwari      pattas/their

successors-in-interest and this is in derogation to the protection

offered by virtue of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India,

particularly in view of the fact that the nature of grant of inam,

which in this case is a personal grant, pales into insignificance,

upon the abolition of the very inam and consequential conversion

of the tenure into ryotwari from inam. Further, the amendment,

discriminating the persons holding land that had been originally

granted as inam in connection with services rendered to religious

institutions, other citizens holding land either former inam land

given for other purpose and since converted into ryotwari tenure or

land that was already held as ryotwari tenure and continues to be

so.

<p id="p_14">      It is also contended that <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_18">A.P. Act</a> No.16 of 2013, amending

this Court to <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_31">Section 17(6)</a> of Act No.30 of 1987. According to

which, all properties belonging to a charitable or religious

institution or endowment, which on the date of commencement of

this Act, are in the possession or under the superintendence of the

Government, Zilla Praja Parishad, Municipality or other local

authority or any company, society, organisation, Institution or

other person or any committee, superintendent or manager

appointed by the Government, shall, on the date on which a Board

of Trustees is or is deemed to have been constituted or trustee is or

is deemed to have been appointed under this section, stand

case may be, and all assets vesting in the Government, local

authority or person aforesaid and all liabilities subsisting against

such Government, local authority or person on the said date shall,

devolve on the institution or endowment, as the case may be.

Therefore, the trust board is the competent authority to have

control over the property in dispute and none others, including the

inamdars or the purchasers from the inamdars are entitled to

exercise any right over the property and requested to dismiss the

writ petition.

together, compelling them to render service to retain the grant is

violative of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_32">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India and that the

without amending the law under Inam abolition Act and without

Inam Abolition Act, on erroneous belief or assumption that it did

not bind the religion or charitable institutions or endowment or

that the holder of land did not acquire title or no patta was granted

to him and the land was still with the institution and treated the

occupant as encroacher. The legislation founded on such an

erroneous assumption does not have the effect of depriving the

holder of the land of their vested rights acquired under the Inams

Abolition Act. The legislature has plainly misfired. Accordingly,

2013 is permissible under the Constitution. When a law is enacted

by the Statute passed by the Legislature, such statutes carries

with it a presumption of constitutionality. Such a presumption

extends also in relation to a law which has been enacted for

imposing reasonable restrictions in the fundamental right. A

further presumption may also be drawn that the statutory

authority would not exercise the power arbitrarily. (vide People&#x27;s

Union for <a href="/doc/110957682/" id="a_62">Civil Liberties v. Union of India9</a>). The presumption is

always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment, and the

burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a

clear transgression of the constitutional principles (vide <a href="/doc/4354/" id="a_63">Chiranjit

Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India10</a>). By reason of presumption in

considering the validity of the impugned law, the Court will not be

restricted to the pleadings of the respondent and would be free to

satisfy itself whether under any provision of the Constitution the

law can be sustained, having regard to the circumstances in which

it was enacted. (vide <a href="/doc/516439/" id="a_64">Burarkar Coal Company v. Union of India11</a>

and <a href="/doc/591481/" id="a_65">Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India12</a>). For the same, the

Court should, if possible, make such a progressive or narrow

construction of the impugned statue as would sustain its

constitutional            validity   (vide    <a href="/doc/162242/" id="a_66">Sunil   Batra       v.        Delhi

Administration13</a>). A law will not be declared unconstitutional

unless the case is so clear as to be free from doubt; &quot;to doubt the

constitutionality of a law is to resolve it in favour of its validity.&quot;

Where the validity of a statute is questioned and there are two

interpretations, one of which would make the law valid and the

other void, the former must be preferred and the validity of law

upheld. In pronouncing on the constitutional validity of a statute,

the Court is not concerned with the wisdom or un-wisdom, the

justice or injustice of the law. If that which is passed into law is

within the scope of the power conferred on a Legislature and

violates no restrictions on that power, the law must be upheld

whatever a Court may think of it. (vide <a href="/doc/1508583/" id="a_67">Karnataka Bank Limited

v. State of A.P14</a>). Thus, the Court has to keep in mind the

presumption of the constitutionality and such statute passed by

Legislature. If, for any reason, the Statute passed by the

Legislature is violative of any fundamental rights guaranteed under

Constitution of India which expressly confers upon the Courts the

power of judicial review and as regards fundamental rights, the

Court has been, by the present Article, assigned the role of a

sentinel on the &#x27;qui vive&#x27;. While the Court naturally attaches great

weight to the legislative judgment, it cannot desert its own duty to

determine finally the constitutionality of an impugned statute (vide

State of Madras v. Raw15 and <a href="/doc/761967/" id="a_68">Basheshar Nath v. C.I.T16</a>). Every

law has to pass through the test of constitutionality, which is

nothing but a formal test of rationality. (vide <a href="/doc/1070146/" id="a_69">State of U.P. v.

Deepak Fertilizers &amp; Petrochemical Corporation Limited17</a>).

The foundation of this power of judicial review, as explained by a

nine-Judge Bench is the theory that the Constitution, which is the

fundamental law of the land, is the will of the &#x27;people&#x27;, while a

statute is only the creation of the elected representatives of the

people; when therefore, the will of the Legislature as declared in a

statute, stands in opposition to that of the people as declared in

the Constitution, the will of the people must prevail. (vide S.C.

Advocates on <a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_70">Record Association v. U.O.I18</a>).                         The power to

annul the acts of the executive and the judiciary which violate the

Constitution is vested by the Constitution itself in the Judiciary

and not the Legislature which is a creature of the Constitution. In

determining the constitutionality of a provision alleged to be

violative of a fundamental right, the Court must weigh the

substance, the real effect and impact thereof on the fundamental

right    and     would     not    allow     the    Legislature      to      bypass          a

constitutional prohibition by employing indirect methods. (vide

S.C. Advocates on <a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_71">Record Association v. U.O.I</a> (referred supra),

Re Kerala Education Bill19 and Dwarka Prasad Laxmi Narain v.

State of U.P20). In view of the law, it is for the Court to keep in

mind the principles laid down in various judgments as to the scope

of judicial review to decide the constitutionality of any statute

passed by either the Union of India or the State. Broadly, the

grounds of unconstitutionality of a statute can be stated as under:

      Initially, <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_86">Article 31-A</a> of the Constitution of India was

originally     inserted   by   Section    4   of   the   Constitution          (First

Amendment) Act,1951, and later amended by the Constitution

(Fourth Amendment) At, 1955, as shown in italics. Both the

amendments were given retrospective effect from the commencement

of the Constitution. Further, amendments have been made by the

Seventeenth Amendment Act, 1964 by adding a second proviso to

Clause (1) and by Clause (2)(a) which is relevant for deciding the

real controversy. According to proviso, provides that where any law

makes any provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate

and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under

his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to

acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit

<p id="p_47">          In   any      view   of   the   matter,   ryotwari   settlement             was

considered to be an agrarian reform. The Ryotwari settlement was

inserted by the Constitution (17th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_94">Amendment) Act</a>, 1964. Prior to

that, the definition of &#x27;estate&#x27; in Clause (2)(a), as introduced by the

Constitution (1st <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_95">Amendment) Act</a>, 951, referred to the existing law

relating to land tenures which, obviously, referred to an estate

under the Permanent Settlement, and the interest of a zemindar or

an intermediary under the law, so that ryotwari lands were

excluded from the purview of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_96">Article 31A(1)(a).</a> (vide <a href="/doc/1980640/" id="a_97">Krishnaswami

Naidu, A.P. v. State of Madras29</a>).                  That loophole has been

plugged by the substitution of Clause (2)(a) by the amendment of

1964 as a result of which even lands under a ryotwari settlement

would be entitled to the protection of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_98">Article 31A(1)(a)</a> provided, of

dedication of property for purposes recognized by Muslim law as

pious, religious or charitable and the property having been found

as wakf would always retain its character as wakf. In other words,

once a wakf always a wakf and the grant of patta in favour of

Mokhasadar under the Inams Abolition Act does not, in any manner,

nullify the earlier dedication made of the property constituting the

same as wakf. After a wakf has been created, it continues to be so

favour of the institution, but not in favour of a grantee i.e. a service

inamdar. Such inamdar is entitled to enjoy the property as along

as he is rendering service to the institution. Therefore, such service

given retrospective effect to the Act and completely takes away the

right of inamdar to alienate the property granted for rendering

contravention of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_136">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. Earlier,

Section 4(4) of Inams Abolition Act, 1955, was repealed with

Division Bench of the High Court at Hyderabad held that, the

golden rule of construction is that, in the absence of anything in

the enactment to show that it is to have retrospective operation, it

cannot be so construed as to have the effect of altering the law

applicable to a claim in litigation at the time when the Act was

passed. In the facts of the above judgment, amendment was given

retrospective application. Reliance was placed on the judgment of

the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/410919/" id="a_139">Peddinti Venkata Murali Ranganatha

Desika Iyengar and others v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a>

(referred supra), wherein the Supreme Court held that &quot;the

competency of the legislature to make the law, its deep impact on

vested rights and its sweep would be properly gazed and

appreciated when we would look into the provisions of the Inams

Abolition Act which is a part of agrarian reform, forming part of the

scheme to abolish an estate, conferment of ryotwari patta on the

tiller of the soil and the institution respectively and creation of

direct   relationship   of   him   with   the   State   paying         revenue

assessment thereof. The Inams Abolition Act was enacted under

Entry 18 of List-II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution viz.,

Rights in or over the land, land tenure including the relationship of

the landlord and the tenant, transfer and alienation of agricultural

lands etc&quot;. The preamble of the Inams Abolition Act envisages &quot;an

act to abolish and convert certain inam lands into ryotwari lands&quot;.

The title of the Act itself indicates abolition of the inam lands and

conversion thereof into ryotwari lands. <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_140">The Act</a> had come into force

on December 14, 1956 and it had been amended from time to time.

Similar provision is available in Telangana area of Andhra Pradesh.

as to whether the Inams Abolition Act is an Act for the purpose of

agrarian reforms or not. It is held by the Supreme Court that it is a

piece of legislation under Entry 18 of List II of the Seventh

Schedule of the Constitution. Since the impugned legislation has

received the Presidential assent and a procedure has been laid

down        for   determination,         apportionment         and       payment             of

compensation under Chapter-III of the Act, therefore, it will not

be subject to any challenge for violation of rights guaranteed

the Jammu and Kashmir Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976, was

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        &quot;Before parting with this case, we would like to observe that <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_142">Section
        7(2)(b)</a> of the Act creates an anomalous situation, especially in the
        contest of the definition of &#x27;personal cultivation&#x27; in <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_143">Section 2(12)</a> of
        the Act. One of the conditions imposed by <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_144">Section 7(2)(b)</a> on the right
        of a land-holder to resume land is that, unless he is a member of the
        defence forces, he must take his residence in the village in which the
        land is situated or in an adjoining village. &quot;Personal Cultivation&quot; is
        defined in <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_145">section 2(12)</a> to mean cultivation by any member of one&#x27;s
        family or by a khana-nishin daughter or a khana-damad or a parent
        of the person or by other relations like the son, brother or sister who
        are specified in the various clauses of <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_146">Section 2(12)</a>. Under clause (g)
        of <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_147">section 2(12)</a>, a land-holder who is a minor, insane, physically
        disabled, incapacitated by old age or infirmity, a widow or a person
        in detention or in person can cultivate the land through a servant or
        hired labourer under the personal supervision of his or her guardian
        or agent. If it is permissible to cultivate a land through another
        person as specified in clauses (b) to (g) of <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_148">section 2(12)</a>, it is difficult
        to understand why residence in the village where the land is situated
        or in an adjoining village should be compulsory for all persons, even
        for minors, widows, insane persons and persons in detention. The
        exception made by the legislature in favour of the members of
        defence forces ought to be extended to these other persons also, The
        exclusion of a constitutional challenge under Articles 14, 19 and 31
        which is provided for by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_149">Article 31A</a> does not justify in equity the
        irrational violation of these articles. This Court did observe in

        drawn by Shri Tarkunde, was treated in <a href="/doc/1308921/" id="a_161">Ranjit Singh v. State of
        Punjab</a> (referred supra) as a special case which cannot apply to
        cases where the general scheme of legislation is definitely agrarian
        reform and under its provisions, something ancillary thereto in the
        interests of rural economy has to be undertaken to give full effect to
        those reforms. In our case the dominant purpose of the statute is to
        bring about a just and equitable redistribution of lands, which is
        achieved by making the tiller of the soil the owner of the land which
        he cultivates and by imposing a ceiling on the extent of the land
        which any person, whether land- lord or tenant, can hold.
        Considering the scheme and purpose of the Act, we cannot but hold
        that the Act is a measure of agrarian reform and is saved by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_162">Article

principles         as     afore-recorded.       There        is    presumption                of

constitutionality in favour of legislation. The Legislature has the

power to carve out a classification which is based upon intelligible

differentia and has rational nexus to the object of the Act. The

burden to prove that the enacted law offends any of the Articles

under Part III of the Constitution is on the one who questions the

constitutionality and show that despite such presumption in

favour of the legislation, it is unfair, unjust and unreasonable.

Another          most      significant      canon       of        determination               of

constitutionality is that the courts would be reluctant to declare a

law invalid or ultra vires on account of unconstitutionality. The

courts would accept an interpretation which would be in favour of

the constitutionality, than an approach which would render the

law unconstitutional. Declaring the law unconstitutional is one of

the last resorts taken by the courts. The courts would preferably

put into service the principle of reading down or reading into the

provision to make it effective, workable and ensure the attainment

of the object of the Act. These are the principles which clearly

emerge from the consistent view taken by the courts in its various

pronouncements.

Apex Court discussed the scope of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_183">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution

of India and drawn difference in the language and scope of

Article13(1) and 13(2). Article13(1) clearly recognises the existence

of pre-existing laws in force in the territory of India immediately

before the commencement of the Constitution and then lays down

that in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part

III, they shall be void to the extent of such inconsistency. The pre-

Constitution laws which were perfectly valid when they were

passed and the existence of which is recognised in the opening

words of <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_184">Article 13(1)</a> revived by the removal of the inconsistency in

question. <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_185">Article 13(2)</a> on the other hand begins with an injunction

to the State not to make a law which takes away or abridges the

rights conferred by Part III. There is thus a constitutional

prohibition to the State against making laws taking away or

abridging fundamental rights. The legislative power of Parliament

and &#x27;the Legislatures of States under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_186">Article 245</a> is subject to the

other provisions of the Constitution and therefore subject to <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_187">Article

taking away or abridging the fundamental rights. Therefore, it

seems to us that the prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_188">Article 13(2)</a> makes

the State as much incompetent to make a law taking away or

abridging the fundamental rights, as it would be where law is made

against the distribution of powers contained in the Seventh

Schedule   to   the   Constitution    between   Parliament       and        the

Legislature of a State. Further, <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_189">Article 13(2)</a> provides that the law

shall be void to the extent of the contravention. Now contravention

in the context takes place only once when the law is &quot;made, for the

contravention is of the prohibition to make any law which takes

away or abridges the fundamental rights. There is no question of

contravention of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_190">Article 13 (2)</a> being a continuing matter.

Therefore, where there is a question of a post- Constitution law,

there is a prohibition against the State from taking away or

abridging fundamental rights and there is a further provision that

if the prohibition is contravened the law shall be void to the extent

of the contravention. In view of this clear provision it must be held

that unlike a law covered by <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_191">Article 13(1)</a> which was valid when

made, the law made in contravention of the prohibition contained

in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_192">Article 13 (2)</a> is a still, born law either wholly or partially

depending upon the extent of the contravention. &#x27;Such a law is

dead from the beginning and there can be no question of its revival

under the doctrine of eclipse. plain reading therefore of the words

in <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_193">Article 13(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_194">Article 13(2)</a> brings out a clear distinction

between the two. <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_195">Article 13(1)</a> declares such pre-Constitution laws

as are inconsistent with fundamental rights void. <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_196">Article 13 (2)</a>

consists of two parts; the first part imposes an inhibition on the

power of the State to make a law contravening fundamental rights,
                                                                    CPK,J &amp; MSM, J

and the second part, which is merely a consequential one,

mentions the effect of the breach. Now what the doctrine of eclipse

can revive is the operation of a law which was operative until the

Constitution came into force and had since then become

inoperative either wholly or partially; it cannot confer power on the

State to enact a law in breach of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_197">Article 13(2)</a> which would be the

effect of the application of the doctrine of eclipse to post-

Constitution laws.

the property as long as he is rendering service to the institution. If,

for any reason, the land covered by grant in favour of the service

inamdar is alienated, it will directly affect the rights of the

    compliance thereof is fatal to the alienation so made. That grant of
    sanction by the Competent Authority is not a matter of any empty
    formality or ritual. Sanction may be accorded only in cases where
    the Competent Authority considers that the proposed transaction is

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     47. In Mannalal Khetan v. Kedar Nath Khetan, (1997) 2 SCC 424,
     the Apex Court stated the principle succinctly:
     &quot;It is well established that a contract which involves in its fulfilment
     the doing of an act prohibited by statute is void. The legal maxim A
     pactis privatorum publico juri non derogatur means that private
     agreements cannot alter the general law. Where a contract, express
     or implied, is expressly or by implication forbidden by statute, no
     Court can lend its assistance to give it effect. (See Mellis v. Shirley
     L.B., (1885) 16 QBD 446). What is done in contravention of the
     provisions of an Act of the Legislature cannot be made the subject of
     an action.&quot;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">     49. We shall, however, bear in mind the principle stated by Lord
     Campbell in an oft-quoted passage:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">     &quot;No universal rule can be laid down as to whether mandatory
     enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an
     implied nullification for disobedience. It is the duty of Courts of
     justice to try to get at the real intention of the Legislature by
     carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be
     considered&quot;. (See: Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner, (1861) 30 LJ
     Ch. 379 and <a href="/doc/465322/" id="a_222">B.K. Srinivasan v. State of Karnataka</a>, ).
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      Finally, the Apex Court concluded as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">     65. We have already noticed that the proceedings against some of the
     writ petitioners have already been initiated under the provisions of
     the Act 30 of 1987 before the Competent Authority seeking
     appropriate declaration as against them to be the encroachers of the
     land on the ground that the sale of the land by the President of the
     Trust did not confer any right, title or interest in the purchasers. The
     proceedings are stated to be pending consideration before the

      Though the principle laid down in the above judgment is

applied to the facts referred supra, it is the obligation of the State

to protect the property of the deity, as such the Act of 1956 is

enacted appropriately amending Act of 1956 with an avowed object

to product the deities interest, such amendment Act No.13 of 2016

arbitrary vide judgment in <a href="/doc/410919/" id="a_225">Peddinti Venkata Murali Ranganatha

Desika Iyengar and others v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a>

(referred   supra),   the   Government      did   not   take      any       steps

immediately to pass appropriate legislation, in view of the

observations of the Apex Court in the above judgment. The Apex

Court specifically pointed out that <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_226">Section 76</a> of Act No.30 of 1987

is a valid piece of legislation, indirectly repealing the Inams

Abolition Act or the judgments of that High Court referred to in the

judgment. It is settled law that repeal of an Act divesting vested

rights is always disfavored. Presumption is against repeal by

implication and the reason is based on the theory that the

legislation, while enacting a law, has complete knowledge of the

pre-existing law on the same subject matter. The Apex Court

referred    to   commentary     in    the   &quot;Principles      of      Statutory

Interpretation&quot; by Justice G.P. Singh, (5th Edition) 1992 at pages

186-87 under the caption &quot;Reference to other statutes&quot; in Chapter

IV (External Aids to Construction) and concluded that, unless the

original Act i.e Inams Abolition Act is amended, <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_227">Section 76</a> of Act

No.30 of 1987 is arbitrary. But, realising the mistake of the State,

passed Act No.16 of 2013 to cure the defect in the legislation and

to jealously protect the interest of the deity. Therefore, the law is

clear as on date that, when the statute itself gave retrospective

effect to the amended provisions, no other interpretation is

required to be given. But, whether such retrospective effect is

arbitrary or violates any constitution mandate is only the

consideration.

</pre><p id="p_99">12.01.1996, there was a clear prohibition from alienation of the

property granted in favour of an inamdar for rendering service i.e.

service imams, and from the date of enacting Act No.16 of 2013,

the prohibition is deemed to be continued on account of automatic

restoration of <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_228">Section 76</a> by fiction. Thus, the petitioner in the

present case acquired title to the property from their vendor, who

purchased prior to the judgment in judgment in <a href="/doc/410919/" id="a_229">Peddinti Venkata

Murali Ranganatha Desika Iyengar and others v. Government

of Andhra Pradesh</a> (referred supra) and by the date of their

purchase, there is a clear prohibition against alienation of land

covered by inam patta issued under <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_230">Section 7</a> for rendering

service. When vesting of title on the petitioner is illegal, the same

illegality cannot be continued even after the amendment by Act

No.16 of 2013 came into operation. More curiously, Explanation II

of <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_231">Section 2(2)</a> of Act No.30 of 1987 was not yet declared as

arbitrary by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/410919/" id="a_232">Peddinti Venkata Murali

Andhra Pradesh</a> (referred supra), which is in pari materia to sub-

section (22) of <a href="/doc/1743918/" id="a_233">Section 2</a>. But, still, it is deemed to be valid as on

the date and those two provisions declared by the Apex Court as

illegal is deemed to have been revived by fiction, from the date of

the Act came into force by operation of law. Therefore, the

petitioner is not entitled to claim any right in property which

vested on an institution governed by the provisions of Act No.30 of

1987 and Inams Act by Act No.16 of 2013. If, any different

interpretation is given, it amounts to disowning the duty to protect

it would take away the valuable right of the institution. To strike

the balance between the rights of an institution and an individual,

more particularly, religious institution, where the property belongs

to the institution and deity who is a perpetual minor, not protected

by anyone, we find that giving retrospective effect to the provision

is not unconstitutional and taking away the rights of the citizens in

immovable property, if acquired legally, such citizen is entitled for

such protection. But, when title is acquired in contravention of the

provision of law, such protection cannot be extended to such illegal

acquisition of right in the property. Therefore, we find no

substance in the contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioner and the same is hereby rejected holding that, giving

retrospective effect to the amended provisions is in accordance

with law.

in dispute in the prohibited list under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_236">Section 22-A</a> of Registration

Act is not an illegality, since the alienations are deemed to be null

proviso to <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_238">Section 7</a> by Act No.16 of 2013.        Therefore, we are

unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the

to property is not a fundamental right. However, the right vested

on the citizen is illegal, then the State is not bound to protect such

legal right in an immovable property of a citizen when such right

was acquired by illegal means and contrary to the provisions of

          One of the contentions raised before this Court is that, when

an Act leads to absurdity, the Court can declare such statute as

illegal and drawn attention of this Court to the judgment of the

Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1534012/" id="a_243">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Malik Zarid Khalid48</a>,

wherein, the Supreme Court held as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">        &quot;It is true that there are situations in which Courts are compelled to
        subordinate the plain meaning of statutory language. Not unoften,
        Courts do read down the plain language of a provision or give it a
        restricted meaning, where, to do otherwise may be clearly opposed

judgment referred supra, if the statute in its restricted meaning, if

opposed to the object and scheme of the Act or may lead to

absurdity illegal or unconstitutional results, such statute has to be

struck down. But, in the present case, Act No.16 of 2013 would

not result in any absurdity and unconstitutionality. Hence, in view

of our foregoing discussion, we find no ground to declare Act No.16

of 2013 as arbitrary and consequently, W.P.No.27655 of 2016 is

       The main contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioners before this Court is that, the first petitioner owned and

possessed an extent of land of Ac.1-30 cents situated in

Sy.No.615/1 of Dhulipalla Village, Sattenapalli Mandal, Guntur

District, purchased under a registered sale deed dated 25.03.1997

(Document No.513 of 1997) from C. Lakshminarayana, who had

purchased the same under registered sale deed dated 30.03.1990

(Document No.469 of 1990) from Chadalavada Nagamani. The said

individual got the property under a Registered Settlement Deed

dated 27.07.1961 (Document No.2693 of 1961).                        The second

petitioner is the co-owner and possessor of an extent of Ac.2-38

cents in the same survey number and the land was purchased

under a registered deed dated 01.09.2014 (Document No.5105 of

2014) from Ande Venkata Prasad and others, who had purchased

the    property    vide   Registered        Sale   Deed   dated      18.06.2014

(Document No.2487 of 2014) from Nagarjuna Educational Society.

The said society had purchased the same under a registered sale

deed    dated     08.03.2001   (Document           No.392   of     2001)         from

Chadalavada Naamani, who had got part of the property by virtue

of a document dated 10.05.1960 and part of it, under a Registered

Settlement Deed dated 27.07.1961 (Document No.2693 of 1961).

</p><p id="p_113">       Though the petitioners claimed that they purchased the

property from different persons, they admitted that the grant was

made in favour of the original grantee to perform Devadasi Services

and it is classified as &quot;Devadasi Inam&quot;. The resettlement register

prepared by the Fort St.George Administration, as per the

provisions of the Madras Survey Act, 1897 and BSO-1, the land

was classified as &quot;Temple Dancing Service&quot;, in column No.15

(remarks column) and further, the names of &quot;Bogam Gunturu Peda

Kondama and Mahalakshmi and others&quot; are shown as inamdars in

column No.14. In column No.5, the land is shown as &quot;I&quot; i.e inam

and the grant was a personal grant in lieu of &quot;Devadasi Service&quot;

rendered by the inamdars.
</p>
<p id="p_114">      These petitioners admitted that the original grant was made

in favour of the original grantee to perform Devadasi Services, as

shown in column No.15 (remarks column) in the resettlement

register prepared by the Fort St.George Administration, under the

provisions of the Madras Survey Act, 1897 and BSO-1, where the

land is described as &quot;Temple Dancing Service&quot;, who in-turn sold

the property to various persons and these petitioners purchased

the property finally. But, the original grantees or these petitioners

cannot be compelled to render such services, as Devadasi Service

is prohibited in the State of Madras and also in the State of Andhra

Pradesh by enacting the statute known as &quot;Madras Devadasis

(Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947, (which is adopted by the State

of   Andhra   Pradesh,   known   as   Andhra    Pradesh       Devadasis

(Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1988. Thus, rendering service of

Devadasi in the temple i.e. dance in the temple is totally prohibited

and it is an offence. When such services are prohibited in the State

of Andhra Pradesh, compelling the original grantee to render such

service is immoral and attracts penal consequences. No doubt,

when the inam is burdened with service as long as inamdars are

rendering service, they are entitled to enjoy the property, but,

when such service is prohibited by the State itself, compelling

them to render such prohibited service is an illegality. Rendering

such traditional service of &quot;Devadasi&quot; is a nasty or ugly practice

being rendered by the Devadasis, since a girl or woman was

dedicated to the Deity and such girl or woman was exploited by the

villagers sexually, hence it is difficult to issue such direction to

render service in the temple by this Court when it is prohibited.

</p><p id="p_115">      It is the specific contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioners that, when Devadasi Services are prohibited and when

the grant is personal grant, the inamdars are entitled to sell the

property, though it is not un-enfranchised. But, this contention

cannot be accepted, for the simple reason that, as long as inam is

un-enfranchised, the inamdar is not entitled to claim right in the

property as freehold. But, only when the inam is enfranchised by

following the procedure under Chapter II, Part I, B.S.O 52 of The

Andhra Pradesh Board of Revenue Standing Orders. B.S.O Nos. 52

&amp; 53 is the relevant rule and it deals with Rules of the inam

settlement and their application to fresh cases. The effect of

enfranchisement of imams is dealt in B.S.O.53 and Clause (1)

deals with position of enfranchised imams. According to it, in the

case of imams enfranchised by the Inam Commissioner, whatever

be their previous tenure there should be no interference of the

Collector. These imams stand in the same position as ryotwari

lands for the purpose of succession, transfer subdivision and sale

for areas of quit-rent. They may also be accepted as security for

any purpose in the same manner as ryotwari lands.

</p><p id="p_116">      Part II of Unfranchised Service Inams consists of B.S.O.54,

which deals with Religions and charitable imams. According to

Clause (1), it is the duty of the Collector, Divisional Officer and

Tahsildar to see that imams confirmed by the Inam Commissioner

for the benefit of or for service to be rendered to any religious or
                                                                  CPK,J &amp; MSM, J

charitable institution or for the maintenance of irrigation works, or

other works of public utility, are not enjoyed without the terms of

the grant being fulfilled. Religious and charitable imams fall under

two distinct classes, viz.;
</p>
<p id="p_117">   (A) (i) Inams granted for the support or maintenance of

       charitable and religious institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_118">      (ii) Inams granted for the performance of a charity or service

      connected with Hindu religious institutions.

</p><p id="p_119">      (iii) Inams granted for any other Hindu religious charities.

   (B) Other imams.
</p>
<p id="p_120">      Resumption and re-grant of Ryotwari Patta in respect of

Inams falling under class (A) are governed by the provisions of the

Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and

<a href="/doc/377820/" id="a_246">Endowments Act</a>, 1966 (Act XVII of 1966) and the procedure

prescribed in the Act and the rules framed under it contained in

Appendix-II should be strictly followed in respect of them.

</p><p id="p_121">      Clause (2) of B.S.O.54 deals with resumption of religious and

charitable imams, a religious or charitable imams may be resumed

on the ground that the terms of the grant are not observed. A

particular case of non-observance of the terms of the grant occurs

where institution or service is deprived by alienation or otherwise,

of the whole or a portion of the land in respect of which the title-

deed was issued, provided that the alienation of the land, whether

by sale, lease, mortgage, or otherwise shall not be treated as an

alienation of the inam, if such alienation is subject to the payment

to the institution or in support of the service of a sum not less than

the net assessment on the land, and provided further that if the

service is performed by the alienee, the alienee shall be recognised
                                                                   CPK,J &amp; MSM, J

                                 54                                             AND
                                                      W.P. Nos.39704 &amp; 42318 of 2017




as the inamdar and the inam shall not be resumed. The power of

recognizing the alienee as the inamdar shall rest n the authority

competent to resume the inam.
</p>
<p id="p_122">      Thus, Clause (2) of B.S.O.54 is relevant for deciding the real

controversy with regard to resumption of the land granted in

favour of the original inamdars. But, when the service imams or

the successors alienated the property and fail to render services to

the temple, by following necessary procedure prescribed under

B.S.O.54, the Revenue Department can take possession of the

property and after resumption, the property shall be regranted for

the same institution by following procedure under B.S.O.54.

</p><p id="p_123">      But, in the present facts of the case, though, the original

grantee or the successors are not rendering service, the court

cannot direct either the original grantee or successors to render

Devadasi service which is prohibited by the Act.

</p><p id="p_124">      The Devadasi system is a Hindu religious practice which

offers prepubescent girls in marriage to deities. As &#x27;servants&#x27;

ordained by deities, Devadasis are ritually forced to offer sexual

services upon attaining puberty. Their virginity is sold and they are

paid a pittance for their services, if at all. Devadasis are

marginalised as &#x27;fallen women&#x27; and kept in poverty. With age,

Devadasis   are    deemed   undesirable.   They      turn    to      begging,

trafficking or engaging manual labour to earn their livelihood.

Devadasis    are   overwhelmingly     &#x27;identified&#x27;   from       the        Dalit

community, which lies excluded from the caste system and is

subject to systemic socio-economic oppression. Poverty-stricken

Dalit families may also dedicate daughters to earn livelihoods,

avoid paying dowry and receive divine help or cure from disease.</p><pre id="pre_8">

Devadasis&#x27;      children        are      stigmatised         by       society            and

</pre><p id="p_125">unacknowledged by their fathers. Devadasis are perpetually

trapped in cycles of poverty, vulnerability and sexual and

psychological abuse. Central Government is obliged to end

institutions similar to slavery, the exploitation of children, human

trafficking and forced marriages under Articles 10(1) and 10(3) of

the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural

Rights; Articles 8(1), 23(3) and 24(1) of the International Covenant

on Civil and Political Rights; Articles 6 and 16(1) of the Convention

on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women;

Articles 19, 24(3), 32(1), 34 and 36 of the Convention on the Rights

of the Child; and <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_247">Article 1</a> of the Supplementary Convention on the

Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and

Practices Similar to Slavery. Domestic laws in the state of Andhra

Pradesh      and        other   states    like   Tamil       Nadu,         Karnataka,

Maharashtra have prohibited the practice of dedicating Devadasis

and deemed previous dedications as unlawful. <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_248">The Act</a>s penalise

all   persons      performing,        participating     in    or       abetting           the

performance        of     Devadasi       dedications.    Though             one         man

commission submitted a report on Devadasi System - The

rehabilitation programme has been running but its effectiveness is

questionable. There is little awareness of the programme and it

fails to provide adequate economic, medical and legal support for

reintegration of women and girls fleeing the system. It is unknown

how many Devadasis have been successfully rehabilitated. The

Central Government considers the Devadasi system to be an issue

of policing and public order. This classification entrenches the

system in two ways. First, by regarding the Devadasi system as a
                                                                        CPK,J &amp; MSM, J

matter of &#x27;policing&#x27; and &#x27;public order&#x27;, the Indian government fails

to account for the social, economic and religious factors that

perpetuate the Devadasi system. The system continues because it

is religiously sanctioned, allows economic exploitation, preys on

landless Dalits and gives upper-caste men control over the bodies

and sexualities of Dalit females. Second, under the scheme of

distribution of powers in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian

Constitution, all matters relating to policing and public order

become the responsibility of state governments. Consequently,

there are no uniform laws, policies or welfare programs in the

country.
