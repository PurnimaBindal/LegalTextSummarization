Hon&#x27;ble Samit Gopal,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Ref: Delay Condonation Application No. 58550 of 2011.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">Heard Sri Prem Narayan Singh, Advocate holding brief of Sri Anil Srivastava, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri Ankit Srivastava, learned State counsel.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">This appeal is reported to be beyond time by 118 days. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">Vide order dated 24.2.2011, learned A.G.A. was granted time to file counter objection in reply to the affidavit filed in support of delay condonation application.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">No objection has been filed by the State till date. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">I have perused the delay condonation application and the affidavit filed in support thereof. Cause shown is sufficient. The delay condonation application is allowed.
</p> 
<p id="p_7">Delay in filing the appeal is condoned.
</p> 
<p id="p_8">Order on Appeal.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">The present appeal has been filed with the prayer that imprisonment of three years and fine of Rs. 3000/- awarded to the opposite party no. 2 to 4 in Sessions Trial No. 232 of 2005, <a href="/doc/139618288/" id="a_1">State vs. Jaswant and others</a>, under <a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_2">Section 365</a> I.P.C. be enhanced up to seven years. 
</p> 
<p id="p_10">Learned counsel for the appellant argued that as per the statute conviction of an accused under the said section is up to seven years imprisonment with fine but the trial court has awarded lesser punishment to the accused/respondents and therefore, the sentence be enhanced up to seven years.
</p> 
<p id="p_11">I have perused the impugned judgement and order of conviction. The trial court by means of a detailed and cogent judgement and order, has convicted the accused/respondents no. 2 to 4 and sentenced them to undergo three years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.3,000/-. Even the question of sentence was heard by the trial court and then sentence was awarded. 
</p> 
<p id="p_12">I am of the view that the impugned judgement and order of trial court does not suffer from any such infirmity or illegality which may call for any interference by this court as the same is well substantiated with sound reasoning. No argument has been raised as to why the sentence as awarded be enhanced, except for the argument that the statute prescribes punishment with imprisonment which may extend up to seven years. 
</p> 
<p id="p_13">Accordingly, the appeal stands dismissed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_14">Office shall communicate this order to the concerned trial court forthwith. 
</p>
