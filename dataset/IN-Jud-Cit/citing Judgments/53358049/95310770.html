          The plaintiff states that it has also spent considerable sums of money
          on the promotion of the said trade marks. The plaintiff has launched a
          website by the name of www.monsoonharvestfarms.com. It also has a
          Facebook page under the name &#x27;Monsoon Harvest Farms&#x27;, created on

          of a Youtube Channel by the name of &#x27;Monsoon Harvest Farms&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_14">          8.       It is the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff learnt of the

          HARVEST&#x27; upon the issuance of the Examination Report by the
          Trade Marks Registry with respect to the trade mark application no.
          3688132 filed by the plaintiff under Class 30, wherein the defendant&#x27;s

          made and the plaintiff has already filed a request for an amendment of
          its reply to the Examination Report in Application no.3688132 to state
          that the defendant&#x27;s mark is subsequent to that of the plaintiff. The
          plaintiff states that as far as the other application is concerned, the
          same has already been advertised and the plaintiff shall make
          appropriate submissions in its counter-statement, which the plaintiff
          would be filing to the notice of opposition filed by the defendant.

          has been opposed by the defendant in the present case, taking a stand
          that the two marks are &#x27;completely identical&#x27; and would mislead the
          general public and traders to believe that the goods manufactured by
          the said plaintiff are also of the defendant. The plaintiff asserts that,
          therefore, the defendant is estopped from taking a defence that the
          marks are different.
</p><p id="p_18">          11.      The plaintiff has since also filed oppositions against the
          registrations of the defendant for the word mark &#x27;MONSOON

<p id="p_19">          12.      The plaintiff submits that in the counter-statement filed by the
          defendant for both opposition proceedings, the defendant, while on the
          one hand claimed that the defendant&#x27;s mark is distinctive, on the other
          hand, claims that the words &#x27;Monsoon&#x27; and &#x27;Harvest&#x27; are common to
          trade and cannot be claimed to be owned by one person/entity.
</p><p id="p_20">          13.      The plaintiff submits that during the pendency of the opposition
          proceedings before the Trade Marks Registry, the defendant also
          registered a domain name www.monsoonharvest.in (registered on
          September, 2015, which became active only in the year 2017) and is
          also using the &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST&#x27; marks on the same social
          media platforms as the plaintiff, that is, Facebook and Instagram. The
          plaintiff asserts that the activity on the said accounts began in the year
          2016 only, that is more than a decade subsequent to the adoption and
          use of the mark &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST FARMS&#x27; by the plaintiff.

          the plaintiff with a dishonest intention to deceive the consumer and
          the public. Such adoption and use of the marks by the defendant
          amounts to infringment of the plaintiff&#x27;s trade marks, passing off, and
          unfair competition.

          marks, used by the defendant for the goods falling under Class 30. The
          defendant has been making millet-based nutrition bars, cookies,

          snack bars and confectionary under the &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST&#x27;
          marks since the year 2015. The business of the defendant is not solely

</p><p id="p_33">          22.      Mr. Chander M. Lall, the learned senior counsel for the
          plaintiff, submits that the adoption and use of the &#x27;MONSOON
          HARVEST&#x27; marks by the defendant amounts to a flagrant violation
          of the plaintiff&#x27;s intellectual property rights, infringement of its trade
          mark, passing off of the goods of the defendant as those of the
          plaintiff, as also unfair competition.
</p><p id="p_34">          23.      He submits that by virtue of being the prior user as also being
          the registered proprietor of the marks, the plaintiff has the exclusive
          right to use the &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST FARMS&#x27; marks in India.
          He states that unauthorised use of a mark deceptively and confusingly
          similar to the &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST FARMS&#x27; marks by the
          defendant would lead to erosion of the distinctiveness of the
          &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST FARMS&#x27; marks of the plaintiff, which
          enjoy an enormous reputation and goodwill in India.

          counsel for the plaintiff submits that the defendant cannot at this stage
          be permitted to take a contrary stand and adopt a virtually identical
          mark and domain name in relation to the identical goods, that is,
          edible goods.
</p><p id="p_36">          25.      On the submission of the defendant that the goods of the
          plaintiff and the defendant are different, he submits that the plaintiff
          and the defendant deal in similar goods, that is, food items and,
          therefore, the artificial distinction drawn by the defendant is incorrect.
</p><p id="p_37">          26.      He submits that merely because the registration obtained by the
          plaintiff of its trade marks is restricted to Edible Oils and Raw and
          unprocessed agricultural products etc., would not make a difference to
          its claim in the present suit. He submits that the plaintiff had to restrict
          the goods covered in its application as at that time the plaintiff was
          dealing only in those goods.
</p><p id="p_38">          27.      He submits that merely because the defendant has transacted in
          a higher volume of sale would also not come to its aid, inasmuch as,
          the right of the prior adopter of the mark shall trump that of the
          subsequent adopter of the mark. He submits that even a single use of
          the mark is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to seek protection of its
          mark. In support, he places reliance on the judgement of this Court in
          Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar &amp; Co.,1977 SCC OnLine Del

          though the plaintiff has shown instances of actual confusion being
          caused amongst the customers due to the adoption of a similar mark
          by the defendant, the plaintiff is not to show that the adoption of the
          marks by the defendant was fraudulent. Once it is shown that the
          marks are similar for similar goods, an injunction must follow. In

          the plaintiff to the Examination Report is not relevant. In any case, for
          one of such applications, the plaintiff has already filed an application
          seeking amendment of its reply.

          for the defendant, at the outset submits that the defendant has now
          adopted a new mark, that is, &#x27;WINGREENS MONSOON
          HARVEST&#x27;, which creates an even-wider difference between the
          marks of the plaintiff and the defendant. He submits that it is trite law
          that marks have to be compared as a whole and with the affixation of
          the prefix &#x27;WINGREENS&#x27;, there exists no question of either
          infringement or passing off of            the marks of the plaintiff by the

          of a house mark, especially when such house mark also has a certain
          reputation and goodwill, would obviate any chance of confusion in the
          mind of an unwary consumer.

          plaintiff is estopped from taking a stand that the marks of the plaintiff
          and the defendant are visually, phonetically and/or structurally similar.
          Drawing the attention of this Court to the response to the Examination
          Report filed by the plaintiff in the application no. 3688133 and
          3688132, wherein the plaintiff stated that the competing marks were
          visually, phonetically and structually different, and accordingly there
          could not be any confusion as to the source of origin, the learned
          senior counsel for the defendant asserts that the plaintiff cannot take a
          contradictory stand now. He submits that for this reason alone, the
          Suit and the application are liable to be dismissed. He submits that
          though the plaintiff has moved an application seeking to withdraw
          such admission in one of the trade mark applications, no such attempt
          has been made for the other. He submits that even otherwise, the

</p><p id="p_48">          33.      The learned senior counsel for the defendant submits that the
          plaintiff had originally applied for registration of its marks under
          Application Nos. 3688135 and 3688134 under Class 29 for &#x27;Organic
          Food, Processed and Raw and Other under this Class&#x27;. On the
          direction from the Registry to limit the scope of these applications, the
          plaintiff, by way of an amendment, restricted the scope of the
          applications only to edible oils.            Similarly, for Application No.
          3688137 under Class 30, the plainitff restricted the application to
          &#x27;Raw and unprocessed agricultural, horticultural products; raw and
          unprocessed grains and seeds; fresh fruit and vegetable and fresh
          herbs‟. By the said conduct, the plaintiff has disentitled himself from
          claiming a right in respect of the goods beyond what are specifically
          mentioned in the registrations granted. In support, he places reliance
          on <a href="/doc/50578813/" id="a_11">Mittal Electronics v. Sujata Home Appliances (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors.,

</p><p id="p_51">          35.      The learned senior counsel for the defendant submits the
          defendant, in any case, is an honest and concurrent user of the marks
          and is entitled to protection of its user of the marks under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_14">Section 34</a>
          of the Act.             He submits that the defendant began using the
          &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST&#x27; marks for processed food items in the year
          2015, while the plaintiff began using the &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST
          FARMS&#x27; marks with respect to pickles, that is a processesed food
          item, only in the year 2017. Therefore, the defendant is the prior user
          of the marks for the processed food items.
          ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
</p><p id="p_52">          36.      I have considered the submissions made by the learned senior
          counsels for both the parties.
</p><p id="p_53">         i. Whether the marks in question are deceptively similar?
</p><p id="p_54">          37.      The first issue that needs to be determined is whether the two
          marks, which are, &#x27;MONSOON HARVEST FARMS&#x27; of the plaintiff
          and &#x27;WINGREENS MONSOON HARVEST&#x27; of the defendant, are
          deceptively similar to each other. In my prima facie view, the two
          marks are deceptively similar to each other. The addition of the word
          &#x27;WINGREENS&#x27; to the marks of the defendant is not sufficient to
          bring about a distinction in the two marks.
</p><p id="p_55">          38.      The test to be applied in determining whether the marks in
          question are deceptively similar to each other is that of an unwary
          purchaser with an average intelligence and imperfect recollection. The
          Supreme Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, (1963)
          2 SCR 484, has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                                     &quot;6. It will be noticed that the words used in

                                     „likely to deceive or cause confusion‟. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_15">The Act</a>
                                     does not lay down any criteria for determining
                                     what is likely to deceive or cause confusion.</blockquote>

                                     particular facts, and the value of authorities
                                     lies not so much in the actual decision as in
                                     the tests applied for determining what is likely
                                     to deceive or cause confusion. On an
                                     application to register, the Registrar or an
                                     opponent may object that the trade mark is not
                                     registrable by reason of clause (a) of <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_16">Section
                                     8</a>, or sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_17">Section 10</a>, as in this
                                     case. In such a case the onus is on the
                                     applicant to satisfy the Registrar that the trade
                                     mark applied for is not likely to deceive or
                                     cause confusion. In cases in which the tribunal
                                     considers that there is doubt as to whether
                                     deception is likely, the application should be
                                     refused. A trade mark is likely to deceive or
                                     cause confusion by its resemblance to another
                                     already on the register if it is likely to do so in
                                     the course of its legitimate use in a market
                                     where the two marks are assumed to be in use
                                     by traders in that market. In considering the
                                     matter, all the circumstances of the case must
                                     be considered. As was observed by Parker, J.
                                     in Pianotist Co.&#x27;s Application, Re [(1906) 23

                                     For deceptive resemblance two important
                                     questions are: (1) who are the persons whom
                                     the resemblance must be likely to deceive or
                                     confuse, and (2) what rules of comparison are
                                     to be adopted in judging whether such
                                     resemblance exists. As to confusion, it is
                                     perhaps an appropriate description of the
                                     state of mind of a customer who, on seeing a

                                     goods which he has previously bought, but is

                                     disputed before us that the two names
                                     „Amritdhara‟ and „Lakshmandhara‟ are in use
                                     in respect of the same description of goods,

                                     alleviation of various ailments. Such medicinal
                                     preparation will be purchased mostly by
                                     people who instead of going to a doctor wish
                                     to purchase a medicine for the quick
                                     alleviation of their suffering, both villagers
                                     and townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate. As

                                     142 : (1960) 1 SCR 968] the question has to
                                     be approached from the point of view of a man
                                     of average intelligence and imperfect
                                     recollection. To such a man the overall
                                     structural and phonetic similarity of the two
                                     names „Amritdhara‟ and „Lakshmandhara‟ is,
                                     in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause
                                     confusion. We must consider the overall
                                     similarity of the two composite words
                                     „Amritdhara‟ and „Lakshmandhara‟. We do
                                     not think that the learned Judges of the High
                                     Court were right in saying that no Indian
                                     would mistake one for the other. An unwary
                                     purchaser of average intelligence and
                                     imperfect recollection would not, as the High
                                     Court supposed, split the name into its
                                     component       parts    and     consider     the
                                     etymological meaning thereof or even
                                     consider the meaning of the composite words
                                     as „current of nectar‟ or „current of
                                     Lakshman‟. He would go more by the overall
                                     structural and phonetic similarity and the
                                     nature of the medicine he has previously
                                     purchased, or has been told about, or about
                                     which has otherwise learnt and which he
                                     wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to
                                     goods largely sold to illiterate or badly
                                     educated persons, it is no answer to say that a

                                     meaning; to give it meaning one must further
                                     make the inference that the „current or stream‟
                                     is as pure and strong as Lakshman of the
                                     Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or
                                     townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the
                                     story of the Ramayana being familiar to him;
                                     but we doubt if he would etymologise to the
                                     extent of seeing the so-called ideological
                                     difference      between       „Amritdhara‟      and
                                     „Lakshmandhara‟. He would go more by the
                                     similarity of the two names in the context of
                                     the widely-known medicinal preparation
                                     which he wants for his ailments.
</p><p id="p_60">                                     8. We agree that the use of the word „dhara‟
                                     which literally means „current or stream‟ is
                                     not by itself decisive of the matter. What we
                                     have to consider here is the overall similarity
                                     of the composite words, having regard to the
                                     circumstance that the goods bearing the two
                                     names are medicinal preparations of the same
                                     description. We are aware that the admission
                                     of a mark is not to be refused, because
                                     unusually stupid people, „fools or idiots‟, may
                                     be deceived. A critical comparison of the two
                                     names may disclose some points of difference
                                     but an unwary purchaser of average
                                     intelligence and imperfect recollection would
                                     be deceived by the overall similarity of the two
                                     names having regard to the nature of the
                                     medicine he is looking for with a somewhat
                                     vague recollection that he had purchased a
                                     similar medicine on a previous occasion with
                                     a similar name. The trade mark is the whole
                                     thing -- the whole word has to be considered.

                                     similar to the registered trademark of the

<p id="p_64">          40.      Therefore, mere addition of the word &#x27;WINGREENS&#x27; cannot
          reduce the deceptive similarity of the mark of the defendant with that
          the plaintiff. I find that even with this addition there is a strong
          likelihood of the defendant&#x27;s mark being confused with the mark of
          the plaintiff. Accordingly, I find that the two marks in question are
          similar to each other.

<p id="p_66">          41.      This now takes me on to the second issue as to whether the

                                     opponent. The mark applied by applicant
                                     would definitely mislead the general public

                                     deceive public or cause confusion and also is

          both the parties, therefore, leaving for this Court to determine whether

          position where the plaintiff therein had obtained registration of its

          the Examination Report was not similar. The Court in the factual

                                     before the Trade Marks Registry, would be
                                     disentitled for any equitable relief by pleading
                                     to the contrary. The learned Single Judge had
                                     referred to the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/178024454/" id="a_22">Telecare

                                     in the facts of the present case. A party that

                                     dissimilar to a cited mark and obtains a

                                     mark &quot;KEI&quot; in Class 11 (Application
                                     No.3693719). The Trade Marks Registry had
                                     cited three marks in its Examination Report
                                     including      the    impugned      trademark
                                     (Application No.3256919). In its response to
                                     the Examination Report, the respondent had,
                                     inter alia, stated &quot;......the services of the

                                     rights and contentions. Undoubtedly, the
                                     respondent had reserved its right to avail of
                                     appropriate remedies in respect of the
                                     impugned trademark, however, reserving a
                                     right to avail of other remedies would not
                                     include the right to make a contrary assertion.
                                     A party approaching the Trade Marks Registry
                                     must be held to its statements made before the

                                     to make a factual assertion contrary to what it
                                     claims before the Trade Marks Registry. For
                                     this reason, as well, it was not permissible for
                                     the respondent to claim that the goods covered
                                     under its trademarks were similar to those of
                                     the appellant.&quot;

          contradictory stand has been taken by the plaintiff, has not proceeded
          to registration. The plaintiff is not claiming its relief in the present suit
          based only on these applications. The plaintiff has also filed an
          application seeking to amend its reply in one of the applications.
          Therefore, in my opinion, the above judgment would not come to
          much assistance for the defendant.
</p><p id="p_78">          46.      Though various other judgments have also been cited by both
          the parties on this issue, in view of the judgment of this Court in
          Raman Kwatra &amp; Anr. (supra), laying down the law on the subject, I
          need not revisit the same by discussing various other judgments that
          have been cited by the parties. Suffice it to say that becaue of both the
          parties taking contradictory stands before this Court and before the
          Registrar of Trade Marks, the present application is being decided on
          merit rather than on the basis of the stand taken by them before the
          Registrar of Trade Marks.
</p><p id="p_79">          iii. Whether the goods in question are similar?
</p><p id="p_80">          47.      Another question that arises for consideration is as to whether
          the goods of the plaintiff and that of the defendant are similar. As
          noted hereinabove, it is the case of the defendant that the plaintiff has
          registered its marks for edible oils, raw and unprocessed agricultural,
          horticultural products, and fresh fruits and vegetables etc., while the
          defendant deals in processed food items like millet based nutrition
          bars, cookies, muesli etc. and therefore, these goods are not similar. It
          is, therefore, argued by the defendant that the goods are different and,
          therefore, there is no possibility of confusion being caused due to the
          use of the impugned marks by the defendant.

          observed that the respective goods of the plaintiff and the defendant
          are under the umbrella of food items; the plaintiff deals in the sale of
          raw and unprocessed agricultural and horticultural products, while the
          defendant sells processed food items such as granola bars, energy
          bars, cookies, bread and other confections. The intended purpose for
          both the plaintiff and the defendant is to market and sell their food
          items to the public at large. The respective users of the goods of both
          the parties are the end point retail consumers. The plaintiff and the
          defendant are entities which come under the food industry. Moreover,
          the goods of the parties would be normally sold through the same
          supply chain to the same customers who may consider the items sold
          by the defendant as emanating from the plaintiff. In fact, the plaintiff

</p><p id="p_116">          58.      In Vishnudas (supra), the Supreme Court allowed the
          rectification of the registration granted in favour of the respondent
          no.1 therein, on the ground of non-user of the registered mark in
          respect of &#x27;quiwam‟ and &#x27;zarda‟ by the respondent no.1 company. The
          Court held that though varieties of articles are made out of tobacco,
          they are used differently and have a distinctive quality and separate
          identity; in common trade channels such articles are not only held
          different and as distinct articles, but are marketed separately. The
          Court held that if a trader or a manufacturer actually trades in or
          manufactures only in one or some of the articles coming under a broad
          classification and such trader or manufacturer has no bona fide
          intention to trade in or manufacture other goods or articles which also
          fall under the said broad classification, such trader or manufacturer
          should not be permitted to enjoy a monopoly in respect of all the
          articles which may come under such broad classification and by that
          process preclude the other traders or manufacturers to get registration
          of separate and distinct goods, which may also be part of the product
          classification. The Court, however, clarified that its observations are
          only confined to the propriety and validity of the order of rectification
          of the registration of the trade mark in favour of the respondent
          company and it is not extended to a question of infringement of trade
          mark or passing off. In the present case, the claim of the plaintiff is of
          infringement and passing off and, therefore, has to be determined on
          the basis of the principles that have been laid down by the Courts for
          testing the same.

          registration for the mark in goods which were held to be different
          from those of the respondent. The Court held that it was difficult to
          imagine that an average man of ordinary intelligence would associate
          the goods of the appellant as that of the respondent. The said

          that the respondent therein had failed to show that it had invented the
          said mark. The Court also found that the adoption of the mark by the

          items. Such food items, in my prima facie opinion, are cognate and

          complained mark used by the other persons and which is likely to

          association with the registered trade mark. Identity of the goods and
          identity of the services is relevant and raises a presumption of the
          likelihood of confusion in terms of <a href="/doc/1992076/" id="a_39">Section 29(2)(c)</a> of the Act,
          however, is not a sine qua non. In the present case the claim of the

          plaintiff would fall in the scope of <a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_40">Section 29(2)(b)</a> of the Act as the
          marks are prima facie deceptively similar and the goods are also
          similar to each other.

          Trade Marks to limit the scope of protection sought in its applications,
          the plaintiff conceded to the same by restricting the scope of the
          registration to edible oils and raw and unprocessed agricultural and
          horticultural products etc., the plaintiff shall still be entitled to an
          interim injunction as, in my prima facie opinion, the plaintiff has been
