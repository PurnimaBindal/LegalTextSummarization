<p id="p_3"> Case of the plaintiffs

</p><p id="p_4">3.     Plaintiff No.1 was originally incorporated under the trading style
of Hoechst Fedco Pharma Pvt. Ltd. in May, 1956. Plaintiff No.1's
corporate name was changed to Sanofi India Ltd. with effect from
May 11, 2012 consequent to a change of name of its parent company
from 'Sanofi Aventis' to 'Sanofi' in May, 2011, in an effort to provide a
common identity to the Sanofi Group globally. Plaintiff No.1 is a
strong and cohesive entity in the field of pharmacy and medicine and
is engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing
of prescription based pharmaceutical products as well as over-the-
counter (OTC) medication. It is also urged that plaintiff No.1 has a
strong presence in seven major therapeutic areas viz. Diabetes,
Oncology, Cardiovascular diseases, Thrombosis, Central Nervous
System disorders and Internal Medicine.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       Plaintiff No.2 was incorporated in 1971 and is one of the
leading pharmaceutical companies in India and is engaged in the
manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical
products. Plaintiff No.2 is the holder and proprietor of the
trademark/name UNIVERSAL in relation to inter alia pharmaceutical
and nutraceutical products which constitute an integral and dominant
part of plaintiff No.2's corporate name/trading style since 1971.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.      Plaintiff No.2's trademark UNIVERSAL is used in relation to a
wide range of plaintiff No.2's pharmaceutical and nutraceutical
products such as UNIVERSAL PRIMOSA, UNIVERSAL'S ICE GEL
etc. Plaintiff No.2 has secured registration of the UNIVERSAL




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                          Page 2 of 45</span>
 family/series of marks in India. The details whereof are provided in
Annexure - A to the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.     Plaintiff No.2 has developed a series of trade dresses for the
packaging/cartons and strips of its pharmaceutical products which
comprise a distinct layout, get up, colour scheme and arrangement of
features closely resembling one another. One of these trade dresses
is used in relation with plaintiff No.2's Soft Gel capsules marketed
under the trademark UNIVERSAL PRIMOSA (hereinafter referred to
as "the PRIMOSA trade dress") the essential elements whereof are
as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     a) An overall silver background

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     b) A bright pink device comprising an artistic rectangle with a
       curved lower right corner, hereinafter referred to as the 'Curved
       Rectangle Device'.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     c) The trade mark PRIMOSA prominently appearing within the
       Curved Rectangular Device.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">6.     The PRIMOSA trade dress was created at the instance of the
plaintiff No.2 in exchange for consideration by an independent
agency A.V. Graphics and constitutes an original artistic work within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_1">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957. Plaintiff No.2
is therefore the proprietor of the said trade dress and is entitled to the
exclusive reproduction thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.     In November, 2011 plaintiff No.1 entered into an agreement to
acquire plaintiff No.2's business of marketing and distribution of
branded nutraceutical formulations in India. As per the terms of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                           Page 3 of 45</span>
 acquisition, plaintiff No.2 transferred its entire nutraceutical portfolio
comprising over 40 branded formulations representing key categories
within the nutraceutical market such as antioxidants, vitamins and
mineral supplements, anti-arthritics, anti-osteoporotics, liver tonics
and other nutrients to plaintiff No.2. This transfer also entailed an
assignment of some trademarks from plaintiff No.2's UNIVERSAL
series/family of marks, which are specific to nutraceuticals, to plaintiff
No.1. Plaintiff No.1 is therefore the subsequent proprietor of the trade
mark UNIVERSAL and the UNIVERSAL family/series of marks in
relation to nutraceutical products while plaintiff No.2 continues to
retain proprietorship in relation to the trade mark and name
UNIVERSAL and the UNIVERSAL family/series of marks in relation
to its pharmaceutical products other than nutraceutical products.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.     It is the case of the plaintiffs that in or around March, 2014 the
plaintiffs became aware of the existence of the defendant company
through their representatives and were utterly shocked to know that
the defendant, engaged in the manufacture, marketing and
distribution of nutraceutical products, has adopted the corporate
name and trading style Universal Neutraceuticals Pvt. Ltd. It was
incorporated on 3rd May, 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.     It has been stated that the defendant company has been
formed by ex-employees of plaintiff No.2 whose services were taken
over by plaintiff No.1 consequent on the transfer of plaintiff No.2's
nutraceutical         business   to   plaintiff   No.1.   These   employees
subsequently left the services of plaintiff No.1 during the period
between October and December, 2013. The defendant's Board of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                               Page 4 of 45</span>
 Directors is constituted entirely by individuals who are spouses of the
ex-employees of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.    It is stated that the defendant has filed an application under No.
2589182 seeking registration of the impugned mark UNIVERSAL in
class 5 and the same is pending.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.    The      defendant   has    also   created    a   domain      name
&lt;universalneutraceuticals.com&gt; on 19th August, 2013 on the website
which was under construction. The trade mark UNIVERSAL was
prominently displayed on this "under construction" website. The
plaintiffs also allege that the defendant is marketing nutraceutical
products under trademarks like FREEMOVE which are clearly
inspired by some of plaintiff No.2's established trademarks such as
FREEFLEX etc.

</p><p id="p_14">12.    It is the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant has adopted a
trade dress comprising an identical get up, lay out, colour scheme
and arrangement of features as plaintiff No.2's PRIMOSA trade
dress. The defendant has even adopted a device which is identical to
plaintiff No.2's Curved Rectangular Device which forms the most
distinctive and essential feature of plaintiff No.2's PRIMOSA trade
dress.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.    It is stated by the plaintiffs that the defendant is therefore
clearly trying to deceive the general public by dishonest imitation of
plaintiff No.2's trade dress/packaging in the following manner:-
</p>
<p id="p_16"> (a)     Deliberate following of the overall silver background;
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                           Page 5 of 45</span>
<p id="p_17">  (b) Conspicuously displaying the Curved Rectangular Device which
       appears at exactly the same location and with the same degree
       of conspicuity as on plaintiff No.2's PRIMOSA packaging.
</p>
<p id="p_18"> (c) Prominently displaying the brand name of its products within
       the Curved Rectangular Device in the same manner as on
       plaintiff No.2's PRIMOSA packaging.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.    The plaintiffs issued a ceased and desist notice on 10th March,
2014 to the defendant refraining it from using the mark UNIVERSAL
(in isolation or in conjunction with any other mark including
NEUTRACEUTICALS) and any other mark, name, logo, including as
a        part         of   the      impugned       domain          name
www.universalneutraceuticals.com which may be deceptively similar
to the plaintiffs' well known trademark/name UNIVERSAL or dilutes
the distinctiveness thereof in the relevant field and also to withdraw
trademark application No. 2589182 in Class 5 for registration of the
impugned mark UNIVERSAL. The defendant in its reply to the notice
dated 24th March, 2014 refused to comply with the requisitions
contained in the notice. In addition, the defendant's website
www.universalneutraceuticals.com which was under construction
since the domain name was registered on 19th August, 2013 became
operational immediately after the defendant received the plaintiffs'
cease and desist notice. The rejoinder letter was sent to the
defendant by the plaintiffs on 4th April, 2014 granting them one final
opportunity to comply with the requisitions contained in the notice. As
there was no response on behalf of the defendant, the present suit
has been filed by the plaintiffs.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                         Page 6 of 45</span>
<p id="p_20"> 15.    It is submitted in the plaint by the plaintiffs that the defendant's
trade name 'Universal Neutraceuticals Pvt. Ltd' incorporates the
plaintiffs trade mark/name UNIVERSAL in entirety and when used in
conjunction with the word 'Nutraceuticals', draws a direct reference
to the plaintiff's products and services and is therefore, designed to
create      confusion.   The    impugned      mark/name      UNIVERSAL
NEUTRACEUTICALS used by the defendant is deceptively similar to
the trade marks UNIVERSAL SKINCEUTICALS and UNIVERSAL
DERMACEUTICALS which are registered in favour of plaintiff No.2 in
class 5 and were assigned to plaintiff No.1 vide the Deed of
Assignment dated 3rd November, 2011. Thus, the use of the
impugned mark/name UNIVERSAL NEUTRACEUTICALS by the
defendant therefore, amounts to infringement of trademark apart from
passing off their goods and business as those of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_21">       It is also alleged that each and every one of the unique and
artistic features of plaintiff No.2's PRIMOSA packaging has been
substantially reproduced and imitated by the defendants, in terms of
the get up, colour scheme, arrangements of features and lay out.
Therefore, the defendant's act clearly amount to infringement of
plaintiff No.2's copyright in the PRIMOSA packaging.
</p>
<p id="p_22">       The defendant's adoption of the trade name UNIVERSAL and
the impugned trade dress in respect of the said products and
business is approximately 42 years subsequent to plaintiff No.2's
adoption of the trade mark/name UNIVERSAL and is clearly in bad
faith. The malafide nature of the adoption of the impugned name and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                            Page 7 of 45</span>
 trade dress by the defendant is demonstrated by the formation of the
defendant company by ex-employees of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       The defendant's use of the plaintiff's trade mark/name
UNIVERSAL, either in isolation or in conjunction with the word
NEUTRACEUTICALS is bound to cause confusion among the
relevant class of consumers. A prudent and reasonable person is
bound to be misled into believing that the defendant's products
originate from the plaintiffs or that the defendant have an
association/relationship/sponsorship/affiliation/authorization or nexus
with the plaintiff on account of the following factors:
</p>
<p id="p_24">(a)    The defendant has adopted an identical trade name as plaintiff
       No.2      viz.   UNIVERSAL    in     conjunction   with    the     term
       NEUTRACEUTICAL which has an obvious affiliation with the
       plaintiff's products and business;
</p>
<p id="p_25">(b)    The defendant has reproduced plaintiff No.2's PRIMOSA trade
       dress including the use of the Curved Rectangular Device;
</p>
<p id="p_26">(c)    The defendant is selling identical products as those of the
       plaintiffs under the impugned name and trade dress;
</p>
<p id="p_27">(d)    The        defendant   has     created        a    domain        name
       &lt;universalneutraceutical.com&gt; which incorporates the plaintiff's
       trade mark/name UNIVERSAL in entirety and is suffixed with
       the word NEUTRACEUTICAL which has an obvious affiliation
       with the plaintiff's products and business.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                              Page 8 of 45</span>
<p id="p_28"> (e)    The defendant's sales representatives are informing members
       of the trade that they are dealing in 'genuine Universal
       products'.
</p>
<p id="p_29">16.    It is prayed in the interim application that the plaintiffs have
established a good prima facie case and the balance of convenience
also tilts in their favour. The defendant's use of a trade mark/name
identical to the plaintiffs clearly constitutes infringement and amounts
to passing off the defendant's products and business as that of the
plaintiffs and will inevitably cause confusion amongst the consumers.
Irreparable loss, damage and injury would be caused to the plaintiff's
goodwill, reputation and business if the defendant is not restrained by
an immediate interim injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_30">17.    No written-statement is filed on behalf of the defendant. In the
reply to the application filed by the defendant, it was stated that the
plaintiffs do not possess any exclusive rights in the trademark
UNIVERSAL. The plaintiffs have not produced any supporting
documents to show that plaintiffs are registered proprietors of
UNIVERSAL. The plaintiffs have relied upon several registrations for
UNIVERSAL formative marks, however, the said registrations are
only referred to as 'UNIVERSAL family series' marks by the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_31">18.    It is stated that the registration certificates and official extracts
furnished by the plaintiffs in relation to the UNIVERSAL formative
marks evidently establish that the plaintiffs have 'disclaimed' any
exclusive right to the word UNIVERSAL, particularly in reference to
Registration          Nos.   879887   [UNIVERSAL    DERMACEUTICALS],
879889       [UNIVERSAL         SKINCEUTICALS],     1356776      [Universal


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                             Page 9 of 45</span>
 ECOCAPS],             837377   [UNIVERSAL   SEACOD]      and     1356167
[Universal CHEWELS], whereby it is stated that the plaintiffs have
'agreed' to the said disclaimer condition. In view of the agreed
disclaimer condition, it is adequately substantiated that the plaintiffs
possess no exclusive rights over the word UNIVERSAL and cannot
therefore, enforce any rights over the same, much-less restrain the
bonafide use of UNIVERSAL logo by the defendant. It is further
stated that the plaintiffs, by suppressing the material fact of
disclaimer, have tried to overreach the due process of this Court in an
attempt to obtain ad-interim injunction against the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_32">19.    It is stated that the plaintiffs have made misleading averments
in the suit regarding long and continuous use of the trade mark
UNIVERSAL and its formative marks since 1971 who have also failed
to prove any subsisting or valid copyright in the PRIMOSA trade
dress as an artistic work, of which they allege to be the rightful
owners. The PRIMOSA trade dress is claimed to have been created
by an independent agency known by the name of A.V.Graphics, at
the instance of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have failed to produce the
details of the author unless the same has been created in the course
of employment of the author as a contract of service. The plaintiffs,
on the contrary, refer to A.V.Graphics as an independent contractor,
who would be deemed to be the first owner of the alleged copyright in
the trade dress, if any, unless proved otherwise by way of a written
contract of assignment/transfer. The plaintiffs have not only failed to
provide any document which shows that the alleged trade dress was
created by A.V.Graphics but they have also failed to prove their



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                         Page 10 of 45</span>
 averments qua ownership of alleged copyright in the said trade dress
in the absence of any valid assignment in favour of the plaintiffs by
A.V.Graphics.
</p>
<p id="p_33">20.    It is stated that the plaintiff No.2 has evidently assigned all title,
rights and interests together with goodwill, if any, in the UNIVERSAL
formative marks to plaintiff No.1 and while admitting to this fact, the
plaintiffs have also filed the Deed of Assignment dated 3rd November,
2011 executed between plaintiff Nos.1 and 2. In view thereof, plaintiff
No.2 may be deemed to be the subsequent proprietor of the alleged
UNIVERSAL formative marks, for the purpose of using the same on
the plaintiffs' products, packaging and trade dress from the year
2011. However, a review of the copies of the plaintiff's packaging and
products, as filed herein by the plaintiffs, reveals that the same date
back to the year 2010. It is further stated that the plaintiffs have, with
a malafide to mislead this Court, filed copies of packaging of products
manufactured by plaintiff No.2 prior to the assignment of the alleged
UNIVERSAL formative marks to plaintiff No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_34">       It is alleged that the defendant has obtained currently available
products of the plaintiffs, as available in the market and a bare review
of the packaging thereof does not reveal any application or depiction
of the alleged UNIVERSAL formative trade marks by the plaintiffs.
The same are being marketed and distributed under the house mark
of plaintiff No.1 i.e. SANOFI.
</p>
<p id="p_35">21.    It is stated that the plaintiffs in their legal notice dated 10th
March, 2014 to the defendant have alleged to have become aware of
the defendant's incorporation in May, 2013, whereas, in suit filed in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                            Page 11 of 45</span>
 the instant proceedings, the plaintiffs claim that they first became
aware of the defendant's incorporation in March, 2014. The plaintiffs
have been, admittedly aware of the defendant and its incorporation
for more than a year and have chosen to remain silent until now.
During the hearing, learned counsel has indicated that in fact the
plaintiffs have been aware about the defendant's activities from the
month of January, 2014 and had also shown one photocopy of
circular dated 28th January, 2014 in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_36">22.    It is further alleged that the test of deceptive similarity of trade
name cannot be based out of mere reliance on a keyword search
report from an online search engine website. This is essentially owing
to the fact that the keyword search reports issued by the online
search engines, including Google, are essentially based upon the
success of a company's internet marketing strategy and on the basis
of the well-known process called Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).
Therefore, the alleged Google search reports are nothing but a tool
for misleading this Court qua the actual market scenario and the
plaintiffs must not be permitted to derive any benefit from such
flagrant misrepresentation.
</p>
<p id="p_37">23.    Although the plaintiffs have relied upon several UNIVERSAL
formative trade marks by producing registration certificates for the
same, none of the alleged registrations certificates bear reference to
the trade mark - UNIVERSAL NEUTRACEUTICALS. Therefore, all
claims and averments of the plaintiffs qua deceptively similarity of the
defendant's trade name to plaintiffs' alleged trademarks/trade name
must fail.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                           Page 12 of 45</span>
<p id="p_38">        In relation to the word 'NEUTRACEUTICALS', it has been
stated that the same is conjunction of 'nutrition' and 'pharmaceuticals'
and was coined in the year 1989 by Dr. Stephen Defelice, who is
world renowned for his innovations in the field of medicine and is the
founder and chairman of the Foundation for Innovation Medicine,
USA. The word 'NEUTRACEUTICAL', which is very often used to
denote nutritional supplements, has also found place in the Oxford
Dictionary. Evidently, the said term is a dictionary term and cannot be
monopolized and hence, the plaintiffs are barred from claiming any
exclusive rights over the word 'NEUTRACEUTICALS' in any form be
it as a trademark or as a trade name.
</p>
<p id="p_39">24.    On a perusal of plaintiffs' product packaging for PRIMOSA, a
person of reasonable intelligence can determine the essential
component of the said trade dress to be the trade mark PRIMOSA;
whereas the essential feature of the defendant's trade dress is EPO
FORTE. Additionally, the dissimilarity in the colour scheme, layout
and overall visual appeal further mitigates any scope for public
confusion. Further, the presence of defendant's composite mark
UNIVERSAL on the trade dress and the plaintiff No.1's house mark
SANOFI leaves no scope for likelihood of confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_40">25.    It is further stated that the plaintiffs may also be barred from
claiming any exclusive rights over the common dictionary term
UNIVERSAL, which has become common to trade in relation to
medicinal products. From a bare review of the public search report for
the mark UNIVERSAL in Class 5, the official records of the Registry
reveals several UNIVERSAL formative trademarks registered in India.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                        Page 13 of 45</span>
<p id="p_41"> Additionally, a detailed market survey conducted online by the
defendant also reveals several pre existing companies using
UNIVERSAL as a part of their trade name and also most of these
companies are operating in the field of medicine, with extensive use
and reproduction of the trademark/ trade name UNIVERSAL. It is
further stated that where there are numerous trademarks, registered
or unregistered, having a common feature or syllable, i.e.
UNIVERSAL and if the said trademarks are owned by different
individuals and proprietors, then the plaintiffs must not be permitted to
claim exclusive rights over UNIVERSAL, which is common to trade
and industry. Hence, there is no scope of any confusion and injury,
actual or probable, to the goodwill, if any, of the plaintiffs'.
</p>
<p id="p_42">26.    It is the admitted position that out of 20 registrations, in 16
registrations there is no disclaimer to the word UNIVERSAL.
Therefore, in 16 registrations granted in favour of the plaintiffs, the
plaintiffs should have got the exclusive and statutory rights under
<a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_2">Section 28</a> of the Trade Marks Act (hereinafter referred to as the
"Act". With regard to the remaining 4 registrations, it is the settled law
that the disclaimed portion does not take away the right of the trade
mark considered as a whole.          In case, some of the registrations
referred by the learned counsel for the defendant to the effect that the
mark UNIVERSAL cannot be examined in isolation to the remaining
portion, the said registrations are within UNIVERSAL A-25.                    The
essential feature of the said trade mark and trading style is
UNIVERSAL which is being used by the plaintiffs since 1971.
Therefore, the defendant in view of the above referred settled law



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                                Page 14 of 45</span>
 cannot absolve itself from infringing the trademark of the plaintiffs and
passing off its business as that of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_43">27.    In order to understand the arguments of the parties, one has to
read together the definitions of "mark" and "trademark" under

</blockquote><p id="p_45">30.    In order to establish infringement, the main ingredients of
<a href="/doc/202028/" id="a_9">Section 29</a> of the Act are that the plaintiff's mark must be registered
under the Act; the defendant's mark is identical with or deceptively
similar to the registered trade mark; and the defendant's use of the
mark is in the course of trade in respect of the goods covered by the
registered trade mark. The rival marks are to be compared as a
whole. Where two rival marks are identical, it is not necessary for the
plaintiff to prove further that the use of defendant's trademark is
likely to deceive and cause confusion as the registration shows the
title of the registered proprietor and the things speak for themselves.
In an infringement action, once a mark is used as indicating
commercial origin by the defendant, no amount of added matter
intended to show the true origin of the goods can effect the question.
If Court finds that the defendant's mark is closely, visually and
phonetically similar, even then no further proof is necessary.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">      15. Shri P.C. Khanna, learned counsel for the respondent,
      argued that where a distinct label is registered as a whole
      such a registration does not confer any exclusive statutory
      right on the proprietor to use any particular word or name
      contained therein, apart from the mark as a whole. Reliance
      in support of this proposition was placed on the observations
      in the <a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_11">Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit
      Lid</a>. (1955) 2 S-C-R. These observations in the cited case

      the Registrar by <a href="/doc/900486/" id="a_12">Section 13</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1940.
      This aspect is not at all relevant for the present controversy
      because the plaintiff can succeed in an action for
      'infringement' if he proves that an essential particular of his
      trade mark has been copied: See Taw Manufacturer Coy. <a href="/doc/945350/" id="a_13">Ltd.

do not show the disclaimer of trade mark UNIVERSAL. This fact is

     the principle that the right to trade in one's own name did not

passing off and grant of ad interim injunction held in no uncertain
terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services under a
trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a
reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by
the Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or
services in the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to
the business of one who has the property in that name. It was held
that honesty and fair play are and ought to be the basic policy in the
world of business and when a person adopts or intends to adopt a
name which already belongs to someone else, it results in confusion,
has the propensity of diverting the customers and clients of someone
else to himself and thereby resulting in injury. It was held that the
principles which apply to trade mark are applicable to trade name
also.
</p><p id="p_75">        The relevant Paras 8 and 10 of the aforesaid judgment read as

      would carry on his trade or business. According to Kerly (Law
     of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 12th Edn., para 16.49),
     the name under which a business trades will almost always
     be a trade mark (or if the business provides services, a
     service mark, or both). Independently of questions of trade or
     service mark, however, the name of a business (a trading
     business or any other) will normally have attached to it a
     goodwill that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off
     will then lie wherever the defendant company's name, or its
     intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert
     business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion
     between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is
     no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the
     proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in which
     the business may be carried on in the future, and to its not
     being carried on precisely as carried on at the date of the
     proceedings. Where there is probability of confusion in
     business, an injunction will be granted even though the
     defendants adopted the name innocently."
     "The law does not permit any one to carry on his business
     in such a way as would persuade the customers or clients
     in believing that his goods or services belonging to
     someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does
     not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or
     otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair
     play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of
     business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to
     adopt a name in connection with his business or services
     which already belongs to someone else it results in
     confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers
     and clients of someone else to himself and thereby

which was referred in the case of Globe Super Parts vs. Blue Super
Flame Industries AIR 1986 Delhi 245, the judgment given by the
Single Judge of this Court speaking through Shri Mahinder Narain, J
who discussed the case of Reddaway (Supra) at great length by
referring the facts of the matter. The said narration of facts are as
under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">      ".......The words of common language which were held to be
      exclusively appropriated by Reddaway, in that case were
      'Camel Hair". What was asserted in the Reddaway's case
      was that beltings were manufactured and sold by various
      persons; that the beltings used to be sold under the name of
      various animals like Yak, Llama, Buffalo, Crocodile etc. What
      Plaintiff Reddaway asserted was that Banham was their one
      time employee and that he had started selling the beltings
      under the name 'Camel Hair"; Reddaway also asserted that
      they were entitled to stop others, like Defendants Banham,
      from using the word 'Camel Hair with respect to the beltings
      manufactured by them.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">      48. This case was decided by the House of Lords on or about
      26th March, 1896. The case was started on 3rd May, 1893
      when Frank Reddaway and F. Reddaway &amp; Co. Ltd.,
      commenced the suit in the Manchester District Registry of the
      Queen's Bench Division against George Banham and George
      Banham &amp; Co. Ltd., for an injunction to restrain the
      Defendants from infringing certain trade marks and from
      continuing to use the word 'Camel in such a manner as to
      pass off their goods as and for the plaintiff's goods. It was
      asserted that the plaintiffs had, during the course of trade,
      sold very large quantities of beltings as 'camel beltings' and
      that the word 'Camel' appeared upon, or was attached to their
      beltings as 'camel beltings'. In England and abroad the word
      'camel', or the figure of a camel, was universally understood
      in all the places where their beltings was sold, to indicate
      goods to be of plaintiffs manufacture. It was also asserted


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) No.1808/2014                                        Page 32 of 45</span>
      that beltings was sold as 'camel' and 'camel hair beltings
     also. The action was commenced because the Defendants'
     company and the Defendant Banham had recently sold in
     England and advertised for sale in conjunction with the word
     "Camel" large quantities of beltings, which belting was not
     made by the plaintiffs and thus, the persons who desire for
     purchasing beltings of the Plaintiff would be deceived by the
     Defendants' use of the word 'Camel', into the belief that they
     were purchasing the beltings of the plaintiffs' manufacture.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">     49. The plaintiffs got the injunction from Collins, J. but the
     Defendants' appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal
     holding that 'Camel Hair' Belting' was merely a truthful
     description of the nature of the goods and nobody can be
     prevented from using that name, although it may lead to
     goods being purchased under that name, as a goods of a
     particular maker. The Court of Appeal held that 'Camel Hair
     Belting was a true description of the goods, and that it was
     the name by which a person wanting to buy goods would ask
     for them. Again a judgment was given for the Defendants.
     The plaintiffs then appealed to the House of Lords.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">     50. The House of Lords examined the case, and held that
     even "descriptive words" like 'Camel Hair Belting' were
     capable of exclusively appropriation, that the words 'Camel
     Hair Belting' have acquired a secondary signification with
     respect to the beltings in the sense that the words 'Camel
     Hair' with respect to the trade in beltings had lost their
     primary meaning, to indicate belting made of camel hair, but
     has acquired a secondary significance or meaning in the
     trade, and came to connote the products of the plaintiffs. The
     House of Lords found that there was ample evidence to
     justify the finding that amongst those who were the
     purchasers of such goods, the words "Camel Hair" were not
     applied to beltings made of that material in general; that in
     short, it did not mean in the market belting made of a
     particular material, but belting made by a particular
     manufacturer. The House of Lords thus came to the
     conclusion that common words of a language can be
     exclusively appropriated to a particular manufacturer as they

       had acquired a special meaning as denoting the goods of a
      particular manufacturer/ trader.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">      51. Lord Herschell also dealt with "coined" words, that did not
      have any meaning in the language; and at page 228 line 19,
      said that "words never in use before, and meaningless except
      as indicating by whom the goods in connection with which it
      is used were made, there could be no conceivable legitimate
      use of it by another person". Thus the "coined" "created",
      "Fancy", or "new" words which were not in use in any
      language before, and which did not have any meaning in the
      ordinary language, us evidenced by their absence in
      authoritative and standard language dictionaries, were the
      exclusive property of the person who first "coined", or created
      them and adopted them for use, and used it in connection
      with any article the only reason why a hitherto meaningless
      word would be used by another in connection with his
      activities would be to deceive the public, that the letters
      article, thing or goods or the articles, thing or goods of the
      former. He also observed that "he was unable to see why a
      man should be allowed in this way, more than in any other, to
      deceive purchasers into the belief that they are getting what
      they are not, and thus to filch the business of a rival".

     in para 8, this Court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">           "(8) Next contention raised by learned counsel for the
           defendant is that the word Marshal has become common
           to the trade of diesel engines in Rajkot and various other
           persons are using the trade mark in one form or other as
           inasmuch as some are using Airmarshal, Perfect
           Marshal, Powermarshal etc. and the defendant is not the
           only person who is using the trade mark Sonamarshal
           only. The plaintiff, therefore, cannot claim its trade mark
           to be distinctive of its goods or business and no
           customer is likely to be confused or deceived on account
           of this trade mark. This contention of the learned counsel
           for the defendant is also without force. In this connection
           it is sufficient to say that under the law it is the right of
           two parties before the court which has to be determined
           and the court has not to examine the right of other
           parties. If some other manufacturers are using or
           suffixing the word Marshal on their diesel engines, it is of
           no consequence. Furthermore, if the plaintiff has not
           taken any action against several other infringements, this
           does not mean that the plaintiff has abandoned its trade
           mark and cannot challenge the action of the defendant."

      name of a company which has been registered with
      undesirable name but that does not mean that the common
      law remedy available to and aggrieved party stands
      superseded. The plaintiff will have two independent rights of

      minds of the customers or general public in view of the
      similarity of names. Both the remedies, one under
      <a href="/doc/1578466/" id="a_43">Section 22</a> and the other under the common law operate in

defendants having also been marketing their black colour cylinders
under their own trade mark 'Thorn Cascade', the proposals of the
defendants to refill the grey colour gas cylinders of the plaintiff, even

defendants also marked and advertised the drug chlordiazepoxide in
black and green 10mg capsules which were identical to those of the
plaintiffs except that they bore the letters "DDSA" instead of the
plaintiffs' name. The plaintiffs were granted interlocutory injunction to
restrain the defendants from passing off capsules of the patented
drug as the goods of the plaintiffs. It was held that marketing of the
capsules by the defendants in almost identical form to those of the
plaintiffs was calculated to cause damage to the plaintiffs. It was
further held that there was a likelihood of confusion as both the
capsules contained the same drug. The public were not concerned
with the identity of the manufacturing of the capsules as long as the
capsules contained the same substance and had the same effect.

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">      "The upshot of all these cases is to my mind to establish that
     a scheme of colouring applied to goods may be a mark within

     in contrast to other definitions in the Act, starts with the word
     "includes" showing that the definition is purposely not limited
     to the precise words which follow. The combination of colour
     giving a speckled effect in the present case is,
     in my judgement, no less a mark than the red lines in
     Redduway's hose case of the "heading" in the cotton cases
     and in the Winter-Hoffmann-La Roche chlordiazepoxide
     case."
</blockquote><p id="p_93">It was further observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">     "The truth of the matter is I think as follows. In some cases the
     colour is an essential part of the article as an article whilst in
     others it is something which is not essential and has been
     added for some other reason. If it has been added so as to
     denote the origin of the goods, and the evidence shows that in
     practice it does so, it can properly be said that it is being used
     as a mark in the trade mark sense. The answer is no doubt
     one of degree and will depend on the evidence. It would be
     highly unlikely that colour in a lipstick could ever become
     distinctive of one manufacturer because in such a case colour
     is an essential element in and part of the article itself. It is for
     that reason that the customer buys it. Colour in a passenger
     motor car would normally be in a similar but not so conclusive
     a position, but I see no reason why a trader, as some do,
     should not paint his delivery vans or racing cars in specific
     distinct colours to indicate the origin of the car or of the goods
     it normally carries as emanating from him. With drugs, on the
     other hand, the position is the opposite of the lipstick. Colour
     is of no importance to the article as a drug and it may, if
     sufficiently, distinctive, be an exceedingly effective indication
     of origin.

<p id="p_94"> DELAY
</p><p id="p_95">50.    Lastly with regard to small delay in filing the present suit against
the defendants is concerned, the same is not fatal in an action for
infringement in view of the settled law laid down by Courts in various
matters. I do not agree with the argument of the defendant's counsel
that the plaintiffs have concealed the material facts from the Court. In
case the whole plaint is read in meaningful manner, it appears that
the plaintiffs have even informed the date and month of incorporation
of defendant's company.       The question of concealment does not
arise. Further no ex-parte interim orders are passed. In case there is
any discrepancy about the month of information to their dealer, the
plaintiffs due to oversight wrongly mentioned the month. The said act
is condonable as no benefit is derived by the plaintiffs. Some of the
relevant judgments in this regard are as under:

            delay is fatal to the grant of an injunction. We are not
           so satisfied. A delay in the matter of seeking an
           injunction may be aground for refusing an injunction in
           certain circumstances. In the present case, we are
           dealing with a statutory right based on the provisions
           of the trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_54">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958. An
           exclusive right is granted by the registration to the
           holder of a registered trade mark. We do not think
           statutory rights can be lost by delay. The effect of a
           registered mark is so clearly defined in the statute as
           to be not capable of being misunderstood. Even if
           there is some delay, the exclusive right cannot be lost.
