S.U. Kamdar, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">Page 0971
 

</p><p id="p_3">1. The present notice of Motion has been  taken out inter alia seeking relief of injunction of infringement of the plaintiffs artistic work  being Exhibit-D to the plaint and also for an  injunction from in any manner manufacturing,  marketing, exhibiting and selling any goods  bearing the trade mark 'AirTel' as mentioned in  Exhibit-A and B to the plaint or any other  deceptively similar mark on the ground of passing  off. Prayer (c) and (d) of the motion are for  appointment of the court Receiver with a power to  take possession of the goods and destruct all the  labels, cartons and advertising material. 
</p> 

<p id="p_4">2. Some of the material facts of the present  case are as under : 
</p> 

<p id="p_5">3. The plaintiffs are a company inter-alia  carrying on business in telecommunication  services. The plaintiffs are also providing  mobile services to various people in India and is  a well known company in the name of 'AirTel'. The  plaintiffs are carrying on business in various  states of India and are having a large turnover  and are owner of well known popular brand name 'AirTel'. Sometime in or about 1994 the  plaintiffs conceived and invented the word mark  'AirTel'. The plaintiff have also simultaneously  adopted a distinctive label mark consisting the  word 'AirTel' written in a particular manner with  a particular colour combination. Plaintiffs are  also contending that they are a group of companies  who are using the said mark 'AirTel' essentially  in relation to business of telecommunication  services. The plaintiffs have also contended that  they have acquired a super reputation in their  mark 'AirTel' thus the said brand should be either  treated as super brand or a universal brand. They  have further contended that by virtue of such a  status of super brand they are entitled to  protection vice-a-versa all kind of goods using  such a word mark 'AirTel'. Plaintiffs have stated  in the plaint that sometime in or about 2002 the  plaintiffs commissioned the services of M/s. Ray  and Keshvan Designer for the purpose of creating  an artistic work with the label mark using the  word 'AirTel'. It is their further case that Ms.  Sujata Keshavan and Ms. Meeta Malhotra, the Creative Controller employed by the creative  agency were entrusted with the work of creating  the artistic work and they have created the design  and artistic work for the plaintiff with the use  of the word 'AirTel'. The said artistic work is  set out at Exhibit-D to the plaint which indicates  use of the word in a particular manner with a  different colour combination of Red, White and  Black. According to the plaintiffs they also  started using the said artistic work on the carton  and/or on the label on the packs for the purpose  of distributing, marketing and selling their  services since 2002. They have contended that  they have sold their products and services with  the said label on a extensive basis all over India  and thus they are the sole proprietor of the said  artistic design. Plaintiffs have also filed an  application for the registration of their word  mark 'AirTel' under the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_1">Merchandise  Marks Act</a>, 1958. The application is also filed  for label mark and the same is also pending since  2002. Application for label mark with artistic  work has been filed under the Copy Rights Act. The plaintiffs have stated in the plaint that Page 0972 they  are using the said mark 'AirTel' and the artistic  work covered by the said label all over the  country extensively and in support of the same the  plaintiff have relied upon the sales figures and  the figures of advertisement expenses indicating  extensive sale of their products and the huge  amount of money spent towards the advertisement.  Therefore the plaintiffs company claim to be known  by the word 'AirTel' in the market and thus  plaintiffs are require to protect their business  and goodwill in the market. Plaintiffs claims to  have as of today 30.71 million subscribers in  almost 16 states and a customer base of 24% of the  cellular subscribers in India i.e. the biggest  and largest market in the cellular phone services.  Plaintiffs also claims to be engaged in prepaid  and post-paid mobile cards for the purpose of  mobile sales services and recently the plaintiffs  have also entered into land-line telephone  services. Plaintiffs have also claimed to have  diversified their business and services such as in  the field of V-SAT services, submarine cable projects manufacturing of telecommunication  equipment and health care. 
</p> 

<p id="p_6">4. It is the case of the plaintiffs that  sometime in or about 2.9.2003 the plaintiffs came  to know that the defendants are using the said  mark 'AirTel' which is identical and deceptively  similar to the mark of the plaintiff. Apart from  using the said word mark 'AirTel' the defendants  are also using the label alongwith words 'AirTel'  with the identical colour scheme and almost  similar writing on their products which is  alcoholic beverages. Thus the plaintiffs contend  that the defendants by dishonestly copying the  label as well as the word mark and are trying to  pass off their business as that of the business of  the plaintiff and thus the plaintiffs goodwill,  business and reputation has been seriously  suffered and affected. It is on the aforesaid  contention the plaintiffs have filed the present  suit for passing off action in the trade mark as  well as for protection of copy right in their  artistic work and passing off action of their proprietary artistic work. 
</p> 

<p id="p_7">5. Thus essentially the plaintiff are  pressing the prayer clause (b) in the nature of  passing off action. The prayer (a) of the motion  is not pressed since the plaintiffs are neither  having their mark registered under the provisions  of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_2">Merchandise Marks Act</a> nor their  mark is registered under the Copy Right Act. 
</p> 

<p id="p_8">6. In response to the claim of the plaintiffs  the defendant no.1 has filed an affidavit in  reply. In the affidavit of the defendant no.1 it  is contended that the goods which are in the  market of the plaintiff are distinctively  different to the goods of the defendant herein  therefore the user of a similar mark or similar  get up in respect of different products altogether  cannot result in any confusion among the consumers  in the market. It has been further contended that  the goods are polls apart i.e. the plaintiff  goods/business being telecommunication services  and the goods of the defendant being selling of liquor and alcohol beverages, the question of any  likelihood of any confusion or actual confusion  would not arise between the goods of the  plaintiffs and the goods of the defendant herein  in the minds of consumers. It has been further  contented that there are various other parties who  are also using the word 'AirTel' in relation to  various products and thus the plaintiff has no  exclusive right to use the said mark 'AirTel'. In  para-8 of the affidavit in reply Page 0973 an explanation  has been furnished by the defendants for using the  mark 'AirTel' which reads as under : 
</p><p id="p_9"> The said word "AirTel" was adopted  by the owner of the said mark to suggest  that the person who will use the said  products, will enjoy it so well that he  will feel like flying in air talking to  the people.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">7. It has been further contended by the  defendant no.1 in their reply that the defendant  no.2 Pooja Keshavan is the proprietor of the said  mark and it is she who has conceived the said mark  'AirTel'. However it is not disputed that the  word mark is identical as well as the nature of  fonts used by the defendants are also identical to that of the plaintiffs mark. It has been  contended that it is the defendant no.2 who is the  proprietor of the said mark and she has assigned  the same to the defendant no.1 for the user  thereof. It has been contended that the defendant  no.2 has submitted an application for registration  of the said mark 'AirTel' and thus the use of the  mark by the defendant is bonafide and cannot be  considered as dishonest user of the mark. It has  been further contended that in view of the fact  that the goods being totally different the  question of passing off of the defendants business  as that of the plaintiff cannot and does not  arise. No consumer would believe that the goods  of the alcoholic beverages are manufactured by the  plaintiff who are solely and essentially in the  business of telecommunication services. It has  been thus contended in reply that the defendant is  not entitled to relief of any nature whatsoever. 
</p> 

<p id="p_11">8. Learned counsel Mr. Tulzapurkar for the  plaintiffs has contended that since 1994 the  plaintiffs are using the word mark 'AirTel' and  that the label is also created by them in 2002 and  therefore they are the owners of a design and  entitled to the copy rights in the said label mark  as well in the word mark 'AirTel'. He has further  contended that by virtue of the sale and  advertisement expenses incurred by the plaintiffs  and the extensive use of the word mark the  plaintiffs word mark has acquired a status of  super brand and/or universal brand and thus the  plaintiff is entitled to protect their brand as  against the world at large inrespect of all the  goods and business. It is contended that the  explanation inrespect of adoption of mark by the  defendant of the word mark 'AirTel' is totally  dishonest, bogus and without any substance. Apart  from the same it has also been contended that the  get up of the mark which has been copied by the  defendant alongwith the word mark 'AirTel, and the  label is almost similar and identical and it is  direct infringement of the plaintiffs artistic  work and word mark 'AirTel'. It has been further  contended that though it is claimed that the  defendant no.2 is the owner of the mark but neither the defendant no.2 has filed any affidavit  in reply opposing the present notice of Motion nor  any case has been made out of the user of the  mark. In so far as the user of the mark of the  defendant no.1 is concerned it is only from June  2003 on their own showing and thus it is evident  that the plaintiffs are prior user of the mark  'AirTel' with the artistic label mark which has  been created by the plaintiffs and their design  and labels have been first published in 2002. It  has been contended that in so far as the question  of infringement of copy right in the label is  concerned the contention that the goods are  different is totally an irrelevant factor and it  is not necessary that the goods need to be  identical or similar or from the Page 0974 common field of  activities or an allied or cognet products when a  question of passing of any artistic work under  the Copy Right Act arises. It has been contended  that a copy right is in label, and in design and  get up of the said label and thus needs to be  protected irrespective of any relation or not to  any product or goods. In support of the aforesaid contention learned counsel for the plaintiffs have  relied upon the provisions of Sections 14, 51 and 55 of  the Copy Right Act. The said provisions are  reproduced hereunder:

Explanation-for the purposes of this  section, the reproduction of a literary,  dramatic, musical or artistic work in the  form of a cinematograph film shall be  deemed to be an "infringing copy".
</p> 

<p id="p_52">55. CIVIL REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT OF  COPYRIGHT-
</p>  

<p id="p_53">(1) Where copyright in any work  has been infringed, the owner of the  copyright shall, except as otherwise provided by this Act, be entitled to all  such remedies by way of injunction,  damages, accounts and otherwise as are or  may be conferred by law for the  infringement of a right : 
</p> 

<p id="p_54">Provided that if the defendant proves that  at the date of the infringement he was not  aware and had no reasonable ground for  believing that copyright Page 0976 subsisted in the  work, the plaintiff shall not be entitled  to any remedy other than an injunction  inrespect of the infringement and a decree  for the whole part of the profits made by  the defendant by the sale of the  infringing copies as the court may in the  circumstances deem reasonable. 
</p> 

<p id="p_55">(2) Where in the case of a literary,  dramatic, musical or artistic work, a name  purporting to be that of the author or the  publisher, as the case may be, appears on  copies of the work as published, or in the  case of an artistic work, appeared on the  work when it was made the person whose  name so appears or appeared shall in any  proceeding inrespect of infringement of  copyright in such work, be presumed unless  the contrary is provided, to be the author  or the publisher of the work, as the case  may be. 
</p> 

<p id="p_56">(3) The costs of all parties in any  proceedings inrespect of the infringement  of copyright, shall be in the discretion  of the court. 
</p> 

<p id="p_57">9. Learned counsel has also contended that even  for protection of the trade mark 'AirTel' it is  not necessary that the goods must be similar or identical or from the common field of activities  He has further contended that once a brand has  achieved a status of super brand or of universal  brand then the said brand needs to be protected  against all kinds of goods, products, services and  business. It is thus contended that it is not  necessary that the goods should be similar or  allied products. In support of his aforesaid  contention he has relied upon the judgment of this  court in the case of <a href="/doc/1319506/" id="a_3">Kirloskar Diesel Recon P. Ltd.  and Anr. v. Kirloskar Proprietary Ltd. and Ors</a>.   of which para 12 to  15 and 18 reads as under : 
</p>  

<p id="p_58">13. The expression 'common filed of  activity' was coined by Wynne parry J, in  McCulloch v. Levis Mary (Product  Distributors Ltd) popularly known as  'Uncle Maccase reported in 65 RPC 58 in  which he held that its presence or absence  was conclusive in determining whether or  not there was passing off. However, the  requirement that a 'common filed of  activity' is conclusive in determining  whether there can be passing off has been  extensively criticised by Manning J. in  the case of Henderson v. Radio Corporation Pty  reported in (1969) RPC 218 holding that it  would be unsafe to adopt the view  expressed in McCulloch v. Mary that what  has been called a common filed of activity must be established in every case to  entitle the plaintiff to succeed. He  further held that it is going too far to  say that the absence of this so-called  common field of activity necessarily bars  a plaintiff from relief. With the passage  of time, law on requirement of common  field of activity in a passing off action  has radically changed. There is no  requirement for a common field of activity  to found a claim in passing off. In  Marage Studies v. Counter Feat Clothing  Co. Ltd. reported in (1991) FSR 145, Browne  Wilkison V-C said that the so-called  requirement of the law that there should  be a common field of activity is  discredited. The real question in each  case whether there is as a result of  misrepresentation a real likelihood of  confusion or deception of the public and  consequent damage to the plaintiff. The  focus is shifted from the external  objective test of making comparison of  activities of parties to the state  confused. With the passage of time and  reputation acquired, the trade mark  'Kiroloskar' Page 0977 has acquired the secondary  meaning and has become almost a household  word. The judgments relied upon by Mr.  Kane pertain to the cases of one type of  business and not where variety of  businesses have been carried by the  plaintiff and defendant as in the instant  case. The business activities of the  Respondents vary from pin to piano as  borne out from the object clauses of the  Memorandums of Association of the  Respondents. The appellants have still to  commence their business activities but as  mentioned in the Memorandums of  Association of 1st appellant in each  appeal, some of the object clauses therein  over lap with the activities of  Respondents and more particularly of  Respondents nos.6 and 7.
</p> 

<p id="p_59">15. The law of passing off protects  goodwill against its erasing or mark. the  exclusive reputation of trading name is  protected and prevented from being  debased. The Delhi High Court in the case  of <a href="/doc/1460548/" id="a_4">Dainler Benz Aktregesellschaft v. Hybo  Hindustan</a>  (supra)  relied on by Mr. Tulzapurkar, has  correctly held that the trade mark law is  not intended to protect a person who  deliberately sets out to take the benefit  of somebody else reputation with  reference to goods, especially so when the  reputation extends world wide. It is  further held that there are names and  marks which have become household word  'Benz' as name of a car would be known to  every family that has ever used a quality  car. The name 'Benz' as applied to a car,  has a unique place in the world. Thus the  boxes in which the defendant sells  undergarments for men, the representation  therein is of man with his legs separated  and hands joined together above his  shoulder, all within a circle indicate, he  strong suggestion of a link between the  tree pointed star of 'Mercedes Benz' car  and the undergarments sold by the  defendant. This cannot be considered to  be a 'honest concurrent user' by the  defendant of the said symbol and hence the  defendant could be restrained from using  the word 'benz' with reference to any  underwear which is manufactured by the  defendant.
</p> 

<p id="p_60">10. Thereafter he has relied upon the judgment  of the Division Bench of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/389599/" id="a_5">Aktiebolaget Volvo v. Volvo Steels Limited</a> in  Appeal No. 570 of 1995 in Notice of Motion no.  950 of 1995 decided on 16-10.1997 particularly the  following para : 
</p>  

<p id="p_61">33. In the matter of <a href="/doc/1460548/" id="a_6">Daimler Benz  Aktiegesellschaft and Anr. v. Hybo  Hindustan</a> ,  the plaintiffs Benz sought injunction  against the defendants using the name  "Benz" for the production like  undergarments. It was held as under :  "There are names and marks which  have become household words.  "Benz" as name of a car would be  known to every family that has  ever used a quality car. The name  " Benz" as applied to a car, has a  unique place in the world. there  is hardly one who is conscious of  existence of the car/automobiles  who would not recognize the name  "Benz" used in connection with  cars. Thus the boxes in which the  defendant sells its undergarments  for men, and the representation  thereof is of a man with his legs  separated and hands joined  together above his shoulder all Page 0978 within a circle indicate the  strong suggestion of the link  between the three pointed' star of  "Mercedes Benz" car and the  undergarments sold by the  defendant. This cannot be  considered to be a "honest  concurrent user" by the defendant  of the above said symbol.  therefore the defendant could be restrained from using the word  "Benz" with reference to any  underwear which is manufactured by  them and injunction could be  issued restraining the defendants  to cease and desist from carrying  on trade in undergarments in the  name of "Benz" and "Three Pointed  Human Being in a Ring" forthwith.  The trade mark law is not intended  to protect a person who  deliberately set out to take the  benefit of somebody else's  reputation with reference to goods  especially so when the reputation  extends world wide. By no stretch  of imagination can be said that  use for any-length of time of he  name "Benz" should be not objected  to
 

</p><p id="p_62">34. In the matter of Alfred Dushill  Ltd. and Anr. v. Synoptic S.A. and  Anr. reported in 1979 FSR 337 the  plaintiffs A.D. Ltd. had for many years  carried on business in the United kingdom  and, through various subsidiary and  associated companies throughout the world  in the sale of tobacco products, smokers  requisites and wide range of luxury goods.  Their entire business had been conducted  under the name and trade mark "Dunhill":  and the evidence showed that they were  widely known as "Dunhill of London". They  had not sold sunglasses or spectacle  frames in the United Kingdom, though their  American subsidiary had made small sales  of sunglasses in the USA. They were  however involved in negotiation with a  view to entering that market. The first  defendant, S.S.A. a Swiss company began  to advertise and sell sunglasses and  spectacle frames under the trade mark "D  Christopher Dunhill-London", pursuant to  an agreement with the second defendant's,  C.D. who was the great grandson of the founder and son of the present chairman of  A.D. Ltd. By that agreement C.D. in  consideration of large royalties, licensed  S.S.A. to use his name in that manner and  undertook to act as consultant. In  relation to the range of sun-glasses and  spectacle framed to be sold by S.S.A.. it  was admitted that he had no particular  expertise in that field but the defendants  argued that he was entitled to use his own  name to further his own commercial aims  and ambitions. The plaintiffs moved for a  world-wide interlocutory injunction but at  the hearing restricted the relief sought  to certain specified countries. Whitford  J held that the evidence of the plaintiffs  reputation was "meagre" but was not  prepared to hold that the plaintiffs had  not reasonable prospect of success in  their claim for a permanent injunction at  the trial. He refused interlocutory  relief on the ground that the plaintiffs  should not suffer significant damage  pending the trial and the grant of an  injunction would be a serious impediment  to the defendants operation. He further  started that even if an injunction had  been granted he would not have granted it  in respect of any countries other than the  United Kingdom. The plaintiffs appealed  to the court of Appeal and argued that  this being a plain case of a deliberate  attempt by the defendants to "cash in" on  the plaintiffs reputation and there being  in the evidence adduced no credible  dispute on the primary facts, the court  was entitled within the principles laid  down by the House of Lords in American  Cyanamid v/ Ethicon to consider the merits  of the plaintiffs case and should not  hesitate to stop by injunction Page 0979 a blatant  fraud. They further argued that damages  would be an inadequate remedy to the  plaintiffs if any injunction were refused.  Upon further evidence which was admitted  in the court of appeal the plaintiffs argued the harm which an injunction would  cause to the defendants would be much less  than the harm which the plaintiffs should  suffer if the defendants activities were  allowed to continue pending the trial.  allowing the appeal it was held as under : 
</p>  

<p id="p_63">(1) That there were in the evidence  substantial disputes on the facts, in  particular as to allegation of fraud and  the extend of the plaintiffs reputation  and in the circumstances this was not a  case which could be decided by considering  the respective merits of the parties'  cases even if (which the court did not  decide) it would be proper to do so in a  case where there was no substantial  dispute as to the facts. 
</p> 

<p id="p_64">(2) The damages would be an inadequate  remedy to the plaintiffs if they were  ultimately to suceed and there was doubt  as to the ability of the defendants to pay  the damages which might be awarded in that  event, whereas the damage which would be  caused to the defendants if any  interlocutory injunction were granted was  shown by the documents produced by the  hearing of the appeal to be considerably  less then they had asserted in their  evidence and less than the judge had  feared. 
</p> 

<p id="p_65">(3) That the injunction should be  restricted to the United Kingdom and  Switzerland, that being the only country  inrepsect of which there was any evidence  of foreign law".  The appeal court also observed on page 362  that" with very great respect to the  learned judge the judgment doe snot seem  to deal with the point that it was alleged  damage to the overall Dunhill reputation  which was in issue and not damage to  particular classes of goods which Dunhill were presently involved in selling. 
</p> 

<p id="p_66">11. He has further relied upon the aforesaid  judgment to contend that it is necessary to  determine that the explanation given by the  defendant to use the same mark is honest or not is  a very relevant factor for the purpose of grant of  injunction and in respect of the same he has  relied upon para 61 of the said judgment which  reads as under : 
</p><p id="p_67"> 61. Taking into consideration various  cases cited by both sides we are of the  opinion that the crux of the passing off  action lies in actual possible or probable  deception. the plaintiffs necessarily has  to establish reputation and goodwill. In  quia timet action he must also show the  probability of the plaintiffs suffering  damage either in trade or to his goodwill  and reputation. Deception may be of  several kinds i.e. that the public may  think that the goods manufactured by the  defendants are in fact manufactured by the  plaintiffs or that there is some trade  connection or association of the  defendants with the plaintiffs. It is  also clear that the trans border  reputation has been recognised by Indian  courts and as a matter of law it is not  necessary to prove the actual sale, if by  other material presence of the plaintiffs  in India and goodwill and reputation in India is demonstrated. It is also clear  to us that as a matter of law the "common  field of activity" is not required to be  established. However, as the crux of  passing off action Page 0980 lies in possible  deception, the existence of common field  of activity is always a relevant  consideration. If there is a common filed  of activity, possible of deception is very  high and if there is no common field of  activity possibility may be less, but it  cannot be laid down as a rule of laws that  there can be no possibility at all.  Thirdly and more importantly, all these  issues ultimately will depend on the facts  and circumstances and the material on  record of each particular case, as to  whether the plaintiff has established the  goodwill or reputation, whether the  plaintiff has established the trans-border  reputation, whether the defendant has  caused misrepresentation innocently or  deliberately and whether the plaintiff has  suffered damage or is likely to suffer  damage in quia timet action will be  questions of fact to be determined by the  court. It i is also clear that if it is  shown that the defendant intended to  deceive, the burden would be much lighter  on the part of the plaintiff. The  existence of unexpected and unexplained  similarities between the goods of the  defendant and the plaintiff or lack of  explanation or false explanation for  adoption of name by the defendant, may be  extremely relevant.

<p id="p_68">12. He has thereafter relied upon the judgment of  the Allahabad High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/150587/" id="a_7">Bata India  Limited v.  Pyare Lal and Co. Meerut City  and Ors</a>.  and  judgment of the division bench of this court in  the case of Kamal Trading Co., Bombay and Ors. v.  Gillette U.K. Ltd, Middle Sex, England reported  in 1988-PTC 1 particularly para 13 of the said  judgment which reads as under : 
</p><p id="p_69"> 13. Finally Mr. Desai submitted that  while admitting this appeal on December  12, 1986, the Division Bench granted  interim relief pending the hearing of the  appeal by putting certain conditions  before which the defendants could use the  trade mark "7 O" CLOCK'. It is the claim  of Mr. Desai that the defendants have  carried out the conditions set out by the  Division Bench and, therefore there is no  occasion now to grant interim injunction.  The conditions put by the Division Bench  were that number will not be written  within the circle of letter 'O' that the  letter 'O' in the mark would be plain on  the device of a or any other mark to  convey any connection to any foreign  country will not be used that letter 'R"  within a circle to represent that the mark  is registered trade mark will not be used;  that the appellants would put the words "  Made in India" below the words "Tooth  Brush" and also the words " Manufactured  by Kamal Trading Company" on the plastic  pouch, and that the manufacture or sale of  tooth brushes will not exceed 20,000. We  fail to appreciate how grant of this  relief pending the appeal can create any  right in the defendants to insist that the  same order be passed at the hearing of the  appeal;. We have hard Mr. Desai very extensively and we find that not only  there in no merit in the appeal but the  entire conduct of the defendants is  totally dishonest and fraudulent in using  the mark "7 O'CLOCK". To begin with, the  defendants are unable to explain how the  mark was assigned by them. The mere  perusal of the tooth brush and the plastic  pouch in which it was sold clearly reveals  the dishonest conduct of the defendant.  The mark Page 0981 issued on the tooth brush and the  plastic pouch is also not identical. The  plastic pouch mentions the word 'R' in a  circle to suggest that the mark used by  the defendants is a registered mark. In  addition, a picture of tower possibly  Fifet Tower is printed on the pouch to  suggest that the goods are manufactured in  Paris. The defendants also used the words  as Hollywood-London-Paris" to suggest that  the goods are of the foreign made. This  conduct on the part of the defendants  clearly indicate that the anxiety was to  trade upon the reputation of the mark "7'O  CLOCK" and not to leave any chance for  customer to detect the mis-use of the mark  further effort was made to give an  impression that the mark is registered  mark and the goods are manufactured in  foreign country. It is hardly required to  be stated that when the defendants are  guilty of total dishonesty then it is  futile to claim that when the aggrieved  party goes to the court, the defendants  should be permitted to use the mark by  making some alteration,. When confronted  with the conduct of the defendants, the  only excuse Mr. Desalt can think of is  that the defendants are illiterate and the  commencement of the marks was without  taking legal advice. In our judgment, the  conduct reveals the mind of the defendants  and the conduct by no stretch of  imagination can be said to be either  bonafide or innocent. We also cannot  overlook the fact that' the defendants did not bother to produce any invoice in  support of the claim that the goods were  sold from 1982 onwards and the sale  figures annexed as Ex.1 to the affidavit  in reply were correct figures. We  enquired from Mr. Desai as to how the  amounts were spent on the advertisement  and the answer was that the advertisement  boards were put up in shops where the  tooth brushes are sold. No affidavit of  any trader or any distributor is filed in  support of the claim nor did the affidavit  of partner sets out the names of any  distributors to whom the advertisement  material was handed over. In these  circumstances, were are unable to accept  the claim made by the defendants by  setting out certain figures in Ex.' to the  affidavit on the facts and circumstances  of the case, the learned single judge was  perfectly right in granting relief to the  plaintiffs and there is no infirmity  whatsoever in the impugned order.

<p id="p_70">13. He has relied upon the judgment of the Madras  High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/705780/" id="a_8">Intel Corporation v.  S. Ramanan Director and Anr</a>. reported in  2002(25) PTC 457(Mad) and particularly para 17  which reads as under : 
</p><p id="p_71"> 17. It is therefore clear from the  aforesaid decisions as well as the  discussion that the applicants trade name  is widely known in the business circle  since 1968, but however so far as India is concerned, the branch office was opened as  early as 1988 at Bangalore and in view of  the wide publicity made in various places  in different modes, it is certain that the  business people at large would have got  knowledge and information about this trade  name. simply because the name of the  respondents was registered earlier in  point of time, it cannot be said that they  have got prima facie case. Considering  the overwhelming documentary evidence  filed on the side of the applicant it is  clear that the applicants trade name is  popular throughout the world. I am unable  to agree with the contention Page 0982 of the  learned counsel for the respondents that  the word INTEL is only an abbreviation of  International. The trade name INTEL has  been coined by the applicant and they have  widely used the same for a very long time.  No doubt, the trade name of the  respondents is INTELTOOLS; but by this,  it cannot be said that they are entitled  to use the same. The products  manufactured by the applicant company are  marketed under the trade name INTEL and if  the same name is used by the respondents  also there is very possibility for  deception and confusion in the minds of  the public . Apart from that, although  the products manufactured by the  respondents are a different one from the  products manufactured by the applicant,  the trade public will be misled and the  product of the respondents would be  misunderstood as the product of the  applicant. The applicant company is a big  one when compared to the company of the  respondents. It is not difficult for the  respondents company to change the name and  market their products since it is not a  recognised once in the business circle and  by this, no prejudice or loss would be  occasioned to the respondents. The  applicant company has got prima facie case  and the balance of convenience is also in their favour;. If the order of interim  injunction is not granted in favour of the  applicant, they would be put to much loss  and hardship and as such, the interim  injunction already granted has to be made  absolute.

</p><p id="p_73"> 18. In the instant case, "Benz" is a  name given to a very high priced and  extremely well engineered product. In my  view, the defendant cannot dilute, that by  user of the name "Benz" with respect to a  product like underwears.

<p id="p_74">Thereafter he has relied upon the judgment of <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_10">Corn  Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food  Products</a>  particularly  para 13 thereof which reads as under : 
</p>  

<p id="p_75">13. The second point on which the  learned appellate Judges based themselves in arriving at the conclusion that there  was no reasonable apprehension of  confusion or deception was, as we have  earlier stated, that there were various  trade marks with a prefix or suffix  'Gluco' or 'Vita' and that made it  impossible to say that the common features  'Glu' and 'Vita' were only associated with  the appellant's products. This view was  founded on a passage which the learned  appellate Judges quoted from Kerly on  Trade marks 7th Edn.,p.624. That passage  may be summarised thus : Where there are  a series of marks registered or  unregistered, having a common feature or a  common syllable, if the marks in the  series are owned by different persons,  this tends to assist the application for a  mark containing the common feature. This  statement of the law in Kerly's book is  based on In re: an application by Beck,  Koller and Co. (England) Ltd. (1947) 64 T  P.C. 76. It is clear however from that  case, as we shall presently show, that  before the applicant can seek to Page 0983 derive  assistance for the success of his  application from the presence of a number  of marks having one or more common  features which occur in his mark also, he  has to prove that these marks had a  acquired a reputation by user in the  market. We will now read a portion of the  judgment at pp.82 and 83 in Beck, Koller  and Co.'s case fro which what we have  sated earlier appears: 
</p><p id="p_76"> I am disposed to agree with Mr.  Burrell's submission that the  'series' objections is primarily  founded upon user, because the  inference which the Registrar is  asked to draw is that traders and  the public have gained such a  knowledge of the common element or  characteristic of the "series"  that when the y meet another make having the same characteristic  they will immediately associate  the later mark with the "series"  of marks with which they already  similar. But I do not think that  this statement necessarily implies  that the whole issue must be  determined solely under the  provisions of <a href="/doc/1081357/" id="a_11">Section 11</a> as I will now  endeavour to explain.  When an application for  registration is before the  Registrar it frequently happens  that the for conflicting marks  reveals several marks having some  characteristic feature in common  with the mark of the application,  which marks may stand on the  Registrar in the name of one  proprietor only or in the name of  of several different proprietors.  At this stage, when the matter is  one between the applicant and the  Registrar, the latter generally  has before him no evidence as to  whether the registered marks are  in actual use or not, but in  forming an opinion under <a href="/doc/1912729/" id="a_12">Section 12</a> as  to whether or not confusion or  deception is likely to arise, he  is bound, I think, in the absence  of evidence to presume that, prima  facie, some atleast of the  registration have been effected  bonafide by persons who at the  date of their respective  applications were using or  proposed in the near future to use  their marks. If, therefore, all  the marks were owned by one  proprietor, the Registrar would  presume that the latter was using  a "series" of marks and judge the  conflict between the applicants  mark and each of the proprietors marks with this consideration in  mind. Of course, if the  registrations merely consisted of  one and the same word registered  separately inrespect of several  articles to be found in agile  class of the Trade Marks  Schedules, the Registrar would in  general regard all these  registrations as but the  equivalent of a single  registration covering all the  items, for they would not  constitute a "series" as now under  discussion. On the other hand, if  the registered marks found were  owned by several different  proprietors, this would b a  circumstance which might  considerably assist the applicant,  who would be in a position to  submit that the common  characteristic was one well  recognised in marks in use in the  particular trade. In short, when  the Registrar comes to compare the  applicant's mark with the  registered mark, using the  principles laid down in the  "Pianotist" case (...) the  presence of marks on the Registrar  other than the one with which the  comparison is being made is  regarded as one of the surrounding  circumstances which he is required  to take into account.
</p> 

<p id="p_77">But when the same question comes  before the Registrar in opposition  proceedings, it appears to me that  he is no longer in a position to  make Page 0984 any presumption as regards  the surrounding circumstances, but  that before he can draw the  necessary inference based upon the  user of other marks either in the applicant's or the opponent's  favour, any such user must be  established by evidence where the  Registrar refused to draw the  necessary inference in favour of  the applicants in the proceedings.  We have no reason to think that  keryl in stating the law on the  subject intended to depart from  the principle stated in the  passage that we have just now read  from Beck Koller and Co.'s Case.  He has thereafter relied upon the judgment of the  Division Bench in the case of <a href="/doc/913745/" id="a_13">The Andhra Perfumery  Works Joint Family Concerns v. Karupakula  Suryanarayaniah and Ors</a>. . He has thereafter relied upon the  judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1104701/" id="a_14">Honda Motors Co. Ltd. v. Charanjit Singh and  Ors</a>. reported in 2003(26) PTC 1 (Del). 
</p> 

<p id="p_78">15. It has been contended by relying upon the  aforesaid judgments that the plaintiff is entitled  to the protection of the word mark 'AirTel'  irrespective whether the goods are cognet or  allied products or similar products or  complimentary products or not. It has been further contended that a principle of common field  of activity is no more a valid principles and a  person acquiring a super-brand status in trade  mark is entitled to protect their business and  brand from being used by other persons so as to  pass off the defendants business as that of the  plaintiff herein. 
</p> 

<p id="p_79">16. It has been alternatively submitted that  even if this court is of the view that goods being  different and thus the plaintiff is not entitled  to the said protection still by virtue of the  provisions of the Copy Right Act the plaintiff is  entitled to the protection of their getup and  label with the word used 'AirTel' thereon and  therefore this court should grant an interim order  in terms of prayer clause (b) of the said Notice  of Motion. 
</p> 

<p id="p_80">17. On the other hand learned counsel for the  defendants have contended that there can be no  dispute that the goods which are sold by the  defendant is nowhere concerned or connected or even close to the goods, product, services or  business of the plaintiffs herein. It has been  submitted by the defendants that the channel of  sale of their products and the class of consumers  are different and distinct and thus the question  of any confusion in the market as between the  plaintiffs goods and the defendants goods can  never arise. It has been further submitted that  the plaintiff has not produced any evidence to  show that there is infact any confusion in the  market between the goods belonging to the  plaintiffs and that belonging to the defendants in  the minds of the consumers so as to entitle the  plaintiffs to obtain any interim injunction  inrespect of their goods and/or business.  Insupport of their aforesaid contention the  learned counsel has relied upon the judgment of  the learned single judge of this court in the case  of Raymond Limited v. Mohammed Sakil Proprietor  of Raymonds Luggage passed dated 6.5.2004 in  Notice of Motiion no. 934 of 2004 in Suit No.  899 of 2004. He has in Page 0985 particular relied upon the  observation of the learned Single Judge which reads as under : 
</p><p id="p_81"> 13. Whether all such entities can  institute proceedings claiming restraint  orders on users of marks identical to them  even if there is not similarity of  goods/products, is a question which will  have to be decided. I am merely opening a  debate because this court is confronted  with such issues almost every day.  Admittedly, the Trademark Act, 1999 cannot  be considered to confer a monopoly upon  anybody. similarly, it's provisions will  have to be considered consistent with the  constitutional mandate enshrined by  Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 32 R/W  Directive Principles of State Policy. The  Preamble of our written constitution  cannot be lost sight of while interpreting  provisions in such statutes. Therefore,  to my mind, the time has come where it is  necessary to lay down broad principles in  considering the applications for interim  injunction. Whether it is possible to  consider and hold that conduct of the  plaintiff in approaching the Court is  wholly irrelevant and the Court is obliged  to go into merits even prima facie because  of sanctity attached to a Trademark in  public interest, is also a matter of some  concern and requires elucidation. The  above preface is necessary because  initially I thought that there should be a  debate and discussion in this case itself.  However, I am of the view that  above-mentioned aspects can be gone into  and decided in an appropriate case where  materials are produced to indicate that  there is total dis-similarity and  therefore, the question of applicability  of the definition "Deceptively Similar",  "False Trade Description" and "Well Known Trademark" are not attracted.  Additionally, when there is total silence  for years together after adoption till  application for interim injunction is made  after a long passage of time on adoption.  This adjudication would become necessary  if competitions not to be stifled and  monopolies are not to be encouraged. In  this context reference can usefully be  made to a decision reported in AIR 1996  SC.
</p> 

<p id="p_82">18. He has thereafter relied upon the judgment of  another learned single judge in the case of <a href="/doc/1182504/" id="a_15">Soni  Kabushiki Kaisha v. Shamrao Maskar and Ors</a>.   particularly para 5  and 6 of the judgment which reads as under :
</p>  

<p id="p_83">5. <a href="/doc/370231/" id="a_16">Section 11(a)</a> of the Act provides  that a mark, the use of which would be  likely to deceive or cause confusion,  shall not be registered as a trade mark.  The contention urged on behalf of the  petitioners is that the mark "SONY" has  acquired world wide reputation and any  product bearing the identical mark is  likely to cause deception or confusion in  the mind of the customers that the product  has association with the manufacture of  electronic goods of the Japanese Company.  Now it cannot be again said the word  "SONY" has acquired reputation inrespect  of the electronic goods but the question  of whether the use of the mark inrespect  of Nail Polish is likely to deceive or cause confusion amongst the customers is  required to be determined by taking into  consideration several circumstances. Page 0986  <a href="/doc/370231/" id="a_17">Section 11(a)</a> requires the court to  ascertain not only whether the mark has  actually deceived or cause confusion but  also whether it is likely to deceiver or  cause confusion. the question as to  whether any deception or confusion would  caused has to be determined with reference  to the facts of each case, and it is  necessary to take into consideration the  totality of the facts and the surrounding  circumstances. The factors creating  confusion would be the nature of the mark  itself, the class of customers, the extent  of the reputation, the trade channel, the  trade, but the list is bit exhaustive and  there will be several other circumstances  which are required to bet taken into  consideration in combination before  recording a conclusion as to whether there  is a likelihood of deception or confusion  by use of the mark. Shri Tulzapurkar  urged that the nature of the goods to be  sold under the mark is an important factor  and emphasis must be laid on the nature of  the goods and the trade channel through  which the goods would be sold, while  examining the order of the Assistant  Registrar in the present case. it is true  that ordinarily the simultaneous use of  identical or similar marks in relation to  goods which are different will not lead to  any deception or confusion, but  circumstances may exist where the mark is  so well known in the market that the use  or the same in relation to different gods,  may indicate to the public that they are  coming from the same trade source. The  trade channel through which goods will be  sold is certainly a vital factor, but no  single factor is conclusive on the point.  On this principle it is now necessary to  examine various facets of the case in  hand. 
</p> 

<p id="p_84">6. It is not in dispute that the  goods sold by the petitioners under the  mark "SONY" are electronic goods like  Television, Tape Recorders and  Transistors, while the goods which the  respondent desire to sell under the mark  is nail polish, an item which is used by  the women and artists. The electronic  goods and nail polish are items poles  apart, looking to the nature and purpose  of their user. The nail polish is an item  of cosmetics and the price being within  the reach of common man, is sold on a  large scale. The item is sold all over  the town, in shops small and large. On  the other hand, electronic goods  manufactured by the petitioners are not  easily available due to import  restrictions. It is claimed that two-band  transistors under the mark "SONY" are  easily available in Bombay and even  assuming it to be so, it cannot be  overlooked that the trade channel for sale  of the two items are entirely different.  The electronic goods and nail polish are  not sold under one roof and there will not  be any confusion in the mind of the  customer that both the items come from the  petitioners house in Japan. There is also  no common field of activity in course of  trade of the two items, and the classes of  customers who would purchase the two items  are distinct and different. The  petitioners had led no evidence whatsoever  before the Assistant Registrar in the  shape of affidavit of any dealer or  consumer to indicate that the use of the  mark by the respondents is likely to cause  deception or confusion. Again the  respondents are not using the mark "SONY"  is written in a rectangular label  appearing in the upper portion of the  rectangle, letter 'M' appears in the small  circle in the middle portion of the  rectangle and a device of a flowers basket just above the rectangle. In my judgment  in these Page 0987 circumstances the finding  recorded by the Assistant Registrar that  registration of mark sought by the  respondents is not likely to cause  confusion or deception in the minds of the  customers in correct and deserves to be  accepted.

<p id="p_85">19. He has thereafter relied upon the  unreported judgment of the Supreme Court in the  case of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_18">Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila  Pharmaceuticals</a>   particularly the guide-lines laid down by the apex  court inrespect of passing off action as mentioned  in para 35 of the said judgment.

Ltd. decided on  29.10.2001 in Notice of Motion No. 3590 of 1999  in Suit no. 5898 of 1999. He has thereafter  relied upon the judgment of the learned single  judge of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/902127/" id="a_19">Faber Castell  Aktiengesellschaft and Anr. v. Pikpen P. Ltd</a>.  reported in 2003(4) Mh.L.J. 264 particularly he  has relied upon para 14 of the judgment :
</p>  

<p id="p_86">14. Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned counsel  for the defendants, however, submits that  the plaintiffs are not entitled to claim  any property in the trade mark.  "TEXTLINER" because that word in purely  descriptive of the nature and the  character o the function to be performed  by the goods in question viz. a  device/instrument or mark or line the text  or any written or printed matter.  According to him, therefore the word  "TEXTLINER" is purely descriptive of the  nature and/or character and the function  of the goods in question is not and cannot  be a trade mark at all. The learned  counsel refers to para 1(d) of the 2nd  affidavit-in-rejoinder filed by the  plaintiffs wherein the plaintiffs have  denied that the mark is "wholly  descriptive". there appears to be  substances in this contention. There is  no doubt that "TEXTLINE" is a result of  combination TEXT and LINER. These two  words taken independently are purely  descriptive. I find that the result of  this combination is also descriptive. It  is descriptive of the function which the  article is intended to perform. For  instance, if the mark "running shoe" was  used for shoes, it would clearly be  descriptive of the goods even if the word  "running shoes" were joint. I think the  case is similar to the case of "SAFEMIX"  reported in 1978 R.P.C. 397, wherein an  application for registration was refused  on the ground that the mark consisted of  the words "SAFE" and "MIX" conjoined.  Reliance has rightly placed on the  decision in  Rochem separation  Systems (1) <a href="/doc/34342143/" id="a_20">P. Ltd. v. Tas Engineering  Co. P. Ltd</a>.  wherein the words "Disc Tube"  were held to be descriptive by this Court.  It is also true that as held by this Court in 1999 P.T.C. 449 that where descriptive  words are concerned, small differences are  enough to distinguish and a mere Page 0988 similarity is not enough for passing off.  the similarity must be accompanied by a  misrepresentation. Applying the aforesaid  decisions I am of the view that the  plaintiffs have not, prima facie,  established an exclusive right to the use  of the word "TEXTLINER" which is  descriptive in nature. It has not  acquired any secondary significance taken  by itself. It is important o recall the  well known passage from Cellular Clothing  Co. Ltd. v. Maxton and Murray which is  quoted in the decision of the Kerala High  Court in <a href="/doc/188490/" id="a_21">Bharthiya Coffee Workers Catering  Service (P) Ltd. v. Indian Coffee Workers  Co</a>. op Soc. Ltd. reported in 1999 PTC (19)  431 : 
</p> 

<p id="p_87">But I confess I have always thought, and  I still think that it should be made  almost impossible for any one to obtain  the exclusive right to the user of a word  or terms which is in ordinary use in our  language and which is descriptive only,  and indeed, were it not for the decision  in Reddaways case 1896 AC 1999 I should  say this should be made altogether  impossible. But where the plaintiffs,  proof shows that the only representation  by the defendants consists in the use of a  term or terms which apply and correctly  describe the goods offered for sale as in  the present case it must be a condition  for the plaintiffs success that they  should prove that these terms no longer  mean what they say - or no longer mean  only what they say-but have acquired the  secondary and further meaning that the  particular goods are goods made by the  plaintiffs, and, as I have already  indicated, it is in my view difficult to  conceive cases in which the facts will  come up to this." Prima facie, it would follow that the word "TEXTLINER" is  neither adapted to distinguish nor capable  of distinguishing the goods of a  particular manufacturer from those of  another.

Khandelwal Laboratories  Ltd</a>. in Notice of Motion no. 2808 of 2002 in Suit  no. 3323 of 2002 decided by me on 27.9.2005 and  he has particularly relied upon para 5 of the said  judgment which reads as under : 
</p>  

<p id="p_89">5. However, the learned counsel for  the plaintiffs has contended that the  learned Single Judge of this Court has in  the case of <a href="/doc/81192/" id="a_23">Pidilite Industries Ltd. v.  S.M. Associates and Ors</a>. reported in 2004  (28) PTC 193 has taken the view that the  mere fact that the said mark has been used  by various other companies in the market  is not sufficient to deny an injunction in  favour of the plaintiff but the defendant  must also establish that the parties who  are using the similar mark in the market  have huge market share and that their sale  is of substantial amount. It is being  contended that thus unless the defendant  establish that the market share of third  parties which are also using the said mark  is of such a huge amount that the  plaintiff can be disentitled to obtain the injunction. The learned Single Judge in  the aforesaid judgment has relied upon a  judgment of the Apex Court in the case of  <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_24">Corn Products v. Shangrila Food Products</a>   and gave a  finding that the defendant must establish a substantial Page 0989 evidence to show that the  said goods are sold extensively in the  market and the sale figures of such third  parties are such that such a party has  acquired reputation by user of the said  goods in the market. It has been held by  the learned Single Judge that the  defendant must establish exclusive use in  the market. Even at the interim  proceedings according to the learned  Single Judge it is not sufficient merely  for the defendant to show prima facie that  there is user of the mark by various  parties in the market. He must produce a  prima facie evidence to show substantial  use and at the final hearing of the suit  the level of the proof is higher and the  defendant must prove a substantial use by  such third parties. On the basis of the  aforesaid judgment the plaintiffs have  urged that the defendant has failed to  show the substantial sale of the said  various products which are sold in the  market under mark "CEF" and thus even  though products are sold in the market  with similar mark as that of the plaintiff  still the defendant should be injuncted  from using the same mark. Apart from the  fact that I do not subscribe to the view  expressed by the learned Single Judge in  the aforesaid judgment but I am refraining  to go into the same in this matter. It is  because in the present case on the facts  in my opinion the defendant has been able  to establish a substantial user of the  said mark by various companies in the  market. The defendants have produced  before me in the form of sale figures of  various companies by relying upon the  survey conducted by ORG-MARG which are set out at Exhibits 14, 15 and 16 of the  affidavit in reply. A mere perusal of the  said exhibits leaves no manner of doubt  that the drugs almost with similar mark as  that of the plaintiff and defendant both  is in the market extensively and is being  sold in market also with substantial sales  figure. In that view of the matter I am  of the opinion that the mark of the  plaintiff does not have any exclusivity  and is being frequently used not only by  the defendant but by various other parties  in the market in respect of pharmaceutical  drugs. However, the learned counsel for  the plaintiff has relied upon the judgment  of the Apex Court in the case of Cadila  Health care <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_25">Ltd. v. Cadila  Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. . He has also relied upon the  judgment of the Division Bench in which  the Division Bench has interfered with the  order of the learned Single Judge and has  granted injunction. The learned counsel  has relied upon para 27 of the said  judgment and has contended that the  confusion arising from similarly of marks  among medicines are required to be taken  into consideration and, therefore, the  Court must grant an injunction. In the  present case, no such case has been made  out and, therefore the question of  granting injunction on that basis does not  arise. Thereafter the learned counsel has  relied upon the unreported judgment of the  Division Bench of this Court in Appeal No.  498 of 2002 in Notice of Motion No. 725  of 2002 in Suit No. 1305 of 2002 (Bal  Pharma Limited v. Wockhardt Limited and Anr. dated 12.6.2002 by A.P. Shah and  Nishita Mhatre, JJ. and has contended  that even if the pre-fix is common still  the other words which are in common use in  the said pre-fix specify the exclusivity  of the said product in favour Page 0990 of the  plaintiff herein. He has relied upon para  7 of the said judgment which reads as under :

<p id="p_90">7. In order to decide whether the word  "AZIWIN" is deceptively similar to the  word "AZIWOK", each of the two words must,  therefore, be taken as a whole word. Each  of them consists of six letters, the first  three letters "AZI" being common in both  the words. The affidavit of the  appellants indicate that various brands of  Azithromycin tablets and syrup are  marketed by different pharmaceutical  companies using the common prefix AZI,  which is derived from the generic name of  drug and in fact the appellants have given  a list of as many as 13 different names of  the companies including the parties to the  suit who are using the prefix AZI. It is  thus apparent that the drug Azithromycin  being the base of these products the word  AZI has been commonly used in describing  the product and no one can claim monopoly  over the use of the said word. In fact  any company producing Aazithromycin  tablets would be justified in using the  said word as prefix to its trade name.  The word AZI being both descriptive and  common to the trade the users of such  product are not likely to be misguided or  confused by the said word. Once it is  held that the word "AZI" is common to the  trade, then having regard to the un-common  letters in these two words namely "work"  and "win" which are totally dissimilar and  also having regard to the fact that even  phonetically the two words are totally  dissimilar, it is difficult to hold that  one will be mistaken or confused with the  other. There is not even a remote chance  of anyone being misguided by the two  words. It is a common ground that  Azithromycin can only be ordered by  prescription from a certified medical  practitioner and the public cannot be  supplied with the same without such  prescription as the said drug is "Scheduled H" drug. It is highly unlikely  that doctors and pharmacists would get  confused by the two marks."  In the present case not only the pre-fix  but even the suffix are commonly used with  the word "CEF" by various companies and,  therefore, also I do not find any  substance in the present case. 
</p> 

<p id="p_91">21. By relying upon the aforesaid judgments  learned counsel for the defendants have contended  that the plaintiffs are not entitled to any  interim injunction because the goods are totally  different and not closely similar. 
</p> 

<p id="p_92">22. It has been thereafter contended by the  learned counsel for the defendant that the word  'Air' and 'Tel' are both descriptive words and are  found in English dictionary as two separate words  and by merely joining them the said descriptive  words do not acquire any exclusiveness or  distinctiveness so as to entitle the plaintiff for  any interim injunction in the said mark 'AirTel'.  It has been thereafter contended that the user of  the mark and the adoption of the mark by the  defendant is honest and therefore the plaintiff is not entitled to any interim injunction. It is  thus vehemently contended by the learned counsel  for the defendant that the Notice of Motion should  be dismissed and no interim relief should be  granted to the plaintiffs herein. 
</p> 

<p id="p_93">23. I have considered the arguments advanced  by both the learned counsels in depth. In so far  as the first contention of the plaintiff is  concerned that the Page 0991 plaintiff is entitled to  injunction and passing off in respect of the goods  belonging to the defendant which is admittedly not  similar to that of the plaintiff. The plaintiffs  are doing the business in the field of  telecommunication and mobile service whereas the  products which are sold by the defendant is whisky  and not in any manner connected or in any way  concerned with the business of the plaintiffs  herein. The products which are sold by the  plaintiffs and the products which are sold by the  defendants are polls apart and cannot be described  as cognet goods or goods from the common field of activity nor can the same be described as allied  products or complimentary to each other. The  goods are totally different. However the learned  counsel for the plaintiffs has contended that  irrespective of the dissimilarity of the products  of the plaintiffs and the defendants and  irrespective of the fact that their products are  not even close complimentary, cognate and ancilary  goods still plaintiffs are entitled to claim the  injunction of passing because the defendants are  passing off his business as if the same belonging  to the plaintiffs. He has further contended that  the brand of the plaintiffs have acquired a super  status and super brand and thus entitled to  injunction of passing off inrespect of different  goods. I have considered the aforesaid  submissions and I am not inclined to accept the  same. Firstly it is not in dispute that the  business of the plaintiff has commenced under the  brand name 'AirTel' sometime in or about 1994 and  the label design is created only in 2002.  Secondly it is not in dispute that the business of  the plaintiff is totally different than the business of the defendant herein. The principles  which are required to be followed for the purpose  of granting of injunction on the basis of passing  off inrespect of totally dissimilar goods which  are not event cognet or falling in the common  field of activity is that it must be shown that  infact the defendant by carrying on business in  the said name is seeking not to pass off his goods  as that of the plaintiffs but infact is seeking to  pass off his business as that of the plaintiffs  business. To accept such proposition of law it is  very essential that the business of the plaintiffs  must be such a nature that it is world wide and so  big and so great that by mere use of the brand  name or trade name it can be stated that the  defendants are seeking to pass off his business as  if it is the business of the plaintiff. It is  also essential for upholding such proposition of  law that the business of the plaintiff must be in  large variety of products and in many fields so  that it is likely to confuse with the business of  the defendants. Mere acquisition of a popularity  or reputation in one particular brand vice-a-versa in relation to one particular business and not  having any cross nations reputation does not  entitle a person to claim an exclusive right to  use a particular brand name and prevent them from  using the said mark or brand name in relation to  any goods. A principle in such cases is not of  passing off goods but is a passing off of a  business. 
</p> 

<p id="p_94">24. The well known author Kerly's has in his  book Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names,  14th Edition 2005 while enamiciating the aforesaid  principle has stated as under : 
</p><p id="p_95"> There is no rule that the defendant must  operate in the same field of activity as  the claimant. However, this does not mean  an examination of their respective fields  of activity is irrelevant. The more  remote the activities of the parties, the  stronger the evidence needed to establish  misrepresentation Page 0992 and the real likelihood  of damage that are prerequisites of a  right of action in passing off. Although  this is a question of fact to be  determined in the circumstances of the  particular case, instances of decisions  may be helpful and are given below.
</p> 

<p id="p_96">25. In my opinion the court is empowered to  grant injunction on the ground of passing off even  if the defendants do not operate in the same field  of activity but while doing so the court must see  whether the plaintiffs are able to establish  implacable reputation of such a huge nature that  the business carried out by any person under the  said trade name would tantamount to suggest that  it is the business of the plaintiffs. In my  opinion in the present case such principle has not  been satisfied by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs  reputation undoubtedly is only inrespect of the  business of telecommunication and it is not  extended to any other business or products. The  reputation of the business of the plaintiff is  only in India. It has not travelled to other  nations. Further more it is not possible to  accept the contention of the plaintiff that a  person buying a whisky, liquor would assume that  it is the plaintiffs who are selling the whisky in  the market in place of the defendants herein.  Strong reliance placed by the learned counsel for  the plaintiffs on the judgment of the Delhi High court in the case of Mercedes Benz (supra) and in  the case of Volvo(supra) are in my opinion do not  apply to the facts of the present case. There can  be no dispute that the brand Mercedes Benz is a  well known reputed brand though in relation to  motor vehicle. Same is the position in the case  of Volvo for the buses. In the judgment of the  Delhi High Court the court was of the view that  while using the mark Mercedes and Benz in relation  to undergarments manufactured by the defendant he  infact sought to copy the said mark with the  picture of logo and he had an intention to earn on  the reputation of the well established Mercedes  Benz brand. Insppourt of the aforesaid contention  the Delhi High Court came to the conclusion that  the emblem of the Mercedes Benz is also been  copied by the defendant in that case while using  the said brand name in relation to his product of  undergarments. In the case of Volvo also the main  consideration of the Division Bench to grant  relief was that the Volvo was already well  established brand and had acquired a super status  brand. In the present case the plaintiffs have  undoubtedly acquired a reputation in their brand  name 'AirTel' but to hold that the said reputation  is of such a nature that it has acquired a super  brand status or has acquired the international  reputation so as to prevent any person from  carrying on any business under the said name is in  my opinion cannot sustain on the facts of the  present case. Thus I do not accept the contention  of the learned counsel for the plaintiff in  relation to passing off of the business of the  defendants as if the same belongs to the  plaintiffs herein. 
</p> 

<p id="p_97">26. The other judgments which are cited by the  learned counsel for the plaintiffs  particularly in the case of Bajaj Electricals,  Kirloskar, Corn Products, Kamal Trading I am of  the view that all these cases fall in a class  where the goods were either cognet goods or from  the common field of activity and thus not much  relevant for the purpose of determination in the  present case in so far as the claim of the  plaintiff which is based not on passing off the goods but on passing off of the business. 
</p> 

<p id="p_98">Page 0993
 

</p><p id="p_99">27. The defendant has thereafter contended  that the word 'Air' and 'Tel' are the descriptive  English language words and no person can claim any  exclusive right on the user of the said words. It  has been contended that the plain simple  dictionary words cannot claim as the words of a  brand name or a trade mark as if the same are  exclusively innovated by the plaintiff herein. It  is thus submitted the words 'Air' and 'Tel' being  simple dictionary words this court should not  grant any injunction inrespect of passing off as  claimed by the plaintiff. In so far as the  aforesaid contention is concerned I am not  inclined to accept the same because not doubt it  is true that the word 'Air' and 'Tel' are the  English words and the plaintiffs have by user  thereof in a particular combination of the word  'Air' and 'Tel' jointly has created an innovative  one word 'AirTel' which is not a common English  word and thus acquired an exclusive reputation  inrespect of the said brand and the said trade  name in their favour. 
</p> 

<p id="p_100">28. Learned counsel for the defendant has  thereafter contended that the plaintiff has not  been able to show actual confusion in the market  between the goods belonging to the plaintiffs  namely telecommunication and tele services and on  the other hand the goods of the defendants namely  whisky and liquor sold by the defendants. In my  opinion the submission made has no merits. It is  not necessary to establish actual confusion at the  interim stage. At the interim stage merely  likelihood of confusion is by itself sufficient  for the purpose of grant of interim injunction.  In any event I am of the opinion that by virtue of  copying the label, the defendants are seeking to  pass off the goods as belonging to the plaintiffs  and thus it is necessary that the interim  injunction should be granted in favour of the  plaintiff. The last submission made by the  learned counsel for the plaintiffs that they are  also other user of the words 'AirTel' in the  market. There is no material of any nature whatsoever produced to show that infact the goods  belonging to other persons are sold in the market  under the brand name 'AirTel'. The defendants  have merely produced the list of pending  application under the mark 'AirTel' with the  Registry of Trade Marks. That by itself cannot  show that other persons are using the word  'AirTel' in the market so as to deprive the  plaintiff from obtaining interim injunction in the  present case. In cases the user of the mark  'AirTel' by large number of persons in the market  of different products it is required to show that  infact goods are sold in the market under the  brand name 'AirTel' so as to show that the  plaintiffs cannot claim exclusive reputation in  the said mark. Not a single case of sale has been  shown by the defendant of any parties under the  brand name 'AirTel'. In that light of the matter  the submission is required to be rejected. 
</p> 

<p id="p_101">29. However that is not an end of the matter.  A very important factor in the present case is the  fact that the defendant has failed to give any satisfactory explanation for using the word mark  'AirTel'. It is not only the words which are used  by the defendant but even the fonts style and  the design of the label is also absolutely  identical to that of the plaintiff. The fact that  the plaintiff is the earlier holder of the said  brand 'AirTel' with the said design and with the  said get up is also not in dispute. Thus the  plaintiff is the proprietor of the copy right of  the label 'AirTel'. The plaintiffs have designed  the said label in 2002. The design which has been  used by the defendant is on the whisky Page 0994 bottle is  absolutely identical to the label design of the  plaintiffs on their advertisements, catalogues,  pamplets and T.V. commercials. The use of the  word 'AirTel' is identical both by the plaintiffs  and the defendants. I am inclined to accept the  contention of the learned counsel for the  plaintiffs that in the light of the provisions of  Section 14, 51 and 55 of the Copy Right Act the  plaintiffs are entitled to protect their label  mark 'AirTel' as a prior holder of copy right and  an author of the said artistic work. It has been brought to my notice that the colour scheme used  by the defendants in the label which has been used  by the defendants for the whisky bottle is also  identical to that of the plaintiffs herein. In  view thereof it is undoubtedly correct that the  use by the defendant of the said label with the  identical font and identical mark is dishonest.  The explanation given by the defendants for using  the mark is that after drinking the whisky people  fly in air and talk anything is merely required to  be stated to be rejected. The contention is  meritless. The use of the words 'AirTel' by  virtue of the fact that they are using the same  style, same colour scheme and similar labels leads  to undisputed situation that the defendant is  passing off the copy right work of the plaintiff  by using the said label and thus the defendant  must be stopped from using the said label with the  identical mark 'AirTel' and in an identical  artistic design and style. 
</p> 

<p id="p_102">30. I am also of the further opinion that the  defendant no.1 should be prevented from using the mark 'AirTel' because the defendant no.1 is only  claiming to be the assignee of the said mark. The  owner is defendant no.2. The defendant no.2 has  not come forward to defend the mark which is owned  by her though it is her creature. In my opinion  if the defendant no.2 is not interested in  defending her own mark the plaintiff cannot claim  any right whatsoever to protect the said mark. I  am also of the opinion that the fact that label is  copied by the defendant no.2 is by itself enough  to prevent the defendants from using the said mark  'Airtel' inrespect of the said labels and the said  design. In that view of the matter I am of the  opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to  injunction in terms of prayer clause (a) and (c).  Motion is accordingly made absolute in the  aforesaid terms.
