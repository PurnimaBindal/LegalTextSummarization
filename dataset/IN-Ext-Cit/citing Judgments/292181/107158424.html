             Dated this the 15th day of June, 2016


                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Petitioner challenges Exts.P1 and P2 rectified orders

issued by the first respondent, invoking Section 66 of the

Kerala Value Added Tax Act, 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.    The short facts involved in the writ petition would

disclose that the petitioner being a dealer in bakery products

was assessed to tax on the basis that he was selling the

bakery products under the brand name 'Thomson Biscuits'

during the year 2005-06 and 2006-07. The Assessing Officer

proceeded on the basis that the bakery products were sold

under the brand name 'Thomson Biscuits' during the aforesaid

period. Petitioner raised a contention that the registered trade

mark was obtained only on 19.9.2007.                 However, the

Assessing Officer proceeded on the basis that the brand name

was registered with retrospective effect from the date of

application ie; on 18.9.2001 and accordingly the petitioner was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -2-</span>



assessed to tax for the aforesaid period at a higher rate

applicable for sale of bakery products under the brand name.

The matter was carried in appeal.      The Appellate Authority

remitted the matter back to the Assessing Authority for fresh

consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    It seems that the Assessing Authority had sought

for a clarification from the Commissioner. The Commissioner

as per letter dated 14.11.2012 informed the Assistant

Commissioner, Special Circle, Kottayam that the biscuits

became taxable at 13.5% from the date of registration of trade

mark. It is submitted that on that basis, assessment orders

were completed. However, after a considerably long period,

the assessment is revised invoking Section 66 of the Kerala

Value Added Tax Act. Exts. P1 and P2 are the orders passed

by which the petitioner is called upon to pay tax at 12.5%.

The main contention raised by the petitioner is that there was

no situation warranting proceedings under <a href="/doc/859057/" id="a_1">Section 66</a> of the

Act. There was no error apparent on the face of record to

rectify the earlier order, which had already become final. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -3-</span>



learned counsel also relies upon the judgment of the Apex

Court     in  <a href="/doc/487233/" id="a_2">M/s. Deva         Metal Powers          Pvt. Ltd   v.

Commissioner, Trade Tax, U.P</a>. [2008 (16) KTR 482

(SC), wherein the Apex Court had occasion to consider the

meaning of 'mistake' which has been elaborately dealt with.

Paragraph 11 of the said judgment, which reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "11.    "Mistake" is an ordinary word but in

      taxation laws, it has a special significance. It is not an

      arithmetical error which, after a judicious probe into

      the record from which it is supposed to emanate is

      discerned. The word "mistake" is inherently indefinite

      in scope, as to what may be a mistake for one may

      not be one for another. It is mostly subjective and the

      dividing line in border areas is thin and indiscernible.</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">      It is something which a duly and judiciously instructed

      mind can find out from the record. In order to attract

      the power to rectify under <a href="/doc/1578466/" id="a_3">Section 22</a>, it is not

      sufficient if there is merely a mistake in the order

      sought to be rectified.    The mistake to be rectified

      must be one apparent from the record. A decision on

      a debatable point of law or a disputed question of fact

      is not a mistake apparent from the record. The plain

      meaning of the word "apparent" is that it must be

      something which appears to be so ex facie and it is

      incapable of argument of debate.           It, therefore,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   -4-</span>



      follows that a decision on a debatable point of law or

      fact or failure to apply the law to a set of facts which

      remains to be investigated cannot be corrected by way

      of rectifications."
</p>
<p id="p_6">      Another judgment relied upon is <a href="/doc/292181/" id="a_4">Meghraj Biscuits

Industries Ltd v. Commissioner of Central Excise, U.P</a>

[2007 (3) SCC 780]. In that case, the Apex Court was

considering the legality and effect of the deeming fiction in the

provisions of the        <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_5">Trade Marks Act</a> and whether such a

deeming provision can be extended to Excise Law. It was held

that the effect of making registration certificate applicable from

retrospective date is based on the principles of deemed

equivalence to public user of such mark. Such deeming fiction

cannot be extended to excise law and it was confined to the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_6">Trade Marks Act</a>. Paragraph 18 is relevant,

which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "18. On reading the above quoted paragraphs from

       the above judgment, with which we agree, it is clear that

       the effect of making the registration certificate applicable

       from retrospective due is based on the principle of deemed

       equivalence to public user of such mark. This deeming

       fiction cannot be extended to the excise law. It is confined

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    -5-</span>



       to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">Trade Marks Act</a>. In a given case

       like the present case where there is evidence with the

       Department of the trade mark being owned by M/s. Kay

       Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd. and where there is evidence of the

       appellants trading on the reputation of M/s. Kay Aar

       Biscuits (P) Ltd which is not rebutted by the appellant

       assessee,   issuance   of   registration   certificate  with

       retrospective effect cannot be confer the benefit of

       exemption notification to the assessee.      In the present

       case, issuance of registration certificate with retrospective

       effect from 30.9.1991 will not tantamount to conferment of

       exemption benefit under the excise law once it is found

       that the appellants had wrongly used the trade mark of

       M/s. Kay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd."</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">      4.     On the other hand, the learned Government Pleader

while supporting the stand taken in the matter, submits that

<a href="/doc/859057/" id="a_8">Section 66</a> apparently applies to the fact situation. This is a

case where there is a clear error by which the taxability of the

bakery product was in question. The authority had taken a

view that the higher tax is liable to be paid only on registration

of the trade mark. As per the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_9">Trade Marks

Act</a>, itself the registration will have retrospective effect and

that apart, the petitioner was effecting sale of the products

under the brand name for quite a long time and even as early

as from 1980 onwards.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      5.    I have heard the learned counsel on either side and

I am of the view that there is justification on the part of the

petitioner in challenging Exts.P1 and P2. <a href="/doc/859057/" id="a_10">Section 66</a> reads as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "66. Power to rectify any error apparent
       on the face of the record- (1) Any authority
       including     Appellate  Tribunal    and   Settlement
       Commission issuing any order or proceedings under
       this Act may, on application or otherwise, at any time
       within four years from the year in which the order is
       passed by it, rectify any error apparent on the face
       of the record:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             Provided that no such rectification, which has
       the effect of enhancing an assessment or any
       penalty, shall be made unless such authority has
       given notice to the person affected and has allowed
       him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             (2) Where such rectification has the effect of
       reducing an assessment or penalty, the assessing
       authority shall make any refund to the person
       entitled thereto.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             (3) Where any such rectification has the effect
       of enhancing an assessment or penalty, the
       assessing authority shall give the dealer or other
       person, a revised notice of assessment or penalty
       and thereupon the provisions of this Act and the
       rules made thereunder shall apply as if such notice
       has been given in the first instance.</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">             Explanation- The liability to pay the tax or
       other amount shall arise only from the date specified

W.P.(C) No. 8888 of 2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 -7-</span>



       in the revised notice."
</p>
<p id="p_12">      6.    The statute permits the rectification of 'any error

apparent on the face of record'. The question is whether there

was any error apparent on the face of the record as far as

Exts.P6 and P7 are concerned. In the said orders, there is a

clear finding that "only when the trade name is registered ,

biscuits becomes taxable @ 12.5%. The crucial event is the

registration of trade mark, which determines the classification

for the purpose of taxation. Hence the assessee is liable to

pay tax @ 12.5% w.e.f. 19.9.2007, but at the time their

business had closed".The aforesaid finding is based on the

statutory provisions. It is true that the registration of trade

mark under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_11">Trade Marks Act</a> can have retrospective effect

and as far as his brand name is concerned, he is entitled to use

the brand name         either with or without registration.  But

question is regarding taxability. The liability to pay tax arises

only when the petitioner gets a registered trade mark for the

product. The item 11 in the notified list of goods taxable at

the specified rate reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_13">W.P.(C) No. 8888 of 2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   -8-</span>



          "Bakery products including biscuits of all varieties,

        cakes, pastries, pizza, bread, sold under brand

        name registered under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_12">Trade Marks Act</a>,

        1999."
</p>
<p id="p_14">Therefore, the event of taxability arises when there is a

registration of the trade mark. In other words, the petitioner

is not entitled to collect tax, if there is no registration of trade

mark, as held by the Apex court in                  Meghraj Biscuits

Industries Ltd (supra). The deeming provision under the

<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_13">Trade Marks Act</a> applies only for the purpose of the said Act

and cannot be applied to any other statutes unless otherwise

provided.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        In the said circumstances, I am of the view that there

was no error apparent on the face of record to enable the

authorities to invoke <a href="/doc/859057/" id="a_14">Section 66</a> of the Act and accordingly this

writ petition is allowed and Exts.P1 and P2 are quashed.
