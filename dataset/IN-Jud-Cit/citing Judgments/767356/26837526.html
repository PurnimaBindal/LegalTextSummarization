(by Shri Raghu Hulikal, Advocate
 for C/Respondent)

        This Miscellaneous First Appeal is filed under order 43
Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure against the order
dated 31st March 2018 passed on IA Nos.1, 2, and 7 in OS
No.6665 of 2017 on the file of the Additional City Civil Judge
at Bengaluru (CCH 10) dismissing IA.No.1 and 2 filed under
Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of CPC and allowing IA.No.7 filed under
Order 30 Rule 4 read with <a href="/doc/828685/" id="a_1">Section 151</a> of the Indian Penal
Code.


        In this Appeal, arguments being heard, judgment
reserved on 26th April 2018, coming on pronouncement of
orders, this day, the Court delivered the following:


                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Appellant filed Suit in O.S. No.6665 of 2017 against the

respondent for committing infringement and passing off of the

trademark and trading name "PATIL and PATIL PARIMALA

WORKS" by using identical and deceptively similar trading

name i.e. "PATIL FRAGRANCES".          The appellant also filed

applications IAs.I and II under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 for

interim injunction to restrain respondent from using the name

"Patil Fragrances" or any other identical or deceptively similar

trading name or trademark during the pendency of the Suit.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    3</span>




Initially,   the   applications   were   allowed   and   temporary

injunction was granted by its order dated 09th October 2017

and upon respondent filing IA.7 under Order XXXVI Rule 4<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2"> of

the Code</a> of Civil Procedure seeking vacating the ex party

interim order granted on 09th October 2017, the learned

Judge, by its order dated 31st March 2018 vacated the interim

order. Hence, the appellant-plaintiff has filed this appeal with

a prayer to set aside the order dated 31st March 2018 passed

by the XVIII Additional City Civil Judge, Bengaluru (CCH 10)

and it is sought to allow IAs.I and II filed by the Plaintiff-

appellant and to        dismiss IA.7 filed by the defendant-

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       2.     Shri Udaya Holla, the learned Senior Counsel

appearing for the learned counsel for the appellant submits

that the Court below by appreciating the case of the appellant

granted an ex parte injunction on 09th October 2017. It was

the case of the appellant that the respondent is using the

similar name viz. "PATIL FRAGRANCES" which is identical to

that of the appellant's registered trade name "PATIL and

PATIL PARIMALA WORKS."            The word-mark "PATIL" was got

registered by the appellant since 1978 and certificate to this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>




effect has been issued as per Annexure-Q dated 10th March

2016; and another certificate issued which is evenly dated

wherein the word mark "PATIL PARIMALA WORKS" is used

since 01st January 1978. It is submitted that the respondent-

defendant, who has got his name registered as "PATIL

FRAGRANCE" in the year 2017 and passing off of the goods

that are similar to that of the appellant, infringes his right.

Accordingly the same is to be injuncted. The learned Senior

Counsel   further   submitted       that   rival   trademarks   are

phonetically, visually, conceptually and aurally are identical

and deceptively similar.   It is contended that the appellant

has a prima facie case to show that it is a clear adaptation of

registered trademark and trading name "PATIL and PATIL

PARIMALA WORKS".        It is further submitted that as the

respondent-defendant had not made out his case and since he

has used duplicate trademark, though rightly, the court

initially granted ex parte injunction, but however, committed

an error in vacating the same on IA.VII filed by the

respondent.   Hence the learned counsel seeks to vacate the

interim order.   In support of his submissions, the learned

Senior Counsel relied upon the judgments of this Court in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span>




case   of   <a href="/doc/96380841/" id="a_3">M/S.   COTHAS   COFFEE    CO.   v.   M/S.   COTHA

COMPRESSORS LTD. V. KHOSLA EXTRAKTING LTD. AND

OTHERS</a> reported in 1986(6) PTC 211 (DEL).
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">       3. On the other hand, it is the case of the respondent

that the appellant-plaintiff had suppressed the facts that the

defendant and plaintiff the respondent and appellant herein

belong to the same family and share common surname. The

defendant is the ex-employee and brother of the plaintiff.

With an intention to obtain ex parte temporary injunction, he

has not disclosed the relationship.     It is submitted that

whoever approaches the court should disclose the material

facts and non-disclosing is nothing but suppression of facts.

It is further submitted that the respondent-defendant's name

is Doddanna Veeranagouda Patil, and is known by 'DVG Patil.'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               6</span>




All concerned and relevant identity, statutory licences and

permissions stand in the name of DVG Patil.     Prior to 2015

defendant was working as General Manager with "Patil

Parimala Works" i.e. appellant's concern.      Due to some

reasons, defendant-respondent discontinued association with

plaintiff-appellant as an employee.   Both the appellant and

respondent are brothers and one late Malleshgouda Police

Patil is their great grandfather. The family members of both

plaintiff and defendant use surname 'PATIL' predominantly.

The manufacture of the respondent's production is named as

"PATIL FRAGRANCE" of which 'Patil' is defendant's surname.

Hence, conducting any business or trade using the surname is

permitted and not restrained under the Act.      Most of the

people of the family of plaintiff and respondent, in any field

whoever are doing the business, invariably have their trade

name as "Patil" and like that the defendant also has the

similar surname for his products and accordingly his interest

is covered under Section 35 of the Trademarks Act, 1999.


</p><p id="p_7">     4.   In support of the claim, the appellant-plaintiff had

produced documents viz. the Certificate of Importer and

Exporter code dated 1st April 1994 issued by Ministry of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   7</span>




Commerce in the name of "PATIL PARIMALA WORKS".                   The

appellant had also produced Deed of Assignment executed by

one P.M. Patil who is the Proprietor of Patil Parimala Works as

an assignor and the said assignment is entered into between

Shanthaveeramma      P.   Patil   W/o    P.M.    Patil.    The    tax

registration certificate dated 31st July 2009 produced and

marked    as   document     No.3      stand     in   the   name    of

Shanthaveeramma V. Patil. Deed of Assignment was on 27th

July 2009; document No.5 is Tax Registration Certificate

issued in the name of P Patil Somashekar, who is the plaintiff-

appellant and he is shown as Proprietor of Patil Parimala

Works.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">    5.   On his behalf, the defendant has produced copy of

Voter's ID to make out that since many years he is known as

DVG Patil. In Voter's ID, Aadhar Card and in PAN Card also it

is shown as DVG Patil.     He has also produced copy of GST

Registration Certificate which stands in the name of the

Doddaveeranagouda Patil thereby trade name is shown as

"Patil Fragrances" and his business is shown as Proprietary

business. He had also applied for Trademark registration of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              8</span>




product "Hitushree5" (label) which is also advertised in the

Trademark Journal dated 03rd July 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     6. The court below having taken these rival contentions

between the parties, framed the following points for its

consideration:
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     1. whether there exists prima facie case in favour of the
        plaintiff?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2. whether the plaintiff proves      the   balance   of
        convenience in his favour?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     3. whether the petitioner/plaintiff proves that he
        would be put to great hardship, loss and
        inconvenience if an order of temporary injunction
        is not granted?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     4. whether the defendant proves that he would be
        put to great hardship, loss and inconvenience if
        an order to exparte temporary injunction is
        continued.</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">     7.   The court below answered points 1 to 3 in the

negative; and to the point as to, whether the defendant

proves that he would be put to great hardship, loss and

inconvenience if an order to ex parte temporary injunction is

continued, the same has been answered in the affirmative.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9</span>




</p><p id="p_15">      8.   The submissions of the learned Senior Counsel for

the appellant and the learned counsel for the defendant have

been considered.   I have gone through the order passed by

the court below and also the judgments referred to by the

learned Senior Counsel for the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">    9. It is the fundamental right of any citizen to carry out

trade, business, etc. under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_8">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution

of India. But this fundamental right is subject to reasonable

restrictions and also various statutes of State and Central. It

guarantees to practice any profession or to carry any

occupation, trade or business. Sub-clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_9">Article 19</a> of

the Constitution further makes its clear that "nothing in sub-

clause (g) of the said clause shall affect the portion of any

existing law insofar as it imposes, or prevent the State from

making any law imposing in the interest of the general public

reasonable restrictions on the exercise of right conferred by

the said sub-clause." When this is the guarantee made by the

Constitution to any person in order to have his own trade,

commerce, etc. then while dealing with the said subject, the

Courts have to take care before preventing or injuncting any

person in this regard.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 10</span><p id="p_18">




</p><p id="p_19">     10. Section 35 of the Trademark Act reads as follows:


</p><p id="p_20">            "35. Saving for use of name, address or
      description of goods or Services--Nothing in this Act
      shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of a
      registered trade mark to interfere with any bona fide
      use by a person of his own name or that of his place
      of business, or of the name, or of the name of the
      place of business, of any of his predecessors in
      business, or the use by any person of any bona fide
      description of the character or quality of his goods or
      services."
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      11.   In view of the same, even a registered user or a

registered trademark proprietor cannot interfere with the

bona fide use of a person of his own name or that of his place

of business. In this regard, the case of the of the appellant-

plaintiff i.e. 'Patil and Patil Parimala Works' is registered prior

to the registration of the respondent and, of late, respondent

also has registered his trade mark as "Patil Fragrances"; and

hence using of the word "Patil" is infringing the rights of the

appellant-plaintiff and passing off the goods in that name

affects the interest of the plaintiff-appellant. The case of the

appellant has been examined on the basis of the materials

which were placed before the Court below, viz. the bona fide
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                11</span>




use of his name as DVG Patil and it has been substantiated by

relying on the Voters card, Aadhar card and PAN Card. It is

the further case of the respondent that the he happens to be

member of the plaintiff family, and the family members of the

plaintiff and defendant invariably use the word "Patil" as

surname. The defendant's name is also DVG Patil which could

be seen from documents produced to that effect. Under these

circumstances, the defendant has used the surname "Patil" as

bona fide user on the basis of his family name, which is

commonly used in the area where the family came from.

Under the circumstance, as it is alleged by the appellant it

cannot be held that the defendant has used the trade mark

phonetically, visually, conceptually and aurally the identical

and deceptively similar trade name to that of the appellant.

Just because the surname of the appellant is 'Patil', that itself

is not a ground to injunct the defendant from using the word

'Patil' in his trademark. It is a right of a person who carries

the surname from ages together whose family namely is alike

may be for many reasons, and that is their fundamental right.


</p><p id="p_23">      12. Under these circumstances, while interfering in the

matter on the basis of the cases of the appellant, it directly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               12</span>




infringes <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_10">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution and also the

same needs to to be held that Section 35 of the Trademarks

Act enables the defendant-respondent to use it.


</p><p id="p_24">      13. The Judgment in the case of M/S. COTHAS COFFEE

CO. (supra) relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, is the

case where the former partner of the appellant, applied for

registration of Trademark 'Cotha'. In that case it was held by

this Court that it is prima facie deceptive phonetically and

similar one to the trade mark "Cothas" registered by the

appellant therein and the use of trademark "Cotha" used by

the respondent. The said judgment has been examined and

in my opinion the said judgment is not applicable to the fact

and circumstances of this case.    The respondent in the said

case has not established as to how he is entitled for the use of

trademark as "Cotha" and it was undisputed that he was the

partner in the said firm.   In that facts and circumstances of

the case, this Court held that the respondent's attempt to use

the Registration "Cotha" is deceptively similar to that of the

appellant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                13</span><p id="p_25">




</p><p id="p_26">       14.   In the case of ADIGA SWEETS (supra) it is held

that "even if the name of 'Adiga' were suffixed or prefixed

with other name, still it would be a case of infringement or

passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">       15.     It s pertinent to observe here that the Hon'ble

Suprmee Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_11">RUSTON &amp; HORNSBY LIMITED

v. ZAMINDARA ENGINEERING COMPANY</a> reported in (1970)2

SCR 222 has observed that the action for infringement is a

statutory right and it is dependent upon the validity of the

registration and subject to other restrictions laid down in

<a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_12">Sections 30</a>, <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_13">34</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_14">35</a> of the Trade Marks Act. In the light of

the said judgment, the case of appellant has been examined.

While considering the case of the defendant, test is to be

done by reading <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_15">Sections 30</a>, <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_16">34</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_17">35</a> of the Trade Marks

Act.   After having applied the said test it is found that the

defendant was entitled to get the trade mark registered by

suffixing the word 'Patil', which is used as bona fide.


</p><p id="p_29">       16.     The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/767356/" id="a_18">N.

RANGA RAO AND SONS v. ANIL GARG AND OTHERS</a> reported
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  14</span>




in 2005 STPL 18201 DELHI while dealing with similar case, at

paragraph 17 of the judgment has observed thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         "17. The plaintiff has also referred to the fact that
    the name DIA is not co-incidental since the defendants
    are trading under the name and style 'Divya Inscense
    (India) Pvt. Ltd.', thus, the word 'DIVYA' as such could
    have been chosen and the word 'DIA' is stated to have
    been chosen solely due to its visual and phonetic
    similarity to the plaintiffs LIA mark. The plaintiff claims
    that the test of unsuspecting consumer with average
    intelligence and imperfect recollection must be applied
    and if the said test is applied, the consumer is bound
    to be deceived. The get-up of the two products is
    stated to be identical and the product is being sold at
    the unusual rate of Rs. 15/- for 35 sticks in the same
    fashion as the plaintiff's product."</blockquote><p id="p_30">


</p><p id="p_31">     17. This has been examined by the Court below. The

appellant had produced several invoices of "Patil Parimala

Works" sold through those invoices incense sticks and "Patil

Parimala Works" is selling these incense sticks in the name

and style "Ullas".   Defendant also produced empty incense

stick cover of his product which is named as "Patil Fragrance"

whereunder    incense   sticks   are   named    as   "Hitushree5".

Except for the common name 'Patil' both of the plaintiff and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               15</span>




the defendant, both of their brand name is distinct, viz. the

appellant's brand is 'Ullas' and the defendant's brand is

"Hitushree5" and phonetically also not similar so as to deceive

the customers. The products of the respective parties are in

different names. Only the surname 'Patil' has been used by

both the appellant as well as the defendant.       Under these

circumstances, it would not make much common for the

buyer as the brands are referred to in two different names

'Ullas' and 'Hitushree5'. So also, the submission made by the

learned Senior Counsel, the respondent is passing off or

marketing the goods deceptively as that of the appellant

cannot be accepted. I have examined the case in the light of

<a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_19">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act and the said Section makes

it clear that even the registered user or a registered trade

mark proprietor cannot be interfered with a bona fide use of a

person or his own name or that of his place of business. In

respect of of bona fide use, the defendant has produced the

materials to the satisfaction of the Court below.    It was his

case that he hails from Patil family and palintiff happens to be

the relative and also in the family circle the family members,

who are in occupation of various business in their walks of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                16</span>




life, invariably use their surname 'Patil' in their respective

businesses.   The Tax Registration Certificate, Voter ID card,

Aadhar Card, PAN Card all show the name of the respondent

as DVG Patil. In view of the same, it is to be held that the

respondent has used the said trademark as bona fide and the

same cannot be interfered with. While saying so, I have also

taken note of the fundamental right guaranteed by the

Constitution of India to carry on the business with reasonable

restrictions. Along with it <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_20">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act

enables the respondent-defendant to make use of the word

'Patil' which is bona fide use.     The products of both the

appellant and defendants are different and only the name of

the company is similar i.e. "Patil and Patil Parimala Works' of

the appellant and 'Patil Fragrances' of the defendant.      As

mentioned earlier, while the appellant's brand of incense stick

is named 'Ullas', the defendant's is 'Hitushree5' which are

entirely distinct.   By considering these two aspects, I hold

that the courr below has examined the respective case of the

parties while passing the impugned order vacating the

temporary injunction granted and the reasons assigned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                               17</span>




therein are sound and proper. Hence, I also concur with the

order passed by the Trial Court.
