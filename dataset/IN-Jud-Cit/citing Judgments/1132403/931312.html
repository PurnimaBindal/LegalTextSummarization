<p id="p_10">3.0	Learned
Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta raised contention before this Court
challenging aforesaid interim order, which has been passed by the
trial Court under Sec. 9 of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>,
1996 (for short  the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_2">Arbitration Act</a> ).  Learned Advocate
Mr. Shalin Mehta submitted that on 6th March 2007,
Business Conducting Agreement signed by both parties.  The premises
in question, is belonging to respondent, where retails and
departmental stores conducted by appellant in the name of 'Vishal
Mega Mart'.  On 
4th April 2007 possession of property
handed over to appellant by respondent.  On 17th June 2007
rent period started, which is to be paid by appellant.  About
15,000/- sq. ft. area for parking place was not provided by
respondent and therefore, dispute has been arisen, which required
renegotiation between both the parties.  Therefore, on 
20th
October 2007, two separate agreements, after renegotiation, arrived
at between both the parties viz. Business Conducting Agreement and
Service and Amenities Agreement.  The date of renegotiation commenced
on is 13th October 2007.  The minimum monthly rent for a
period of three years decided, wherein one month rent is
Rs.18,63,812/-.  On 31st July 2008 alleged default of not
paying rent by appellant committed meaning thereby that, the
appellant stopped paying rent to the respondent.  On 7th
November 2008, the appellant wrote termination letter to terminate
mutually both agreements.  This aspect has been denied by respondent
vide letter dated 10th November 2008.  On 27th
February 2009, Rs.12,69,923/- monthly rent towards November/December
2008 paid by appellant to respondent.  Similarly, on 15th
May 2009, Rs.12,69,923/- monthly rent for  January/February 2009 paid
by the appellant to respondent.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_11">3.1	On
5th September 2009, an application under Sec. 9 of the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_3">Arbitration Act</a> has been filed by respondent.  The trial Court passed
order on 16th October 2009 and certain directions have
been issued by the trial Court, which are on page 13 to the appeal. 
The arbitration proceedings have commenced from November 2009 and no
dispute is raised for commencing arbitration proceedings.  However,
respondent is not agree to this submission made by learned Advocate
Mr. Shalin Mehta.  In respect to security amount of Rs.62,80,000/-,
according to learned Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta, it has been wrongly
forfeited by respondent.  Learned Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta
emphasized that direction in respect to solvent security of 2.5
crores shall have to be executed by appellant is an unwarranted
because there is no base established by respondent before the trial
Court.  He relied upon 
Para 8 of the impugned order and also
relied upon a decision of the Honourable Apex Court, reported in 2009
AIR SCW 7551 in respect to fact that in absence of prima facie case,
if not established by respondent before trial Court, then question of
balance of convenience and irreparable loss caused to respondent have
no meaning to grant to interim relief in favour of the respondent by
trial Court.  He also referred to Para 10 of the order and submitted
that trial Court has secured the amount for respondent, which amounts
to giving final direction by way of interim order.  Therefore,
impugned order is bad.  He is also harping upon these facts that
apparently the order passed by the trial Court, which amounts to a
final or in permanent measure in favour of respondent, such order
cannot be passed.  For that, he relied upon a decision of the
Honourable Apex Court, in the case of Firm Ashok Traders and Anr. Vs.
Gurumukhdas Saluja and Ors., reported in (2004) 3 SCC 155, more
particularly Para 17, which is quoted as under:  
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_12"> 17.	There
are two other factors which are weighing heavily with us and which we
proceed to record. As per the law laid down by this Court in M/s.
Sundaram Finance Ltd. an application under<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4"> S. 9</a> seeking interim
relief is maintainable even before commencement of arbitral
proceedings. What does that mean? In M/s. Sundaram Finance Ltd.,
itself the Court has said   (SCC p.488, Para.19)
 


 


 


"It
is true that when an application under<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_5"> S. 9</a> is filed before the
commencement of the arbitral proceedings there has to be manifest
intention on the part of the applicant to take recourse to the
arbitral proceedings." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_13"><a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_6">Section
9</a> permits application being filed in the Court before the
commencement of the arbitral proceedings but the provision does not
give any indication of how much before. The word 'before' means,
inter alia, ahead of; in presence or sight of; under the
consideration or cognizance of.' The two events sought to be
interconnected by use of the term 'before' must have proximity of
relationship by reference to occurrence; the later event proximately
following the preceding event as a foreseeable or 'within sight'
certainty. The party invoking<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_7"> S. 9</a> may not have actually commenced
the arbitral proceedings but must be able to satisfy the Court that
the arbitral proceedings are actually contemplated or manifestly
intended (as M/s. Sundaram Finance Ltd. puts it) and are positively
going to commence within a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time
will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and the
nature of interim relief sought for would itself give an indication
thereof. The distance of time must not be such as would destroy the
proximity of relationship of the two events between which it exists
and elapses. The purpose of enacting<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_8"> S. 9</a>, read in the light of the
Model Law and UNCITRAL Rules is to provide 'interim measures of
protection.' The order passed by the Court should fall within the
meaning of the expression 'an interim measure of protection' as
distinguished from an all-time or permanent protection. 	
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_14">3.2	Learned
Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta submitted that order itself is harsh and
unjust as well as disproportionate restoring possession in favour of
respondent.  He submitted that trial Court itself has observed in
Para 9 that,  who terminated the agreement is required to be proved
during trial before arbitration and thus, there is a prima facie case
in favour of applicant .  Relying upon this observation he
emphasized that prima facie case is not established before the trial
Court.  The
trial Court is not
clear about the fact that who has terminated the agreement. 
Therefore, according to him, no prima facie case is proved by
respondent before the trial Court and there is clear perversity
in direction issued by the trial Court
and he relied upon Para 10 (Page 21) of the application made by
respondent.  He submitted that looking to the amount found to
be due and payable by respondent means present appellant to the
respondent an on 31st
July 2009 it comes to Rs.52,40,938/- up to 31st
July 2008, but present respondent
is not giving any deduction to present appellant.  He emphasized that
due amount up to date of termination of agreement on 31st
December 2008, it comes to Rs.52,40,938/- as per Para 10 (Page
</p><p id="p_15">21) of application.  He submitted that security amount is
lying with respondent but, for that, no adjustment is given.  The
Para 10 (Page21) of application filed by respondent before trial
Court is quoted as under:  
</p>

3.3	He
further relied upon Sec. 9 of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_9">Arbitration Act</a> and submitted that
securing amount cannot be considered to permit withdrawal of said
amount to present respondent.  In short, his submission is that the
trial Court has committed a gross error in granting interim relief in
favour of respondent without considering prima facie case in favour
of respondent and therefore, it requires interference of this
Court.  Therefore, present appeal is required to be admitted by this
Court and to grant interim relief against impugned order dated 16th
October 2009.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_30">4.0	Learned
Advocate Mr. Nitin Mehta appearing on behalf of respondent raised
contention that question of termination of agreements itself proved
by conduct of appellant itself.  He submitted that a contract arrived
at between both the parties   one is in respect to Business
Conducting Agreement and another is Service and Amenities Agreement,
which have not been complied by the appellant means a legal and
contractual obligation must have to be performed by the appellant and
appellant should have to show bonafide to pay due amount to present
respondent.  But no payment is made by appellant as admitted by
appellant from the date of application filed before the trial Court
by respondent.  No payment is made at all by appellant to the
respondent.  He submitted that appellant is
enjoying property belong to respondent for more than 1? years
continuously but no due payment is made by appellant to respondent. 
Learned Advocate Mr. Nitin Mehta emphasized that conduct of
appellant itself becomes prima facie case in favour of respondent
because it is not bonafide litigation but in guise of litigation, the
appellant is enjoying property without any payment to be made to the
respondent.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_31">4.1	Learned
Advocate Mr. Nitin Mehta submitted that certain documents have been
produced by appellant before the trial Court.  From that documents,
learned Advocate Mr. Nitin Mehta relied upon a letter dated 7th
November 2008, where agreements have been terminated w.e.f. 1st
January 2009 and appellant shall have to handover the possession of
the premises on 1st January 2009.  In the said letter it
is made clear that agreements have been terminated, which had arrived
at between both the parties dated 20th October 2007 w.e.f.
1st January 2009.  A reply is given by the respondent by
letter dated 10th November 2008 to appellant where it was
made clear by respondent to appellant that,  we deny that we had
ever agreed to terminate the above Business Conducting Agreement
dated 20th October 2007.  We are extremely
shocked to receive the above captioned letter .  In Para 4 of
the said letter of respondent, where it is made clear by respondent
that,  we never intended to terminate the said agreements since,
if we would have intended, we certainly could have done it pursuant
to the afore-stated non-payment at your end.  We state that it is for
the first time that such an intention of termination is communicated
to us.  We state that decision of termination is solely a unilateral
action from your side and we do not consent to the same.  The lock-in
period as per the agreement Clause 3.4
of both the agreements is for 03 years, which expires
on 12th October 2010 .  Therefore,
learned Advocate Mr. Nitin Mehta, relying upon the aforesaid Para 4
of the reply dated 10th November 2008 to the letter of the
appellant dated 
7th November 2008 submitted that
agreements are unilaterally terminated by the appellant by letter
dated 7th November 2008, which was replied by present
respondent vide letter dated 10th November 2008, as
referred above.  Therefore, in such circumstances, he submitted that
at least to show bonafide by appellant undisputed amount according to
the appellant requires to be paid to respondent but no payment is
made till date by the appellant considering application preferred by
respondent under Sec. 9 of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_10">Arbitration Act</a> before the trial
Court.  He also made it clear that amount claimed by respondent is
after deducting Security Deposit amount.  In short, his submission is
that both the agreements are terminated by appellant unilaterally for
which respondent had never agreed to it.  Therefore, it is a clear
default committed by appellant, which itself shows a prima facie case
established by the respondent before the trial Court, which has been
rightly considered by the trial Court and on that basis, interim
relief has been granted for which the trial Court has jurisdiction. 
He relied upon one decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the
case of Nepa Ltd. Vs. Manoj Kumar Agrawal, reported in AIR 1999
Madhya Pradesh 57, more particularly Head Note (B).
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_32">5.0	Learned
Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta again emphasized on Para 9 of the impugned
order (Page 7) and submitted that trial Court is not sure about the
fact as to who has terminated the agreement.  That question is kept
open, which do not establish the prima facie case in favour of
respondent.  He referred to a letter dated 1st December
2008 of M/s. K.C. Kalra &amp; Co., Advocates, more particularly, Para
3 of the letter for suggesting,  that in a joint meeting dated
5th November 2008, which took place at the
Corporate Office of our client it was amicably decided between you
and our client to terminate both the above-mentioned agreements. 
Pursuant to the discussions held amicably between you and our client
that both above-referred agreements shall stand terminated w.e.f. 1st
January 2009 .  This letter of M/s. K.C. Kalra &amp; Co.,
Advocates, dated 1st December 2008 is addressed to present
respondent and it was given by Advocate under instructions and on
behalf of M/s. Vishal Retails Ltd., Rangpuri, New Delhi   present
appellant.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_33">5.1	These
facts have been denied by learned Advocate 
Mr. Nitin Mehta relying
upon letter dated 7th November 2008 communicated to
respondent against which reply was given by present respondent vide
letter dated 10th November 2008.  Therefore, learned
Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta submitted that both agreements have been
terminated by mutual agreement and therefore, agreements were not
terminated by appellant.     
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_34">6.0	Except,
as referred above, no other and further contentions have been raised
by either of the learned Advocates and no other decision is relied
upon by them except as referred above.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_35">6.1	In
light of this background, this Court has to consider the question,
whether the order passed by the trial Court dated 
16th
October 2009 in Civil Misc. Application preferred by the respondent
under Sec. 9 of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_11">Arbitration Act</a> is legal and valid or not. 
Before dealing with the contentions raised by both learned Advocates,
it is necessary to consider Sec. 9 of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_12">Arbitration Act</a>, which is
quoted as under:

<p id="p_44">6.2	A
party or a person is entitled to interim protection if action of the
other party is either in breach of the terms of the agreement or
militates against equity, fair play or natural justice as per
decision of Delhi High Court in case of Baby Arya Vs. Delhi Vidyut
Board, reported in AIR 2002 Del 50.  The scope of Sec. 9 of the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_14">Arbitration Act</a> only deals with the interim measure by the Court. 
Obviously, it is not within the scope of this section to inquire into
the claim and the counter claim made by both the parties in regard to
the custody of the articles beyond what has been admitted by
the respondent, reported in case of Narain Sahai Aggarwal Vs. Santosh
Rani, reported in 1997 (2) Arb LR 322.  The trial Court, while
considering application under Sec. 9(ii)(b)  of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_15">Arbitration Act</a>,
is given power and jurisdiction securing the amount in dispute in the
arbitration and also to pass any direction as interim measure of
protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient.

<p id="p_45">6.3	The
question of interim relief when it to be granted has examined by the
Honourable Apex Court in case of M.
</p><p id="p_46">Gurudas Vs. Rasaranjan, reported in 2006 AIR SCW 4773.  While
considering interim relief application, the Court has to consider
finding on prima facie case which would finding fact. 
However, while arriving at such finding of fact, Court not only must
arrive at a conclusion that a case for trial has been made out but
would consider question in regard to balance of convenience of
parties as also irreparable injury which might be suffered by
plaintiffs if prayer for injunction is to be refused.  Court has to
consider the conduct of defendants was undisputedly relevant.  The
relevant Paras viz. Nos. 19 to 22 and 37 from aforesaid decision are
quoted as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_47"> 19.
	While considering an application for injunction, it is well-settled,
the courts would pass an order thereupon having regard to:
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_48">	(i)
Prima facie
 


</p><p id="p_49">	(ii)
Balance of convenience
 


</p><p id="p_50">	(iii)
Irreparable injury.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_51">20.	A
finding on 'prima facie case' would be a finding of fact. However,
while arriving at such finding of fact, the court not only must
arrive at a conclusion that a case for trial has been made out but
also other factors requisite for grant of injunction exist. There may
be a debate as has been sought to be raised by Dr. Rajeev Dhawan that
the decision of House of Lords in <a href="/doc/797639/" id="a_16">American Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd</a>.
[1975] 1 All ER 504 would have no application in a case of this
nature as was opined by this Court in <a href="/doc/1722050/" id="a_17">Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd.
v. Hindustan Lever Ltd</a>. [(1999) 7 SCC 1] and <a href="/doc/1132403/" id="a_18">S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v.
Cadbury (India) Ltd</a>. [(2000) 5 SCC 573], but we are not persuaded to
delve thereinto. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_52">21.
	We may only notice that the decisions of this Court in Colgate
Palmolive (supra) and S.M. Dyechem Ltd (supra) relate to intellectual
property rights. The question, however, has been taken into
consideration by a Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/558150/" id="a_19">Transmission Corpn. of A.P.
Ltd. v. Lanco Kondapalli Power (P) Ltd</a>. [(2006) 1 SCC 540] stating:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_53">"The
Respondent, therefore, has raised triable issues. What would
constitute triable issues has succinctly been dealt with by the House
of Lords in its well-known decision in American Cyanamid Co v.
Ethicon Ltd. [(1975) 1 AER 504], holding :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_54">"Your
Lordships should in my view take this opportunity of declaring that
there is no such rule. The use of such expression as 'a probability',
'a prima facie case', or 'a strong prima facie case' in the context
of the exercise of a discretionary power to grant an interlocutory
injunction leads to confusion as to the object sought to be achieved
by this form of temporary relief. The court no doubt must be
satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious; in other
words, that there is a serious question to be tried." 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_55">It
was further observed :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_56">"Where
other factors appear to be evenly balanced it is a counsel of
prudence to take such measures as are calculated to preserve the
status quo. If the defendant is enjoined temporarily from doing
something that he has not done before, the only effect of the
interlocutory injunction in the event of his succeeding at the trial
is to postpone the date at which he is able to embark on a course of
action which he has not previously found it necessary to undertake;
whereas to interrupt him in the conduct of an established enterprise
would cause much greater inconvenience to him since he would have to
start again to establish it in the event of his succeeding at the
trial.
</p> 

<p id="p_57">*
* *
 


The
factors which he took into consideration, and in my view properly,
were that Ethicon's sutures XLG were not yet on the market; so that
had no business which would be brought to a stop by the injunction;
no factories would be closed and no workpeople would be thrown out of
work. They held a dominant position in the United Kingdom market for
absorbable surgical sutures and adopted an aggressive sales policy."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_58">We
are, however, not oblivious of the subsequent development of law both
in England as well as in this jurisdiction. The Chancery Division in
Series 5 Software v. Clarke [(1996) 1 All ER 853] opined:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_59">"In
many cases before American Cyanamid the prospect of success was one
of the important factors taken into account in assessing the balance
of convenience. The courts would be less willing to subject the
plaintiff to the risk of irrecoverable loss which would befall him if
an interlocutory injunction was refused in those cases where it
thought he was likely to win at the trial than in those cases where
it thought he was likely to lose. The assessment of the prospects of
success therefore was an important factor in deciding whether the
court should exercise its discretion to grant interlocutory relief.
It is this consideration which American Cyanamid is said to have
prohibited in all but the most exceptional case. So it is necessary
to consider with some care what was said in the House of Lords on
this issue."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_60"><a href="/doc/1722050/" id="a_20">In
Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v. Hindustan Lever Ltd</a>. [(1999) 7 SCC
1], this Court observed that Laddie, J. in Series 5 Software (supra)
had been able to resolve the issue without any departure from the
true perspective of the judgment in American Cyanamid. In that case,
however, this Court was considering a matter under Monopolies and
Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969.

<p id="p_61"><a href="/doc/1132403/" id="a_21">In

Jagannadha Rao, J. in a case arising under Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_22">Merchandise
Marks Act</a>, 1958 reiterated the same principle stating that even the
comparative strength and weaknesses of the parties may be a
subject-matter of consideration for the purpose of grant of
injunction in trade mark matters stating :	
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_62">"21.
</p><p id="p_63">Therefore, in trademark matters, it is now necessary to go into the
question of "comparable strength" of the cases of either
party, apart from balance of convenience. Point 4 is decided
accordingly."

said decisions were noticed yet again in a case involving

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_65">22.	While
considering the question of granting an order of injunction one way
or the other, evidently, the court, apart from finding out a prima
facie case, would consider the question in regard to the balance of
convenience of the parties as also irreparable injury which might be
suffered by the plaintiffs if the prayer for injunction is to be
refused. The contention of the plaintiffs must be bona fide. The
question sought to be tried must be a serious question and not only
on a mere triable issue. [<a href="/doc/1822024/" id="a_24">See Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab

terms.	1995 AIR SCW 3521, Para 50	
 


 


 


"47.
</p><p id="p_67">In this context, it would be relevant to mention that in the instant
case GBC had approached the High Court for the injunction order,
granted earlier, to be vacated. Under Order 39 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with an order of
interlocutory or temporary injunction is purely equitable and,
therefore, the Court, on being approached, will, apart from other
considerations, also look to the conduct of the party invoking the
jurisdiction of the Court, and may refuse to interfere unless his
conduct was free from blame. Since the relief is wholly equitable in
nature, the party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court has to show
that he himself was not at fault and that he himself was not
responsible for bringing about the state of things complained of and
that he was not unfair or inequitable in his dealings with the party
against whom he was seeking relief. His conduct should be fair and
honest. These considerations will arise not only in respect of the
person who seeks an order of injunction under Order 39, Rule 1 or
Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, but also in respect of the
party approaching the Court for vacating the ad interim or temporary
injunction order already granted in the pending suit or proceedings."

Paras from the above referred recent decision viz. Nos. 23 to 32 are
quoted as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_71">23.	Interim
order is passed on the basis of prima facie findings, which are
tentative. Such order is passed as a temporary arrangement to
preserve the status quo till the matter is decided finally, to ensure
that the matter does not become either infructuous or a fait accompli
before the final hearing. The object of the interlocutory injunction
is, to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right
for which he could not be adequately compensated in damages
recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his
favour at the trial. (vide <a href="/doc/446103/" id="a_29">Anand Prasad Agarwalla v. State of Assam</a>

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_72">24.	Grant
of an interim relief in regard to the nature and extent thereof
depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case as no
strait-jacket formula can be laid down.  There may be a situation
wherein the defendant/respondent may use the suit property in such a
manner that the situation becomes irretrievable. In such a fact
situation, interim relief should be granted (vide M. Gurudas &amp;

of temporary injunction, is governed by three basic principles, I.e.
prima facie case; balance of convenience; and irreparable injury,

appropriate for any court to hold a mini trial at the stage of grant

<p id="p_74">26.	In
Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. Vs. Hindustan Lever Ltd., AIR 1999SC
3105, this court observed that the other considerations which ought
to weigh with the Court hearing the application or petition for the
grant of injunctions are as below :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_75">(I)	Extent
of damages being an adequate remedy;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_76">(ii)	Protect
the plaintiff s interest for violation of his rights though however
having regard to the injury that may be suffered by the defendants by
reason therefor ;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_77">(iii)	The
court while dealing with the matter ought not to ignore the factum of
strength of one party s case being stronger than the others;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_78">(iv)	No
fixed rules or notions ought to be had in the matter of grant of
injunction but on the facts and circumstances of each case- the
relief being kept flexible;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_79">(v)	The
issue is to be looked from the point of view as to whether on refusal
of the injunction the plaintiff would suffer irreparable loss and
injury keeping in view the strength of the parties  case;
</p> 


<p id="p_80">(vi)	Balance
of convenience or inconvenience ought to be considered as an
important requirement even if there is a serious question or prima
facie case in support of the grant;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_81">(vii)	Whether
the grant or refusal of injunction will adversely affect the interest
of general public which can or cannot be compensated otherwise. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_82">27.	In
Dalpat Kumar &amp; Anr. Vs. Prahlad Singh &amp; Ors., AIR 1993 SC
276, the Supreme Court explained the scope of aforesaid material
circumstances, but observed as under:-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_83"> The
phrases `prima facie case , `balance of convenience  and
`irreparable loss  are not rhetoric phrases for incantation, but
words of width and elasticity, to meet myriad situations presented by
man s ingenuity in given facts and circumstances, but always is
hedged with sound exercise of judicial discretion to meet the ends of
justice. The facts rest eloquent and speak for themselves. It is well
nigh impossible to find from facts prima facie case and balance of
convenience. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_84">28.	This
Court in Manohar Lal Chopra Vs. Rai Bahadur Rao Raja Seth Hira Lal,
AIR 1962 SC 527 held that the civil court has a power to grant
interim injunction in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction even if
the case does not fall within the ambit of provisions of Order 39
Code of Civil Procedure.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_85">29.	<a href="/doc/160789/" id="a_31">In
Deoraj vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors</a>. AIR 2004 SC 1975, this
Court considered a case where the courts below had refused the grant
of  interim relief.   While dealing with the appeal, the Court
observed that ordinarily in exercise of its jurisdiction under
<a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_32">Art.136</a> of the Constitution, this Court does not interfere with the
orders of interim nature passed by the High Court. However, this rule
of discretion followed in practice is by way of just self-imposed
restriction. An irreparable injury which forcibly tilts the balance
in favour of the applicant, may persuade the Court even to grant an
interim relief though it may amount to granting the final relief
itself. The Court held as under:-
</p> 


 


 


 
 


 


<p id="p_86"> The
Court would grant such an interim relief only if satisfied that
withholding of it would prick the conscience of the court and do
violence to the sense of justice, resulting in injustice being
perpetuated throughout the hearing, and at the end the court would
not be able to vindicate the cause of justice. 
</p> 

 
 


 


<p id="p_87">30.	Such
a course is permissible when the case of the applicant is based on
his fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. (vide
<a href="/doc/51800/" id="a_33">All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam vs. Chief Secretary, Govt.
of Tamil Nadu &amp; Ors</a>. (2009) 5 SCC 452)
 

 
 


 


</p><p id="p_88">31.	In
Bombay Dyeing &amp; Manufacturing Co. Ltd. Vs. Bombay Environmental
Action Group &amp; Ors. (2005) 5 SCC 61, this Court observed as
under:-
</p> 

 
 


 


<p id="p_89"> The
courts, however, have to strike a balance between two extreme
positions viz. Whether the writ petition would itself become
infructuous if interim order is refused, on the one hand, and the
enormity of losses and hardships which may be suffered by others if
an interim order is granted, particularly having regard to the fact
that in such an event, the losses sustained by the affected parties
thereby may not be possible to be redeemed. 
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_90">32.	Thus,
the law on the issue emerges to the effect that interim injunction
should be granted by the Court after considering all the pros
and cons of the case in a given set of facts involved therein on the
risk and responsibility of the party or, in case he looses the case,
he cannot take any advantage of the same. The order can be passed on
settled principles taking into account the three basic grounds I.e.
prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss. The
delay in approaching the Court is of course a good ground for refusal
of interim relief, but in exceptional circumstances, where the case
of a party is based on fundamental rights guaranteed under the
Constitution and there is an apprehension that suit property may be
developed in a manner that it acquires irretrievable situation, the
Court may grant relief even at a belated stage provided the court is
satisfied that the applicant has not been negligent in pursuing the
case.
</p> 


 

 

<p id="p_91">6.5	The
Division Bench of this Court, in the case of Jasoda Indralal
Vadhva Vs. Hemedrabhai Kakulal Vyas and Ors., reported in 2009 (2)
GLH 437, has decided the issue, that while considering the interim
order passed by the trial Court that what are the powers of the
Appellate Court in considering such interim order passed by the trial
Court.  The relevant discussion is made in Para 13 of the said
judgment, which is quoted as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_92">"13.	Granting
of injunction is a matter of discretion.  Balance of convenience and
irreparable injury are triable issues and are required to be examined
and positively found.  It is settled law that while hearing appeal
against discretionary
exercise of powers by the trial judge, while deciding the application
under Order 39, Rule 1 and 2 of C.P.C. the appellate court is not
expected to interfere with the discretion, unless it is shown that
power has been exercised arbitrarily, capriciously or in perversity
and against the settled principles of law.  Appellate court is not
expected to reassess the material and to reach a conclusion different
than  the one reached by the court below.  If the one reached by the
court was reasonably a plausible view, appellate court would normally
not be justified in interfering with the order.  But, if the exercise
of discretion in appeal is only on the ground that the matter has not
received consideration at trial court stage, then it would have come
to a different conclusion and the appellate court can interfere with
the exercise of discretion of trial court provided it is satisfied
about prima facie strong case, balance of convenience and extreme
urgency. "	
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_93">7.0	In
light of scope of Sec. 9 of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_34">Arbitration Act</a> and not to decide
merits between parties while considering interim application, the
observations made by trial Court in Paras 9 and 10 are quoted as
under: 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_94"> 9.	From
the above discussion fact, it appears that applicant has substantial
case for a trial during arbitration.  As noticed herein above it is
the case of applicant that respondent terminated the first agreement.
 The respondent however claims that it was terminated by mutual
agreement.  As to who terminated the agreement is required to
be proved during trial before arbitration and thus there is prima
facie case in favour of applicant.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_95">10.	So
far as balance of convenience and irreparable loss are concerned,
undisputedly even after expressing its intention to handover the
possession of the property in question to the applicant by the
afore-mentioned letter, the respondent does not appear to have handed
over the possession, except that the applicant has taken possession
of the parking lot as indicated in the application.  The rest of the
area is admittedly being used and enjoyed by the respondent without
paying any rent or charges whatsoever.  The only basis for non
payment of the rentals and other dues of applicant as propounded by
the respondent is that there was a revision in rentals but even that
aspect is prima facie not established by the respondent.  Admittedly
what has been produced by the respondent is a mere a draft of
agreement which is not accepted by the applicant.  It is submitted
that a cheque, after such revision came to be accepted by the
applicant.  While, disputing the said facts and also disputing the
execution of any agreement or modification of terms of the contract,
learned Advocate for the applicant has rightly pointed out that even
if said draft agreement produced at mark 20/4 is taken into
consideration at face value, total monthly rental which according to
respondent was agreed to be paid Rs.10,21,000/- per month and thus no
prudent man would have accepted the sum of Rs.8,21,000/- by so called
acknowledgment receipt mark 20/1.  It is also pertinent to note that
in the so called draft agreement mark 20/4 relied upon by respondent,
it has been clearly stated that rest of the terms and conditions will
remain to be same.  Thus by making such a statement, the respondent
approved all the terms and conditions in the aforementioned two
agreements and if the respondent intends to enjoy the property in
question, it is required to be put to suitable terms for such use
before the disputes are settled during intended arbitration.  For the
purpose of interim orders, the court at this stage is inclined to
take into consideration the admitted position by the respondent.  As
admitted by the respondent, it was required to pay Rs.3,21,000/- or
0.5% of the turn over which ever is higher as the Business Conducting
fees and Rs.7,00,000/- towards services and amenities fees per month.
 Thus, if even after expressing its intention to return possession of
property the respondent continues to use the same,  there can be no
difficulty in requiring the respondent to pay such admitted amount to
the applicant every month from 01/01/2009 as indicated by the
respondent in the draft agreement.  The draft agreement mark 20/4
also indicates that respondent wanted to modify the terms of the
agreement with effect from 01/01/2009 and it is further stated that
rest of the conditions of previous agreements shall have to adhered
to.  Thus, as admitted by respondent, two agreements relied upon by
the applicant continued upto 31/12/2008 is required to be adhered to
and therefore, respondent is bound to release the outstanding as on
31/12/2008 on the basis of such agreements, since the respondent can
not retain the possession of the property without paying anything to
the applicant.    
</p>
 


   

 


<p id="p_96">7.1	The
trial Court has also considered overall circumstances before granting
relief in favour of present respondent in Paras 12, 13 and 14 which
are quoted as under:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_97"> 12.	Thus,
considering overall circumstances, it appears that there is no
dispute that the agreements mark 3/3 and 3/4 were executed between
the parties.  Admittedly respondent expressed its intention to
handover the possession of the property to the applicant with effect
from 01/01/2009, but it didn't.  The respondent has stopped paying
even a single pie to applicant.  Thus, on one hand, by retaining
possession of the property, the respondent has prevented the
applicant from putting the property to other use.  On the other hand,
if the interim orders are passed, the respondent will not lose
anything as it would be paying for the use of the property in
question.  The absence of interim order would cause irreparable
injury to the applicant which can not be compensated in terms of
money.  Balance of convenience is also in favour of applicant.    
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_98">13.	Termination
of the agreement mark 3/3 exposes respondent to severe consequences
like double the rent etc.  According to applicant, the total dues
have crossed 5 Crores and these dues will keep on mounting during
arbitral proceedings as the same is likely to consume time. 
Therefore, to secure applicant's interest, the respondent must be
required to execute a security at least in the sum of
Rs.2,50,00,000/-.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_99">14.	It
is true that under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_35">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_36">Conciliation Act</a>,
1996, application for interim orders can be preferred even before
arbitration proceeding, however in order to see that the respondent
is not put to hanging sword in the nature of this order, applicant
shall be oblige to initiate arbitration proceeding within 4 weeks
from today by giving notice to the respondent.  Under the
circumstances, the application must partly succeeds and hence
following order is passed...   
</p>
 


 


 

<p id="p_100">7.2	The
contention is raised by learned Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta that trial
Court is not sure or clear as to who has terminated the agreements
between both the parties, therefore only, prima facie case is not
established by respondent before trial Court.  But according to the
trial Court, respondent has substantial case for a trial during
arbitration.  It is also necessary to note that if, at an interim
stage, the trial Court decided the question as to who has
terminated the agreements then it amounts to finding given by trial
Court to decide merits of the matter.  Therefore, that question has
been left open which can be required to be proved by either party
before the Arbitrator during trial in arbitration.  But respondent
has a substantial case for trial during arbitration, has been
justified the prima facie case in favour of respondent.  The trial
Court has also considered in Para 11 that respondent has a prima
facie good case and interest of respondent is required to be
protected, otherwise award, which may be passed in favour of
respondent, become paper award.  Therefore, trial Court has taken
care while dealing with question of interim relief not to give
finding in respect to merits of the matter so it will not adversely
affect either of party while deciding arbitration proceedings.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_101">7.3	The
trial Court has also considered certain facts which have been
admitted by present appellant in Para 10 of the impugned order.  The
trial Court has also considered one important aspect that possession
of the property is not handed over by appellant to respondent w.e.f.
1st January 2009 and without paying anything, retained the
possession of the property of present respondent, which apparently
amounts to clear breach of both agreements arrived at between both
the parties.  Once, breach has been committed or default has been
committed by present appellant, found apparent from record and also
from the conduct of appellant, that itself proves or establishes the
prima facie case in favour of respondent, which has rightly been
examined by the trial Court while deciding interim relief
application.  Therefore, decision which has been relied by the
learned Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta in case of Kashi Math Samsthan and
Anr. Vs. Srimad Sudhindra Thirtha Swamy and Anr., reported in 2009
(14) scale 274, wherein, the Honourable Apex Court has observed that
 while considering the interim relief application under O.XXXIX
R.1 and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure being
a discretionary remedy and in such case when a party fails to prove
prima facie case to go for trial then it is not open to the Court to
grant injunction in his favour even if, he has made out case of
balance of convenience being in his favour .  The
aforesaid observations are not applicable to the facts of the present
case considering observations made by trial Court because in Para 9 
the trial Court has made it clear that, from the above discussion
fact,  it appears that applicant (means present respondent) has
substantial case for a trial during arbitration  and in Para 10
also the trial Court has come to the conclusion that no prima facie
case has been established by respondent   present appellant in his
favour and certain admitted facts by present appellant have also been
considered which amounts to admitted position by present appellant. 
So, after perusing entire interim order passed by the trial Court, it
is very clear that trial Court has made clear observation in favour
of present respondent that present respondent has established prima
facie case in his favour, which has been rightly decided by trial
Court and thereafter, trial Court has rightly considered the question
of balance of convenience and irreparable loss caused to respondent. 
</p>

 

 


 

<p id="p_102">7.4	According
to my opinion, the trial Court has rightly exercised its
discretionary power while granting relief in favour of present
respondent.  For that even, trial Court has not committed any error,
which requires interference by this Court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_103">7.5	The
contention raised by learned Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta that no prima
facie case is established by respondent before trial Court.  Prima
facie case does not mean that the Court should examine the merits of
the case closely and come to a conclusion that the petitioner has a
case in which he has rightly succeeded.  This would amount to
prejudging the case on merits.  All that the Court has to see is that
on face of it, the person applying for interim relief has a case,
which needs consideration.  The balance of convenience has also to be
looked into.  This view has been taken by the Bombay High Court in
the case reported in 2000 (2) Bom LR 624.  For that, according to my
opinion, the trial Court has not committed any error, which requires
interference by this Court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_104">7.6	Learned
Advocate Mr. Nitin Mehta relied upon a decision of Madhya Pradesh
High Court in the case of Nepa Ltd. (supra), more
particularly, Head Note (B) relating to Paras 14 and 17, which are
quoted as under:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_105"> 14.	On
the merits of the two orders passed by the Civil Court, learned
counsel for the appellant company contended that the Court in making
directions for measurement of the quantity of coal ash and preserving
the same totally lost sight of the legal position that the contract
for sale and purchase of movable property is not specifically
enforceable under <a href="/doc/124747/" id="a_37">Section 14(c)</a> of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The
contract was determinable in its nature. The Court, therefore
committed an error in granting an injunction contrary to the
provisions contained in <a href="/doc/28932/" id="a_38">Section 41</a> (c) of the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_39">Specific Relief Act</a>. It
is argued that accepting the case of commission of alleged breaches
of the contract by the company, the remedy of the contractor would be
only of claiming compensation in terms of money. It was wrong on the
part of Civil Court to have restrained the company from disposing of
the coal ash by inviting fresh tenders after the existing contract
with the present contractor was terminated. Reliance is placed on
Gujarat Electricity Board v. M/s. Mahesh Kumar and Co., AIR 1982
Gujarat 289 and <a href="/doc/987659/" id="a_40">M/s. Misra and Company v. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd</a>.,
AIR 1986 Orissa 22.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_106">17.	The
provisions of <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_41">Section 9</a> empower the Civil Court only to take interim
measures for preservation and safe custody of the subject matter in
arbitration agreement and for that purpose issue interim injunctions.
The aforesaid measures by the Civil Court are of interim nature only
to enable the parties to effectively get their disputes adjudicated
through the forum of arbitration agreed to by them under the terms of
the agreement. To such arbitration proceedings and the interim
measures taken by the Court under Sec. 9, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_42">Specific
Relief Act</a> cannot be made applicable. In taking interim measures
under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_43">Section 9</a>, the Court does not decide the merits of the case or
the rights of the parties. Existence of an arbitration clause and the
necessity of taking interim measures alone are required to be
considered by the Court for issuing necessary directions or orders.
In the instant case, undoubtedly, there exists an arbitration clause
and the parties have in fact resorted to the provisions of Sec. 11 of
the Act for appointment of Arbitrator. A separate case has been
registered being M. C. C. No. 178 of 1998. It has also not been
disputed by the appellant company that it is a sick industry and
proceedings under the <a href="/doc/438563/" id="a_44">Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions)
Act</a> are pending. The industry may be still in production, but for
that reason alone it cannot be said that the subject matter of
dispute i.e. the stipulated quantity of coal ash can be made
available to the contractor even if the existing contracted quantity
is allowed to be sold to third parties. The validity of the action of
termination of the contract is also a subject matter to be decided by
the arbitrator in the arbitration forum. The Court in the two orders
passed by it, which are under consideration in these appeals, has
held that looking to the poor financial condition of the appellant
company it is necessary to safeguard and preserve the subject matter
of the contract and the security amount furnished by the contractor.
It is with that view that the Court has passed the two orders and
insisted on the company that it should preserve the contracted
quantity of coal ash after due measurement and keep the security
amount safe in a nationalised bank. The two orders made by the Civil
Court are just and fair in the circumstances mentioned above, and
there is no scope for interference by this Court. 
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_107">8.0	This
Court has considered submissions made by both learned Advocates
appearing on behalf of respective parties.  Most of submissions are
related to merits while referring letter dated 
7th
November 2008 by appellant and reply given by respondent vide letter
dated 10th
November 2008.  But this Court is not expressing any opinion on
merits as merely referred all the three letters including letter
dated 1st
December 2008 of M/s. K.C. Kalra &amp; Co., Advocates,
addressed to present respondent by appellant.  This Court has
considered very limited scope in deciding legality and validity of
interim order dated 16th October 2009, so, while deciding
it, this Court may refer some of the merits without expressing any
opinion on merits otherwise it will cause prejudice to either party
while deciding the same in arbitration proceedings.  Therefore, this
Court has merely referred it because both learned Advocates have made
their submissions on letters as referred above.  But this Court has
not expressed any opinion on merits and merely considering prima
facie case in favour of respondent and also considered question of
balance of convenience and irreparable loss caused to respondent
decided by trial Court.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_108">8.1	It
is undisputed fact that after filing Sec. 9 application by respondent
on 5th September 2009, no payment is made to respondent
even though being an undisputed fact that appellant is enjoying
property belong to respondent without paying any rent to the
respondent.  Even according to the appellant whatever amount being
undisputed that has also not paid by the appellant to respondent.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_109">8.2	This
conduct and approach and behaviour of appellant suggested that some
security measure, as directed by trial Court, is necessary in the
interest of justice, otherwise, in future, if any award is passed by
the arbitrator in favour of respondent, then it will become merely
paper award and it is very difficult for respondent to recover the
amount from appellant.  Therefore, direction issued by trial Court
while partly allowing interim relief application filed by respondent
directing appellant to execute solvent security in a sum of Rs.2.5
crores within a period of two weeks from date of order cannot be
considered to be harsh or unjust because, otherwise, entire property
used by appellant and no due payment is made to respondent and
accordingly, during pendency of arbitration proceedings, which likely
to consume sometime, these dues will keep on mounting.  Therefore,
trial Court, keeping in mind this aspect and also keeping in mind
termination of the agreement Mark 3/3, which exposed present
appellant to severe consequences like double the rent, the interest
of present respondent is required to be secured.  Therefore, trial
Court has rightly directed to present appellant to execute solvent
security in a sum of Rs.2.5 crores, which protects and safeguards the
interest of the present respondent.  Therefore, according to my
opinion, trial Court has taken more than sufficient care to pass
interim order in such a given facts and circumstances of the case and
also keeping in mind the conduct and approach and behaviour of the
present appellant with respondent using premises but not paying due
amount of rent only on the ground of dispute, which is not proper for
appellant.  Therefore, equity and fair play require some protection
to be given to the right of respondent otherwise, entire arbitration
proceedings become nugatory.  The undisputed amount has been directed
to be deposited w.e.f. 1st January 2009 and rightly
permitted to withdraw such amount to respondent.  For that also, the
trial Court has not committed any error, which requires interference
by this Court.  In short, according to my opinion, contentions raised
by learned Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta cannot be accepted and after
perusing entire interim order passed by trial Court dated 16th
October 2009, it cannot be considered to be a final relief granted by
trial Court in favour of respondent.  Therefore, decision, which has
been relied upon by the learned Advocate Mr. Shalin Mehta in the case
of Firm Ashok Traders and Anr. (supra) is not applicable to
the facts of the present case.  The trial Court has not granted any
relief having nature of permanent measure.  On the contrary, the
trial Court has kept certain facts open, which can be examined by the
arbitrator and meanwhile, looking to the conduct and approach of the
appellant, certain security has been imposed upon appellant, while
keeping in mind equity and fair play principles, so that ultimate
result of arbitration proceedings cannot become failure or it cannot
become merely paper award for respondent.  Therefore, such relief is
squarely covered being an interim measure of protection and it cannot
be considered to be a permanent protection given in favour of
respondent because this will remain continue only during arbitration
proceedings and also appellant having remedy to approach arbitrator
by necessary application.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_110">8.3	In
view of principle examined by the Honourable
Apex Court in both the cases as referred above viz. M. Gurudas and
Ors. and Zenit Metaplast P. Ltd.in facts of present case, the trial
Court has rightly examined the matter while granting interim
relief in favour of respondent.  All the principles are satisfied by
respondent that having strong prima facie case as well as risk and
responsibility of present appellant as per agreements.  The conduct
of present appellant is also rightly considered by the trial Court. 
The balance of convenience and irreparable loss caused to respondent
if interim relief refused by trial Court.  The respondent having
triable case and contentions raised are bonafide.  The questions
which are raised by respondent before trial Court are serious
questions looking to the facts and circumstances, which are
self-eloquent.  As per agreements itself legally due amounts
disclosed by respondent before trial Court, which comes to more than
Rs.5 crores, even though, premises belonged to respondent is fully
enjoyed by appellant without paying any rent even agreed by appellant
to the respondent.  It may be some dispute between parties but
undisputed amounts also not paid by appellant to respondent that
shows conduct, attitude and behaviour of appellant.  So, according to
my opinion, looking to facts and circumstances of present case, trial
Court has rightly exercise discretionary power in granting interim
relief in favour of respondent, who satisfied all ingredients for
granting interim relief in favour of respondent.  For that, trial
Court has not committed any error, which requires any interference by
this Court.  If such interim relief not granted then arbitration
proceedings become infructuous or fait accompli before
deciding finally.
</p> 

 

 

<p id="p_111">9.0	Therefore,
according to my opinion, no error has been committed by the trial
Court while granting relief in favour of respondent.  Therefore,
there is no substance in the First Appeal preferred by the appellant
before this Court.  Therefore, present First Appeal is dismissed. 
Accordingly, interim relief granted by this Court on 13th
November 2009 only extending the period for executing solvent
security stands vacated.  This Court has not granted any interim
relief in favour of appellant except extending the period of
executing solvent security, to be given by appellant.

<p id="p_112">9.1	The
Civil Application No. 12068 of 2009 for Stay is also
accordingly dismissed.
