HEADNOTE:
     In the  pre-independent  period,  the  former  princely
State of  Mysore which	now  forms  part  of  the  State  of
Karnataka is  one of  the earliest  States in the country in
which the  system of  reservation for  backward	 classes  in
public services	 was introduced.  In 1918, the Government of
His Highness  the Maharaja  of Mysore  appointed a committee
under the  chairmanship Or  Sir	 Leslie	 C.  Miller,  Chief,
Justice of  the Chief  Court of	 Mysore to  investigate	 and
report on  the problem	of backward  classes. The  questions
referred to  that Committee  were (i)  changes needed in the
then existing  rules of	 recruitment to the public services;
(ii) special facilities to encourage higher and professional
education among	 the members  of backward  classes and (iii)
any other  special measures which might be taken to increase
the representation  of backward	 communities in	 the  public
service without	 materially affecting  the  efficiency,	 due
regard being  paid also	 to the general good accruing to the
State by  a wider  diffusion of	 education  and	 feeling  of
increased status  which will  thereby  be  produced  in	 the
backward communities. The expressions 'backward classes' and
'backward communities,	were used almost interchangeably and
that the  contained in	<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_1">Article 335</a> of the Constitution that
any  reservation  made	should	not  impair  efficiency	 was
anticipated more  than three decades before the Constitution
was enacted.  The committee  submitted its  report  in	1921
containing its	opinion that  all communities  in the  State
other  than   Brahmins	should	be  understood	as  backward
communities regarding  whom it made certain recommendations.
The
353
Government  orders   issued  on	 the  basis  of	 the  Report
continued to  be in  force till 1956 i.e. there organisation
of States  which brought  together five integrating A units-
the former  State of  Mysore (including	 Bellary  District),
Coorg, four  districts of  Bombay, certain  portions of	 the
State of  Hyderabad and the district of Sough Kanara and the
Kollegal Taluk	which formerly	formed part  of the State of
Madras. There  were different  lists of backward communities
in the	five integrating  units and  they  were	 allowed  to
continue for  sometime	even  after  the  reorganisation  of
States.
     In order to bring about uniformity the State Government
issued	a  notification	 containing  the  list	of  backward
classes for the purpose of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_2">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution
at the	beginning of 1959. The validity of that notification
and of	another notification  issued thereafter	 on the same
topic which  according to  the State  Government had treated
all  persons   except  Brahmins,  Banias  and  Kayasthas  as
backward communities was challenged before the High Court of
Mysore in  Rama Krishna	 Singh v.  State of Mysore, AIR 1950
Mysore 338.  The two  notifications were  struck down by the
High  Court   holding  (a)   in	 as  much  as  the  impugned
notifications contained	 list of  backward classes including
55 per	cent of	 the population	 of the	 State and all Hindu
communities other  than Brahmins,  Banias and  Kayasthas and
all other  non-Hindu communities  in the State except Anglo-
Indians and  Parsees had been treated as backward classes it
resulted more  in a  discrimination against the few excluded
communities consisting	of about  5 per	 cent of  the  total
population rather  than making	provision for  socially	 and
educationally backward	classes; (b)  making  provision	 for
communities which  were slightly  backward to  the so called
forward communities  did not  amount to making provision for
the communities which really needed protection under <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_3">Article
(15</a>(4) of  the Constitution;  (c) socially and educationally
backward classes  can in  some cases  be determined  on	 the
basis of castes.
     Therefore, the State Government constituted a Committee
on January  8, 1960  under the	Chairmanship of	 Dr R. Nagan
Gowda for  the purpose	of determining	the criteria for the
classification of  backward classes  in the  State with	 the
following tern	s of  reference: (i) to suggest the criteria
to be adopted in determining which sections of the people in
the State  should be  treated as  socially and educationally
backward and  (ii) to  suggest the exact manner in which the
criteria thus  indicated should	 be followed  to enable	 the
State Government  to determine the persons who should secure
such preference	 as  may  be  determined  by  Government  in
respect	 of   admissions  to   technical  institutions	 and
appointment  to	 Government  services.	The  said  committee
submitted its  Interim Report  on February  19, 1960. On the
basis of  the Interim  Report of  the Committee,  the  State
Government passed  an order  dated June	 9,  1960  regarding
admissions  to	 professional  and   technical	institutions
reserving 22  per cent of seats for backward classes, 15 per
cent for  Scheduled Castes  and 3  per	cent  for  Scheduled
Tribes and the remaining 60 percent of seats were allowed to
be filled  upon	 the  basis  of	 merit.	 The  order  of	 the
Government was challenged before the High Court of Mysore in
S.A. Partha &amp; Ors. v. The State of Mysore &amp; Ors. A.J.R. 1961
Mys. 220.  The High Court found that the direction contained
in the	Government order  to the  effect that if any seat or
seats reserved	for candidates	belonging to  the  Scheduled
Castes
354
and Scheduled  Tribes remained	unfilled, the  same shall be
filled	by  candidates	A  of  other  backward	classes	 was
unconstitutional. It also gave some directions regarding the
manner in  which the calculation of the quota of reservation
be made.  Thereafter the  Final Report	was submitted by the
Nagan Gowda  Committee on  May 16,  1961. After	 taking into
consideration the  recommendations made	 in the said Report,
the State  Government issued  an order	for the	 purpose  of
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_4">Article 15 (4)</a> of the Constitution on July 10, 1961. By that
order, the  State Government  specified 81 classes of people
as backward  classes and  135  classes	of  people  as	more
backward  classes   and	 reserved   30	percent	  of   seat-
professional and  technical institutions  for  backward	 and
more backward  classes. 15  per cent  and 3  per cent of the
seats were  reserved  for  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled
Tribes respectively  and the  remaining 52  per cent  of the
seats were  allowed to be filled up on merit. This order was
challenged before  the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_5">Article 32</a> of the
Constitutions in  <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_6">M. R.	 Balaji &amp;  Ors v.  State  of  Mysore</a>
[1963] Supp. 1 SCR 439.
     In this  land mark	 decision of  the Supreme Court, the
meaning of  the term  "socially and  educationally  backward
classes" appearing  in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_7">Article	15(4)</a> was  explained as "The
backwardness  under   <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_8">Article  15(4)</a>   must  be	 social	 and
educational. It	 is not	 either social or educational but it
is both	 social and educational." After explaining as to how
social and  educational backwardness  has to  be determined,
and the	 question of determination of the classes which were
educationally backward, the court held that the inclusion of
the members  of	 the  Lingayat	community  in  the  list  of
backward classes was erroneous. On the question of extent of
reservation that  can be  made the  Court held that speaking
generally and  in a broad way, a special provision should be
less then 50 per cent; how much less than 50 per cent should
depend upon  the relevant  prevailing circumstances  in each
case." and thus allowed the petition
     Thereafter, the  Government passed	 another order dated
July 26,  1963 which  directed that 30 per cent of the seats
in professional	 and  technical	 colleges  and	institutions
should be  reserved for	 backward classes as defined in that
order and  that 18  per cent of the seats should be reserved
for the	 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The criteria
laid down  in that order for determining social and economic
backwardness were  two-fold-income and occupation. It stated
that those  who followed  occupations of  agriculture, petty
business, inferior  service,  crafts  or  other	 occupations
involving manual  labour and  whose family  income was	less
than Rs.  1,200 per annum were to be treated as belonging to
backward classes.  This order was questioned before the High
Court in  <a href="/doc/1977916/" id="a_9">D.G. Viswanath  v. Government	 of  Mysore  &amp;	Ors.
A</a>.l.R. 1964 Mys. 132 by some petitioners on various grounds.
The High  Court dismissed  the petitions  observing that the
determination of  the backward	classes without reference to
caste altogether  was not  correct and it expressed the hope
that the  State would make a more appropriate classification
lest its bonafides should be questioned. In the appeal filed
against this judgment in R. Chitralekha &amp; H. Anr. v State of
Mysore &amp; Ors [196416 SCR 368 the Supreme Court explained the
inconsistency between  the  High  Court	 judgment  with	 the
decision in  Balaji's case and observed that "Two principles
stand out prominently from
355
Balaji, namely,	 (i) the caste of a group of citizens may be
a  relevant   circumstance  in	 ascertaining  their  social
backwardness; and  (ii) though	it is a relevant A factor to
determine the  social backwardness  of class of citizens, it
cannot be  the sole or dominant test in that behalf-casts is
only   a   relevant   circumstance   in	  ascertaining	 the
backwardness of a class and there is nothing in the judgment
of the Supreme Court which precludes the authority concerned
from determining  the social  backwardness  of	a  group  of
citizens if  it can do so without reference to caste." While
this Court  has not  excluded caste  from  ascertaining	 the
backwardness of	 a class of citizens, it has not made it one
of compelling  circumstances,  affording  a  basis  for	 the
ascertainment of backwardness of a class.
     Thereafter the State Government appointed the Karnataka
Backward Classes  Commission under  the Chairmanship  of Sri
L.G. Havanur  which after an elaborate enquiry submitted its
report in  four massive	 volumes on  November  19,1975.	 The
Commission recommended	that person  belonging	to  backward
classes for  purposes of  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_10">Article 15(4)</a>	 of the Constitution
should be divided into three groups-(a) backward communities
consisting of  15 castes  (b) backward	castes consisting of
128 castes  and (c) backward tribes consisting of 62 tribes.
For purposes  of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_11">Article  16(4)</a>	 of  the  Constitution,	 the
Commission divided  the backward  classes into	(a) backward
communities  consisting	  of  9	 castes(b)  backward  castes
consisting of  115 castes and (c) backward tribes consisting
of  61	 tribes.  According   to  the  Commission,  backward
communities were  those	 castes	 whose	student	 average  of
students passing  SSLC examination  in 1972  per thousand of
population was	below the  State average (which was 1.69 per
thousand) but  above 50	 per cent  of the  State average and
backward castes	 and backward  tribes were  those castes and
tribes whose  student average  was below  50 per cent of the
State average  except in the case of Dombars and Voddars and
those who  were Nomadic	 and de-notified  tribes. The  total
population of  these backward  classes (other than Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled Tribes),	according to the Commission,
was about  45 per cent of total population of the State. The
difference between the two lists-one under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_12">Article 15(4)</a> and
the other under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_13">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution was due to
the exclusion  of certain  communities,	 castes	 and  tribes
which were socially and educationally backward but which had
adequate  representation  in  the  services  from  the	list
prepared for  the purpose  of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_14">Article  16(4).</a> The Commission
recommended both  for purposes	of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_15">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_16">Article
16(4)</a>  the   percentage	 of   reservations:   (i)   Backward
communities 16	per cent;  (ii) Backward Castes 10 per cent;
and (iii)  Backward Tribes 6 per cent and total 32 per cent.
The reservation	 of 32	per cent  along	 with  18  per	cent
reserved for  Scheduled Casts  and Scheduled Tribes together
amounted to  50 per cent of the total seats or posts, as the
case  may   be.	 The   Commission  further   recommended  if
seats/posts remained  unfilled	in  the	 quota	allotted  to
backward tribes,  they	should	be  made  over	to  backward
communities and	 backward castes  Similarly  if	 seats/posts
remain unfilled	 in the	 quota allotted	 to backward castes,
they  should  be  made	over  to  backward  communities	 and
backward tribes	 If, however, seats/posts remain unfilled in
the quota  allotted to	any of	those three categories, they
should be  made	 over  to  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled
Tribes. In  the event  of seats/posts  remaining unfilled by
any of	these categories  they should  be transferred to the
general pool.
356
     After considering the said Report, the State Government
issued an  order A  dated  February  22,1977  whereunder  it
listed	the   Backward	communities.   Backward	 Castes	 and
Backward Tribes who shall be treated as Backward classes for
purposes of  Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution of
India. The  order clarified,  (a) that only such citizens of
these Backward	Classes whose  family income  per annum from
all sources  if Rs.  8000 (Eight  thou sands only) and below
shall be  entitled to special treatment under these Articles
and (b)	 that five categories, namely; an actual cultivator,
an artisan,  a petty businessman, one holding an appointment
either in Government service or corresponding services under
private employment  including casual  labour; and any person
self employed  or engaged in any occupation involving manual
labour" of  citizens shall  be considered as a special group
such citizens  of this	special group whose family income is
Rs. 4,800  (Rupees four thousand and eight hundred only) and
below per  annum shall	be eligible  for  special  treatment
under the  two Articles.  The order  further noted  that (i)
Family income  means income  of the  citizen and his parents
and if	either of  the parents	is dead, his legal guardian;
and (b)	 to fix	 the reservation  for purposes	of  Articles
15(4) and  16(4) of  the  Constitution	in  respect  of	 the
Backward classes and the special group of citizens at 40 per
cent, the  allocation being  -Backward Communities  (20	 per
cent), Backward	 castes (10 per cent, Backward Tribes (5 per
cent), and  special group  (5 per  cent).  In  the  list  of
backward communities  mentioned in the Government order, the
State Government  included ' Muslims' thus making a total of
16 backward  communities. In  the list	of  backward  castes
there were  129 castes	including converts into Christianity
from   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   upto   second
generation and	62 Scheduled  Tribes.  The  reservation	 for
backward classes  was 40 percent and taken along with 18 per
cent for  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes, the total
reservation of	seats/posts came to 58 per cent leaving only
42 per cent for merit pool.
     The  Government  order  dated  February  22,  1977	 and
another notification dated March 4, 1977 issued for purposes
of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_17">Article  16(4)</a> had  also been  challenged in	 a number of
writ petitions	filed under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
before the  High Court	of Karnataka  in S  Somashekarappa &amp;
Ors. v	State of  Karnataka &amp;  Ors (Writ Petition No 43;1 of
1977 and  connected writ  petition disposed  of on  April 9,
1979). Allowing	 the petitions;	 the High  Court quashed (i)
the inclusion  of `Arasu' community in the list of 'Backward
Communities' both  for purposes of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_19">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_20">Article
16(4); (ii)</a> the inclusion of the (a) Balija (b) Devadiga (c)
Ganiga (d)  Nayinda (e) Rajput and (f) Satani in the list of
backward communities  and the  inclusion of  (a)  Banna	 (b)
Gurkha (c)  Jat (d) Konga (e) Kotari (f) Koyava (g) Malayali
(h) Maniyanani	or (Muniyani)  (i) Padatti  (j) Padiyar	 (k)
Pandavakul (l)	Raval and  (m) Rawat in the list of backward
classes for  purposes of  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_21">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution;
and (iii)  reservation	of  20	percent	 made  for  Backward
communities in the State Civil Services under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_22">Article 16(4</a>),
reserving liberty  to the  State Government to determine the
extent	of   reservation  in   accordance  with	  law.	 The
classification and reservation in other respects was upheld.
Special	 Leave	Petitions  (Civil)  No.	 6656  of  1979	 and
985411979 are  filed against  the said Judgment of the	High
Court under <a href="/doc/784506/" id="a_23">Article ] 36</a> of the Constitution.
357
     After the	said judgment of the High Court, by an order
dated May  1, 1979, the reservation for backward communities
was reduced  to 18 per cent A for purposes of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_24">Article 16(4).</a>
By an  order dated  June  27,  1979,  the  State  Government
modified the  Government order	dated February	22, 1977  by
increasing the	reservation for	 'Special Group'  from 5 per
cent to	 15 per	 cent both for purposes of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_25">Article 15(4)</a> and
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_26">Article 16(4)</a>  of the  Constitution. Thus  as on  date,	 the
total reservation  for purposes	 of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_27">Article  15(4)</a> is 68 per
cent and for purposes of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_28">Article 16(4)</a> is 66 per cent. There
are only  32 per  cent seats  in professional  and technical
colleges and  34 per cent posts in Government services which
can be filled up on the basis of merit. These writ petitions
filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_29">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India, seek to
challenge  the	 Constitutional	 validity   of	 the   State
Government orders  dated February 22,1977 as modified by the
Government orders dated May ],1979 and June 27,1979.
     Disposing of  the petitions  and the appeals by Special
Leave, the Court expressed their following opinions,
     Per Chandrachud, C.J.
     The following  propositions on the issue of reservation
may serve  as  a  guideline  to	 the  Commission  which	 the
Government of  Karnataka proposes  to appoint, for examining
the question  of affording better employment and educational
opportunities to  Scheduled  Castes,  Scheduled	 Tribes	 and
other Backward	Classes which problem is a burning issue to-
day.
     1. The  reservation in  favour of	scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes  must continue	 as to	present,  there	 is,
without the  application of  a means  test,  for  a  further
period not  exceeding fifteen  years. Another  fifteen years
will  make   it	 fifty	 years	after	the  advent  of	 the
Constitution, a	 period reasonably  long for the upper crust
of the	oppressed classes to overcome the baneful effects of
social oppression, isolation and humiliation. [376 C-D]
     2. The means test, that is to say, the test of economic
backwardness  ought  to	 be  made  applicable  even  to	 the
Scheduled Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  after	 the  period
mentioned in  (1) above. It is essential that the privileged
section	 of   the  underprivileged  society  should  not  be
permitted  to	monopolise  preferential   benefits  for  an
indefinite period of time. [376E-F]
     3.	 In  so	 far  as  the  Other  Backward	Classes	 are
concerned, two	tests should  be conjunctively	applied	 for
identifying  them   for	 the   purpose	of  reservations  in
employment  and	  education:  One,   that  they	  should  be
comparable to  the Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes in
the matter  of their backwardness; and two, that they should
satisfy the  means test	 such as  a State Government may lay
down in	 the context of prevailing economic conditions. [376
F-G]
     4. The  policy of reservations in employment, education
and legislative	 institutions should  be reviewed every five
years or  so. That will at once afford an opportunity (i) to
the State  to rectify  distortions arising out of particular
facts of the reservation policy and (ii) to the people, both
backward and, non-
358
backward, to ventilate their views in a public debate on the
practical impact  of A	the policy  of reservations. [376 H;
377 Al
     Per Desai J
     For a  period of  three and  half decades, the unending
search for  identifying socially  and educationally backward
classes of  citizens has  defined  the	policy	makers,	 the
interpreters of	 the policy  as	 reflected  in	statutes  or
executive administrative orders and has added a spurt in the
reverse direction,  namely,  those  who	 attempted  to	move
upward (Pratilom)  in the  social  hierarchy  have  put	 the
movement in reverse gear so as to move downwards (Anulom) in
order to  be identified	 as a  group or	 class	of  citizens
socially  and	educationally  backward.   The	Constitution
promised an  egalitarian society;  it  was  a  caste  ridden
stratified hierarchical	 society. Therefore,  in  the  early
stages	of  the	 functioning  of  the  Constitution  it	 was
accepted without  dissent or dialogue that caste furnishes a
working criterion for identifying socially and educationally
backward class	of  citizens  for  the	purpose	 of  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_30">Article
15(4).</a>[377 D-G]
     The language of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_31">Article 15(4)</a> refers to 'class' and not
caste. Preferential treatment which cannot be struck down as
discriminatory was  to be  accorded a  class,  shown  to  be
socially and  educationally backward  and not to the members
of  a	case  who   may	 be  presumed  to  be  socially	 and
educationally backward. [378 A B]
     It is  clear from	the decisions  of the  Supreme Court
that same  vacillation on  the part  of the judiciary on the
question  whether   the	 caste	 should	 be  the  basis	 for
recognising  the   backwardness.  Judiciary   retained	 its
traditional  blindfold	on  its	 eyes  and  thereby  ignored
perceived realities.  The expression  `backward classes'  is
not defined.  Courts, therefore	 have more  or less  in	 the
absence of  well-defined criteria  not based  on caste label
has veered  round to  the view	that in order to be socially
and educationally  backward classes, the group must have the
same indicia  as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. [378

</p><p id="p_2">     A caste  is a  horizontal segmental division of society
spread over  a district	 of a  region or the whole State and
also sometimes outside it. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">359</span>
concept of  purity and	impurity  conceptualises  the  caste
system. There  are four	 essential  features  of  the  caste
system which  maintained in homo hierarchicus character; (i)
hierarchy (ii)	commensality (iii)  restrictions on marriage
and (iv)  hereditary  occupation.  Most	 of  the  caste	 are
endogamous groups.  Inter-marriage  between  two  groups  is
impermissible.	But  `Pratilom'	 marriages  are	 not  wholly
unknown. Similarly with the onward movement of urbanisation,
members of  various castes are slowly giving up, traditional
occupations and	 the pure impure avocations is being frowned
upon by	 developing notion  of dignity	of  labour.  As	 the
fruits of  independence were  unequally distributed  amongst
various segments  of the  society, in  each caste there came
into  existence	  a  triple   division	based	on  economic
resurgence amongst  the members of the caste. Those who have
become economically  well off  have acquired  an upper class
status (class  consciousness) and  the one on the step below
is the	middle class  and the  third one  belongs to  poorer
section of the caste. This led to the realisation that caste
culture does  not help	economic interest. In fact the upper
crust of  the same caste is verily accused of exploiting the
lower strata  of the same caste. Therefore, the basis of the
caste system  namely, purity  and pollution  is slowly being
displaced by  the economic condition of the various segments
of the same caste. It is recognised on almost all hands that
the  important	 feature  of   the   caste   structure	 are
progressively suffering	 erosion. The  new organisation, the
so-called caste	 organisation,	is  substantially  different
from the  traditional caste  structure and  caste  councils.
Economic differentiation  amongst the  members of  the caste
has become  sharp,  but	 not  so  sharp	 as  to	 bury  caste
sentiments and	ties. In  the face of this transformation of
the caste  structure, caste label can not be accepted as the
basis for  determining social  and educational backwardness,
but the class or the social group should be examined [385 C-
H; 386 A-D]
     Caste in  rural society is more often than not mirrored
in the	economic power	wielded by it and vice versa. Social
hierarchy and  economic	 position  exhibit  an	undisputable
mutuality. The	lower the caste, the poorer its members. The
poorer the  members of	a caste,  the lower the caste. Caste
and economic situation, reflecting each other as they do are
the Deus  ex-Machina of	 the social  status occupied and the
economic power	wielded by  an individual  or class in rural
society. Social	 status and  economic power are so woven and
fused into the caste system in Indian rural society that one
may, without  hesitation, say  that if poverty be the cause,
caste is  the primary  index of social backwardness, so that
social	backwardness  is  often	 readily  identifiable	with
reference to  a person's  caste So  sadly  and	oppressively
deep-rooted is	caste in  our country that it has cut across
even  the   barriers  of  religion.  The  caste	 system	 has
penetrated other  religious and	 dissentient Hindu  sects to
whom the  practice of  caste should be anathema and today we
find that  practitioner of  other religious faiths and Hindu
dissentients are some times as rigid adherents to the system
of caste as the conservative Hindus. [386 E-H]
     Shared  situation	in  the	 economic  hierarchy,  caste
gradation, occupation,	habitation,  style  of	consumption,
standard of  literacy and  a variety  of such  other factors
appear	to   go	 to  make  towards  social  and	 educational
backwardness. Thus  there is a mad rush for being recognised
as belonging to a caste
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">360</span>
which by  its nomenclature  would be included in the list of
socially  and  A  educationally	 backward  classes.  Certain
castes are known by a number of synonymy which vary from one
region to  the other  and  making  their  complete  coverage
almost	impossible.  The  only	way  out  would	 in  such  a
situation is  to treat,	 if  a	particular  caste  has	been
treated as  backward, all  its synonyms whether mentioned in
the State  lists or  not as  backward. Again,  some  of	 the
castes just  for the  sake of  being considered socially and
educationally backward,	 have degraded themselves to such an
extent that  they had no hesitation in attributing different
types of  vices to  and associating other factors indicative
of backwardness, with their castes. The only remedy for such
a malaise is to devise a method for determining socially and
educationally backward	classes without	 reference to caste,
beneficial to  all sections  of people	irrespective of	 the
caste to which they belong. [387 B-H; 388 A]
     A few  other aspects  for rejecting  caste as the basis
for identifying social and educational backwardness are: (i)
If State  patronage for preferred treatment accepts caste as
the only  insignia for	determining social  and	 educational
backwardness; the  danger looms	 large	that  this  approach
alone would  legitimise and perpetuate caste system. It does
not  go	 well  with  our  proclaimed  secular  character  as
enshrined  in	the  Preamble	to  the	  Constitution.	 The
assumption that	 all  members  of  some	 caste	are  equally
socially and  educationally backward  is  not  well-founded.
Such an	 approach  provides  an	 over  simplification  of  a
complex problem	 of identifying	 the social  and educational
backwardness: (ii)  it is  recognised reservation  has	been
usurped by  the economically well-placed section in the same
caste; and  (iii) the  caste is,  as is	 understood in Hindu
Society unknown to Muslims, Parsis, Jews etc. As such, caste
criterion would not furnish a reliable yardstick to identify
socially and  educationally backward  group in the aforesaid
communities though economic backwardness would.
</p><p id="p_3">					  [388 P-G; 389 A;F]
     Therefore,	  the	 only	criterion   which   can	  be
realistically devised  is the  one of economic backwardness.
To this	 may be	 added some  relevant criteria	such as	 the
secular character  of the group, its opportunity for earning
livelihood etc,	 but by and large economic backwardness must
be the load-star. [389 F]
     Chronic poverty  is the  bane of Indian Society. Market
economy and  money  spinning  culture  has  transformed	 the
general behaviour  of the society towards its members. Upper
caste does  not enjoy  the status  or respect,	traditional,
voluntary or  forced any  more even  in rural  areas what to
speak of highly westernised urban society. The bank balance,
the property  holding and   the	 money power  determine	 the
social	status	 of  the   individual  and   guarantee	 the
opportunities to  rise to the top echelon. How the wealth is
acquired has  lost significance. Purity of means disappeared
with Mahatma  Gandhi and  we have reached a stage where ends
determine  the	 means.	 This	is  the	 present  disturbing
situation whether one likes it or not. [389 G-H; 390 A-B]
     Reservation in  one or  other form	 has been  there for
decades. If  a survey  is made with reference to families in
various castes	considered to  be socially and educationally
backward, about	 the benefits  of  preferred  treatment,  it
would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">361</span>
unmistakably show  that the  benefits  of  reservations	 are
snatched away  by the  top  creamy  layer  of  the  backward
castes. This has to be avoided at any cost.
</p><p id="p_4">						     [390 E]
     If economic  criterion for	 compensatory discrimination
or affirmative	action is  accepted, it	 would strike at the
root cause  of	social	and  educational  backwardness,	 and
simultaneously	take  a	 vital	step  in  the  direction  of
destruction of	caste structure	 which in turn would advance
the secular  character of the Nation. This approach seeks to
translate into	reality the  twin constitutional goals: one,
to strike at the perpetuation of the caste stratification of
the Indian  Society so as to arrest progressive movement and
to  take  a  firm  step	 towards  establishing	a  casteless
society;   and	 two,	to   progressively   eliminate	 the
disadvantageous sections  of  the  society  to	raise  their
position and  be part  of the mainstream of life which means
eradication of	poverty. However,  this does  not deal	with
reservation in	favour of  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled
Tribes.	  Thousands   of   years   of	discrimination	 and
exploitation cannot be wiped out in one generation. But even
here  economic	criterion  is  worth  applying	by  refusing
preferred treatment  to those  amongst them who have already
benefited by  it and  improved their  position. And  finally
reservation must  have a time span otherwise concession tend
to become vested interests. [391 E-H; 392 A]
     Per Chinnappa Reddy .r.
</p><p id="p_5">     The paradox  of the  system of  reservation that may be
made under  Articles 15(4),16(4)  read	with  29(2)  of	 the
Constitution is	 that it  has engendered  a spirit  of	self
denigration among  the people.	Nowhere else in the world do
castes, classes	 or communities	 queue up  for the  sake  of
gaining the  backward status.  Nowhere else  in the world is
there competition  to assert  backwardness and	to claim 'we
are  more  backward  than  you'.  This	is  an	unhappy	 and
disquieting situation, but it is stark reality. [392 E-F]
</p><p id="p_6">     2. The Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and other
socially and  educationally backward  classes, all  of	whom
have been compendiously described as 'the weaker sections of
the people', have long journeys to make unsociety. They need
aid; they  need facility;  they need  launching;  they	need
propulsion. Their  needs are  their demands. The demands are
matters of  right and  not of  philanthropy.  They  ask	 for
parity, and  not charity.  They claim  their  constitutional
right to  equality of status and of opportunity and economic
and social  justice. Several  bridges have to be erected, so
that they  may cross the Rubicon. Professional education and
employment under  the State  are  thought  to  be  two	such
bridges. Hence the special provision for advancement and for
reservation  under   Articles  15(4)   and  16(4)   of	 the
Constitution. [393 C-D]
</p><p id="p_7">     3. Courts	are not	 necessarily the  most competent  to
identify the  backward classes or to lay down guidelines for
their identification except in a broad and very general way.
Courts are  not equipped  for that;  Courts  have  no  legal
barometers to  measure social  backwardness  and  are  truly
removed from  the people, particularly those of the backward
classes, by  layer upon	 layer of gradation and degradation.
And, India is such a vast country that conditions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">362</span>
vary from  State to  State, region  to region,	'district to
district and  from one	A ethnic  religious,  linguistic  or
caste group to another. A test to identify back ward classes
which may  appear appropriate  when applied  to one group of
people may  be	wholly	inappropriate  and  unreasonable  if
applied	 to  another  group  of	 people.  There	 can  be  no
universal test; there can be no exclusive test; there can be
no conclusive  test. In	 fact, it may be futile to apply and
rigid tests.  One may  to look	at the	generality  and	 the
totality of the situation. [398 A-C]
</p><p id="p_8">     4. Before	attempting to lay down any guideline for the
purpose	 of  determining  the  methods	to  be	adopted	 for
identifying the	 socially and educationally backward classes
one should  guard against  the pitfalls	 of the	 traditional
approach to the question, which has generally been superior,
elitist and,  therefore, ambivalent.  The result is that the
claim of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other
backward classes  to equality  as  a  matter  of  human	 and
constitutional right  is  forgotten  and  their	 rights	 are
submerged  in	what  is   described  as  the  "Preferential
principle" or  "protective or  compensatory discrimination".
Unless these superior, patronising and paternalist attitudes
are got	 rid off.  It is  difficult to	truly appreciate the
problems involved  in the  claim of  the  Scheduled  Castes,
Scheduled  Tribes  and	other  backward	 classes  for  their
legitimate share  of  the  benefits  arising  out  of  their
belonging to  humanity and  to a  country whose constitution
preaches  justice,   social,  economic	 and  political	 and
equality of status and opportunity for all. [393 E-H]
</p><p id="p_9">     5.	 There	is  neither  statistical  basis	 nor  expert
evidence to  support the  assumption  that  efficiency	will
necessarily be	impaired  if  reservation  exceeds  50%,  if
reservation is carried forward or if reservation is extended
to promotional	posts.	The  word  'efficiency'	 is  neither
sacro-sanct nor is the sanctorum has to be fiercely guarded.
'Efficiency' is	 not a Mantra which is whispered by the Guru
in the	Sishya's ear.  The mere securing of high marks at an
examination  may   not	 necessarily   mark   out   a	good
administrator. An  efficient administrator,  one  takes	 it,
must be one who possesses among other qualities the capacity
to  understand	with  sympathy	and,  therefore,  to  tackle
bravely the  problems  of  a  large  segment  of  population
constituting the  weaker sections  of the  people. This does
not mean  that efficiency in civil service is unnecessary or
that it	 is a  myth. However, one need not make a fastidious
fetish of  it. It  may be  that for  certain posts, only the
best may  be appointed and for certain courses of study only
the best  may be  admitted. If	so, rules  may	provide	 for
reservation for	 appointment to such posts and for admission
to such	 courses. The  rules may  provide for an appropriate
method of  selection. It may be that certain posts require a
very high  degree of skill or efficiency and certain courses
of study require a high degree of industry and intelligence.
If so,	the rules  may prescribe  a high  minimum qualifying
standard and  an appropriate  method of selection. Different
minimum standards  and different  modes of  selection may be
prescribed  for	  different  posts   and  for  admission  to
different courses of study having regard to the requirements
of the	posts and  the courses	of  study.  But,  efficiency
cannot be  permitted to	 be used  as a camouflage to let the
upper classes  monopolise  the	services,  particularly	 the
higher posts  and the  professional institutions. In view of
Articles 15(4) and 16(4), the so called
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">363</span>
controversy  between   the   moratorium	  and	compensatory
principles is not of any significance. [395 D; G-H; 396 C-G;
397 F]
</p><p id="p_10">     6. The three dimensions of social inequality are class,
status and  power. Everyone  of these  three dimensions	 are
intimately  and	  inextricably	 connected   with   economic
position. Viewed  from any  of these  three dimensions it is
clear  that   the  economic  factor  is	 at  the  bottom  of
backwardness and  poverty  is  the  culprit  cause  and	 the
dominant characteristic.  The economic	power has firm links
with the  castes system,  land	and  learning,	two  of	 the
primary sources	 of economic  power in	India have  been the
monopoly of  the superior castes. Social status and economic
power are so woven and fused into the caste system in Indian
rural society  that one may, without hesitation, say that if
poverty be  the cause,	caste is the primary index of social
backwardness, so  that social  backwardness is often readily
identifiable with  reference to	 a  person's  caste.  Shared
situation  in	the  economic  hierarchy,  caste  gradation,

so on.	Under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_37">Article  16(4</a>), reservation  is to  be made to
benefit those  backward classes,  who in  the opinion of the
Government are	not adequately represented, in the services.
Reservation must,  therefore, be  aimed at securing adequate
representation.	 It   must  follow   that  the	 extent	  of
reservation must  match the  inadequacy	 of  representation.
There is  no reason  why this  guideline  furnished  by	 the
Constitution itself  should not	 also  be  adopted  for	 the
purposes of  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_38">Article 15(4)</a>  too. The reservation of seats in
professional colleges  may conveniently	 be determined	with
reference to the inadequacy of representation in the various
professions. Similarly,	 the extent  of reservation in other
colleges may  be determined with reference to the inadequacy
in the	number of  graduates, etc.  Naturally, if  the	lost
ground is  to be  gained, the extent of reservation may even
have to be slightly higher than the percentage of population
of the backward classes. [403 H; 404 A-F]

     There is  no reason  whatever to  narrow the concept of
equality in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_39">Article 16(1)</a> and refuse to read into it broader
concepts of  social justice  and equality.  In	fact  it  is

caste and  class the philosophy, the reason and the rhetoric
behind reservation  and anti-reservation, the Constitutional
provisions and	the varying  judicial stances, the following
emerges; (a)  clearly there  exist large  sections of people
who are socially and educationally backward who stand midway
between the forward classes such as the landed, the learned,
the priestly  and the  trading classes	on one	side and the
out-caste and  depressed classes,  i.e. the Scheduled Castes
and the	 Scheduled Tribes  on the  other;(b) Poverty, Caste,
occupation and	habitation are	the principal  factors which
contribute to  brand  a	 class	as  socially  backward.	 The
customs which  they honour  and observe,  the rituals  which
they fear  and practice	 the habits  to which they adapt and
conform, the  festivals which  they enjoy  and celebrate and
even the  Gods that they revere and worship are enlightening
elements  in   recognising  their   social   gradation	 and
backwardness; (c)  Amongst very many classes and communities
considered socially  inferior, child  marriage persists, the
rule of Saptapadi is not followed; divorces are granted by a
caste panchayat;  (d) dress  and work  habit is	 yet another
indication that	 economic  situation  and  social  situation
often reflect each others; (e) there are many other customs,
rituals or  habits of  significance mark  out  the  socially
backward class;	 (f) the  weight to  be	 attached  to  these
factors depends upon the circumstances of the case which can
only be	 revealed by  thoughtful, penetrating  investigation
and analysis.  It cannot  be done  by means  of mathematical
formulae but  only by  looking in the round or taking a look
at the	entire situation.  Sometimes it	 may be	 possible to
readily identify  certain castes or social groups as a whole
as socially  forward or	 socially backward classes. Poverty,
of course,  is basic,  being the  root cause  as well as the
rueful result  of social  and educational  backwardness	 But
mere  poverty	it  seems   is	not  enough  to	 invite	 the
constitutional branding	 because of the vast majority of the
people of our country are poverty-struck but some among them
are socially  and educationally forward and others backward.
In a country like India where 80 per cent of the people live
below the  breadline, even  the majority  of the  so  called
socially forward  classes may  be poor.	 In the rural social
ladder they  are indeed	 high up  and despite  the  economic
backwardness of	 sizeable sections  of them,  they cannot be
branded as  socially backward.	On the other hand, there are
several castes	or other  social groups	 who have only to be
named  to   be	immediately   identified  as   socially	 and
economically  backward	 classes,  identified	as  socially
backward classes. [431 F-H; 432 A-F; 433 <a href="/doc/203735/" id="a_47">A-E]

have progressed far enough and forged ahead so as to compare
favourably with	 the leading  forward classes  economically,
socially and  educationally. In	 such cases,  per  haps	 and

to such of these members of the class who really deserve it;

</p><p id="p_20">     14. In  the ultimate  analysis, attainment	 of economic
equality is the final and the only solution to the besetting
problems. There	 is also  one danger  in adopting individual
property as  the criterion  to	identify  a  member  of	 the
backward classes.  The truly  lower  classes  who  need	 the
certificate  most  to  prove  their  poverty  will  find  it
difficult to  get the  certificate from	 the official or the
legislator or any named person [434 B-C]
</p><p id="p_21">     15. Class poverty, not individual poverty, is therefore
the primary test. Other ancillary tests are the way of life,
the standard  of living,  the place in the social hierarchy,
the  habits   and  customs,  etc.  etc.	 Despite  individual
exceptions, it	may be	possible and easy to identify social
backwardness with  reference to	 caste,	 with  reference  to
residence,  with  reference  to	 occupation  or	 some  other
dominant feature. notwithstanding our antipathy to caste and
sub-regionalism, these	are facts  of life  which cannot  be
wished away.  If they  reflect poverty	which is the primary
source of  social and educational backwardness, they must be
recognised for	what they  are along with other less primary
sources.  There	 is  and  there	 can  be  nothing  wrong  in
recognising  poverty   wherever	 it   is  reflected   as  an
identifiable group  phenomena whether  you see it as a caste
group, a  sub regional	group, an occupational group or some
other class.  Once  the	 relevant  factors  are	 taken	into
consideration, how  and where to draw the line is a question
for each  State to  consider since  the economic  and social
conditions differ  from area  to  area.	 Once  the  relevant
conditions are taken into consideration and the backwardness
of a  class of	people is determined, it will not be for the
court to  interfere in	the matter.  But certainly, judicial
review will not stand excluded. [334 D-G]

as  envisaged	by  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_58">Art.   16(4)</a>  as   guaranteed   in	 the
Constitution, is a national commitment and a historical need
to eradicate  age-old social disparities in our country. But
unfortunately the policy of reservation higher to formulated
by the	Government for	the upliftment	of such socially and
educationally backward classes of citizens is caste-oriented
while the  policy should be based on economic criteria. Then
alone the element of caste in making such special provisions
or reservations	 under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) can be removed.
[435B-D]
</p><p id="p_23">     2. It is true that mere economic backwardness would not

One of	several tests to be adopted. The predominant and the

15(4)</a> or  for reservations  of posts  and appointments under
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_61">Art. 16(4)</a>  should be poverty, and caste or a sub-caste or a
group should  be used only for purposes of identification of
persons comparable  to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes,
till such  members of  backward classes	 attain a  state  of
enlightenment and  there is  eradication of  poverty amongst
them and they become equal partners in a new social order in
our national life. [435 H; 436 C-D]
</p><p id="p_24">     3. The  adequacy or  otherwise of representation of the
backward classes  in the  services has to be determined with
reference to  the percentage of that class in the population
and the	 total strength	 of the	 service  as  a	 whole.	 The
representation does  not have  to exactly  correspond to the
percentage of  that class  in the population; it just has to
be adequate. Moreover, in the case of services the extent of
representation has  to be  considered by taking into account
the number  of members of that class in the service, whether
they are holding reserved or unreserved posts. [436 E-F]
</p><p id="p_25">     4. The  State should  give due importance and effect to
the  dual   constitutional  mandates   of   maintenance	  of
efficiency and	the equality of opportunity for all persons.
The nature  and extent	of reservations must be rational and
reasonable. The	 state	of  backwardness  of  any  class  of
citizens is  a fact  situation which needs investigation and
determination by a fact finding body which has the expertise
and  the   machinery  for   collecting	relevant  data.	 The
Constitution has  provided for	the appointment	 of  such  a
Commission for	Backward Classes by the President under <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_62">Art.
340</a> to	make recommendations  and left	if to  the States to
make special  provisions for  advancement of  such  backward
classes. It may be, and often is, difficult for the Court to
draw the line in advance which the State ought not to cross,
but it	is never  difficult for	 the Court  to know  that an
invasion across	 the border,  however ill-defined, has taken
place.	The  Courts  have  neither  the	 expertise  nor	 the
sociological knowledge	to define  or lay  down the criteria
for  determining   what	 are   'socially  and  educationally
backward classes  of citizens'	within the  meaning of	<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_63">Art.
15(4)</a> which  enables the  State to  make 'special provisions
for the	 advancement' of  such classes	notwithstanding	 the
command of  <a href="/doc/1952106/" id="a_64">Art. 15(2)</a> that the State shall not discriminate
against any  citizens on  the ground only of religion, race,
caste, descent,	 place of  birth, residence  or any of them.
The Supreme  Court is  ill-equipped to	perform the  task of
determining whether  a class  of citizens  is  socially	 and
educationally backward, but, however a duty to interpret the
Constitution and  to see  what it  means and intends when it
makes  provision   for	the   advancement  of  socially	 and
educationally  backward	  classes.   In	  considering	this
situation then,	 Courts must  never forget  that it  is	 the
Constitution they are expounding. Except for this, the Court
has very little or no function.

</p><p id="p_27">     5. The  Preamble to our Constitution shows the nation's
resolve to  secure  to	all  its  citizens:  Justice-Social,
economic and  political. The  State's objective	 of bringing
about  and  maintaining	 social	 justice  must	be  achieved
reasonably having regard to the interests of all. Irrational
and unreasonable  moves by  the State will slowly but surely
tear apart the fabric of society. It is primarily the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">368</span>
duty and function of the state to inject moderation into the
decisions taken	   under  Arts.	 15(4)	and  16(4),  because
justice lives  in the  hearts of  men and a growing sense of
injustice and reverse discrimination, fueled by unwise State
action, will  destroy, not  advance, social  justice. If the
State contravenes  the constitutional mandates of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_65">Art. 16(1)</a>

region	to   region  within  a	State,	depending  upon	 the
conditions prevailing  in a  particular State  or region, of
the Backward  Classes.	Since  the  problems  pertaining  in
reservation can	 never be resolved through litigation in the
Courts,	 the   Central	Government   should   consider	 the
feasibility of	appointing a  permanent National  Commission
for  Backward	Classes	 which	must  constantly  carry	 out
sociological and economic study from State to State and from
region	to  region  within  a  State.  The  framers  of	 the
Constitution by	 enacting <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_69">Art.	340</a>  clearly  envisaged	 the

cannot be  stretched beyond  a particular  limit. The  State
exists to  serve its  people. There  are some services where
expertise and  skill are  of the  essence. Medical  services
directly affect	 and deal  with the  health and	 life of the
populace. Professional	expertise,  born  of  knowledge	 and
experience, of	a high	degree of  technical  knowledge	 and
operational  skill   is	 required  of  pilots  and  aviation
engineers. The	lives of  citizens depend  on such  persons.
There are  other similar  fields  of  governmental  activity
where  professional,   technological,  scientific  or  other
special skill is called for. In such services or posts under
the Union or States, there can be no room for reservation of
posts;	merit	alone  must   be  the	sole  and   decisive
consideration for appointments. [438 C-E]
Per Venkataramiah, J.
</p><p id="p_30">     1. Equality of opportunity revolves around two dominant
principles-  (i)   the	traditional  value  of	equality  of
opportunity;  and   (ii)  the  newly  appreciated-not  newly
conceived-idea of  equality of	results. The  Society  which
cherishes the  ideal of	 equality has  to define the meaning
and consent  of the concept of equality and the choices open
to it  to bring about an egalitarian society would always be
political. But	the Courts  have been forced to scrutinise a
variety of  choices, while  society for	 which they  have to
answer has  been issuing  a proliferation  of demands.	Many
inequalities in	 the past seemed almost to have been part of
the order  of nature.  The Courts,  however  deal  with	 the
problems that  society presents.  `Levels of  awareness	 and
corresponding senses  of grievance  have arisen at different
times for  particular historical  reasons often	 tending  to
differentiate among  the categories  of equality rather than
unifying them. Inequalities of class, race, religion and sex
have presented	themselves at  different periods  as primary
grievances'. The  Courts must  remind  themselves  that	 for
those who  are suffering  from	deprivation  of	 inalienable
rights, gradualism can never be a sufficient remedy. Ours is
a 'struggle for status, a struggle
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">369</span>
to take	 democracy off	parchment and give it life.' 'Social
injustice always  balances its	books with red ink'. Neither
the caprice  of personal  taste nor the protection of vested
interests can stand as reasons for restricting opportunities
of  any	  appropriately	 qualified  person.  These  are	 the
considerations	which  sometimes  may  be  conflicting	that
should weigh  with  the	 courts	 while	dealing	 with  cases
arising out of the doctrine of equality. It should, however,
be remembered  that the	 courts by  themselves are  not in a
position to  bring the	concept of  equality  into  fruitful
action. They  should be	 supported by the will of the people
of the Government and of the legislators. These should be an
emergence of  united action  on the  part of all segments of
human society.	This is	 not all.  Mere will  to bring about
equality under	the existing economic level might worsen the
situation. There  should be at the same time a united action
to increase  the national resources so that the operation of
equality will  be less	burdensome and	every member  of the
society is  carried to	a higher  social and  economic level
leaving nobody	below a	 minimum which	guarantees  all	 the
basic human  needs to  every member of the society. If there
is no  united action  the  pronouncements  by  courts  would
become	empty	words  as   many  of   the  high  principles
adumberated in	the chapter  on the  Directive Principles of
State Policy in the Constitution have turned out to be owing
to several factors. [440 B-H; 441 A]
</p><p id="p_31">     2. The  need for  social action  is necessitated by the
environmental  factors	 and  living   conditions   of	 the
individuals concerned.	The application	 of the principle of
individual merit,  unmitigated by  other considerations	 may
quite often lead to inhuman results 1441 G]
</p><p id="p_32">     3. An  examination of the question of the background of
the Indian  Social conditions-caste  ridden atmosphere shows
that  the   expression	"backward   classes"  used   in	 the
Constitution  referred	only  to  those	 who  were  born  in
particular castes,  or who  belonged to	 particular races or
tribes or  religious minorities which were backward. This is
so because a caste is based on various factors, sometimes it
may be	a class,  a race or a racial unit and the caste of a
person is  governed by his birth in. the family. [459 E; 457
F]
     It	 is   significant  that	  the  expression  "backward
classes" used  in  Part	 XVI  of  the  Constitution  and  in
particular  in	 <a href="/doc/848473/" id="a_71">Article  338(3)</a>  is  used  along  with	 the
Scheduled Castes,  the Scheduled Tribes and the Anglo-Indian
Community. The meaning of "backward classes" has, therefore,
to be  deduced along with the other words preceding it. [462
G]
     It is a rule of statutory construction that where there
are general  words following  particular and specific words,
the general  words must	 be confined  to things	 of the same
kind as	 those specified. It is true that this rule which is
called as  the ejusdem	generise rule or the rule noscitur a
sociis cannot  be carried  too far.  But it is reasonable to
apply that rule where the specific words refer to a distinct
genus or category. [462 H; 463 A]
     Part  XVI	 of  the  Constitution	deals  with  certain
concessions extended  to certain  castes, tribes  and  races
which are  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes and to the
Anglo-Indian community. In the context if <a href="/doc/848473/" id="a_72">Article 338(3)</a> and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">370</span>
<a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_73">Article 340</a> are construed, the expression 'backward classes'
can  only  refer  to  A	 certain  castes,  races  tribes  or
communities or	parts thereof  other than  Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes  and the  Anglo-Indian community, which are
backward. Clause  (6) of  the resolution  regarding the aims
and objects  of the  Constitution moved by Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru on  December 13, 1946 and the history of the enactment
of Part	 XVI of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly
lead to	 the conclusion that backward classes are only those
castes, races,	tribes or  communities, which are identified
by birth,  which are backward. It is, therefore,difficult to
hold that  persons or  groups of  persons who  are  backward
merely on  account of poverty which is traceable to economic
reasons can  also be  considered  as  backward	classes	 for
purposes of  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_74">Article 16(4)</a> and Part XVI of the Constitution.
[463 C-D; 466 G-H]
     The Drafting  Committee by	 qualifying  the  expression
"class of  citizens" by	 "backward" in	<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_75">Article 16(4)</a> of the
Constitution tried  to reconcile  three different  points of
view  and   produced  a	  workable  proposition	  which	 was
acceptable to  all, the	 three points of view being (i) that
there should be equality of opportunity for all citizens and
that every individual qualified for a particular post should
be free	 to apply  for that post to sit for examinations and
to have his qualifications tested so as to determine whether
he was fit for the post or not and that there ought to be no
limitations, there ought to be no hindrance in the operation
of the	principle of  equality of  opportunity; (ii) that if
the principle of equality of opportunity was to be operative
there ought  to be no reservations of any sort for any class
or community  all and  that all	 citizens if  they qualified
should be  placed on  the same footing of equality as far as
public services	 were concerned;  and (iii)  that though the
principle of  equality of opportunity was theoretically good
there must  at the  same time  be a  provision made  for the
entry of  certain communities which have so far been outside
the administration.  The whole	tenor of  discussion in	 the
Constituent Assembly  pointed to  making reservation  for  a
minority of  the population  including Scheduled  Castes and
Scheduled Tribes which were socially backward. [465 G-H; 466
A-B]
</p><p id="p_33">     4. In  Balaji's case  and in  Chitralekha's  case,	 the
Supreme Court  exhibited a lot of hesitation in equating the
expression 'class'  with 'caste'  for  purposes	 of  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_76">Article
15(4)</a> and  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_77">16(4)</a> of  the Constitution.	The juxtaposition of
the expression	'backward classes' and 'Scheduled Castes' in
<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_78">Article 15</a>  of the  Constitution, according to the above two
decisions, led	to a  reasonable inference  that  expression
'classes' was  not synonymous  with 'caste'. The Court while
making these  observations did	not give adequate importance
to  the	  evils	 of  caste  system  which  had	led  to	 the
backwardness of	 people belonging  to certain castes and the
debates that  preceded the enactment of Part XVI and <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_79">Article
15(4)</a> and  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_80">Article 16(4)</a>  of the  Constitution. What  was in
fact over  looked was  the  history  of	 the  Indian  social
institutions. The  makers of  the Indian  Constitution	very
well knew  that there were a number of castes the conditions
of whose  members were	almost similar	to the conditions of
members	 belonging  to	the  Scheduled	Castes	and  to	 the
Scheduled Tribes  and that  they also  needed  to  be  given
adequate protection  in order  to tide over the difficulties
in the	way of	their progress which were not so much due to
poverty but  due to  their birth in a particular caste. Part
XVI was not enacted for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">371</span>
purpose of  alleviating the  conditions of poorer classes as
such which  was taken care of by the provision of Part IV of
the Constitution  and in  particular by	 <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_81">Article 46</a>  and  by

likely to follow and may take away from the sole purpose for

factors such  as  physical  disability,	 poverty,  place  of

parts. It  asks the State not to deny to any person equality
before law.  It also  asks the	State not  to deny the equal
protection of the laws. Equality before law connotes absence
of  any	  discrimination  in   law.  The  concept  of  equal
protection required  the  State	 to  meet  out	differential
treatment to  persons in  different situations	in order  to
establish an  equilibrium amongst  all. This is the basis of
the rule  that equals should be treated equally and unequals
must be	 treated unequally if the doctrine of equality which
is one	of the	corner stones  of our  Constitution is to be
duly implemented.  In order  to do justice amongst unequals,
the State  has	to  resort  to	compensatory  or  protective

were enacted as measures of compensatory or protective
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">372</span>
discrimination to  grant  relief  to  persons  belonging  to
socially oppressed  castes and minorities. Under them, it is
possible to  provide for reservation of seats in educational
institution and	 of posts  in Government  services  to	such
persons only.  But if there are persons who do not belong to
socially oppressed  castes and	minorities but who otherwise
belong	to   weaker  sections,	due  to	 poverty,  place  of
habitation, want  of equal  opportunity	 etc.  the  question
arises whether	such reservation can be made in their favour
under any  other  provision  of	 the  Constitution  such  as
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_105">Article 14</a>,  <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_106">Article 15(1</a>),  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_107">Article 16(1)</a>  or	<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_108">Article	 46.</a>
According to  Thomas's case, (a) no reservation of posts can
be  made   in  Government   services  for  backward  classes
including  Scheduled   Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  under
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_109">Article 14</a>  or <a href="/doc/873751/" id="a_110">Article 16 1</a>), and (b) preferential treatment
as was	done in	 this case  on the  basis of  classification
ordinarily  could  be  given  under  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_111">Article  16(1)</a>  to	 the
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes only. Other backward
classes could  not, except  in exceptionally  rare cases  be
extended the  same benefit  and their  only hope was <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_112">Article
16(4)</a> of the Constitution. [477 A-E; 485 G-H]
</p><p id="p_36">     7.	 As   to  the	power  of  the	Government  to	make

of the	Constitution is	 not open  to the Government to call
any caste or group or community as backward according to its
sweet will  and pleasure  and extend the benefit that may be
granted under  those provisions	 to such  caste or  group or
community.  The	  exercise  of	uncontrolled  power  by	 the
Government in  this regard  may lead to political favoritism
leading to  denial of the just requirements of classes which
are truly  backward. The power of the Government to classify
any caste  or group  or community  as  backward	 has  to  be
exercised in  accordance with  the guidelines  that  can  be
easily gathered	 from the  Constitution. It  is now accepted
that the  expressions 'socially	 and educationally  backward
classes of  citizens'  and  the	 Scheduled  Castes  and	 the
Scheduled Tribes'  in  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_117">Article	15(4)</a>  of  the	Constitution
together are equivalent to `backward classes of citizens' in
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_118">Article 16(4).</a> [486 A-D]
     Further the  criterion for determining the backwardness
must not  be based  solely on  religion, race, caste, sex or
place  of  birth  and  the  backwardness  being	 social	 and
educational must  be similar  to the backwardness from which
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes suffered. This
view is in conformity with the intention underlying clause 6
of the	resolution regarding  the aims	and objects  of	 the
Constitution moved  by Jawaharlal  Nehru on December 13,1946
which  asked   the  Constitution   Assembly   to   frame   a
Constitution providing	adequate safeguards  for minorities,
backward and  tribal area  and depressed  and other backward
classes and  also wish	the provisions	of <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_119">Article  338</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_120">Article	 340</a>   of  the	 Constitution.	Unless	 the   above
restriction is	imposed on  the Government,  it would become
possible for  the Government  to call  any caste or group or
community which	 constitutes a	powerful political  lobby in
the State  as backward	even though  in fact  it may  be  an
advanced caste	or group  or community	but just  below some
other forward community.
</p><p id="p_37">					    [486 H; 487 C-D]
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">373</span>
     There is  another important  reason why  such  advanced
castes or  groups or  communities should  not be included in
the list of backward classes and that A is that if castes or
groups and  communities which  are fairly  well advanced and
castes and  groups and communities which are really backward
being at  the rock-bottom  level are  classified together as
backward  classes,   the  benefit   of	 reservation   would
invariably be eaten up by the more advanced sections and the
really deserving  sections would  practically go without any
benefit as  more number	 of children  of the  more  advanced
castes or  group or  communities  amongst  them	 would	have
scored higher  marks than  the	children  of  more  backward
castes or  groups or  communities. In  that even  the  whole
object of reservation would become frustrated. [487 D-F]
     Hence as  far as  possible while  preparing the list of
backward classes,  the State  Government has to bear in mind
the above principle as a guiding factor. The adoption of the
above principle will not unduly reduce the number of persons
who will  be eligible  for the	benefits under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_121">Article 15(4)</a>
and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_122">Article  16(4)</a> of  the Constitution since over the years
the level  of the  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes is
also going  up by  reason of several remedial measures taken
in regard  to them  by the  State and Central Government. At
the same  time, it  will also  release the  really  backward
castes, groups	and communities	 from the  strangle-hold  of
many advanced  groups  which  have  l-ad  the  advantage  of
reservation along  with	 the  really  backward	classes	 for
nearly three  decades. It  is time  that n  ore attention is
given to  those castes, groups and communities who have been
at the lowest level suffering from all the disadvantages and
disabilities (except  perhaps untouchability)  to which many
of the	Scheduled Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  have	been
exposed but without the same or similar advantages that flow
from being  included in the list of the Scheduled Castes and
the Scheduled Tribes.

</p><p id="p_39">     8.	 Since	 economic  condition   is  also	 a  relevant
criterion, it  would be	 appropriate to incorporate a 'means
test' as one of the tests in determining the backwardness as
was done  by the  Kerala Government. These two tests namely,
that the conditions of caste or group or community should be
more  or  less	similar	 to  the  conditions  in  which	 the
Scheduled Castes  or Scheduled	Tribes are situated and that
the income of the family to which the candidate belongs does
not  exceed  the  specified  limit  would  serve  as  useful
criteria in  determining beneficiaries of any reservation to
be made	 under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_123">Article	15(4).</a> For  the purpose	 of  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_124">Article

adequately represented	in the	Government services. [488 C-

</p><p id="p_40">     9. The  classification styled  as 'special' group which
is based  on occupation-cum-income  considerations and which
has received  the approval  in Chitralekha  s case;  is	 yet
another valid  and useful  test which can be adopted for the
purpose of reservation which can be more legitimately traced
to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_125">Art. 14</a> and not to <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_126">Art. 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_127">Art. 16(4).</a> [491 H]

cent has  been unsettled  by a	majority on  the Bench which
decided this case. [491 B]
</p><p id="p_42">     11. If  reservation is  made only	in favour  of  those
backward castes	 or clauses  which  are	 comparable  to	 the
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes, it may not exceed 50
per cent  (including 18	 per cent reserved for the Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  and 15  per cent	reserved for
'special group')  in view  of the  total population  of such
backward classes  in the  State of  Karnataka.	The  Havanur
Commission has	taken the number of students passing at SSLC
examination in	the year  1972 as  the basis for determining
the backwardness.  The average	passes per  thousand of	 the
total population of the State of Karnataka was 1.69 in 1972.
The average in the case of the Scheduled Castes was 0.56 and
in the	case of	 Scheduled Tribes  was 0.51. Even if we take
all the	 castes, tribes	 and communities  whose	 average  is
below 50  per cent  of the  State average  i.e. below 85 per
cent for  classifying them  as	backward,  large  chunks  of
population which  are now  treated as backward would have to
go out	of the	list of	 backward classes.  Consequently the
necessity  for	 reservation  which  would  take  the  total
reservation under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_130">Article 15(4)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_131">1</a><a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_132">(,(4)</a>  beyond 50	 per
cent of	 the total  number of  seats/posts  would  cease  to
exist. The present arrangement has been worked for more than
five years  already. It	 is now necessary to redetermine the
question of  backwardness of  the various castes, tribes and
communities for	 purposes of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_133">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_134">Article 16(4)</a>
in the	light of  the latest  figures to be collected on the
various	 relevant   factors  and  to  refix  the  extent  of
reservation for backward classes. The reservation of 15% now
made under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_135">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_136">Article 16(4)</a> but which may be

occupation-cum-income can  in any  event be  availed  of  by
members of all communities and castes.

determination some  castes or  communities have to go out of
the list of backward classes prepared for Articles 15(4) and
16(4),	the  Government	 may  still  pursue  the  policy  of
amelioration of	 weaker sections  of the  population amongst
them in accordance with the directive principle contained in
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_137">Article 46</a>  of the Constitution. There are in all castes and
communities poor  people who  if  they	are  given  adequate
opportunity and	 training may  be able	to  compete  success
fully  with   persons  belonging   to  richer  classes.	 The
Government  may	  provide  for	 them  liberal	 grants	  of
scholarships, free  studentships, free	boarding and lodging
facilities, free  uniforms, free  mid-day meals etc. to make
the life  of poor  students comfortable.  The Government may
also provide extra tutorial facilities, stationery and books
free of	 cost and  library facilities. These and other steps
should be  taken in  the lower classes so that by the time a
student appears	 for the  qualifying examination  he may  be
able to	 attain a high degree of proficiency in his studies.

their  respective   points  of	 view  on   the	 policy	  of
reservations which,  alas, is  even figuratively,  a burning
issue to-day.  We were invited by the counsel not so much as
to deliver judgments but to express our opinion on the issue
of reservations;  which may  serve as  a  guideline  to	 the
Commission with	 the Government	 of  Karnataka	proposes  to
appoint, for  examining the  question  of  affording  better
employment  and	  educational  opportunities   to  Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled  Tribes  and	other  Backward	 Classes.  A
somewhat unusual  exercise is  being undertaken by the Court
in giving  expression to  its  views  without  reference  to
specific facts.	 But, institutions  profit  by	well-meaning
innovations. The facts will appear before the Commission and
it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">376</span>
will evolve  suitable tests in the matter of reservations. I
cannot resist expressing the hope that the deep thinking and
sincerity  which  has  gone  into  the	formulation  of	 the
opinions expressed by my learned Brethren will not go waste.
The proposed Commission should give its close application to
their weighty  opinions. Mine  is only	a skeletal effort. I
reserve the  right to  elaborate upon it, but the chances of
doing so are not too bright.
</p><p id="p_54">     I would  state my opinion in the shape of the following
pro positions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     1	  The reservation  in favour of scheduled castes and
     scheduled tribes must continue as at present, there is,
     without the  application of a means test, for a further
     period not	 exceeding fifteen  years.  Another  fifteen
     years will	 make it fifty years after the advent of the
     Constitution, a  period reasonably	 long for  the upper
     crust of  the oppressed classes to overcome the baneful
     effects   of    social   oppression,    isolation	 and
     humiliation.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2.	  The means  test, that	 is  to	 say,  the  test  of
     economic backwardness  ought to be made applicable even
     to the  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes after the
     period mentioned in (1) above. It is essential that the
     privileged	 section   of  the  underprivileged  society
     should not	 be  permitted	to  monopolise	preferential
     benefits for an indefinite period of time.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     3.	  In so	 far  as  the  Other  Backward	Classes	 are
     concerned, two  tests should  be conjunctively  applied
     for identifying them for the purpose of reservations in
     employment and  education: One,  that  they  should  be
     comparable to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
     in the matter of their backwardness; and two, that they
     should  satisfy   the  means   test  such	as  a  State
     Government may  lay down  in the  context of prevailing
     economic conditions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     4.	  The  policy	of   reservations   in	 employment,
     education	and   legislative  institutions	  should  be
     reviewed every  five years	 or so.	 That will  at	once
     afford an oppor

     out of  particular facets of the reservation policy and

This review  is necessary  because a  serious doubt  is	 now

backwardness. There has been some vacillation on the part of
the Judiciary  on the  question whether	 the caste should be

bird's eye-view	 of the	 decisions of the Court may first be
taken to arrive at a starting point as to
 whether  the Judiciary	 has univocally	 recognised caste as
the basis for recognition of the backwardness,
     <a href="/doc/149321/" id="a_145">In State  of Madras  v. Srimathi Champakam Dorairajan &amp;

result of  poverty to  a very  large extent.  The classes of

would provide a much more reliable yardstick for determining

dithering and  the vacillation	on the part of the Judiciary
in dealing  with the  question of  reservation in  favour of
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes as well as other socially

perceived  realities.	A  perceptive	viewer	of  judicial
intervention observed  that the courts turned out to be more
limited as  a vantage  point then  I naively  assumed at the
outset. They act as a balance wheel channelling compensatory
policies and accommodating them to other commitments, but it
is the	political process  that shapes the larger contour of

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">385</span>
<p id="p_87">answer is  whether caste should be the basis for determining
social and educational backwardness. In other words, by what
yardstick, groups  which are  to be  treated as socially and
educationally backward are to be identified? To simplify the
question: should  membership of	 caste signify	a  class  of
citizens as  being socially  and educationally backward ? If
'caste' is  adopted as	the criterion for determining social
and educational backwardness does it provide a valid test or
it would  violate <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_168">Art.	15(1)</a> which prohibits discrimination
against any  citizen on	 grounds of  religion, race,  caste,
sex, place of birth or any of them.
</p><p id="p_88">     What then	is a caste ? Though caste has been discussed
by scholars  and  jurists,  no	precise	 definition  of	 the
expression has	emerged. A  caste is  a horizontal segmental
division of  society spread  over a  district or a region or
the whole  State and  also  sometimes  outside	it.(')	Homo
Hierarchicus is	 expected to  be the central and substantive
element of the caste system with differentiate it from other
social	systems.   The	concept	  of  purity   and  impurity
conceptualises the  caste system.  Louis Dumont asserts that
the principle  of the  opposition of the pure and the impure
underlies hierarchy, which is the superiority of the pure to
the impure, underlies separation because pure and the impure
must be	 kept separate	and underlies the division of labour
because pure  and impure  occupations must likewise, be kept
separate.(2) There  are four essential features of the caste
system which maintained its homo hierarchicus character: (1)
hierarchy (2)  commensality: (3)  restrictions on marriages;
and (4)	 hereditary occupation.(3)  Most of  the  caste	 are
endogamous  groups.  Intermarriage  between  two  groups  is
impermissible.	But  'Pratilom'	 marriages  are	 not  wholly
unknown. Similarly with the onward movement of urbanisation,
members of  various castes are slowly giving up, traditional
occupations and	 the pure  and impure  avocations  is  being
frowned upon  by developing  notion of	dignity of labour As
the  fruits   of  independence	were  unequally	 distributed
amongst various segments of the society, in each caste there
came into  existence a	triple division	 based	on  economic
resurgence amongst  the members of the caste. Those who have
become economically  well off  have acquired  an upper class
status (class  consciousness) and  the one on the step below
is the	middle class  and the  third one  belongs to  poorer
section

<p id="p_90">of the caste. This led to the realisation that caste culture
does not  help economic interest. In fact the upper crust of
the same  caste is  verily accused  of exploiting  the lower
strata of  the same  caste. It	is therefore, rightly argued
that the  basis of  the	 caste	system	namely,	 purity	 and
pollution  is	slowly	being	displaced  by  the  economic
condition of  the various  segments of the same caste. It is
recognised on almost all hands that the important feature of
the caste structure are progressively suffering erosion. The
new  organisation,  the	 so-called  caste  organisation,  is
substantially different	 from the  traditional structure and
caste councils. Economic differentiation amongst the members
of the	caste has  become sharp, but not so sharp as to bury
caste sentiments and ties.
</p><p id="p_91">     If the  transformation of the caste structure as herein
indicated is  realistically accepted, should the caste label
be still  accepted as  the basis  for determining social and
educational backwardness.  In a	 recent paper  by the  noted
sociologist Shri  I.P. Desai  (Alas, he	 is no more), it has
been ably  argued that	not a  caste but  the class  or	 the
social group  should be	 examined with a view to determining
their social  and educational  backwardness. Caste  in rural
society is  more often	than not  mirrored in  the  economic
power wielded  by it  and vice	versa. Social  hierarchy and
economic position  exhibit an  undisputable  mutuality.	 The
lower the  caste, the  poorer its  members. The	 poorer	 the
members of  a caste, the lower the caste. Caste and economic
situation, reflecting  each other  as they  do arc  the Deus
exMachina of  the social  status occupied  and the  economic
power wielded  by an  individual or  class in rural society.
Social status and economic power are so woven and fused into
the caste  system in  Indian  rural  society  that  one	 may
without hesitation,  say that if poverty be the cause, caste
is the	primary index of social backwardness, so that social
backwardness is often readily identifiable with reference to
a person's  caste. Such	 we must  recognize is	the primeval
force and  omnipresence of caste in Indian Society, however,
much we	 may like to wish it away. So Sadly and oppressively
deep-rooted is	caste in  our country that it has cut across
even  the   barriers  of  religion.  The  caste	 system	 has
penetrated other  religious and	 dissentient Hindu  sects to
whom the  practice of  caste should be anathema and today we
fined that  practitioner of other religious faiths and Hindu
dissentients are some times as rigid adherents to the system
of caste  as the  conservative Hindus  . We  find  Christian
harijans, Christian
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">387</span>
Madars, Christian  Reddys, Christian  Kammas,  Mujbi  Sikhs,
etc. etc.  In Andhra  Pradesh there  is a community known as
Pinjaras or  Dudekulas (known  in the  North as 'Rui Pinjane
Wala'):	 (Professional	 cotton-beaters)  who	are   really
Muslims, but are treated in rural society, for all practical
purposes, as  a Hindu  caste. Several other instances may be
given.
</p><p id="p_92">     Shared  situation	in  the	 economic  hierarchy,  caste
gradation, occupation,	habitation,  style  of	consumption,
standard of  literacy and  a variety  of such  other factors
appear	to   go	 to  make  towards  social  and	 educational
backwardness. In  some situations  and indeed  quite  often,
social investigator  may easily	 be able to identify a whole
caste group  as a socially and educationally backward class;
he may readily recognise people living in certain areas, say
mountainous, desert  a fresh lease of life. In fact there is
a mad  rush for	 being recognised  as belonging	 to a  caste
which by  its nomenclature  would be included in the list of
socially and  educationally backward classes. To illustrate:
Bakshi Commission  in Gujrat recognised as many as 82 castes
as  being   socially  and  educationally  backward.  On	 the
publication of	its report,  Government of  Gujrat  received
representations by  members of those castes who had not made
any representation  to the  Bakshi Commission  for  treating
them as socially and educationally backward. This phenomenon
was noticed  by Mandal Commission when it observed: "whereas
the Commission	has tried  to make  the State  wise lists of
OBCS as	 comprehensive as  possible, it is quite likely that
severally synonymy  of the  castes listed backward have been
left out.  Certain castes  are known by a number of synonymy
which vary  from one  region to the other and their complete
coverage is  almost impossible.	 Mandal Commission found a p
way out	 by recommending that if a particular caste has been
treated as  backward then all its synonyms whether mentioned
in the	State  lists  or  not  should  also  be	 treated  as
backward.(1) Gujrat  Government	 was  forced  to  appoint  a
second commission  known as  Rane Commission Rane Commission
took note of the fact that there was an organised effort for
being considered socially and educationally backward castes.
Rane Commission	 recalled the  observations in Balaji's case
that 'Social  backwardness is  on the  ultimate analysis the
result of  poverty to  a very  large extent.' The Commission
noticed that  some of  the castes just for the sake of being
considered as  socially	 and  educationally  backward,	have
degraded
     (1) Mandal Commission Report Vol. Ch. XII p. 55.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">388</span>
<p id="p_93">themselves to such an extent that, they had no hesitation in
attributing different  types of	 vices	to  and	 associating
other factors indicative of backwardness, with their castes.
The  Commission	 noted	that  the  malaise  requires  to  be
remedied. The  Commission therefore,  devised a	 method	 for
determining  socially  and  educationally  backward  classes
without reference  to caste,  beneficial to  all sections of
people irrespective  of the  caste to which they belong. The
Commission came	 to an	irrefutable conclusion	that amongst
certain castes	and communities	 or class  of  people,	only
lower  income	groups	amongst	  them	are   socially	 and
educationally  backward.   We  may   recall  here   a  trite
observation in case of N.M.Thomas which reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	  "A word  of sociological  caution. In the light of
     experience,  here	 and  elsewhere,   the	 danger	  of
     'reservation', it	seems  to  me,	is  three-fold.	 Its
     benefits, by  and large,  are snatched  away by the top
     creamy layer  of the  'backward' caste  or class,	thus
     keeping the  weakest among	 the week  always  weak	 and
     leaving the fortunate layers to consume the whole cake.
     Secondly, this  claim is  over played  extravagntly  in
     democracy by  large and  vocal groups  whole burden  of
     backwardness has  been substantially  lightened by	 the
     march of time and measures of better education and more
     opportunities of  employment,  but	 wish  to  weak	 the
     'weaker section'  label as	 a means to score over their
     near-equals   formally   categorised   as	 the   upper
     brackets."</blockquote>
<p id="p_94">     A few  other aspects  for rejecting  caste as the basis
for identifying	 social and  educational backwardness may be
briefly noted.	If State  patronage for	 preferred treatment
accepts caste  as the  only insignia  for determining social
and educational	 backwardness, the  danger looms  large that
this approach  alone would  legitimise and  perpetuate caste
system. lt  does not  go well  with our	 proclaimed  secular
character as  enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution.
The assumption	that all  members of  some caste are equally
socially and  educationally backward  is  not  well-founded.
Such an approach provides an oversimplification of a complex
problem	 of   identifying   the	  social   and	 educational
backwardness.  The   Chairman  of   the	  Backward   Classes
Commission, set	 up in	1953,  after  having  finalised	 the
report, concluded  that 'it  would have	 been better  if  we
could determine	 the criteria  of backwardness on principles
other than
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">389</span>
caste.'(1) Lastly  it is recognised without dissent that the
caste based reservation has been usurped by the economically
well-placed section   in  the same  caste. To illustrate, it
may be pointed that some years ago, I came across a petition
for special  leave against  the decision  of the  Punjab and
Haryana High  Court in	which the  reservation of 2-1/2" for

Majhabi Sikhs  was challenged  by none	other than the upper
crust of  the members  of the Scheduled Castes amongst Sikhs
in Punjab,  proving that  the  labelled	 weak  exploits	 the
really weaker.	Add to	this, the  findings of	the Research
Planning  Scheme   of  Sociologists   assisting	 the  Mandal
Commission when it observed: 'while determining the criteria
of  socially  and  educationally  backward  classes,  social
backwardness should be considered to be the critical element
and educational backwardness to be the linked element though
not  necessarily  derived  from	 the  former.'(2)  The	team
ultimately concluded  that 'social  backwardness  refers  to
ascribed status	 and educational  backwardness	to  achieved
status,	 and   it  considered  social  backwardness  as	 the
critical element  and educational  backwardness	 to  be	 the
linked though  not derived  element.'  'The  attempt  is  to
identify  socially  and	 educationally	backward-classes  of
citizens. The  caste, as  is understood in Hindu Society, is
unknown to  Muslims,  Christians,  Parsis,  Jews  etc  Caste
criterion would not furnish a reliable yardstick to identify
socially   and	 educationally	 backward   group   in	 the
aforementioned	communities   though  economic	backwardness
would.
</p><p id="p_95">     Therefore, a  time has come to review the criterion for
identifying  socially  and  educationally  backward  classes
ignoring the  caste label.  The only  criterion which can be
realistically devised  is the  one of economic backwardness.
To this	 may be	 added some  relevant criteria	such as	 the
secular character  of the group, its opportunity for earning
livelihood etc.	 but by and large economic backwardness must
be the load star. Why I say this ?
</p><p id="p_96">     Chronic poverty  is the  bane of Indian Society. Market
economic and  money spinning  culture  has  transformed	 the
general behavior  of the  Society towards its members. Upper
caste does  net enjoy  the status  or respect,	traditional,
voluntary or  forced any  more even  in rural  areas what to
speak of highly westernised urban society.

     the poor  strata of  lower castes,	 and in	 the name of
     secularism. In course of time the upper caste will also
     become the upper class. Such a process would hamper the
     growth of secular forces."(1)
This fear  psychosis is	 effectively answered  by an eminent
academic. He  says that	 'if the  poor can  be operationally
defined, categorised  and  sub-categorised  and	 reservation
benefits be stratified accordingly, would the scenario still
haunt use?  I think  not. He  recognised that  this point is
valuable in  terms of  alerting everyone  to  the  need	 for
further	 refinement  of	 the  notions  of  poor	 strata.  He
recognised that	 the State  is, with all its limitations and
resources, to  direct and  plan social	transformation. (The
non-revolutionary) choice  is between reinforcing 'caste' or
reinforcing the extant constitutional values ' (2)
     Let me conclude. If economic criterion for compensatory
discrimination or  affirmative action  is accepted, it would
strike	at   the  root	 cause	of  social  and	 educational
backwardness, and  simultaneously take	a vital	 step in the
direction of  destruction of  destruction of caste structure
which in  turn would  advance the  secular character  of the
Nation. This  approach seeks  to translate  into reality the
twin  constitutional   goals:  one,   to   strike   at	 the
perpetuation of	 the  caste  stratification  of	 the  Indian
Society so  as to  arrest progressive movement and to take a
firm step towards establishing a casteless society; and two,
to progressively  eliminate poverty by giving an opportunity
to the	disadvantaged sections of the society to raise their
position and  be part  of the mainstream of life which means
eradication of poverty.

</p><p id="p_104">     CHINNAPA REDDY, J. Over three decades have passed since
we  promised   ourselves  "justice,   social,  economic	 and
political" and	"equality of  status and  opportunity". Yet,
even today,  we find members of castes, communities, classes
or by  whatever name  you may  describe them,  jockeying for
position, trying  to elbow each other out, and, viewing with
one another  to be  named and  recognised as  'socially	 and
educationally  backward	  classes',  to	  quality  for	 the
'privilege' of the special provision for advancement and the
provision for  reservation that may be made under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_169">Art. 15(4)</a>
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_170">&amp; 16(4)</a>	 of the	 Constitution. The  paradox of the system of
reservation is	that it	 has engendered	 a  spirit  of	self
denigration among  the people. Now here else in the world do
castes, classes	 or communities	 queue up  for the  sake  of
gaining the  backward statue.  Nowhere else  in the world is
there competition  to assert  backwardness and	to claim 'we
are  more  backward  than  you'.  This	is  an	unhappy	 and
disquieting situation,	but it	is stark  reality.  Whatever
gloss one  may like  to put  upon it,  it is  clear from the
rival claims  in these	appeals and  writ petitions that the
real contest  here is between certain members of two premier
(population-wise) caste-community-classes  of Karnataka, the
Lingayats and  the Vokkaligas,	each claiming that the other
is not	a socially and educationally backward class and each
keen  to   be  included	  in  the   list  of   socially	 and
educationally backward	classes. To  them, to  be  dubbed  a
member of  the socially	 and educationally back ward classes
is a passport for entry into professional colleges and State
services; so they jostle with each other and in tho bargain,
some time they keep out and some times they usher in some of
those entitled	to legitimate  entry, by  competition or  by
reservation. Commissions  have been appointed in the past to
identify the  backward classes,	 Governments have considered
the reports  of the commissions, and Courts have scrutinised
the decisions  of Governments, Case s have reached the Court
too, then and now again. Once more we are told
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">393</span>
that the  State of  Karnataka is  ready to  appoint  another
commission and	they have  asked us will you kindly lay down
some guidelines?"
</p><p id="p_105">     Ours  is  a  country  of  great  economic,	 social	 and
cultural  diversity.  Often  we	 take  great  pride  in	 the
country's cultural  diversity. While cultural diversity adds
to the	splendor of  India, the others add to our sorrow and
shame.	The   social  and  economic  disparties	 are  indeed
despairingly  vast.  The  Scheduled  Castes,  the  Scheduled
Tribes and  the other  socially and  educationally  backward
classes, all  of whom  have been  compendiously described as
'the weaker  sections of  the people'  have long journeys to
make society.  They need  aid; they need facility; they need
launching; they	 need  propulsion.  Their  needs  are  their
demands. The  demands  are  matters  of	 right	and  not  of
philanthropy. They ask for parity, and not charity. The days
of Dronacharya	and Ekalavya  are  over.  They	claim  their
constitutional	right	to  equality   of  status   and	  of
opportunity and economic and social justice. Several bridges
have to	 be erected  so that  they may	cross  the  Rubicon.
Professional education	and employment	under the  State are
thought to  be two such bridges. Hence the special provision
for advancement	 and for  reservation under  Arts. 15(4) and
16(4) of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_106">     Before we	attempt to  lay down  any guidelines for the
benefit of  the Commission  proposed to	 be appointed by the
Karnataka Government, will do well to warn ourselves and the
proposed Commission against the pitfalls of the traditional'
approach towards  the question	of reservation for Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled  Tribes and  other backward  classes which
has  generally	 been  superior,   elitist  and,  therefore,
ambivalent.  A	 duty  to   undo  an  evil  which  had	been
perpetrated through the generations is thought 'to betoken a
generosity and	farsightedness that are rare among nations'.
So a  superior and  patronising	 attitude  is  adopted.	 The
result is  that	 the  claim  of	 the  Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes to equality as a
matter of  human and  constitutional right  is forgotten and
their rights  are submerged  in what  is  described  as	 the
'proferential  principle'  or  'protective  or	compensatory
discrimination',   expression	 borrowed   from    American
jurisprudence  Unless	we  get	  rid  of   these  superior,
patronising and	 paternalist attitudes, what the French Call
Le  mentalite	hierarchique,  it   is	difficult  to  truly
appreciate  the	 problems  involved  in	 the  claim  of	 the
Scheduled  Castes,   Scheduled	Tribes	and  other  backward
classes for  their legitimate  share of the benefits arising
out of their belonging to humanity and to a country
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">394</span>
whose constitution  preaches justice,  social, economic	 and
political  and equality of status and opportunity for all.
</p><p id="p_107">     One of the results of the superior, elitist approach is
that the question of reservation is invariably viewed as the
conflict  between   the	  meritarian   principle   and	 the
compensatory principle.	 No, it is not so. The real conflict
is between  the class  of people,  who have never been in or
who have  already  moved  out  of  the	desert	of  poverty,
illiteracy and	backwardness and are entrenched in the oasis
of convenient  living and  those who are still in the desert
and want  to reach  the oasis.	There is not enough fruit in
the garden  and so  those who are in, want to keep out those
who are	 out. The  disastrous consequences  of the so-called
meritarian principle  to the  vast majority  of	 the  under-
nourished, povetity-stricken, barely literate and vulnerable
people of our country are too obvious to be stated And, what
is merit  ? There is no merit in a system which brings about
such consequences.  Is not  a child of the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes  or other  backward classes  who  has	been
brought up  in an atmosphere of penury, illiteracy and anti-
culture, who  is looked	 down upon by tradition and society,
who has	 no books and magazines to read at home, no radio to
listen, no  T.V. to  watch, no one to help him with his home
work, who  goes	 to  the  nearest  local  board	 school	 and
college, whose	parents are either illiterate or so ignorant
and informed  that he  cannot even hope to seek their advice
on any	matter of  importance, a  child	 who  must  perforce
trudge	to  the	 nearest  public  reading  room	 to  read  a
newspaper to  know what	 is happening  in the world, has not
this child  got merit  if he,  with all his disadvantages is
able to	 secure the  qualifying 40% or 50% of the marks at a
competitive examination	 where the  children  of  the  upper
classes who  have all  the advantages,	who go to St. Paul's
High School  and St. Stephen's College, and who have perhaps
been specially coached for the examination may secure 70, 80
or even	 90% of the marks? Surely, a child who has been able
to jump	 so many  hurdles may  be expected  to do better and
better as  he progresses in life. If spring flower he cannot
be, autumn  flower he may be. Why than, should he be stopped
at the	threshold on  an alleged  meritarian principle?	 The
requirements of	 efficiency may always be safeguarded by the
prescription of	 minimum standards.  Mediocrity	 has  always
triumphed in  the past in the case of the upper classes. But
why should the so-called meritarian principle be put against
mediocrity when	 we  come  to  Scheduled  Castes,  Scheduled
Tribes and backward classes?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">395</span>
<p id="p_108">     Efficiency is  very much  on the lips of the privileged
whenever reservation  is mentioned.  Efficiency,  it  seems,
will be	 impaired if  the   total reservation exceeds 50 per
cent; efficiency,  it  seems,  will  suffer  if	 the  'carry
forward' rule  is adopted;  efficiency, it  seems,  will  be
injured	 if   the  rule	  of  reservation   is	extended  to
promotional posts.  from the  protests	against	 reservation
exceeding 50  per cent or extending to promotional posts and
against the  carry-forward rule,  one would  think that	 the
civil service  is a  Heavenly Paradise	into which  only the
archangels, the chosen of the elite, the very best may enter
and may be allowed to go higher up the ladder. But the truth
is otherwise.  The truth  is that  the civil  service is  no
paradise and  the upper	 echelons belonging  to	 the  chosen
classes	 are  not  necessarily	models	of  efficiency.	 The
underlying assumption  that those  belonging  to  the  upper
castes and  classes, who  are appointed	 to the non-reserved
castes will,  because of  their presumed  merit, 'naturally'
perform better	 than  those who  have been appointed to the
reserved posts	and that the clear stream of efficiency will
be polluted  by the  infiltration of  the  latter  into	 the
sacred precincts  is a	vicious assumption,  typical of	 the
superior approach  of the  elitist classes. There is neither
statistical basis  nor	expert	evidence  to  support  these
assumptions that  efficiency will necessarily be impaired if
reservation exceeds  50 per  cent, if reservation is carried
forward or  if reservation is extended to promotional posts.
Arguments are  advanced and  opinions are expressed entirely
on an  ad hoc  presumptive basis. The age long contempt with
which the  'superior' or  'forward' castes  have treated the
'inferior' or  'backward'  casts  is  now  transforming	 and
crystalising itself  into an unfair prejudice, conscious and
sub-conscious, ever  since the	'inferior' casts and classes
started claiming  their legitimate  share of the cake, which
naturally means,  for the  'superior' castes  parting with a
bit  of	 it.  Although	in  actual  practice  their  virtual
monopoly  on   elite  occupations   and	 posts	 is   hardly
threatened, the forward castes are nevertheless increasingly
afraid that  they might	 lose this  monopoly in	 the  higher
ranks of  Government service  and the  profession. It  is so
difficult for  the 'superior'  castes to understand and rise
above their  prejudice	and  it	 is  so	 difficult  for	 the
inferior castes and classes to overcome the bitter prejudice
and opposition which they are forced to face at every stage.
Always one  hears the word efficiency as if it is sacrosanct
and the	 sanctorum has	to be fiercely guarded. 'Efficiency'
is not	a mantra  which is  whispered by  the  Guru  in	 the
Sishya's  ear.	The  mere  securing  of	 high  marks  at  an
examination may not necessarily mark out a good
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">396</span>
administrator. An  efficient administrator,  one  takes	 it,
must be	 one A	who  possesses	among  other  qualities	 the
capacity to  understand with  sympathy	and,  therefore,  to
tackle bravely the problems of a large segment of populating
constituting the  weaker sections  of the  people. And,	 who
better than  the ones  belonging to those very sections? Why
not ask	 ourselves why	35  years  after  independence,	 the
position of  the Scheduled  Castes,  etc.  has	not  greatly
improved? Is  it not  a legitimate  question to	 ask whether
things	might	have  been   different,	 had   the  District
Administrators and  the State  and Central  Bureaucrats been
drawn in  larger numbers  from these classes? Courts are not
equipped to  answer these  questions, but the courts may not
interfere with	the honest  endeavours of  the Government to
find answers  and solutions.  We do  not mean  to  say	that
efficiency in the civil service is necessary or that it is a
myth. All  that we  mean to  say is that one need not make a
fastidious fetish  of it.  It may be that for certain posts,
only the  best may be appointed and for certain courses ! of
study only the best may be admitted [f so, rules may provide
for reservations  for appointment  to  such  posts  and	 for
admission to  such courses.  The rules	may provide  for  no
appropriate method  of selection.  It may  be  that  certain
posts require  a very high degree of skill or efficiency and
certain courses	 of study  require a high degree of industry
and intelligence.  If so,  the rules  may prescribe  a	high
minimum qualifying  standard and  an appropriate  method  of
selection. Different  minimum standards	 and different modes
of selection  may be  prescribed for different posts and for
admission to different courses of study having regard to the
requirements of	 the posts  and the courses of study. No one
will suggest  that the	degree t  of efficiency	 required  a
cardiac or  a neuro-surgeon  is the  same as  the degree  of
efficiency  required  of  a  general  medical  practitioner.
Similarly no  will suggest  that the  degree of industry and
intelligence expected  of a candidate seeking admission to a
research degree	 course need  be  the  same  as	 that  of  a
candidate seeking  admission  to  an  ordinary	arts  degree
course. We do not, therefore, mean to say that efficiency is
to be altogether discounted. All that we mean to say is that
it cannot  be permitted	 to be	used as	 a camouflage to let
that upper classes take advantage of the backward classes in
its name  and to  monopolise the  services, particularly the
higher posts  and  the	professional  institutions.  We	 are
afraid we  have to  rid our  minds of many cobwebs before we
arrive at the core of the problem. The quest for equality is
self elusive,  we must	lose our  illusions, though  not our
faith. It  is the  dignity of  man to  pursue the  quest for
equality. It  will be advantageous to quote at this juncture
R.H. Tawney in his classic work equality where he says.

<p id="p_109">     But the  controversy between  the	meritarian  and	 the

guaranteed to  all citizens  under our	Constitution is	 the
right of  the weaker  sections	of  the	 people	 to  special

realities  of	the  situation.	  and  least  there  by	 any
misapprehension, the  Constitution has taken particular care
to specially  mention this  right of  the weaker sections of
the people  in Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution. In
view of	 Arts. 15(4)  and 16(4)	 the  so-called	 controversy
between the meritarian and compensatory principles is not of
any great significance, though, of course, we do not suggest
efficiency should be sacrificed. The question really is, who
are the	 scheduled castes,  scheduled  tribes  and  backward
classes,  who	are  entitled	to  special   provision	 and
reservation  in	  regard  to   admission  into	 educational
institutions and  representation in  the services. So far as
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes are  concerned,	 the
question of  their identification  stands  resolved  by	 the
notifications issued  by the President under Part XVI of the
Constitution.  The   problem  is   only	 in  regard  to	 the
identification	of  the	 other	socially  and  educationally
backward classes.  The question	 really is  how to  identify
these backward	classes to entitle them to entry through the
doors of  Arts. 15(4)  and 16(4). And, the further question,
naturally, is about the limits of reservation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">398</span>
<p id="p_110">     We are  afraid the	 courts are not necessarily the most
competent to  identify the  backward classes  or to lay down
guidelines for their identification except in broad and very
general way.  We are not equipped for that; we have no legal
barometers to  measure social  backwardness.  We  are  truly
removed from  the people, particularly those of the backward
classes, by  layer upon	 layer of gradation and degradation.
And, India  is such a vast country that conditions vary from
State to  State, region	 to region, district to district and
from one  ethnic religious,  linguistic or  caste  group  to
another. A  test to  identify  backward	 classes  which	 may
appear appropriate  when applied  to one group of people may
be wholly  inappropriate  and  unreasonable  if	 applied  to
another group  of people.  There can  be no  universal test;
there can  be no  exclusive test; there can be no conclusive
test. In  fact, it  may be  futile to apply any rigid tests.

the richer  classes, the  poorer classes,  the upper  middle
class, the  lower middle  classes,  the	 ruling	 class,	 the
privileged class,  the working class, the exploited classes,
etc. etc.  In what  senses the	word 'classes'	used in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_171">Art.
15(4)</a> and  in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_172">Art.  16(4)</a> of  the Constitution?	 What is the

have  a	  clear	 understanding	 of   what   is	  meant	  by
'backwardness',	 'backward   classes'  and   'socially	 and
educationally backward	classes', we  must have	 an idea  of
what social  inequality is about. Max Weber gives us a three
dimensional  picture  of  social  inequality.  According  to
Weber, the  three dimensions  are class, status and power. A
person's class-situation,  in the  Weber sense,	 is what  he
shares with  others, similarly	placed	in  the	 process  of
production, distribution and exchange, a definition of class
which is  very near  to that  of the  Marxist conception The
inequality of  class  depends  primarily  on  inequality  of
income and to some extent on an equal opportunity for upward
mobility.   persons class, according this definition, is his
shared situation  in the  economic  hierarchy.	Status,	 the
second of  Weber's three  dimensions is generally determined
by the	style of  consumption, though not necessarily by the
source or  amount of  income. An  impoverised aristocrat  is
sometimes sought  after by  the nouveau riche. A desk worker
considers  himself   superior  to   a	manual	 worker.   A
professional like  a doctor  or a lawyer is thought to be of
superior status	 than those belonging to several other walks
of life. Status seems to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">399</span>
depend on  social attributes  and styless of life, including
dress, speech,	I occupation,  etc.,  on  what	R.H.  Tawney
describes as 'the tedious A vulgarities of income and social
position.'   Similarly,	   class   and	  status   are	 not
contemporeaneous with  power, though  power  and  class	 can
often be sen to be closely connected. Power is participation
in the decision making process but those who wield power are
not necessarily	  the best paid nor the most respected. But,
it is now obvious even to the most superficial observer that
social and  political power is wielded in innumerable unseen
ways by those who control economic power. Political power is
remorselessly manipulated  by economic power. We, therefore,
see that  everyone of  the three  dimensions  propounded  by
Weber is intimately and inextricably connected with economic
position.   However,	we   look   at	 the   question	  of
'backwardness', whether	 from the  angle of class, status or
power, we  find the  economic factor at the bottom of it all
and we	find poverty,  the culprit-cause  and  the  dominant
characteristic	Poverty,  the  economic	 factor	 brands	 all
backwardness  just   as	 the   erect  posture	brands	 the
homosapiens and distinguishes him from all other animals, in
the  eyes of the beholder from Mars. But, whether his racial
stock  is   Caucasian,	Mongoloid,  Negroid,  etc.,  further
investigation will  have to  be made.  So  too	the  further
question of  social and	 educational  backwardness  requires
further	 scrutiny.   In	 India,	  the  matter	is   further
aggravated, complicated	 and pitilessly	 tyrannised  by	 the
ubiquitous caste  system, a unique and devastating system of
gradation and  degradation  which  has	divided	 the  entire
Indian and particularly Hindu society horizontally into such
distinct layers as to be v destructive of mobility, a system
which has  penetrated and  corrupted the  mind and  soul  of
every Indian  citizen. It  is a notorious fact that there is
an upper  crust of  rural society consisting of the superior
castes,	 generally   the  priestla,  the  landlord  and	 the
merchant castes,  there is a bottom strata consisting of the
'out-castes' of	 Indian Rural  Society, namely the Scheduled
Castes, and,  in between  the highest  and the lowest, there
are large  segments of	population who	because of  the	 law
gradation of  The caste	 to which  they belong	in the rural
society hierarchy,  because of	the humble  occupation which
they pursue  , because	of their  poverty and  ignorance are
also condemned	to  backwardness,  social  and	educational,
backwardness which  prevents them  from competing  on  equal
terms to catch up with the upper crust
     Any view of the caste system, class or cursory, will at
once reveal  the firm  links which the caste system has with
economic power.	 Land  and  learning,  two  of	the  primary
sources of economic power in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">400</span>
India have  till recently  been the monopoly of the superior
castes. Occupational  skills were  practised by	 the  middle
castes and  in the  economic system prevailing till now they
could  rank   in  the	system	next   only  to	 the  castes
constituting the  landed and  the learned gentry. The lowest
in the	hierarchy where	 those who were assigned the meanest
task, the  out-castes who  wielded no  economic	 power.	 The
position of  a caste in rural society is more often than not
mirroned in the economic power wielded by it and vice versa.
Social	hierarchy   and	  economic   position	exhibit	  an
undisputable mutuality.	 The lower the caste, the poorer its
members. The  poorer the members of a caste lower the caste.
Caste and  economic situation, reflecting each other as they
do are the Deus ex-Machina of the social status occupied and
the economic  power wielded  by an  individual or  class  in
rural society. Social status and economic power are so woven
and fused into the caste system in Indian rural society that
one may	 without hesitation,  say that	if  poverty  be	 the
cause, caste is the primary index of social backwardness, so
that social  backwardness is often readily identifiable with
reference to  a person's  caste. Such  we must recognised is
the primeval  force and	 omnipresence  of  caste  in  Indian
Society, however, much we may like to wish it away. So Sadly
and oppressively deep-rooted is caste in our country that it
has out	 across even  the barriers  of religion.  The  caste
system has  penetrated other religious and dissentient Hindu
sects to  whom the  practice of caste should be anathema and
today we  find that  practitioner of  other religious faiths
and Hindu  dissentients are some times as rigid adherents to
the system  of caste  as the  conservative Hindus.  We	find
Christian  harijans,  Christian	 Madars,  Christian  Reddys,
Christian Kammas,  Mujbi Sikhs,	 etc. etc. In Andhra Pradesh
there is  a community  known as Pinjaras or Dudekulas (known
in the	North as  'Rui Pinjane	Wala'): Professional cotton-
beaters) who  are really  Muslims, but	are trated  in rural
society, for  all practical  purposes,	as  a  Hindu.  caste
Several other instances may be given.
</p><p id="p_112">     Shared  situation	in  the	 economic  hierarchy,  caste
gradation, occupation,	habitation,  style  of	consumption,

refer to the relevant Constitutional provisions. Part XVI of
the Constitution  concerns itself  with "Special  provisions

speaks of  'provision for the reservation of appointments or

the opinion  of the  State is  not adequately represented in

socially and  educationally backward classes of citizens and
the Scheduled  Castes and  the Scheduled  Tribes  from	whom
special provision  for advancement  is contemplated  by Art-
15(4) are distinct and separate from the backward classes of

for the	 purposes of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_201">Art. 16(4)</a> it is further necessary that
the Backward classes should not be adequate in the services.
Again,	and   quite  obviously,	  'special   provision	 for
advancement' is	 a wide expression and may include many more
things besides	'mere reservation  of seats in colleges.' It
may  be	 by  way  of  financial	 assistance,  free  medical,
educational  and   hostel  facilities,	 scholarships,	free
transport, concessional	 or  free  housing,  exemption	from
requirements insisted  upon in the case of other classes al-
so on.	We are	not, for the time being, concerned with	 the
mode  advancement,   other  than  reservation  of  seats  in
college, we observe that under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_202">Art. 16(4</a>), reservation is to
be made	 to benefit  those  backward  classes,	who  in	 the
opinion of the Government are not adequately represented, in
the services.  Reservation  must,  therefore,  be  aimed  at
securing adequate  representation. It  must follow  that the
extent	of   reservation  must	 match	the   inadequacy  of
representation.	 There	is  no	reason	why  this  guideline
furnished by  the Constitution	itself should  not  also  be
adopted for the purposes Or <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_203">Art. 15(4)</a> too. For example, the
extent of  reservation of seats in professional colleges may
conveniently be	 determined with reference to the inadequacy
of representation  in the various profession. Similarly, the
extent of  reservation in  other colleges  may be determined
with reference to the inadequacy in the number of graduates,
etc. Naturally,	 if the	 lost ground  is to  be gained.	 the
extent of  reservation may  even have  to be slightly higher
than the percentage of population of the backward classes.

Constitution and  every time when an order is passed in that
behalf,	 its   validity	 has   been   challenged   by	writ
proceedings. Four previous orders passed in that behalf were
challenged by writ proceedings taken against the State under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_205">Art. 226".</a>  Balaji was	concerned with	the question  of the
validity of  the reservation  made under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_206">Art. 15(4)</a>  of the
Constitution in	 regard to admission to the medical colleges
of the Mysore and Karnataka Universities. 28 per cent of the
seats were  reserved  for  Backward  Classes  so-called,  20
percent for more Backward classes, 15 per cent for Scheduled
Castes and  3 per  cent for Scheduled Tribes, making a total
of 68  per cent	 of the	 seats available  for  the  reserved
category only  and 32  per cent	 for the  general  category,
described in  the judgment  as "merit pool". The reservation
was generally  made on	the basis of the report of the Nagan
Gowda Committee appointed by the State Government. The court
found  that   the  Committee   approached  the	 problem  of
enumerating and classifying these socially and educationally
backward communities  on the  basis that social backwardness
depended substantially	on the	caste to which the community
belonged, though  it recognised	 that economic condition may
be a  contributing  factor.  according	to  the	 court,	 the
Committee virtually  equated  'classes'	 with  castes'.	 The
court observed	that in	 dealing with  the  question  as  to
whether any class of citizens were socially backward or not,
it might not be irrelevant to consider the caste of the said
citizens  but	the  importance	  of  caste  should  not  be
exaggerated. rt	 was observed  that caste  could not be made
the  sole   or	dominant   test	 to  determine-	 the  social
backwardness of	 group or  classes of citizens. It was noted
that social  backwardness was  in the  ultimate analysis the
result of  poverty, to	a very	large extent.  It  was	also
noticed	 that	the  occupation	  of  citizens	 might	also
contribute   to	   make	  classes   of	 citizens   socially
backwardness. As  the Nagam  Gowda Committee had adopted the
caste test  as the  predominant test,  if not the sole test,
without regard	to the	other factor- which were undoubtedly
relevant, the  court expressed	the vice  the classification
made by	 the Committee	of socially backward communities was
invalid. In  passing, at one place, it was remarked that the
Backward Classes  of citizens for whom special provision was
authorised to be made, were treated by <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_207">Art. 15(4)</a> itself, as
being similar  to the  Scheduled Castes	 and Tribes.  It was
observed that  the Backward  Classes were  in the matters of
their  backwardness   comparable  to  Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Tribes. Based on these observations and the juxta
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">406</span>
position of  the  expressions  Scheduled  Castes,  Scheduled
Tribes and  A socially and educationally backward classes in
<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_208">Art. 15</a>	 and <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_209">Art.  338</a>, it  was	 suggested  by	the  learned
counsel	 for  the  petitioner  that  the  socially  backward
classes of  people were	 those whose  status and standard of
living was  very much  the same	 as those  of the  Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled Tribes.  We do  not think	 that  these
observations were meant to lay down any proposition that the
socially Backward  Classes were	 those	classes	 of  people,
whose conditions  of life were very nearly the same as those
of the	Scheduled Castes and Tribes. We say so first because
of the	inappropriateness of  applying the ordinary rules of
statutory  interpretations   to	  interpret   constitutional
instruments which  are sui  generies  and  which  deal	with
situations of significance and consequence. It is not enough
to exhibit  a Marshallian awareness that we are expounding a
Constitution; we must also remember that we are expounding a
Constitution born  in the  mid-twentieth century,  but of an
anti-imperialist  struggle,   influenced  by  Constitutional
instruments, events  and revolutions elsewhere, in search of
a better world, and winded to the idea of justice,
 economic,  social and political to all. such a Constitution
must be	 given a  generous interpretation  so as to give all
its citizens the full measure of justice promised by it. The
expositors of  the Constitution	 are to	 concern  themselves
less with  mere words and arrangement of words than with the
philosophy and	the prevading  'spirit	and  sense'  of	 the
Constitution, so elaborately exposed for our guidance in the
Directive Principles of State Policy and other provisions of
the Constitution.  Now, anyone	acquainted  with  the  rural
scene in India would at once recognise the position that the
Scheduled Castes  occupy a  peculiarly degraded position and
are treated,  not  as  persons	of  caste  at  all,  but  as
outcastes. Even	 the other  admittedly backward classes shun
them and  treat them  as inferior  beings. It was because of
the special  degradation to  which they	 had been  subjected
that the  Constitution itself  had to  come forward  to make
special provision  for them. There is no point in attempting
to determine  the social  backwardness of  other classes  by
applying the test of nearness to the conditions of existence
of the	Scheduled Castes.  Such	 a  test  would	 practically
nullify the  provision	for  reservation  for  socially	 and
educationally Backward	Classes other  than Scheduled Castes
and Tribes.  Such a  test would	 perpetuate the dominance of
the existing  upper  classes.  Such  a	test  would  take  a
substantial majority  of the   classes	who are	 between the
upper classes and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes out of the
category of  backward classes  and put	them at	 a permanent
disadvantage. Only  the 'enlightened'  classes of  body will
capture all  the 'open'	 posts and  seats and  the  reserved
posts and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">407</span>
seats will  go to  the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and those
very near the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. The bulk of those
behind the   'enlightened'  classes and	 ahead of  the	near
Scheduled Castes and Tribes would be left high and dry, with
never a chance of imposing themselves .
</p><p id="p_124">     Earlier we	 mentioned that	 poverty was regarded by the
Court as the prime cause of social backwardness. It was said
at  page  460,	"Social	 backwardness  is  on  the  ultimate
analysis the  result of poverty, to a very large extent. The
classes of  citizens who  are deplorably  poor automatically
become socially	 backward. They	 do not	 enjoy a  status  in
society and  have,  therefore,	to  be	content	 to  take  a
backward seat.	It is  true that  social backwardness  which
results	 from	poverty	 is   likely  to  be  aggravated  by
considerations of  caste to  which  the	 poor  citizens	 may
belong, but  that only shows the relevance of both caste and
poverty in  determining the  backwardness of  citizens".  We
only add  that there  is an  overpowering mutuality  between
poverty and  caste on  the Indian scene. Again, referring to
some scheme  formulated by  the Maharashtra  Government	 for
financial assistance  the Court	 observed, "However,  we may
observe that  if any  State adopts  such a  measure, it	 may
afford relief  to and assist the advancement of the Backward
Classes	 in  the  State,  because  backwardness	 social	 and
educational,  in   ultimately  and   primarily	duties	 for
proverty". Recognising	poverty as  the true  source of	 the
evil of	 social and  economic backwardness  and caste  as  a
relevant factor	 in determining backwardness, the Court also
noticed occupation  and habitation  as two  other  important
contributing factors  and finally  stressed the	 need for  a
penetrating investigation. It was said,
	  "The occupations  of citizens	 may also contribute
     to make  classes of  citizens socially  backward. There
     are some  occupations which  are  treated	as  inferior
     according	to   conventional  beliefs  and	 classes  of
     citizens who follow these occupations are apt to become
     socially backward.	 The place  of habitation also plays
     not a  minor part	in determining the backwardness of a
     community of persons. In a sense, the problem of social
     backwardness is  the problem of Rural India and in that
     behalf,  classes	of  citizens  occupying	 a  socially
     backward position in rural area fall within the purview
     of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_210">Art.  15(4).</a> The  problem of  deter mining  who	 are
     socially backward	classes is undoubtedly very complex.
     Sociological, social  and economic	 considerations come
     into play in solving the problem and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">408</span>
     evolving proper  criteria for determining which classes
     are A  socially backward  is obviously a very difficult
     task. It  will  need  an  elaborate  investigation	 and
     collection of  data and  examining the  said data	in a
     rational and scientific way".
</p><p id="p_125">     The  Balaji   Court  then	proceeded  to  consider	 the
question  of   educational  backwardness.  The	Nagan  Gowda
Committee had  dealt with  the question	 on the basis of the
average of  the student	 population in	the last  three High
school classes	of all High Schools in the State in relation
to a  thousand citizens of that community. The Committee was
of the	view that all castes whose average was less than the
State average should be regarded as Backward communities and
those whose  average was  less than 50 per cent of the State
average should	be regarded as More Backward. The Court took
the view  that the  adoption of	 the test  of the last three
High School  classes might  be a little high. but even if it
was  not   considered  high,  it  was  not  right  to  treat
communities which  were just  below the	 State	 average  as
backward. There can be divergence of views on this question.
Where the State average itself is abysmally low, there is no
reason why  classes of	people whose  average  was  slightly
above, or very near, or just below the State average, should
be excluded  from the list of Backward Classes. The adoption
of the State average or the 50 per cent of the State average
test might  lead to  quite arbitrary results and This surely
cannot be  a matter  in which the court should try to impose
its views.
</p><p id="p_126">     In fact while observing: "if the test has to be applied
by a  reference to  the State average of student population,
the legitimate	view to	 take would  be that  the classes of
citizens, whose	 average is  well or substantially below the
State average,	can be	treated as  educationally backward,"
the court  also observed,  ' On	 this point  again we do not
propose to  lay down  any hard	and fast rule; it is for the
State to consider the matter and decide in a manner which is
consistent with the requirements of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_211">Art. 15(4)".</a>
</p><p id="p_127">     It	 was   also  observed	in  Balaji   that  the	sub-
classification	made   by  the	 reservation  order  between
Backward Classes  and More  Back ward Classes did not appear
to be  justified under	<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_212">Art. 15(4)</a>  as it  appeared to	be a
measure devised	 to benefit  all the classes of citizens who
were less  advanced when  compared with	 the  most  advanced
classes in  the State,	and that  was not  the scope of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_213">Art.
15(4).</a> A result of the sub-classification was that nearly 90
per cent of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">409</span>
population  of	the  State  was	 treated  as  backward.	 The
propriety of  such a  course may  be open to question on the
facts of  each case,  but A  we do  not see why on principle
there cannot  be :3 classification into Backward Classes and
More Backward  Classes, if  both Classes  are not  merely  a
little behind,	but far far behind the most advanced classes
In fact such a classification would be necessary to help the
More Backward  Classes;	 otherwise  those  of  the  Backward
Classes who  might be  a little	 more advanced than the More
Backward Classes  might walk  away with	 all the seats, just
as, if reservation was confined to the More Backward Classes
and no	reservation was	 made to  the slightly more advanced
Backward Classes  the most  advanced Classes would walk away
with all  the  seats  available	 for  the  general  category
leaving none  for the  Backward Classes. All that we can say
is that	 sub-classification may	 be permissible if there are
classes of people who are definitely far behind the advanced
classes but ahead of the very backward classes.
</p><p id="p_128">     One may  say the  same thing  about the adoption of the
average of  the student	 population in	the last  three High
School Classes	of all High Schools in the State in relation
to a  thousand citizens	 of that  community as the basis for
assessing relative  Backwardness. Balaji  thought it  was  a
little high  but surely	 other views  are possible.  In fact
considering the	 wide spread  of elementary  education,	 one
would think  the basis	should be  pushed up  higher. Having
regard to  the availability  of elementary  schools in rural
areas, more and more boys of the backward Classes may become
literate.  But	 it  is	 a  long  way  from  ceasing  to  be
educationally backward.	 As one goes up class by class it as
a notorious  fact that	there are  more 'drop-outs' from the
boys of	 the backward  classes than  from  the	boy  of	 the
forward classes.  The adoption	of a  lower basis  to assess
educational backwardness  may give  a wholly  false picture.
After all,  if one  is considering the question of admission
to professional	 colleges or  of appointment  to posts,	 the
basis possibly	should be  the average number of students of
that community who have passed the examination prescribed as
the minimum  qualification  for	 admission  to	professional
colleges, say  in the  last three  years,  and	perhaps	 the
average	 number	 of  persons  of  that	community  who	have
graduated is  the last	three  years,  since  graduation  is
generally the minimum qualification for most posts possibly,
the extent  of reservation  may even  vary with reference to
the class  of post.  This is  a	 matter	 for  evaluation  by
experts.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">410</span>
<p id="p_129">     The Balaji	 Court then  considered the  question of the
extent of   the	 special provision  which the State would be
competent to  make under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_214">Art. 15(4).</a> Here the Court brought
in the so-called meritarian principle and thought that large
reservation  would  inevitably	affect	efficiency.  We	 may
perhaps, mention  here what  a noted sociologist had to say:
"So  the   leading  anti-reservationists  by  hand  to	find
nationalizations for  their campaigns. A favourite one is to
conjure up  the image of a phoney juxtaposition; on one side
is 'merit'  shown up  by candidates on the open list, on the
other side  is 'incompetence',	represented b  those on	 the
reserved list Hence-so the argument runs-if reservations are
maintained, standards  in the  medical	professions  (or  in
other professions  and	senior	Government  posts)  will  be
deleted. Indeed	 (it is	 claimed) there is serious risk that
patients will  die if they are treated by (backward' doctors
who have reached their positions through reservations. (Such
allegations  are   constantly  repeated	 although  they	 are
patently false;	 in the final at the postgraduate level, the
minimum qualifying  marks are  identical for all candidates,
irrespective of their origin.)"(') We should think that is a
matter for  experts in	management and administration. There
might be  posts or technical courses for which only the best
can be	admitted and  others might  be posts  and  technical
courses for  which minimum  qualification would	 also serve.
The percentage	of reservations is not a matter upon which a
court may  pronounce with no 1 material at hand. For a court
to say	that reservations  should not exceed 40 per cent, 50
per cent  or  60  per  cent,  would  be	 arbitrary  and	 the
Constitution does  not, permit us to be arbitrary. Though in
the Balaji  case, the  court thought that generally and in a
broad way  a special  provision should	be less	 than 50 per
cent, and  how much  less than 50 per cent would depend upon
the relevant  prevailing circumstances	in  each  case,	 the
court confessed.  "In this matter again, we are reluctant to
say definitely	what would  be a  proper provision to make."
All that  the court  would  finally  say  was  that  in	 the
circumstances of  the case  before them, a reservation of 68
per  cent   was	 inconsistent	with  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_215">Art.   15(4)</a>  of	 the
Constitution. We  are	 not  prepared	to  read  Balaji  as
arbitrarily   laying down  50 per cent as the outer limit of
reservation. What  precisely was  decided by Balaji has been
summed up  by the  Court itself at page 471 of the S.C.R. in
the following words:
</p><p id="p_130">(1)  Ruth  Glass:  Divided  and	 degraded:  the	 downtrodden

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">411</span>
<p id="p_131">	 "We have already noticed that the impugned order in
the present case has categorised the Backward Classes on the
sole basis  of	caste  A  which,  in  our  opinion,  is	 not
permitted by  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_216">Art. 15(4):</a>  and we  have also  held that	 the

plainly	 inconsistent	with  the  concept  of	the  special

that the  impugned order  is a	fraud on  the Constitutional

</p><p id="p_132">     We must  repeat here,  what we  have said earlier, that
there is  no scientific	 statistical  data  or	evidence  of
expert administrators who have made any study of the problem
to support  the opinion	 that reservation  in excess  Or 5()
percent may  impair efficiency.	 It is	a rule	of thumb and
rules of  the thumb  are not for judges to lay down to solve
complicated  sociological   and	  administrative   problems.
Sometimes,  it	 is  obliquely	 suggested  that   excessive
reservation is	indulged in  as a  mere votecatching device.
Perhaps so,  perhaps not.  One can  only say  'out  of	evil
cometh good'  and quicker  the redemption  of the  oppressed
classes, so much the better for the nation. Our observations
are not	 intended to  show the	door to	 genuine efficiency.
Efficiency must	 be a guiding factor but not a smokes-cream.
All that  a Court  may legitimately  say is that reservation
may h  not be excessive. It may not be so excessive as to be
oppressive; it	may not be so high as to lead to a necessary
presumption of unfair exclusion of everyone else.

Court	upheld	 that	classification	 of   socially	 and
educationally backward classes made on the basis of economic
condition  and	 occupation,  without  reference  to  caste.
According to the Government order, a family whose income was
Rs. 1200  per annum or less and persons or classes following
occupations of agriculture petty business, inferior services
crafts or other occupations involving manual labour, were in
general, socially and educationally backward. The Government
listed the  following occupations  as contributing to social
backwardness;  (1)  actual  cultivators;  (2)  artisan;	 (3)
inferior services  (i.e. Class IV in Government Services and
corresponding  class   or  service  in	private	 employment)
including  casual  labour;  and	 (4)  any  other  occupation
involving manual  labour. Th  is criteria was adopted by the
Government as  a temporary  measure pending further detailed
study. The  order did  not  take  into	consideration  as  a
criterion  for	backwardness  the  caste  of  an  applicant.
Relying heavily on Balaji,
(1) [1964] 6 S.C.R.368.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">412</span>
<p id="p_134">the Mysore  High Court	held that  the scheme adopted by the
Government  was	 most  imperfect  as  in  their	 opinion  in
addition to  the occupation  and poverty  tests,  the  study
should	have   adopted	the   caste  test  as  well  as	 the
"residence" test  in  making  the  classification.  It	also
observed that  the decision in the Balaji case said that the
caste basis  was undoubtedly  a relevant,  nay an  important
basis in  deter mining the classes of backward Hindus but it
should not  be made  the sole basis. Subba Rao, J., speaking
for this  Court, explained  how the  Mysore High  Court	 had
misunderstood Balaji and observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "While this  Court  said  that  caste	 is  only  a
     relevant  circumstance   and  that	 it  cannot  be	 the
     dominant test  in ascertaining  the backwardness  of  a
     class of  citizens, the  High Court  said that it is an
     important basis  in determining  the class	 of backward
     Hindus and	 that the  Government  should  have  adopted
     caste as one of the test. As the said observations made
     by the  High Court	 may lead  to some  confusion in the
     mind of  the authority  concerned who  may be entrusted
     with the duty of prescribing the rules for ascertaining
     the backwardness  of classes  of  citizens	 within	 the
     meaning of	 <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_220">Art. 15(4)</a>  of the  Constitution, we  would
     hasten to	make it	 clear that caste is only a relevant
     circumstance in  ascertaining  the	 backwardness  of  a
     class and	there is  nothing in  the judgment  of	this
     Court which  precludes  the  authority  concerned	from
     determining the  social  backwardness  of	a  group  of
     citizens if  it can  do so	 without reference to caste.
     While  this   Court  has	not  included	caste	from
     ascertaining the  backwardness of	a class of citizens,
     it has  not made it one of the compelling circumstances
     affording a  basis for the ascertaining of backwardness
     of a  class. To  put it  differently, the	au-  thority
     concerned	may   take  caste   into  consideration	  in
     ascertaining the  backwardness of	a group	 of persons;
     but, if  it does not, its order will not be bad on that
     account, if  it can  ascertain the	 backwardness  of  a
     group  of	 person	 on  the  basis	 of  other  relevant
     criteria."
</blockquote><p id="p_135">Later he further proceeded to explain:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "This interpretation	will carry out the intention
     of the Constitution expressed in the aforesaid Article.
     It	 helps	 the  really  backward	classes	 instead  of
     promoting the  interests of  individuals or groups who,
     though they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">413</span>
     belong to	a particular  caste a  majority where  of si
     socially and educationally backward, really belong to a
     class A  which is	socially and educationally advanced.
     To illust	rate, take  a caste  in	 a  State  which  is
     numerically the  largest therein. It may be that though
     a majority of the people in that caste are socially and
     educationally backward,  an effective  minority may  be
     socially and  edu- cationally  for more  advanced	than
     another small  sub-caste the  total number	 of which is
     far less  than the	 said minority.	 If we interpret the
     expression "Classes"  as "caster  ', the  object of the
     Constitution will	be frustrated  and the people who do
     not deserve  any advertitious  aid may  get it  to	 the
     exclusion of  those who  really deserve.  This  anomaly
     will not  arise if,  without equating caste with class,
     caste is  taken as	 only one  of the  considerations to
     ascertain whether	a person belongs to a backward class
     or not.  On the other hand, if the entire sub-caste, by
     and large,	 is backwardness,  it may be included in the
     Scheduled Castes by following the appropriate procedure
     laid down by the Constitution".</blockquote>
<p id="p_136">     Evidently recognising  the	 difficulty  be-setting	 any
attempt by  a Court  to lay  down  inflexible  criteria,  he
pointed out:

     though the	 caste	of  an	individual  or	a  group  of

determine who were backward classes and this was contrary to
the decision  of the  Court in Balaji. It had also been held

     educationally above  the general  average. There  is no
     gain saying  the fact that there are numerous castes in
     the  Country,  which  are	socially  and  educationally
     backward and  therefore a	suitable provision will have
     to be  made by  the State as charge in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_230">Article 15(4)</a> to

............. the  members of  an entire  caste or community

values, at  a given time be backward and may on that account
be treated as backward classes, but that is not because they
are members  of a caste of community but because they form a
class. Therefore, it is clear that there may be instances of
an  entire   caste  or	 a  community	being  socially	 and

     To conclude,  though prima	 facie the  list of Backward
     Classes  which   is  under	 attack	 before	 us  may  be
     considered to  be on  the	basis  of  caste,  a  closer
     examination  will	 clearly  show	 that  it   only   a

     occupations or professions, exhaustively referred to by
     the Commission."
</p><p id="p_147">     The Court	then proceeded	to observe that the question
before them  was whether the Backward Classes Commission had
relevant data  and material  before it	for enumerating	 the
classes of  persons to	be included  in the list of backward
classes was  a real  question and not whether the Commission
was  scientifically   accurate	in   conclusion.  The  Court
expressed  its	 satisfaction  that   there  was  sufficient
relevant material to justify the Commission's conclusion and
added:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	  "No doubt  there are	a few  instances  where	 the
     educational  average   is	slightly   above  the  State
     average, but  that circumstance by itself is not enough
     to strike	down the entire list. In fact, even there it
     is seen  that  when  the  whole  class  in	 which	that
     particular group is included, is considered the average
     works out to be less
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">418</span>
     than the State average. Even assuming there are a few A
     categories which  are a little above the State average,
     in literacy, that is a matter for the State to be taken
     note of  and review  the position of such categories of
     persons and take a suitable decision."
</blockquote><p id="p_148">Referring to  the observations	in Balaji regarding the test
of average  student population	in the last three High Court
School classes it was said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  "These observations  made by	this  Court  in	 the

     on the  basis that it is axiomatic that the educational
     average of	 the class  should not	be calculated on the
     basis of  the student population in the last three high
     school  classes  and  that	 only  those  classes  whose
     average is below the State average, that can be treated
     as	 educationally	 back  ward.  This  Court  has	only
     indicated the  broad principles to be kept in view when
     making the provision under Art. 15(4)."</blockquote>
<p id="p_149">     <a href="/doc/579569/" id="a_232">In Janki Prasad Parimoo v. State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir</a> the
Court noticed  the link	 between economic  backwardness	 and
social and educational backwardness and observed  -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  "In India,  social and educational backwardness is
     further associated with economic backwardness and it is
     observed  in  Balaji's  case  referred  to	 above	that

     and primarily due to poverty."
</blockquote><p id="p_150">Having said  this the  Court was  not prepared	to lay	down
poverty as  the exclusive  test on  the ground	that a large
proportion of  the population  in India was poverty stricken
and if	poverty was  made the  sole test  for reservation, a
resourceless situation might arise. It was said,
	  "But if  poverty is  the exclusive  test,  a	very
     large proportion  of the population in India would have
     to be  regarded as	 socially and educationally backward
     and if  reservations are  made only  on the  ground  of
     economic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">419</span>
     considerations,  an   untenable  situation	  may  arise
     because  even   in	 sectors  which	 are  recognised  as
     socially and  educationally advanced,  there are  large
     pockets of	 poverty. In this country except for a small
     percentage of  the population, the people are generally
     poor-some being more poor, others less poor. Therefore,
     when a  social investigator  tries to identify socially
     and educationally	backward classes  he may  do it with
     confidence that  they are	bound to be poor. Though the
     two wards,	 'Socially'  and  'educationally'  are	used
     cumulatively  for	 the  purpose	of  describing	 the
     backwardness class,  one may  find that if a class as a
     whole is  educationally advanced,	it is generally also
     socially advanced	because of the reformative effect of
     education on  that	 class.	 The  words  "advanced"	 and
     "backward" are  only relative terms-there being several
     layers  or	  strata  of   classes,	  hovering   between
     "advanced" and  "backward", and  the difficult  task is
     which class  can be  recognised out  of  these  several
     layers as being socially and educationally backward."
     The State	of Jammu  &amp; Kashmir had declared six classes
of citizens  as socially  and educationally  backward.	They
were (1) persons whose traditional occupation was one of the
sixty-two mentioned;  (2) persons  belonging  to  23  social
castes; (3)  small cultivators	(4) low paid pensioners; (5)
residents  in  areas  adjoining	 the  cease-fire  line;	 (6)
persons belonging  to "bad  pockets". The  court found	that
some  of  the  sixty-two  enumerated  occupations  were	 not
traditional occupations	 at all	 and that that list required
review. The  court also	 found that  19 out of the 23 castes
had been  identified by	 the  Committee	 as  suffering	from
social disabilities  and also educationally and economically
backward. In  the case	of the	remaining four castes, there
was nothing  to indicate  that they  were backward  classes.
Referring to the third category of small cultivators, it was
observed that  they could  not be  said to be 'a homogeneous
social	section	  of  the  people  with	 common	 trades	 and
identifiable by	 some common  attributes'. All that could be
said about  them was  that they cultivated or lived on land.
Similarly in  regard to the fourth category, it was observed
that they also do not belong to a homogeneous section of the
people, the  only thing	 common between them being that they
had retired  from Government service. In regard to the fifth
and  sixth   category  the   court  observed  that  lack  of
communication, inaccessibility, lack
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">420</span>
of material  resources, primitive living conditions and such
considerations	made   the  people  living  in	those  areas
socially and educationally backward.
</p><p id="p_151">     <a href="/doc/1734464/" id="a_233">In State  of Uttar	 Pradesh v.  Pradeep Tandon</a>,(1)	 the
Court recognised  poverty as  a relevant factor but observed
that it	 was not  the determining  factor  discovering	poor
socially and  educationally backward  classes. Even  so	 the
backwardness of	 the hill  and	Uttrakhand  areas  in  Uttar
Pradesh was sustained on economic basis. It was said,
	  "The Hill  and Uttrakhand  areas in  Uttar Pradesh
     are instances  of socially	 and educationally  backward
     classes of	 citizens for those reasons. Backwardness is
     judged by	economic basis	that each region has its own
     measurable possibilities  for the	maintenance of human
     numbers, standards	 of living  and fixed property. From
     an economic  point of  view the classes of citizens are
     backward  when  they  do  not  make  effective  use  of
     resources. When  large areas of land maintain a sparse,
     disorderly and  illiterate population whose property is
     small and negligible the element of social backwardness
     is observed.  When effective territorial specialisation
     is	 not   possible	 in   the  absence   Of	  means	  of
     communication and	technical processes  as in  the hill
     and Uttrakhand  areas the	people are socially backward
     classes of citizens. Neglected opportunities and people
     in remote	places raise walls of social backwardness of
     people."
</p><p id="p_152">	  "Educational	backwardness   is  ascertained	with
     reference	to   those  factors.   Where   people	have
     traditional apathy	 for education	on account of social
     and   environ   mental   conditions   or	occupational
     handicaps,	 it   is  an   illustration  of	 educational
     backwardness.  The	  hill	and   Uttrakhand  areas	 are
     inaccessible. There is lack of educational institutions
     and educational aids. People in the hill and Uttrakhand
     areas illustrate  the educationally backward classes of
     citizens because  lack of	educational facilities	keep
     them stagnant  and they have neither meaning and values
     nor awareness for education."

The Court  struck down	the reservation	 for candidates from
rural areas  on	 the  ground  that  rural  population  which
constituted 80%	 of A  the population of the State could not
be a homogeneous class. Some people in the rural areas might
be educationally  backward, some might be socially backward,
there may  be few  who were  both socially and educationally
backward but it could not be said that all citizens residing
in rural areas were socially and educationally backward.
</p><p id="p_154">     The Court while noticing the difficulty of defining the
expression 'socially'  and 'educationally'  backward classes
of citizens  allowed itself  to make  the observation,	"the
traditional   unchanging   occupations	 of   citizens	 may
contribute to social and educational backwardness. The place
of habitation  and its	environment is	also  a	 determining
factor in judging the social and educational backwardness."

to the caste and community mentioned in the annexures to the
Government Order would constitute socially and educationally

upheld the order and held:

     the ultimate  analysis the result of poverty to a large
     extent. Social  backwardness which results from poverty
     is likely	to be  aggravated by considerations of their

<p id="p_156">     Poverty by	 itself is  not the  determining  factor  of

     educationally  backward   classes.	 The  basis  of	 the

backwardness which  results from  poverty is  likely  to  be

<p id="p_159">certain departmental  test to qualify for promotion from the

on the	ground that  it was  violative of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_240">Art. 16(1).</a> One of
the arguments  in support  of the attack was that the result
of application of the rule would be to enable the members of
the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to claim more than
50% of	the posts  immediately available  for promotion. The
rule was  upheld by Ray, C.J., Mathew, Beg, Krishna Iyer and
Murtaza Fazal  Ali, JJ. and struck down by Khanna and Gupta,
JJ. Ray, C.J. Observed that the equality of opportunity took
within	its   fold  "all  stages  of  service  from  initial
appointment  to	 its  ,	 termination  including	 promotion".
Articles 14  and 16(1)	would not  be violated	by the	rule
which  would   ensure  equality	 of  representation  in	 the

not contravene	Arts. ]4,  61(1) and  16(2).  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_241">Article  16(4)</a>
merely removed any doubt in that respect. The classification
of employees  belonging to  Scheduled Castes  and  Scheduled
Tribes for allowing them an extended period of two years for
passing the  special tests  for promotion  was	a  just	 and
reasonable  classification  having  rational  nexus  to	 the
object of  providing equal  opportunity for  all citizens in

rule  exceeded	the  permissible  limits  of  the  resulting
preference shown to Scheduled Castes. Ray, C.J.. Observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  "The High Court was wrong in basing its conclusion
     that the  result of  application of  the impeached Rule
     and the orders are excessive and exorbitant namely that
     out of  51 posts,	34 were	 given to the members of the
     Schedule  led   Castes  and   Scheduled   Tribes.	 The
     promotions made  in the service as a whole are no where
     near 50  per cent	of the	total number  of posts.	 The
     Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes constitute 10 per
     cent of  the State's  population. Their  share  in	 the
     gazetted service  of the State is said to be 2 per cent
     184 out  of 8,700.	 Their	share  in  the	non-gazetted
     appointments is  only 7  per cent	namely 11,437 out of
     1,62,784. It  is, therefore,  correct that Rule 13A and
     the orders are meant to implement
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">424</span>
     not only  the direction  under <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_245">Art.  335</a>, but  also the
     Directive principal under Art. 46."</blockquote>
<p id="p_160">     One other	important statement  in Ray, CJ. 's judgment
is worth  noticing. He said, "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes are  not a  caste  within  the  ordinary	 meaning  of
caste". He  referred <a href="/doc/1725052/" id="a_246">Bhaiyalal	v. Harikishan  Singh</a> were it
had been  held that  an enquiry was not permissible into the
question whether a particular caste was a Scheduled Caste or
not in view of the provision of <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_247">Art. 341.</a>
</p><p id="p_161">     Mathew, J. who agreed with the conclusions of Ray, CJ.,
observed that  resort to some sort of proportionate equality
was necessary  in many	spheres to achieve justice. Equality
of opportunity	was not simply a matter of legal equally, it
depended not  merely on the absence of disability but on the
presence of  abilities. The  Government has  an	 affirmative
duty to	 eliminate inequalities and to provide opportunities
for the	 exercise of human rights and claims. The Government
has  an	  affirmative  responsibility	for  elimination  of
inequalities, social,  economic or  otherwise. There  was no
reason for  the court  not to  require the  State to adopt a
standard of  proportional equality which took account of the
differing  conditions	and  circumstances  of	a  class  of
citizens whenever  those conditions  and circumstances stood
in the	way of	their equal access to the enjoyment of basic
rights and  claims. <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_248">Art.  16(4)</a> was not an exception of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_249">Art.
16(1).</a> It was an emphatic way of putting the extent to which
the equality  of opportunity could be carried, viz., even up
to the	point of  making reservation. The state was entitled
to  adopt   by	measure	  which	 would	ensure	an  adequate
representation of  the members	of the	Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes and justify it as a compensatory measure to
ensure equality	 of opportunity provided the measure did not
dispense  with	 the  acquisition   of	the   minimum  basic
qualification	 necessary    for    the    efficiency	  of
administration.	 Beg,	J.  expressly	agreeing  with	 the
conclusions of	Ray, CJ.,  Mathew, Krishna  Iyer and  S.  M.
Fazal  Ali,  JJ,  added	 that  the  protection	of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_250">Art.  16</a>
continued  through   out   the	 period	  of   service.	  He
distinguished Devasana	and Balaji on the ground that if the
overall position  and picture  was  taken  into	 account  by
taking	the   number  of   employees   in   all	  Government
departments, the so-called favoured class of employees would
be less than 50 per cent of the number of posts.
</p><p id="p_162">     Beg, J.,  however, thought that <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_251">Art. 16(4)</a> was designed
'to  reconcile	 the  conflicting   pulls  of	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_252">Art.   16(1)</a>

service, and  of Arts.	A 46 and 335 embodying the duties of
the State  to promote  the  interest  of  the  economically,

the encroachments  on the  field of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_253">Art. 16(1)</a> could only be
permitted to  the extent  they were  warranted by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_254">Art. 16(4)</a>
and to	read broader  concept of social justice and equality
into <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_255">Art. 16(1)</a> might stultify the provision itself and make
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_256">Art. 16(4)</a>  otiose. We must straight away demur. There is no
reason whatever	 to narrow  the concept	 of equality in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_257">Art.
16(1)</a> and  refuse to read into it broader concepts of social
justice and  equality. In fact, it is necessary to read <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_258">Art.
16(1)</a> so  as not to come into any conflict with Arts. 46 and
</p><p id="p_163">335. A	constitutional document must be read as to synthesis
its provisions	and avoid  disharmony. To  say that equality
also means that unequals cannot be treated equally is merely
to say	what is	 self-evident  and  common  place.  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_259">Art.  14</a>
implies it  and we  do not see why it is not implied in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_260">Art.

save the  power of  the State  to  make	 provision  for	 the
reservation of	appointments and  posts	 in  favour  of	 any
backward class	of citizens, but a second look shows that it
really recognises  a pre-existing  power and  expresses	 the
recognition in	an emphatic  way lest  there should  be	 any
doubt caste upon that power. Such a device is not unknown to
legislatures and  constitution making  bodies. <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_262">Art. 16(4)</a> is
more in	 the nature of a rule of interpretation to guide the
construction of	 Aft. 16(1). The possibility of interpreting

not as	a saving  clause but as a clause inserted in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_265">Art. 16</a>

expressed his agreement with Fazal Ali, J. that arithmetical

could not be pressed too far and that overall representation
in a  department did  not depend  on the  recruitment  in  a

agreed with  Fazal Ali,	 J's construction  of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_267">Art. 16(4)</a> and
his view  about the  'carry forward' rule. But we must point
out that  Krishna Iyer,	 J. also  made certain	observations

     benefits, by  and large,  are snatched  away by the top
     creamy layer  of the  'back ward'	caste or class, thus
     keeping the  weakest among	 the weak  always  weak	 and
     leaving the fortunate layers to consume the whole cake.
     Secondly, this  claim is  over played  extravagantly in
     democracy by  large and  vocal groups  whose burden  of
     backwardness has  been substantially  lightened by	 the
     march of time and measures of better education and more
     opportunities  of	employment  but	 wish  to  wear	 the
     'weaker section'  label as	 a means to score over their
     near-equals formally categorised as the upper brackets.
     Lastly, a	lasting solution  to the  problem comes only
     from   improvement	  of   social	environment,   added
     educational  facilities   and  cross-fertilisation	  of
     castes  by	  inter-caste  and   inter-class   marriages
     sponsored	as  a  massive	State  programme,  and	this
     solution is calculatedly hidden from view by the higher
     'backward' groups	with a	vested interest in the plums
     of	 backwardness.	But  social  science  research,	 not
     judicial impressionism, will alone tell the whole truth
     and a  constant process of objective re-evaluation of a
     progress registered  by the  'under dog'  categories is
     essential lest a once deserving 'reservation' should be
     degraded into 'reverse discrimination'."
     One cannot	 quarrel  with	the  statement	that  social
science research  and not judicial impressionism should form
the basis  of  examination,  by	 Courts,  of  the  sensitive
question of  reservation for  backward classes.	 Earlier  we
mentioned  how	 the  assumption  that	efficiency  will  be
impaired if  reservation exceeds 50 per cent, if reservation
is extended  to promotional  posts or  if the  carry forward
rule is	 adopted, is  not based	 on any scientific data. One
must, however,	enter a	 caveat to  the criticism  that	 the
benefits of  reservation are  often snatched away by the top
creamy layer  of backward  class or caste. That a few of the
seats and posts reserved for backward classes are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">427</span>
snatched away by the more fortunate among them is not to say
that reservation  is not  necessary. This is bound to happen
in  a	competitive  society  such  as	ours.  Are  not	 the
unreserved seats  and posts  snatched away, in the same say,
by the	top creamy  layer on society itself ? Seats reserved
for the	 backward classes  are taken  away by the top layers
amongst them  on the same principle of merit it on which the
unreserved seats  are  taken  away  by	the  top  layers  of
society. How  can it  be bad if reserved seats and posts are
snatched away  by the  creamy layer  of backward classes, if
such snatching	away of	 unreserved posts  by the top creamy
layer of  society it  self not	bad?  This  is	a  necessary
concomitant of	the very  economic and	social system  under
which we  are functioning.  The privileged  in the  whole of
society snatch away the unreserved prizes and the privileged
among the  backward classes snatch away the reserved prizes,
This does  not render  reservation itself  bad. But  it does
emphasis that  mere reservation	 of a percentage of seats in
colleges and  a percentage  of posts  in the services is not
enough to  solve the  problem of backwardness. Developmental
facility and  opportunity must	be  created  to	 enable	 the
really backward	 to take  full advantage of reservations. It
indicates that	the ultimate solution lies in measures aimed
firmly at  all round  economic and social development. There
is, of course, the danger that it engenders self-denigration
and backwardness  may become  a vested interest. The further
real danger  is	 not  reservation  but	reservation  without
general all  round  social  and	 economic  development.	 The
result of  such reservation  is that  all the  young men  of
merit belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Backward classes
are literally  'gobbled up'  by the  civil services  leaving
very few  educated young  men of those classes to make their
cause on the social, economic and political fronts. The very
constraints of	office restrain	 those who have become civil
servants from championing the cause of their brethern. There
is also	 the historical	 truth that  oppressed	persons	 who
improve their  lot, in	an effort to forget an unhappy past,
often, rush to join the elite and imitate their ways, habits
and thoughts.  In the process they tend to forget their less
fortunate brethern.

classification made  by the  Government by  Rule 13(AA)	 was
fully justified by <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_268">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution- He held that
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_269">Art. 16(4)</a>  was not  to	 be  read  in  isolation  or  as  an
exception to  Art 16(1),  but was  to be  read as  part	 and

the  COCKADED	excessive   reservation,   he	emphatically
observed,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">428</span>
	  "This means  that the reservation should be within
     A the  permissible limits	and should not be a cloak to
     till all  the posts  belonging to a particular class of
     citizens  and   thus  violate   <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_270">Art.   16(1)</a>   of	 the
     Constitution indirectly. At the same time clause (4) of
     <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_271">Art. 16</a>  does not	fix any	 limit on  the power  of the
     Government to  make reservation.  Since clause (4) is a
     part of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_272">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution it is manifest that
     the State	cannot be  allowed to  indulge in  excessive
     reservation so  as to  defeat the	policy contained  in
     <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_273">Art. 16(1).</a>  As to what would be a suitable reservation
     within permissible	 limits will  depend upon  the facts
     and circumstances	of each	 case and  no hard  and fast
     rule can  be laid	down, nor can this matter be reduced
     to a mathematical formula so as to be adhered to in all
     cases. Decided  cases of  this Court have no doubt laid
     down that	the percentage	of  reservation	 should	 not
     exceed 50	per cent.  As t	 read the authorities, this,
     is, however, a rule of caution and does not exhaust all
     categories. Suppose  for instance	a State	 has a large
     number  of	  back	ward   classes	of   citizens  which
     constitute 80  per cent of the jobs for them, can it be
     said that	the percentage	of reservation	is  bad	 and
     violates the  permissible limits  of clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_274">Art.
     16 ?</a>  The answer  must necessarily	 be in the negative.
     The dominant  object of this provision is to take steps
     to make inadequate representation adquate."
     Fazal Ali,	 J. mext  considered  the  validity  of	 the
'carry forward' rule and upheld that rule also. He said that
if in  fact the	 carry forward	rule was  not allowed  to be

the clear  view that  the so-called fifty percent rule would
apply to the total number of posts in the service and not to

India &amp;	 Ors</a>.,(l) the  Court had to consider the question of
reservation of	posts under the State in favour of Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the 'carry forward rule. The
reservation and	 the rule  were upheld	by the court. One of
the arguments  vigorously advanced  was the  usual plea that
efficiency  would  suffer.  Krishna  Iyer,  J.	meeting	 the
argument observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	  "The sting  of the argument against reservation is
     that it  promotes inefficiency  in	 administration,  by
     choosing  sub-standards  candidates  in  preference  to
     those with	 better mettle.	 Competitive skill  is	more
     relevant  in   higher  posts,  especially	those  where
     selection is  made by  competitive examinations. Lesser
     classes  of   posts,   where   promotion	is   secured
     mechanically by  virtue of	 seniority except  where the
     candidate is  unfit. do  not require  a high  degree of
     skill as  in the case of selection posts. (See [1968] I
     SCR p.  721 at  734). It  is obvious  that	 as  between
     selection and  non-selection posts the role of merit is
     functionally more	relevant in  the former	 than in the
     latter. And  if in Rangachari reservation has been held
     valid in  the case of selection posts, such reservation
     in non-selection  posts is	 an afortiori  case. If,  in
     selecting top  officers you may reserve posts for SC/ST
     with lesser  merit, how  can you  rationally argue that
     for  the  posts  of  peons	 or  lower  division  clerks
     reservation  will	 spell	calamity?   The	 part	that
     efficiency plays  is far  more in	the case  of  higher
     posts than	 in the	 appointments of the lower posts. On
     this approach Annexure K is beyond reproach."
	  "Trite arguments about efficiency and inefficiency
     are a  trifle phoney  because, after all, at the higher
     levels the heartiness harijans girijan appointees are a
     microscopic percentage  and even in the case of Classes
     III and  II posts they are negligible. The preponderant
     majority  coming	from  unreserved   communities	 are

     caused by the minimal induction of

<blockquote id="blockquote_26">     a small  percentage of  'reserved'	 candidates,  cannot
     affect   the    over-all	administrative	  efficiency
     significantly. Indeed, it will be gross exaggeration to

     10 per  cent of  the total	 number of  officials in the

<p id="p_169">     While we  agree that  competitive skill  is relevant in
higher posts,  we  do  not  think  it  is  necessary  to  be
apologetic about  reservations in  posts, higher or lower so
long as the minimum requirements are satisfied. On the other
hand, we  have to  be apologetic  that there  still exists a
need for  reservation. Earlier	we extracted  a passage from
Tawney's Equality where he bemoaned how degrading it was for
humanity to  make  much	 of  their  intellectual  and  moral
superiority to	each other.  Krishna  Iyer,  J.	 Once  again
emphasised that	 Art. l	 6(4) was  one facet  of the  multi-
faceted character of the central concept of equality. One of
us (Chinnappa  Reddy, J.),  in the  same case, explained how
necessary it  was to translate the constitutional guarantees
given to  the Scheduled	 Castes, Scheduled  Tribes and other
backward classes  in to reality by necessary State action to
protect and nuture those classes of citizens so as to enable
them to	 shake off  the heart-crushing	burden of a thousand
years' deprivation  from their shoulders and to claim a fair
proportion of  participation in	 the administration.  It was
pointed out  that <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_278">Art.	16(4)</a> in  truth flowed	out of	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_279">Art.

	  "<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_280">Art. 16(4)</a>  is not  in the nature of an exception
     to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_281">Art.  16(1).</a> It	 is a  facet  of  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_282">Art.	16(1)</a>  which
     fosters  and   furthers  the   idea  of   equality	  of
     opportunity  with	 special  reference   to  an   under
     privileged and  deprived  class  of  citizens  to	when
     egalite do	 droit (formal	or legal  equality)  is	 not
     egalite de	 fait (practical or factual equality). It is
     illustrative of  what the State must do to wipe out the
     distinction between  egalite de  droit and	 egalite  de
     fait, It  recognises that	the  right  to	equality  of
     opportunity includes  the right of the under-privileged
     to conditions  comparable to  or compensatory  of those
     enjoyed by	 the privileged Equality of opportunity must
     be such  as to yield 'Equality of Results' and not that
     which simply  enables people, socially and economically
     better placed,  to win against the less fortunate, even
     when the  competition is  itself  otherwise  equitable.
     John Rawls in 'A,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">431</span>
     Theory of	Justice' demands the priority of equality in
     a distributive  sense and	the setting up of the Social
     System  "so  that	no  one	 gains	or  loses  from	 his
     arbitrary place  in the  distribution of natural assets
     or his  own initial  position in society without giving
     or receiving  compensatory advantages  in return."	 His
     basic principle  of  social  justice  is:	"All  social
     primary  goods-liberty   and  opportunity,	 income	 and
     wealth, and  the  bases  of  self-respect-	 are  to  be
     distributed equally  unless an  unequal distribution of
     any or all these goods is to the advantage of the least
     favoured."	 One   of  the	essential  elements  of	 his
     conception of  social justice  is	what  he  calls	 the
     principle of  redress:  "This  is	the  principle	that
     undeserved inequalities  call for	redress,  and  since
     inequalities  of	birth  and   natural  endowment	 are
     underserved,  these  inequalities	are  somehow  to  be
     compensated for".	Society must,  therefore, treat more
     favorably those with fewer native assets and those born
     into less favorable social positions."
</p><p id="p_170">     The statement  that equality  of opportunity must yield
equality of  results was the philosophical foundation of the
fulfillment of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_283">Art. 16(1)</a> in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_284">Art. 16(4).</a>
</p><p id="p_171">     So we  have now noticed the historical and sociological
background of  Class and  Caste, the  philosophy, the reason
and the	 rhetoric behind  reservation and  anti-reservation,
the  Constitutional  provisions	 and  the  varying  judicial
stances.  What	 emerges  from	 these	three	decades	  of
Parliamentary, Executive, Judicial, Political, and practical
wisdom? Clearly there exist large sections of people who are
socially  and	educationally  backward,  who  stand  midway
between the such as forward classes the landed, the learned,
the priestly and the trading classes on the one side and the
out-caste and  depressed classes,  i.e. the Scheduled Castes
and the	 Scheduled Tribes  on  the  other.  Poverty,  Caste,
occupation and	habitation are	the principal  factors which
contribute to  brand  a	 class	as  socially  backward.	 The
customs which  they honour  and observe,  the rituals  which
they fear  and practice	 the habits  to which they adapt and
conform, the  festivals which  they enjoy  and celebrate and
even the  Gods that they revere and worship are enlightening
elements  in   recognising  their   social   gradation	 and
backwardness- For instance, it may be possible
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">432</span>
to demonstrate	that amongst  very many	 classes, castes  or
communities, considered	 socially inferior,  Child  marriage
persists to  this day  despite the  <a href="/doc/323064/" id="a_285">Child Marriage Restraint
Act</a> and	 the <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_286">Hindu Marriage Act</a>. Despite the wisdom of legal
pandits and  learned text  books on  Hindu Laws	 proclaiming
that Saptapadi	is essential  to a vaid Hindu Marriage, most
of the	socially inferior  classes rarely  follow the  rule;
they have  their own  customs and  rituals. Long  before the
Hindu Widows'  Re-marriage Act	permitted widows to remarry,
long before  the <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_287">Hindu	Marriage Act</a>  permitted divorce, the
custom of the several so called socially inferior classes or
communities permitted re-marriage of widows and divorce. The
divorce was  not by decree of a Court of Law but was granted
by a  Caste Panchayat.	The    Caste-Panchayat	divorce	 was
impermissible	and    remarriage   of	 widows	  was	also
impermissible among  the socially  superior classes who used
to look	 down upon  these customs as primitive. The socalled
inferior classes  did not and do not have recourse either to
Purohits to  perform marriages	or the	Courts	to  dissolve
them.
</p><p id="p_172">     Dress habits also throw light, while it is difficult to
imagine, persons  belonging to	upper caste  or occupational
groups going about their daily work bare-lacked it is not an
uncommon right	to see	persons belonging  to lower caste or
occupational groups  so going  about, Work habits also given
an indication. Women belonging to higher social groups would
not generally  care to	serve in  other	 people's  homes  or
fields. Again  children	 of  lower  social  groups  take  to
domestic and  field work  quite early  in their lives. There
are certainly  good economic  reasons for all these factors.
As we  said economic  situation and  social situation  often
reflect each others. We mentioned earlier that even the Gods
that they  worship give	 occasional clues.  While the  Hindu
Gods proper,  Rama, Krishna, Siva etc. are worshipped by all
Hindus generally  there are several local Gods and Goddesses
in each	 village worshipped  only by the inferior castes. In
Andhra Pradesh,	 for example,  in every village the socalled
inferior castes worship the goddesses Sunkalamma,  Gangamma,
Polimeramma (the  Goddess guarding  the	 village  boundary),
Yellamma (another Goddess guarding the vi11age limits). They
celebrate Hindu	 festivals like	 Dasara, Deepawali  etc. but
also other  festivals in  which the  upper  classes  do	 not
participate.
</p><p id="p_173">     There are	many other  customs, rituals  or  habits  of
significance which  if one only cares to study them mark out
the socially back ward classes. The weight to be attached to
these factors depends
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">433</span>
upon the  circumstances	 of  the  case	which  can  only  be
revealed  by   thoughtful,  penetrating	  investigation	 and
analysis. It  cannot be	 done A	 by  means  of	mathematical
formulae but  only by  looking in the round or taking a look
at the	entire situation.  Sometimes it	 may be	 possible to
readily identify  certain castes or social groups as a whole
as socially  forward or	 socially backward classes. Poverty,
of course,  is basic,  being the  root cause  as well as the
rueful result  of social  and educational  backwardness. But
mere  poverty	it  seems   is	not  enough  to	 invite	 the
Constitutional branding, because of the vast majority of the
people of our country are poverty-struck but some among them
are socially  and educationally forward and others backward.
In a  country like  India where 80% of the people live below
the bread-line,	 even the majority of the so called socially
forward classes	 may be	 poor. For example no one will think
of describing  Brahmins anywhere in the land as socially and
educationally backward however, poor they might be. The idea
that poor  Brahmins may also be eligible for the benefits of
Articles 15(4)	and  16(4)  is	too  grotesque	even  to  be
considered. Similarly  no one  can possibly  claim that	 the
patels of  Gujarat, the	 Kayasthas of Bengal, the Reddys and
Kammas of  Andhra Pradesh  are	socially  backward  classes,
despite the  fact that	the majority  of them  may  be	poor
farmers and  agricultural laborers.  In	 the  rural,  social
ladder they  are indeed	 high up  and despite  the  economic
backwardness of	 sizeable sections  of them, they can not be
branded as  socially backward.	On the other hand, there are
several castes	or other  social groups	 who have only to be
named  to   be	immediately   identified  as   socially	 and
economically  backward	 classes,  identified	as  socially
backward  classes.  Again  illustrating	 from  rural  Andhra
Pradesh, one  can easily  identify caste  groups,  such	 as,
Kommaras (who traditionally carry on the occupation of black
smiths), Kummaris (who traditionally carry on the occupation
of  potters),  Vadderas	 (who  traditionally  carry  on	 the
occupation of  Stone breaking),	 Mangalis (who traditionally
carry  on  the	occupation  of	Barbers)  and  Besthas	(who
traditionally carry  on the occupation of Fisher folk), etc.
as backward  classes by	 the mere  mention of  their castes.
True, a few members of those caste or social groups may have
progressed far	enough and  forged ahead  so as	 to  compare
favourably with	 the leading  forward classes  economically,
socially and  educationally. In such cases, perhaps an upper
income ceiling	would secure  the benefit  of reservation to
such of	 those members	of the	class who really deserve it.
But one	 is entitled  to ask what is to happen to the poorer
sections of  the forward classes? The State will have to-and
it is the duty of the State so to do-to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">434</span>
discover other	means of  assisting them,  means other	than
reservations A	under Arts.  15(4) and	16(4). All this only
emphasises that	 in the	 ultimate  analysis,  attainment  of
economic equality  is the final and the only solution to the
besetting problems.  There is  also one	 danger in  adopting
individual poverty  as the criterion to identify a member of
the backward  classes, which needs to be pointed out. How is
one n  to identify  the	 individuals  who  are	economically
backward and,  therefore, to  be classified  as socially and
educationally  backward?   Are	 all   those   who   produce
certificates from  an official or a legislator or some other
authority that	their family incomes are less than a certain
figure to  be so  classified? It should be easy to visualise
who will  obtain such  certificates? Of	 course,  the  rural
elite, the  upper classes  of the  rural areas who don't pay
any income tax because agricultural income is not taxed. Who
will  find   it	 difficult  or	impossible  to	obtain	such
certificates? Of  course, the  truly lower  classes who need
them most.
</p><p id="p_174">     Class poverty, not individual poverty, is therefore the
primary test. Other ancillary tests are the way of life, the
standard of  living, the  place in the social hierarchy, the
habits and customs, etc. etc. Despite individual exceptions,
it  may	  be  possible	 and  easy   to	 identify   socially
backwardness with  reference to	 caste,	 with  reference  to
residence,  with  reference  to	 occupation  or	 some  other
dominant feature. Notwithstanding our antipathy to caste and
sub-regionalism, these	are facts  of life  which cannot  be
wished away.  If they  reflect poverty	which is the primary
source of  social and educational backwardness, they must be
recognised for	what they  are along with other less primary
sources	 There	 is  and  there	 can  be  nothing  wrong  in
recognising  poverty   wherever	 it   is  reflected   as  an
identifiable group  phenomena whether  you see it as a caste
group, a  sub-regional group,  an occupational group or some
other class.  Once the	relevant conditions  are taken	into
consideration, how  and where to draw the line is a question
for each State to consider since the economic and social
 conditions  differ from  area. Once the relevant conditions
are taken into consideration and the backwardness of a class
of people  is determined,  it will  not be  for the court to
interfere  in	the  matter.   But,  lest   there   be	 any
misunderstanding, judicial review will rot stand excluded .

reservation of	appointments or	 posts as  envisaged by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_292">Art.
16(4)</a> as  guaranteed in	 the  Constitution,  is	 a  national
commitment and a historical need to eradicate age-old social
disparities in	our country. But unfortunately the policy of
reservation hitherto  formulated by  the Government  for the
upliftment  of	such  socially	and  educationally  backward
classes of  citizens  is  caste-oriented  while	 the  policy
should be based on economic criteria. Then alone the element
of caste  in making  such special provisions or reservations
under Arts.  15(4) and 16(4) can be removed. At present only
the privileged	groups within  the backward classes i.e. the
forwards among the backward classes reap all the benefits of
such reservation  with the result that the lowest of the low
are  stricken	with  poverty  and  therefore  socially	 and
economically   backward	  remain   deprived   though   these
constitutional provisions  under Arts.	(15(4) and 16(4) are
meant for their advancement.
</p><p id="p_177">     After 37  years of attainment of independence it cannot
be seriously  disputed that  poverty is	 the root  cause  of
social and  economic  backwardness.  The  problem  is  about
identification of the backward classes for whose benefit the
State may  make special	 provisions under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_293">Art. 15(4).</a> Or for
reservation of	appointments or	 posts under  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_294">Art. 16(4).</a> In
view of	 the widespread public unrest in the State of Madhya
Pradesh and  Gujarat in	 recent days,  the Government at the
Centre must  have a  second look  at  the  whole  system  of
reservation. It	 is true  that	mere  economic	backwardness
would  not  satisfy  the  test	of  educational	 and  social
backwardness under  Art. IS(4) but the question is as to the
criteria to be adopted. Economic backwardness is only one of
the tests  to determine social and educational backwardness.
If that	 test were  to be  the sole  criterion of social and
educational   backwardness,    the   reservation   for	 the
advancement of	such classes to special treatment under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_295">Art.
15(4)</a> would fail.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">436</span>
<p id="p_178">     In retrospect, the answer to the question as to who are
the A members of socially and educationally backward classes
for whose  advancement the State may make special provisions
under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_296">Art.  15(4)</a>  still  eludes  us.  Why  should  not	 the
expression 'backward  classes' be treated as synonymous with
the weaker  sections of	 the society?  Does the word 'class'
denote a  caste or  sub-caste among  Hindus so far as Hindus
are concerned,	or a  section or  a group  so far as Muslim,
Christian or  other religious  communities and	denomination
are concerned? In my considered opinion. the predominant and
the only  factor for  making special  provisions under	<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_297">Art.
15(4)</a> or  for reservations  of posts  and appointments under
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_298">Art. 16(4)</a>  should be poverty, and caste or a sub-caste or a
group should  be used only for purposes of identification of
persons	 comparable  to	 Scheduled  Castes  -  or  Scheduled
Tribes, till such members of backward classes attain a state
of enlightment	and there  is eradication of poverty amongst
them and they become equal partners in 8 new social order in
our national life.
</p><p id="p_179">     In this  context, I must point out that the adequacy or
otherwise of  representation of	 the backward classes in the
services  has	to  be	determined  with  reference  to	 the
percentage of  that class  in the  population and  the total
strength of  the service as a whole. The representation does
not have  to exactly  correspond to  the percentage  of that
class in  the population;  it just to be adequate. Moreover,
in the	case of services the extent of representation has to
be considered  by taking into account  the number of members
of that	 class in  the service,	 whether  they	are  holding
reserved or  unreserved posts.	I cannot  overemphasize	 the
need for  a rational examination of the 17 whole question of
reservation in	the light of the observation made by us. The
State should  give due	importance and	effect to  the	dual
constitutional mandates of maintenance of efficiency and the
equality of  opportunity for  all persons.  The	 nature	 and
extent of  reservations must  be rational and reasonable. It
may be,	 and often  is difficult  for the  Court to draw the
line in	 advance which	the State ought not to cross, but it
is never  difficult for	 the Court  to know that an invasion
across the border, however ill-defined, has taken place. The
Courts have  neither  the  expertise  nor  the	sociological
knowledge to define or lay down the criteria for determining
what are  'socially and	 educationally backward	 classes  of
citizens' within  the meaning of Art 15(4) which enables the
State to  make 'special	 provisions for	 the advancement' of
such classes  notwithstanding the command of <a href="/doc/1952106/" id="a_299">Art. 15(2)</a> that
the State shall not discriminate against and citizens on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">437</span>
ground only  of religion,  race, caste,	 descent,  place  of
birth, residence  or any  of them. <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_300">Art. 340</a> provides for the
appointment of	a Commission  to 'investigate the conditions
of socially  and educationally	backward classes  within the
territory of  India and	 the difficulties  under which	they
labour and  to make  recommendations as	 to the	 steps	that
should be  taken by  the Union	or any	State to remove such
difficulties and  to improve  their condition.	The state of
backwardness of	 any class  of citizens	 is a fact situation
which  needs  investigation  and  determination	 by  a	fact
finding body  which has	 the expertise and the machinery for
collecting relevant  data. The Constitution has provided for
the appointment of such a Commission for Backward Classes by
the President  under <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_301">Art.  340</a> to  make recommendations	 and
left it	 to the	 State to  make special	 provisions for	 the
advancement of	such backward  classes. The  Court  is	ill-
equipped to  perform the task of determining whether a class
of citizens  is socially  and educationally  backward.	This
Court has, however, a duty to interpret the Constitution and
to see what it means and intends when it makes provision for
the advancement	 of socially  and educationally	 back-	ward
classes. In  considering this  situation then, we must never
forget that it is the Constitution we are expounding. Except
for this the Court has very little or no function.
</p><p id="p_180">     Questions	as   to	 the   validity	 or   otherwise	  of
reservations have  been agitated  several times	 before this
Court and  resolved. The  frequency and	 vigour	 with  which
these questions are raised is a disturbing indication of the
tension and  unease in	society in  regard to  the manner in
which <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_302">Art.  15(4)</a> and  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_303">Art. 16(4)</a> are operated by the State.
The Preamble  to our Constitution shows the nation's resolve
to secure  to all its citizens: Justice-Social, economic and
political. The	State's	 objective  of	bringing  about	 and
maintaining  social  justice  must  be	achieved  reasonably
having regard  to  the	interests  of  all.  Irrational	 and
unreasonable moves  by the State will slowly but surely tear
apart the  fabric of  society. It  is primarily the duty and
function  of   the  State  to  inject  moderation  into	 the
decisions taken under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4), because justice
lives in  the hearts  of men  and growing sense of injustice
and reverse  discrimination, fuelled by unwise State action,
will destroy,  not advance,  social justice.  If  the  State
contravenes the	 constitutional mandates  of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_304">Art.  16(1)</a> and
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_305">Art. 335</a>,  this Court  will of	course, have  to perform its
duty.
</p><p id="p_181">     The extent	 of reservation	 under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_306">Art.  15(4)</a> and	<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_307">Art.
16(4)</a> must  necessarily vary  from State  to State  and from
region to region within
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">438</span>
a State,  depending upon  the  conditions  prevailing  in  a
particular A  State or region, of the Backward Classes. r do
feel  that   the  Central  Government  should  consider	 the
feasibility of	appointing a  permanent National  Commission
for  Backward	Classes	 which	must  constantly  carry	 out
sociological and economic study from State to State and from
region	to  region  within  a  State.  The  framers  of	 the
Constitution by	 enacting <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_308">Art.	340</a>  clearly  envisaged	 the
setting up  of such  a high-powered  National Commission for
Backward classes  at the Centre. These problems can never be
resolved through litigation in the Courts.
</p><p id="p_182">     I	wish   to  add	 that  the  doctrine  of  protective
discrimination embodied	 in Arts.  15(4) and  16(4) and	 the
mandate	 of   <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_309">Art.  29(2)</a>   cannot  be	stretched  beyond  a
particular limit.  The State  exists to	 serve	its  people.
There are some services where expertise and skill are of the
essence. For example, a hospital run by the State serves the
ailing members	of the	public who need medical aid. Medical
services directly  affect and  deal with the health and life
of the	populace. Professional	expertise, term of knowledge
and experience,	 of a high degree of technical knowledge and
operational  skill   is	 required  of  pilots  and  aviation
engineers. The	lives of  citizens depend  on such  persons.
There are  other similar  fields  of  governmental  activity
where  professional,   technological,  scientific  or  other
special skill is called for. In such services or posts under
the Union  or States,  we think	 there can  be no  room	 for
reservation of	posts; merit  alone must  be  the  sole	 and
decisive consideration for appointments.
</p><p id="p_183">     Reasons for this decision will follow.

</p><p id="p_185">     The questions  involved in	 these cases  fare  delicate
ones and  have, therefore, to be tackled with great caution.
The issues raised here and the decision rendered on them are
bound to have a great
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">439</span>
impact on  society. They are indeed highly sensitive issues.
A superficial  approach to the problem has, therefore, to be
avoided. A  The questions  have to  be tackled with sympathy
for persons  who are really in need of the benign assistance
at the	hands of  the State  and  with	due  regard  to	 the
interests of the general public.
</p><p id="p_186">     "India's  vast   and   unparalleled   experiment	with
'protective' or	 'compensatory' discrimination	in favour of
'backward sections'  of her population betokens a generosity
and  farsightedness   that  are	  rare	among  nations.	 The
operation  of	such  a	  preferential	principle   involves
formidable burdens  of policy-making and administration in a
developing nation.  It also  places upon the judiciary tasks
of great  complexity and  delicacy. The	 courts	 must  guard
against abuses	of the	preferential principle	while at the
same time insuring that the government has sufficient leeway
to devise  effective use  of  the  broad  powers  which	 the
Constitution places  at its  disposal". These  are the	wise
words of  Marc Galanter,  a member  of the faculty on social
Sciences, University  of Chicago,  who has  made  a  special
study of  the problem  of the  Indian backward	classes. The
very fact  that the governmental agencies and 'above all the
courts have  been  obliged  to	examine	 the  constitutional
principles in  the light of the egalitarian pressures has in
its turn  opened up  hardly foreseen  complexities that	 had
lain buried  in the doctrine of equality'. The society which
cherishes the  ideal of	 equality has  to define the meaning
and content  of the concept of equality and the choices open
to it  to bring about an egalitarian society would always be
political. But	the courts  have been forced to scrutinise a
variety of choices, while the society for which they have to
answer has  been issuing a proliferation of demands. What is
'coming	 about,	  in   short,	is   a	 transformation	  of
consciousness which  is tinged with sensations of in justice
and exploitation'.  Many inequalities  in  the	past  seemed
almost to  have been  part of  the  order  of  nature.	'The
categories of  equality can  thus in  a	 sense	be  seen  to
correspond  to	 levels	 of   awareness.  Perhaps   not	 all
inequalities can  ever be  rectified and  it is certain that
some can  be rectified only by creating new inequalities and
new grievances.	 It is	this that has made the judiciary the
fulcrum of  such continuous  tension for it is the judiciary
and above  all the  Supreme Court  which  has  the  duty  of
mediating these	 conflicting demands back to society through
the prism  of constitutional  interpretation'.	The  courts,
however, deal  with  the  problems  that  society  presents.
'Levels of  awareness and  corresponding senses of grievance
have arisen  at different  times for  particular  historical
reasons often tend
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">440</span>
ing to differentiate among the categories of equality rather
than unifying  them. Inequalities  of class,  race, religion
and sex	 have presented	 themselves at	different periods as
primary grievances'. Equality of opportunity revolves around
two  dominant	principles-(1)	the   traditional  value  of
equality of  opportunity and  (2) the  newly appreciated-not
newly conceived-idea of equality of results. 'Social justice
may demand  and political  interests may  make	expedient  a
policy of  correction in  favour of  individual	 members  of
minorities or  communities. But	 at this  point whenever any
action was  taken the  principle of  individual equality  of
opportunity lost  its  direction.  Such	 affirmative  action
played off  not one  individual of one group against another
of another  group, but the present against the past. In past
many privileged	 persons of  mediocre ability  had benefited
from the  indulgence of	 a system that unquestionably biased
in favour  of higher  castes.' 'Individual aspirations claim
the protection	of society's  rules. But they are not always
in harmony  and sometimes  conflict with  the same society's
broad interest in achieving certain kinds of racial or group
balance.' But  rectification  of  imbalance  also  sometimes
tends towards inequality. 'Societies do not work on absolute
rationality, excess of rationality often tends to dehumanise
human relations'.  The courts  are also	 reminded  that	 for
those who  are suffering  from	deprivation  of	 inalienable
rights, gradualism  can never be a sufficient remedy because
as Ralph  Buoche  observed  'inalienable  rights  cannot  be
enjoyed posthumously'.	Ours is	 a 'struggle  for status,  a
struggle to  take democracy off parchment and give it life'.
'Social injustice  always balances  its books with red ink'.
Neither the  caprice of personal taste nor the protection of
vested interests  can be  stand as  reasons for	 restricting
opportunities of  any appropriately  qualified person. These
are the	 considerations which  sometimes may  be conflicting
that should weigh with the courts dealing with cases arising
out of	the doctrine  of equality.  It should,	however,  be
remembered that	 the courts  by	 themselves  are  not  in  a
position to  bring the	concept of  equality  into  fruitful
action. They  should be supported by the will of the people,
of the Government and of the legislators. There should be an
emergence of  united action  on the  part of all segments of
human society.	This is	 not all.  Mere will  to bring about
equality under	the existing economic level might worsen the
situation. There  should be at the same time a united action
to increase  the national resources so that the operation of
equality will be less burdensome
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">441</span>
and every  member of  the society  is carried  to  a  higher
social and  economic level  leaving nobody  below a  minimum
which guarantees  all the  basic human needs to every member
of  the	  society.  If	 there	is   no	 united	 action	 the
pronouncements by courts would become empty words as many of
the high  principles  adumberated  in  the  chapter  on	 the
Directive Principles  of State	Policy in  the	Constitution
have turned  out to  be owing  to several factors which need
not be detailed here. We shall proceed to consider this case
against this background.
</p><p id="p_187">     In this  case, the	 Court is called upon to resolve the
conflict  between   'the  meritarian   principle   and	 the
compensatory principle'	 in the	 matter of  admissions	into
institutions imparting	higher education  and of  entry into
Government service  in	the  State  of	Karnataka.  All	 the
contestants depend  upon one  or the  other clauses  of	 the
Constitution in	 support of their case. Hence the problem is
rendered more difficult.
</p><p id="p_188">     Those who	argue in  support of  merit contend that the
State should  remove all man-made obstacles which are in the
way of	an Individual and allow him to attain his goal in an
atmosphere of  free competition relying upon his own natural
skill and  intelligence. Those	who argue  for	compensatory
principle contend  that in order that the competition may be
'fair and not just free' it is the duty of the State to take
note of	 the unequal  situation of the individuals concerned
which has  led to  unequal capacities  amongst them  and  to
reduce the  rigours of	free competition  which may,  unless
looked into  by the  State,  lead  to  perpetual  denial  of
equality of  opportunity  to  the  weak	 and  the  neglected
sections of  society. This  argument is	 based on  the	well
founded assumption  that unequal conditions of cultural life
at home	 cause	unequal	 cultural  development	of  children
belonging to  different strata	of  society.  The  need	 for
social action is necessitated by the environment factors and
living	conditions   of	 the   individuals  concerned.	 The
application  of	  the	principle   of	 individual   merit,
unmitigated by other considerations, may quite often lead to
inhuman results. The following illustration given by Bernard
Williams establishes the above statement:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	  "Suppose that	 in a certain society great prestige
     is attached  to membership	 of  a	warrior	 class,	 the
     duties of	which require  great physical strength. This
     class has	in the	past  been  recruited  from  certain
     wealthy families
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">442</span>
     only ;  but egalitarian reforms achieve a change in the
     rules,  by	  which	 warriors  are	recruited  from	 all
     sections of  the society,	on the results of a suitable
     competition, The  effect of  this, however, is that the
     wealthy  families	 still	provide	 virtually  all	 the
     warriors, because the rest of the populage is so under-
     nourished by  reason of  poverty  that  their  physical
     strength is  inferior to that of the weal thy and well-
     no nourished.  The reformers  protest that	 equality of
     opportunity has  not really  been achieved; the wealthy
     reply that	 in fact  it has, and that the poor now have
     the opportunity  of becoming  warriors- it	 is just bad
     luck that	their characteristics  are such that they do
     not pass  the test.  'We  are  not,'  they	 might	say,
     'excluding anyone for being poor, we exclude people for
     being weak,  and it  is unfortunate  that those who are
     poor are also weak.'
	  This answer  would seem  to most people feeble and
     even cynical  This is  for	 reasons  similar  to  those
     discused before  in connection with equality before the
     law; that the supposed equality of opportunity is quite
     empty indeed,  one may  say any that it does not really
     exist- unless  it is made more effective than this. For
     one knows	that it	 could be  made more  effective: one
     knows that	 there is  a casual connection between being
     poor and  being  under  nourished,	 and  between  being
     undernourished and	 being physically  weak. One suppose
     further  that   something	could	be  done-subject  to
     whatever economic	conditions   obtain in	the imagined
     society to	 alter the distribution	 of wealth. All this
     being so,	the appeal  by the wealthy to the 'bad luck'
     of the poor must appear as disingenuous."</blockquote>
<p id="p_189">     The former	 princely State	 of Mysore  which now  forms
part of the State of Karnataka is one of the earliest States
in the	country in  which  the	system	of  reservation	 for
backward classes  in public  ser vices	was  introduced.  In
1918, the  Government of His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore
appointed a  committee under  the chairmanship of Sir Leslie
C. Miller,  Chief Justice  of the  Chief Court	of Mysore to
investigate and	 report on  the problem of backward classes.
The questions  referred to  that Committee  were (i) changes
needed in  the then  existing rules of recruitment to public
services; (ii) special
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">443</span>
facilities to  encourage higher	 and professional  education
among the  members of  backward classes	 and (iii) any other
special measures  which	 might	be  taken  to  increase	 the
representation	of   backward  communities   in	 the  public
services without  materially affecting	the efficiency,	 due
regard being  paid also	 to the general good accruing to the
State by  a wider  diffusion of	 education  and	 feeling  of
increased status  which will  thereby  be  produced  in	 the
backward communities.  It is significant that the expression
'backward classes'  and	 'backward  communities'  were	used
almost	interchangeably	 and  that  the	 idea  contained  in
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_312">Article 335</a>  of the  Constitution that	any reservation made
should not impair efficiency was anticipated more than three
decades before	the Constitution  was enacted. The Committee
submitted its report in 1921 containing its opinion that all
communities in	the State  other  than	Brahmins  should  be
understood as  backward communities  regarding whom  it made
certain recommendations. The Government orders issued on the
basis of that Report continued to be in force till 1956 i.e.
the reorganisation  of States  which brought  together	five
integrating units-the  former State  of	 Maysore  (including
Bellary District),  Coorg, four districts of Bombay, certain
portions of the State of Hyderabad and the district of South
Kanara and  the Kollegal Taluk which formerly formed part of
the State  of Madras. There were different lists of backward
communities in	the five  integrating units  and  they	were
allowed	 to   continue	 for   sometime	  even	 after	 the
reorganisation of States- In order to bring about uniformity
the State  Government issued  a notification  containing the
list of backward classes for the purpose of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_313">Article 15(4)</a> of
the Constitution  at the  beginning of 1959. The validity of
that  notification   and  of   another	notification  issued
thereafter on  the same	 topic which  according to the State
Government had	treated all  persons except Brahmins. Banias
and Kayasthas  as backward communities was challenged before
the High  Court of  Mysore in <a href="/doc/532826/" id="a_314">Rama Krishna Singh v. State of
Maysore</a>.(l) The	 two notifications  were struck	 down by the
HighCourt. The High Court held that inasmuch as the impugned
notifications contained a list of backward classes including
95% of the population of the State and all Hindu communities
other than Brahmins, Banias and Kayasthas and all other non-
Hindu communities  in the  State  except  Anglo-Indians	 and
Parsees had  been treated  as backward	classes it  resulted
more  in   a  discrimination   against	the   few   excluded
communities consisting	of about  5% of the total population
rather than making provision for socially and
     (1) A.I.R.. 1960 Mys. 338.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">444</span>
<p id="p_190">educationally backward	classes. The  High Court  held	that
making A  provision  for  communities  which  were  slightly
backward to the so called forward communities did not amount
to making  provision for the communities which really needed
protection under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_315">Article 15(4)</a>	 of  the  Constitution.	 The
argument of  the petitioners  in that case that socially and
educationally backward	classes can in no case be determined
on the	basis of  caste was,  however, rejected.  After	 the
above decision	was rendered  by the  High Court,  the State
Government constituted	a Committee OD January 8, 1960 under
the Chairmanship  of Dr.  R. Nagan  Gowda for the purpose of
determining the	 criteria for the classification of backward
classes in  the State with the following terms of reference:
( I)  to suggest  the criteria	to be adopted in determining
which sections	of the people in the State should be treated
as socially  and educationally	backward and  (2) to suggest
the exact manner in which the criteria thus indicated should
be followed  to enable the State Government to determine the
persons	 who   should  secure  such  preference	 as  may  be
determined  by	 Government  in	 respect  of  admissions  to
technical  institutions	  and  appointment   to	  Government
services. The said committee submitted its Interim Report on
February 19, 1960. On the basis of the Interim Report of the
Committee, the	State Government  passed an order dated June
9, 1960	 regarding admissions  to professional and technical
institutions reserving	22% of	seats for  backward classes,
15% for Scheduled Castes and 2% for Scheduled Tribes and the
remaining 60%  of seats	 were allowed  to be filled upon the
basis of  merit. The  above Government order was, challenged
before the High Court of Mysore in <a href="/doc/195149/" id="a_316">S.A. Partha &amp; Ors. v. The
State of  Mysore &amp;  Ors</a>.(l) The	 High Court  found that	 the
direction contained  in the  Government	 order to the effect
that if	 any seat or seats reserved for candidates belonging
to  the	 Scheduled  Castes  and	 Scheduled  Tribes  remained
unfilled, the  same shall  be filled  by candidates of other
backward classes  was unconstitutional.	 It also  gave	some
directions regarding  the manner in which the calculation of
the quota  of reservation  should be  made.  Thereafter	 the
Final Report  was submitted  by the Nagan Gowda Committee on
May  16,   1961	 After	 taking	  into	 consideration	 the
recommendations	 made	in  the	  said	Report,	  the  State
Government issued an order for the purpose of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_317">Article 15 (4)</a>
of the	Constitution on	 July 10,  1961. By  that order, the
State Government  specified 81 classes of people as backward
classes and  13 S classes of people as more backward classes
and reserved 30% of
     (1) A.I.R.. 1961 Mys. 220.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">445</span>
<p id="p_191">seats in  the professional  and technical  institutions	 for
backward and  more backward classes. 15% and 3% of the seats
were reserved  for Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes
respectively and the remaining 52% of the seats were allowed
to be  filled up on merit. The above order was superseded by
a fresh	 Government order  made on  July 31,  1962  for	 the
purpose of  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_318">Article 15	(4).</a> By	 this new  order, 28% of the
seats were  reserved for  the backward	classes, 22% for the
more backward  classes, 15 per cent for the Scheduled Castes
and 3 per cent for the Scheduled Tribes. Thus 68 per cent of
the  seats  were  reserved  under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_319">Article  15	(4)</a>  of	 the
Constitution and  only 32  per	cent  of  the  seats  became
available for  being filled  up on  the basis of merit. This
order was  challenged before  this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_320">Article 32</a> of
the Constitution  in  <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_321">M.R.  Balaji  and	 Ors.  v.  State  of
Mysore</a>.(1) In  the decision  rendered in  that case which is
considered   to	  be   land-mark   in	the   constitutional
pronouncement made  by this Court, Gajendragadkar, J. (as he
then was)  explained the  meaning of  the term 'socially and
educationally backward	classes' appearing in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_322">Article 15 (4)</a>
of the Constitution at pages 459-461 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	  "The backwardness under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_323">Art. 15 (4)</a> must be social
     and educational. It is not either social or educational
     but it  is both  social and educational; and that takes
     us to  the question  as to	 how social  and educational
     backwardness has to be determined.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	  Let us  take the  question of	 social backwardness
     first. By	what test  should it  be decided  whether  a
     particular class  is socially  backward or	 not  ?	 The
     group of  citizens to  whom <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_324">Article  15 (4)</a> applies are
     described as  'classes of	citizens', not	as castes of
     citizens. A class, according to the dictionary meaning,
     shows division  of society according to status, rank or
     caste.  In	  the	Hindu	social	 structure,   caste,
     unfortunately plays  an important	part in	 determining
     the  status   of  the   citizen.  Though  according  to
     sociologists and  Vedic scholars,	the caste system may
     have originally  begun on	occupational  or  functional
     basis,  in	  course  of   time,  it  became  rigid	 and
     inflexible. The  history of  the growth of caste system
     shows that	 its original  functional  and	occupational
     basis was	later over-  burdened with considerations of
     purity based on ritual
     (1) [1963] Supp. S.C.R. 439,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">446</span>
     concepts  and  that  led  to  its	ramifications  which
     introduced inflexibility  and rigidity. This artificial
     growth  inevitably	  tended  to  create  a	 feeling  of
     superiority and  inferiority and to foster narrow caste
     loyalties. Therefore,  in dealing	with the question as
     to whether	 any class  of citizens is socially backward
     or not,  it may  not be  13 irrelevant  to consider the
     caste  of	 the  said   group  of	 citizens.  In	this
     connection, it  is, however,  necessary to bear in mind
     that the  special provision is contemplated for classes
     of citizens  and not  for individual  citizens as such,
     and so,  though the  caste of the group of citizens may
     be relevant,  its importance should not be exaggerated.
     If the  classification of	backward classes of citizens
     was based	solely on  the caste  of the citizen, it may
     not always	 be logical and may perhaps contain the vice
     of perpetuating the castes themselves.
	  Besides, if the caste of the group of citizens was
     made  the	 sole  basis   for  determining	 the  social
     backwardness  of	the  said  group,  that	 test  would
     inevitably break  down in	relation to many sections of
     Indian Society  which do  not recognise  castes in	 the
     conventional sense	 known to  Hindu Society. How is one
     going to  decide whether  Muslims, Christians or Jains,
     or even  Lingayats are  socially, backward or not ? The
     test of  castes would  be inapplicable to those groups,
     but that  would hardly  justify the  exclusion of these
     groups in	to  from the operation of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_325">Art. 15 (4).</a> It is
     not unlikely  that	 in  some  States  some	 Muslims  or
     Christians or  Jains forming  groups  may	be  socially
     backward. That  is why  we think  that though castes in
     relation to Hindus may be a relevant factor to consider
     in determining  the social	 backwardness of  groups  or
     classes of	 citizens, it cannot be made the sole or the
     dominant test in that behalf. Social backwardness is on
     the ultimate  analysis the result of poverty, to a very
     large  extent.   The  classes   of	 citizens   who	 are
     deplorably poor automatically became socially backward.
     They do  not  enjoy  a  status  in	 society  and  have,
     therefore, to be content to take a backward seat. It is
     true  that	  social  backwardness	which  results	from
     poverty is likely lo be aggravated by considerations of
     caste to which the poor citizens may belong, but that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">447</span>
     only shows	 the relevance	of both caste and poverty in
     determining the backwardness of citizens. A
	  The occupations of citizens may also contribute to
     make classes  of citizens	Socially backward. There are
     some  occupations	 which	are   treated  as   inferior
     according	to   conventional  beliefs  and	 classes  of
     citizens who  follow   these  occupations	are  apt  to
     become socially  backward. The place of habitation also
     plays not	a minor part in determining the backwardness
     of a  community of	 persons. In a sense, the problem of
     social backwardness  is the  problem of Rural India and
     in	 that	behalf,	 classes  of  citizens	occupying  a
     socially backward	position in  rural area-fall  within
     the purview  of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_326">Art.  15 (4)</a> The problem of determining
     who are  socially backward	 classes is undoubtedly very
     compleat	 Sociological,	   social    and    economic
     considerations come  into play  in solving	 the problem
     and evolving  proper  criteria  for  determining  which
     classes are  socially  backward  is  obviously  a	very
     difficult task; it will need an elaborate investigation
     and collection of data and examining the said data in a
     rational and  scientific way.  That is  the function of
     the State	which purports	to act under Art 15 (4). All
     that this	Court is  called upon to do in dealing which
     the present  petitions is	to decide  whether the tests
     applied by	 the impugned  order are valid under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_327">Art. 15
     (4).</a> If  it appears  that the test applied by the order
     in that  behalf  is  improper  and	 invalid,  then	 the
     classification of	socially back  ward classes based on
     that test	will have to be held to be inconsistent with
     the requirements of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_328">Art. 15 (4)."</a></blockquote>
<p id="p_192">     Dealing with  the	question  of  determination  of	 the
classes which  were educationally  backward, Gajendragadkar,
J. (as	he then was) observed in the same case at pages 463-
464 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	  "It  may  be	conceded  that	in  determining	 the
     educational backwardness  of a  class of  citizens	 the
     literacy test supplied by the Census Reports may not be
     adequate; but it is doubtful if the test of the average
     of student	 population in	the last  three High  School
     classes is	 appropriate in	 determining the educational
     backwardness. Having  regard to  the fact that the test
     is intended to determine who are educationally backward
     classes, it may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">448</span>
     not be  necessary or  proper to put the test as high as
     has been  done by the Committee. But even assuming that
     the test applied is rational and permissible under Art.</blockquote>
<p id="p_193">     15 (4),  the question  still remains  as to  whether it
     would be  legitimate to  treat  castes  or	 communities
     which are just below the State average as educationally
     backward classes.	If the	State  average	is  6.9	 per
     thousand, a  community which satisfies the said test or
     is just  below the	 said test  cannot  be	regarded  as
     backward. It  is only  communities which are well below
     the State	average that  can properly  be	regarded  as
     educationally backward  classes of citizens. Classes of
     citizens whose  average  of  student  population  works
     below 50  per cent	 of the	 State average are obviously
     educationally backward  classes of citizens. Therefore,
     in	 our   opinion,	 the  State  was  not  justified  in
     including in  the list  of Backward  Classes, castes or
     communities whose	average of  student  population	 per
     thousand was slightly above or very near, or just below
     the State average." (underlining by us)
     Applying  the  above  rule	 the  Court  held  that	 the
inclusion of  members of  the Lingayat community in the list
of backward classes was erroneous. On the question of extent
of reservation	that can be made, this Court observed in the
aforesaid case at pages 469-471 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">	  "The learned	Advocate-General has  suggested that
     reservation of  a large  number of seats for the weaker
     sections of  the society  would not  affect either	 the
     depth or  efficiency of  scholarship  at  all,  and  in
     support  of   this	 argument,  he	has  relied  on	 the
     observations made	by the	Backward Classes  Commission
     that it  found no	complaint in  the States  of Madras,
     Andhra, Travancore-Cochin	and Mysore  where the system
     of recruiting candidates from other Backward Classes to
     the  reserve  quota  has  been  in	 vogue	for  several
     decades.  The   Committee	further	 observed  that	 the
     representatives of	 the upper  classes did not complain
     about any	lack of	 efficiency in the offices recruited
     by reservation  (p. 135).	This  opinion,	however,  is
     plainly inconsistent  with what  is  bound	 to  be	 the
     inevitable	 consequence   of  reservation	 in   higher
     university education.  If admission to professional and
     technical colleges	 is unduly  liberalist it  would  be
     idle to contend
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">449</span>
     that the quality of our graduates will not suffer. That
     is not to say that reservation should not be adopted; A
     reservation should	 and must  be adopted to advance the
     prospects of  the weaker  sections of  society, but  in
     providing for  special measures  in  that	behalf	care
     should be	taken not  to exclude  admission  to  higher
     educational  centres   to	 deserving   and   qualified
     candidates of  other communities.	A special  provision
     contemplated by  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_329">Art. 15  (4)</a> like reservation of posts
     and appointments  contemplated by	<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_330">Art. 16	 (4)</a> must be
     within  reasonable	 limits.  The  interests  of  weaker
     sections of  society which	 are a	first charge  on the
     States and	 the Center  have to  be adjusted  with	 the
     interests of  the community  as a whole. The adjustment
     of these  competing claims	 is undoubtedly	 a difficult
     matter, but  if under  the guise  of making  a  special
     provision, a  State reserves  practically all tho seats
     available in  all the  colleges, that  clearly would be
     subverting the  object of	<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_331">Art. 15	 (4).</a> In this matter
     again, we are reluctant to say definitely what would be
     a proper provision to make. Speaking generally and in a
     broad way,	 a special  provision should be less than 50
     per cent;	how much  less than 50 per cent would depend
     upon the  relevant	 prevailing  circumstances  in	each
     case. In  this particular	case, it  is remarkable that
     when the  State issued  its order	on July 10, 1961, it
     emphatically expressed its opinion that the reservation
     of 68  per cent  recommended  by  the  `Nagging  Gowada
     Committee would  not be  in the larger interests of the
     State. What happened between July 10, 1961 and July 31,
     1962, does	 not appear  on the  record. But  the  State
     changed its  mind and adopted the recommendation of the
     Committee ignoring	 its earlier  decision that the said
     recommendation was	 contrary to the larger interests of
     the State.	 In our	 opinion, when	the  State  makes  a
     special provision	for the	 advancement of	 the  weaker
     sections of society specified in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_332">Art. 15 (4</a>), it has to
     approach its task objectively and in a rational manner.
     Undoubtedly,  it	has  to	 take  reasonable  and	even
     generous  steps  to  help	the  advancement  of  weaker
     elements; the  extent of  the problem  must be weighed,
     the requirements  of the  community at  large  must  be
     borne in mind and a formula must be evolved which would
     strike  a	 reasonable  balance   between	the  several
     relevant considerations. Therefore,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">450</span>
     we are  satisfied that  the reservation  of 68 per cent
     directed by  the impugned order is plainly inconsistent
     with <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_333">Art. 15 (4)."</a> (Emphasis added)
     The petition was thus allowed by this Court.</blockquote>
<p id="p_194">     Then came	the Government	order dated  July  26,	1963
which directed that 30 per cent of the seats in professional
and technical  colleges and  institutions should be reserved
for backward  classes as  defined in  that order and that 18
per cent  of the  seats should be reserved for the Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled Tribes. The criteria laid down in that
order for  determining social and economic backwardness were
two-fold-income and  occupation. It  stated that  those	 who
followed  occupations	of  agriculture,   petty   business,
inferior service,  crafts  or  other  occupations  involving
manual labour  and whose  family income	 was less  than	 Rs.
1,2001- per  annum  were  to  be  treated  as  belonging  to
backward classes.  This order was questioned before the High
Court in <a href="/doc/1977916/" id="a_334">G. Viswanath v. Govt. of Mysore and Ors</a>.(l) by some
petitioners on	various grounds.  While dismissing  the said
petitions, the High Court observed that the determination of
the backward  classes without  reference to caste altogether
was not	 correct and  it expressed  the hope  that the State
would  make  a	more  appropriate  classification  lest	 its
bonafides should  be questioned. In the appeal filed against
this judgment  in <a href="/doc/203735/" id="a_335">R. Chitralekha and Anr. v. State of Mysore
and Ors</a>.,(2)  the correctness  of the  above observation was
questioned. Dealing  with that question Subba Rao, J. (as he
then was),  who	 spoke	for  the  majority,  said  that	 the
observations of	 the  High  Court  referred  to	 above	were
inconsistent with  the decision	 in Balaji's  case  (supra).
After referring	 to the	 relevant observations	made by this
Court in  Balaji' case	(supra), Subba	Rao, J.	 (as he then
was) observed at pages 386-387 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">	  "Two principles  stand out  prominently  from	 the
     said observations,	 namely, (i) the caste of a group of
     citizens may be a relevant circumstance in ascertaining
     their social  backwardness; and  (ii) though  it  is  a
     relevant factor to determine the social backwardness of
     a class  of citizens, it cannot be the sole or dominant
     test in that behalf.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">451</span>
     The observations  extracted in the judgment of the High
     Court appear to be in conflict with the observations Of
     A this  Court. While this Court said that caste is only
     a relevant	 circumstance and  that	 it  cannot  be	 the
     dominant test  in ascertaining  the backwardness  of  a
     class of  citizens, the  High Court  said that it is an
     important basis  in determining  the class	 of backward
     Hindus and	 that the  Government  should  have  adopted
     caste as one of the tests As the said observations made
     by the  High Court	 may lead  to some  confusion in the
     mind of  the authority  concerned who  may be entrusted
     with the duty of prescribing the rules for ascertaining
     the backwardness  of classes  of  citizens	 within	 the
     meaning of	 <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_336">Art. 15 (4)</a> of	 the Constitution, we would
     hasten to	make it	 clear that caste is only a relevant
     circumstance in  ascertaining  the	 backwardness  of  a
     class and	there is  nothing in  the judgment  of	this
     Court which  precludes  the  authority  concerned	from
     determining the  social  backwardness  of	a  group  of
     citizens if  it can  do so	 without reference to caste.
     While  this   Court  has	not  excluded	caste	from
     ascertaining the  backwardness of	a class of citizens,
     it has  not made it one of the compelling circumstances
     according	a   basis  for	 the	  ascertainment	  of
     backwardness of  a class.	To put	it differently,	 the
     authority concerned  may take  caste into consideration
     in ascertaining the backwardness of a group of persons;</blockquote>
<p id="p_195">     but, if  it does not, its order will not be bad on that
     account, if  it can  ascertain the	 backwardness  of  a
     group  of	persons	 on  the  basis	 of  other  relevant
     criteria." (Underlining by us)
     Proceeding further,  Subba Rao,  J. (as  he  then	was)
observed at pages 388-389 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	  "The important  factor to  be noticed in <a href="/doc/1744360/" id="a_337">Art. 5(4)</a>
     is that it does not speak of castes, but only speaks Or
     classes. If  the makers of the Constitution intended to
     take castes  also as  units of  social and	 educational
     backwardness, they would have said so as they have said
     in the  case of  the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
     Tribes. Though  it may  be	 suggested  that  the  wider
     expression "classes"  is used  in cl. (4) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_338">Art. 15</a> as
     there are communities without castes, if take intention
     was to equate classes with castes,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">452</span>
     nothing prevented	the marks of the Constitution from A
     using the	empression "backwarded	classes or  castes".
     The juxtaposition	of the expression "backward classes"
     and "Scheduled  Castes" in	 <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_339">Art.  15(4)</a>  leads    to  a
     reasonable inference  that the  empression "classes" is
     not  synonymous   with  castes.  It  may  be  that	 for
     ascertaining whether a particular citizen or a group of
     citizens belong  to a  backward class  or not,  his  or
     their caste  may have some relevance, but it can not be
     either  the   sole	 or   the  dominant   criterion	 for
     ascertaining the class to which he or they belong.
	  This interpretation  will carry  out the intention
     of	 the   Constitution  expressed	 in  the   aforesaid
     Articles. It  helps the really backward classes instead
     or promoting  the interests  of individuals  or  groups
     who,  though  they	 belong	 to  a	particular  caste  a
     majority  whereof	 is   socially	 and   educationally
     backward, really  belong to  a class  which is socially
     and educationally advanced. To illustrate, take a caste
     in a State which is numerically the largest therein. It
     may be  that though  a majority  of the  people in that
     caste  are	 socially  and	educationally  backward,  an
     effective minority	 may be	 socially and  educationally
     far more  advanced	 than  another	small-sub-caste	 the
     total number  of  which  is  far  less  then  the	said
     minority. If  we interpret	 the empression "classes" as
     "castes"  the   object  of	 the  Constitution  will  be
     frustrated and  the  people  who  do  not	deserve	 any
     adventitious aid  may get	it to the exclusion of those
     who really	 deserve. This	anomally will  not arise if,
     without equating  caste with  class, caste	 is taken as
     only one  of the  considerations to ascertain whether a
     person belongs to a backward class or not. On the other
     hand,  if	the  entire  sub-caste,	 by  and  large,  is
     backward, it may be included in the Scheduled Castes by
     following the  appropriate procedure  laid down  by the
     Constitution".</blockquote>
<p id="p_196">     In 1972,  tho State  Government appointed the Karnataka
Backward Classes  Commission under  the chairmanship of Shri
L. G. Havanur which after an elaborate enquiry submitted its
Report on  November 19,	 1975 in  four massive	volumes, the
first volume  containing two  parts. rt	 is stated  that the
commission counted  a socio-economic  survey of 378 villages
and town/city  blocks in  their entirety  covering more than
3,55,000 individuals belonging to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">453</span>
171 castes  and communities  with the  help of more than 425
investigators and  supervisors.	 About	365  witnesses	were
examined by  A the  Commission. The Report of the Commission
is full	 of tabular  statements and  it refer to a number of
writings by  sociologists, demographers, jurists and persons
will versed  in social	sciences. The work of the Commission
deserves to  be commended as such an extensive investigation
into  the  conditions  of  backward  classes  had  not	been
conducted in  the State so far Perhaps till than in no other
part of	 India, such  on elaborate  investigation  had	been
carried out  with reference  to so  many minute details. The
commission recommended	that persons  belonging to  backward
classes for  purpose of	 <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_340">Article 15(4)</a>	of the	Constitution
should be divided into three groups-(a) backward communities
consisting of  15 castes,  (b) backward castes consisting of
128 castes  and (c) backward tribes consisting of 62 tribes.
For purposes  Or <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_341">Article  16(4)</a>	 of  the  Constitution,	 the
Commission divided  the backward  classes into	(a) backward
communities consisting	of 9  castes.  (b)  backward  castes
consisting of  115 castes and (c) backward tribes consisting
of  61	 tribes.  According   to  the  Commission,  backward
communities were  those	 castes	 whose	student	 average  of

thousand of  population was  below the	State average (which
was 1.69  per thousand)	 but above  50 per cent of the State
average and  backward castes  and backward tribes were those
castes and  tribes whose  student average  was below  50 per
sent of	 the State average except in the case of Dombars and
Voddars and  those who	were Nomadic and de-notified tribes.
The total  population of  these backward classes (other then
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes,  according  to	 the
Commission, was about 45 per cent of the total population of
the State.  The difference  between the	 two lists-one under

educationally backward but which had adequate representation
in the	services from  the list	 prepared for the purpose of
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_344">Article 16(4).</a>	The Commission	recommended both for purpose

<p id="p_197">	       Total:			32 percent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">454</span>
     The above	reservation of 32 per cent along with 18 per
cent reserved  for Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes
together amounted  to 50  per cent  of the  total  seats  or
posts,	as   the  case	 may  be.   The	 Commission  further
recommended that  if seats/posts  remained unfilled  in	 the
quota allotted	to backward tribes, they should be made over
to backward  communities and  backward castes.	Similarly if
seats/posts  remain   unfilled	in  the	 quota	allotted  to
backward castes,  they	should	be  made  over	to  backward
communities and	 backward tribes.  If, however,	 seats/posts
remain unfilled	 in the quota allotted to any of those three
categories, they should be made over to Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes.  In the  event  of  seats/posts  remaining
unfilled  by   any  of	these  categories,  they  should  be
transferred to the general pool.

</p><p id="p_205">     Volumes  have   been  written   on	 the   caste  system
prevailing in  India. The  caste (varna)  has its  origin in
antiquity. We  find reference to it in the vedic lore and in
the great  epics, in the Smritis and in the Puranas. Purusha
Sukta refers  to the  prevalence of  the four Varnas (caste)
(See Rig Veda X-90-12). The Lord says in the
     (1) Writ  Petition No.  4371 of 1977 and connected writ
petitions disposed of on April 9, 1979.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">457</span>
<p id="p_206">Bhagavadgita (lV- 13) that the fourfold caste was created by
him by	the varying  distribution of  guna and	karma. Varna
Dharma is  extold in many ancient treaties. However laudable
the  division  of  society  into  different  castes  at	 the
commencement might  have been,	during the several centuries
that followed  these castes became petrified making mobility
from one  caste to another almost impossible. The caste of a
person was known by his birth. There arose in course of time
a social  hierarchy built  upon the caste system. The stigma
of low	caste was attached to a person during his whole life
with all the attendant disadvantages. Karua, the tragic hero
of the	Mahabharata though  born of a Kshatriya princess had
to suffer ignominy during his entire life time as he came to
be known  as the  son of  a charioteer (Suta) belonging to a
low caste.  He was  made to  say 'I may be a charioteer or a
charioteer's son.  I may  be anybody.  What does it matter ?
Being born  in a  (high) caste	is  God's  will	 but  valour
belongs to me.' (See Veni Samhara by Bhatta Narayana).
</p><p id="p_207">     There were	 many sub-castes of different degrees in the
hierarchy. Some were even treated as untouchables. People of
low castes  became socially  backward and they in their turn
neglected   studies.   Thus   they   became   socially	 and
educationally backward.	 This part  of the Indian history is
dismal indeed. A page of history is worth a volume of logic.
</p><p id="p_208">     We are  aware of the meanings of the words caste, race,
or tribe  or religious	minorities in  India. A	 caste is an
association  of	  families  which  practice  the  custom  of
endogamy i.e  which permits  marriages amongst	the  member.
belonging to  such families  only. Caste  rules prohibit its
members	 from	marrying  outside  their  caste.  There	 are
subgroups amongst the castes which sometimes inter marry and
sometimes do  not. A  caste is	based  on  various  factors,
sometimes it  may be  a class,	a race	or a  racial unit. A
caste has  nothing to  do with wealth. The caste of a person
is governed  by his  birth in  a family.  Certain  ideas  of
ceremonial purity  are peculiar	 to  each  caste.  Sometimes
caste practices	 even led  to segregation  of same castes in
the villages-  Even the	 choice of  occupation of members of
castes was predetermined in many cases, and the members of a
particular caste were prohibited from engaging themselves in
other types  of callings, professions or occupations Certain
occupations were  considered to	 be degrading  or impure.  A
certain amount	of rigidity developed in several matters and
many who
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">458</span>
belonged to  castes which  were lower  in social  order were
made  to   A  suffer   many  restrictions,   privations	 and
humiliations. Untouchability  was practised  against members
belonging to  certain castes. Inter dining was prohibited in
some cases.  None of  these  rules  governing  a  caste	 had
anything to  do with either the individual merit of a person
or his	capacity. The wealth owned by him would not save him
from  many   social  discriminations  practised	 by  members
belonging to higher castes. Children who grew in this caste-
ridden	atmosphere   naturally	suffered  from	many  social
disadvantages apart  from the  denial of opportunity to live
in the	same kind  of environment in which persons of higher
castes lived.  Many social  reformers have tried in the last
two centuries  to remove  the stigma  of  caste	 from  which
people born  in lower  castes were suffering. Many laws were
also passed prohibiting some of the inhuman caste practices.
<a href="/doc/1952106/" id="a_362">Article 15  (2)</a> of the Constitution provides that no citizen
shall on  grounds only	of religion, race, caste, sex, place
of birth  or any  of them  be  subject	to  any	 disability,
liability, restriction,	 or condition  with  regard  to	 (a)
access to  shops, public  restaurants, hotels  and places of
public entertainment  or (b)  use of  wells, tanks,  bathing
ghats, roads  and places  of public resort maintained wholly
or partly  out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the
general public. <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_363">Article 16 (2)</a> declared that no person shall
be ineligible to hold any civil post on grounds of religion,
race,	caste	 or   descent.	  <a href="/doc/1987997/" id="a_364">Article    17</a>	   abolished
'untouchability' and  its practice  in	any  form.  Yet	 the
disadvantages from which many of the persons who belonged to
various lower  castes were  suffering are  still  persisting
notwithstanding the  fact that	some of them have progressed
economically. socially	and educationally. Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru writes  on the  social problems  created by  tho caste
system which is peculiar to India in those terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">	  "The conception and practice of caste embodied the
     aristocratic  ideal   and	was   obviously	 opposed  to
     democratic conceptions.  It had  its  strong  sense  of
     noblesse  oblige,	 provided  people   kept  to   their
     hereditary	 stations   and	 did   not   challenge	 the
     established order.	 India's  success  and	achievements
     were on  the whole confined to the upper classes; those
     lower down	 in the scale had very few chances and their
     opportunities  were   strictly  limited.	These  upper
     classes were  not small  limited groups  but  large  in
     numbers and  there was  a difusion	 of power, authority
     and influence. Hence they carried on successfully
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">459</span>
     for a  very long  period. But the ultimate weakness and
     failing of	 the caste  system  and	 the  Indian  social
     structure were  that they	degraded  a  mass  of  human
     beings and	 gave them  no opportunities  lo get  out of
     that   condition-	  educationally,   culturally,	  or
     economically. That	 degradation brought  deterioration,
     all along	the line  including in	its scope  even	 the
     upper classes. It led to the petrification which became
     a dominant	 feature of  India's economy  and life.	 The
     contrasts	between	 this  social  structure  and  those
     existing elsewhere in the past were not great, but with
     the changes  that have  taken place  all over the world
     during the	 past few  generations they  have become far
     more pronounced.  In the  context of society today, the
     caste system  and much  that goes	with it	 are  wholly
     incompatible, reactionary,	 restrictive and barriers to
     progress. There  can  be  no  equality  in	 status	 and
     opportunity within	 its  framework	 nor  can  there  be
     political democracy  and much  less economic democracy.
     Between these two	conceptions conflict is inherent and
     only one  of them can survive." (Jawaharlal Nehru: 'The
     Discovery of  India' 1974	Edn. Chapter  VI at pp. 256-

making of  appointments by  the Union  or the States, as the
case may be. <a href="/doc/1800831/" id="a_388">Article 336</a> contained special provision for the
Anglo-Indian community	in certain services during the first
two years  after the  commencement of  the Constitution	 and

appoint a Special Officer for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes. <a href="/doc/848473/" id="a_391">Article	 338(3)</a> stated	that references to Scheduled
Castes	and  Scheduled	Tribes	in  <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_392">Article  338</a>  should  be
construed as  references to  such other	 backward classes as

Commission appointed  under <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_393">Article 340</a> by order specify and
also to the Anglo-Indian community. <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_394">Article 340</a> provided for
the  appointment   of  a  Commission  by  the  President  to
investigate the	 conditions of	socially  and  educationally
backward classes  and  the  difficulties  under	 which	they
labour, <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_395">Article 341</a> and <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_396">Article 342</a> explained what the terms
'Scheduled Castes'  and 'Scheduled  Tribes' meant. The above
Articles (<a href="/doc/818841/" id="a_397">Art.	330</a> to	<a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_398">Art. 342</a> of the Revised Draft of the
Constitution)  were   finally  passed	by  the	 Constituent
Assembly with  the amendment  that for the word 'minorities'
wherever  it  occurred	in  Part  XVI,	the  words  'certain
classes'  be  substituted  The	heading	 of  the  Part	was,
therefore,  changed   to  'Special  Provisions	Relating  to
certain Classes'.
</p><p id="p_215">     It is significant that the expression 'backward classes
used in	 Part XVI  of the Constitution and the particular in
<a href="/doc/848473/" id="a_399">Article 338(3)</a>	is used along with the Scheduled Castes, the
Scheduled Tribes  and the  Anglo-Indian	 Community.  In	 the
original Draft	Constitution, the  Muslim community  and the
Indian Christian community also had been referred to in Part
XVI. In	 the course  of the  debates, the  question  of	 the
members of  the Sikh  community was  along considered  along
with these communities. The meaning of backward classes has,
therefore, to  be deduced  having regard  to the other words
preceding it.  It is  a rule  of statutory construction that
where there  are  general  words  following  particular	 and
specific words, the general words must be confined to things
of the	same kind  as those  specified. It is true that this
rule which is called as the ejusdem generies rule or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">463</span>
the rule  noscitur a socis cannot be carried too far. But it
is reasonable  to apply	 that rule  where the specific words
refer to  a distinct  A genus  or  category.  The  Scheduled
Castes are  those castes,  races and  tribes or	 parts of or
groups	within	the  castes,  races  and  tribes  which	 are
specified in the Public Notification issued by the President
under <a href="/doc/281651/" id="a_400">Article  341(1).</a> Similarly  Scheduled Tribes are those
tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups of within
tribes or  tribal communities  which are  specified  in	 the
Public Notification  issued by	the President  under <a href="/doc/1874527/" id="a_401">Article
342(1).</a> This  is clear	from the  definitions of  'Scheduled
Castes'	 and  'Scheduled  Tribes'  in  <a href="/doc/382320/" id="a_402">Article	366(24)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/924700/" id="a_403">Article 366(25).</a>  The notifications issued under <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_404">Article 341</a>
and <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_405">Article  342</a> can  be modified  only by a law made by the
Parliament (Vide  <a href="/doc/1581845/" id="a_406">Article 341(2)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1418692/" id="a_407">Article  342(2).</a> It is
thus seen  that Part  XVI of  the  Constitution	 deals	with
certain concessions  extended to  certain castes, tribes and
races which are Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and to
the Anglo-Indian  community. In the above context if <a href="/doc/848473/" id="a_408">Article
338(3)</a>	and   <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_409">Article  340</a>  are	 construed,  the  expression
'backward classes'  can only refer to certain castes, races,
tribes or  communities or parts thereof other than Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled  Tribes and  the  Anglo-Indian  community,
which are  backward. Thus  view also  gains support from the
resolution  regarding	the  aims   and	  objects   of	 the
Constitution  moved   by  Pandit  Jawaharlal  Nehru  in	 the
Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946. He sid: E
     "I beg to move:
</p><p id="p_216">     (1)  This Constituent  Assembly declares  its firm	 and

     willing contribution  to the  promotion of	 world peace
     and the welfare of mankind." (Underlining by us)
     Clause (6)	 of the	 above resolution  which  was  later
adopted by the Constituent Assembly pledged to make adequate
safeguards in the Constitution for 'minorities, backward and
tribal areas  and depressed  and other backward classes' The
above resolution  and the  history of  the enactment of Part
XVI of	the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly lead to
the conclusion	that backward classes are only those castes,
races, tribes or communities, which are identified by birth,
which are backward. It is, therefore, difficult to hold that
persons or  groups of  persons who  are backward  merely  on
account of  poverty which  is traceable	 to economic reasons
can also  be considered	 as backward classes for purposes of
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_410">Article 16(4)</a> and Part XVI of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">465</span>
<p id="p_218">     The word  'backward' was  not there  before  the  words

of  the	 Constitution  (the  personal  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_412">Article	16(4)).</a>	 The
Drafting  Committee  presided  over  by	 Dr.  B.R.  Ambedkar

introducing that term as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">     "Supposing, for  instance, reservations were made for a
     community or  a collection of communities, the total of

     posts under the State and only 30 per cent are retained
     as	 the   unreserved,  could   anybody  say   that	 the
     reservation  of   30  per	 cent  as  open	 to  general
     competition would	be satisfactory	 from the  point  of
     view of  giving effect  to the  first principle, namely
     that there	 shall be equality of opportunity? It cannot
     be in  my judgment. Therefore the seats to be reserved,
     if the  reservation is to be consistent with sub-clause
     (1) of  <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_413">Article 10</a>,  must be  confined to a minority of
     seats. It	is then	 only that the first principle could
     find its  place in the Constitution and effective (sic)
     in operation.  If Honourable  Member under	 stand	this
     position then  we have to safeguard two things, namely,
     the principle  of equality	 of opportunity	 and at	 the
     same time	satisfy the demand of communities which have

     sure they	will agree  that unless	 you use  some	such

     favour of	reservation will  ultimately eat up the rule
     altogether Nothing	 of the	 rule  will  remain."  (Vide
     Constituent Assembly  Debates, 1948-1949, Vol. VII, pp.</blockquote>
<p id="p_219">     701-702). F
     The Drafting  Committee by	 qualifying  the  expression
classes of  citizens' by  'backward' in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_414">Article 16(4)</a> of the
Constitution tried  to reconcile  three different  points of
view  and   produced  a	  workable  proposition	  which	 was
acceptable to  all, the	 three points of view being (1) that
there should be equality of opportunity for all citizens and
that every individual qualified for a particular post should
be free	 to apply for that post, to sit for examinations and
to have his qualifications tested so as to determine whether
he was fit for the post or not and that there ought to be no
limitations, there ought to be no hindrance in the operation
of the principle of equality of opportunity; (2) that if the
principle of equality of opportunity was to be operative the
Ought to b no reservations of any sort for any class or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">466</span>
community at all and that all citizens if they are qualified
should be A placed on the same footing of equality as far as
public services	 were concerned	 and  (3)  that	 though	 the
principle of  equality of opportunity was theoritically good
there must  at the  same time  be a  provision made  for the
entry of  certain communities which have so far been outside
the administration.  The whole	tenor of  discussion in	 the
Constituent Assembly  pointed to  making reservation  for  a
minority of  the population  including Scheduled  Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  which were  socially backward.  During the
discussion, the Constitution (first Amendment) Bill by which
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_415">Article 15(4)</a>  was  introduced,	 Dr.  Ambedkar	referred  to
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_416">Article 16(4)</a>  and said	 that backward	classes are 'nothing
else but  a collection	of  certain  castes'  (Parliamentary
Debates 1951,  Third Session,  Part Ir Vol. Xll at p. 9007).
This statement leads to a reasonable inference that this was
the meaning  which  the	 Constituent  Assembly	assigned  to
classes' at any rate so far as Hindus were concerned.
</p><p id="p_220">     In Balaji's  case (supra)	and  in	 Chifralekha's	case
(supra) this Court exhibited a lot of hesitation in equating
the expression 'class' with 'caste' for purposes of Articles
15(4) and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_417">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution. It observed, as
stated	earlier,  that	while  caste  might  be	 a  relevant
circumstance to	 determine a  backward class,  it could not,
however, be  dominant test. One of the reasons given for not
accepting caste	 insofar as  Hindu community  in which caste
system was  prevalent was  concerned as	 a dominant test for
determining  a	 backward  class  was  that  as	 there	were
communities without  castes, nothing prevented the makers of
the Constitution  to use the expression 'backward classes or
castes'.  The  juxtaposition  of  the  expression  'backward
classes'  and  'Scheduled  Castes'  in	<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_418">Article	 15</a>  of	 the
Constitution, according to the above two decisions, led to a
reasonable  inference  that  expression	 'classes'  was	 not
synonymous  with  'caste'.  The	 Court	while  making  these
observations did  not give  adequate importance to the evils
of caste  system which had led to the backwardness of people
belonging to  certain castes  and the  debates that preceded
the enactment  of Part	XVI and	 <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_419">Article 15(4)</a>	and  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_420">Article
16(4)</a> of the Constitution- What was in fact overlooked ! was
the history of the Indian social institutions. The makers of
the Il	Indian Constitution very well knew that there were a
number of  i castes  the conditions  of whose  members	were
almost similar to the conditions of members belonging to the
Scheduled Castes  and to  the Scheduled Tribes and that they
also needed  to be  given adequate  protection in order tide
over the difficulties in the way of their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">467</span>
progress which	were not  so much  due to poverty but due to
their birth in a particular caste. As mentioned elsewhere in
the  course  of	 this  judgement.  the	word  'classes'	 was
substituted in	the place  of the  word 'communities' by the
Constituent Assembly  just at  the  last  moment.  The	word
community meant a caste amongst Hindus or Muslims, or Indian
Christians or  Anglo-Indians. Part  XVI was  not enacted for
the purpose  of alleviating the conditions of poorer classes
as such which was taken care of by the provisions of Part IV
of the	Constitution and  in particular by <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_421">Article 46</a> and by
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_422">Article 14</a>,  <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_423">Art. 15(1)</a>	 and <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_424">Art.  16(1)</a> of the Constitution
which  permitted   classification  of  persons	on  economic
grounds for special treatment in order to ensure equality of
opportunity to all person.
</p><p id="p_221">	   It is of significance that the views expressed by
this Court, however, stood modified by the decisions of this
Court in  <a href="/doc/1342109/" id="a_425">Minor P.  Rajendran v.  State of Madras &amp; Ors</a>.,(l)

Medical Colleges  on the  basis of  the district  to which a
candidate belonged  was not  warranted by  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_428">Art.	 15(4</a>),	 the
Court observed that a caste was also a class of citizens and
if the	caste as  a whole  was	socially  and  educationally
backward reservation  could be	made in favour of such caste
under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_429">Art.  1 5(4)</a>  In Sagar's	case (supra)  reservation of
seats was  done solely	on the	basis of caste or community.
There appeared	to be  no determination	 of the fact whether
members belonging to such castes or communities were in fact
socially and  educationally backward.  The court struck down
the reservation	 as being  outside Article  I  C(4)  of	 the
Constitution. The Court. however, observed at page 600 thus:

     beneficaries of the special provision are classes which

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">	  "In ascertaining social backwardness of a class of

     of the  group of citizens. Caste cannot however be made
     the sole  or dominant  test. Social  backwardness is in
     the ultimate  analysis the result of poverty to a large
     extent. Social  backwardness which results from poverty
     is likely	to be  aggravated by considerations of their
     caste. This  shows the  relevance	of  both  caste	 and
     poverty in	 deter- mining the backwardness of citizens.</blockquote>
<p id="p_231">     Poverty by	 itself is  not the  determining  factor  of
     social backwardness. Poverty is relevant in the context
     of social	backwardness. The  Commission found that the
     lower   income    group   constitutes    socially	 and
     educationally  backward   classes.	 The  basis  of	 the
     reservation is  not income	 but social  and educational
     backwardness  determined	on  the	 basis	of  relevant
     criteria. If  any classification of backward classes of
     citizens is  based solely	on the caste of the citizens
     it will  perpetuate the vice of caste system. Again, if
     the classification	 is based  solely on poverty it will
     not be  logical. The society is taking steps for uplift
     of the people. In such a task groups or classes who are
     socially and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">474</span>
educationally backward	are helped by the society. That A is
the philosophy	of our	Constitution. It  is in this context
that social  backwardness  which  results  from	 poverty  is
likely to be magnified by caste considerations. Occupations,
place  of   habitation	may  also  be  relevant	 factors  in
determining who	 are  socially	and  educationally  backward
classes.  Social   and	economic  considerations  come	into
operation in  solving the  problem and	evolving the  proper
criteria of  determining  which	 classes  are  socially	 and
educationally  backward.   That	 is   why  our	Constitution
provided  for  special	consideration  socially	 and  educa-
tionally backward  classes of  citizens	 as  also  Scheduled
Castes and  Tribes. It	is only by directing the society and
the State  to offer  them  all	facilities  for	 social	 and
educational uplift that the problem is solved. It is in that
context that  the Commission  in the present case found that
income of the classes of citizens mentioned in Appendix VIII
was a  relevant	 factor	 in  determining  their	 social	 and
educational backwardness."
</p><p id="p_232">     When once	the relevance  of caste	 is not	 adhered  to
several difficulties  might arise  as can  be seen  from the
decision in  the <a href="/doc/1734464/" id="a_461">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Pradip Tandon and
Ors</a>.,(1) In  that case the Court had to examine the validity

(1) those  who came  from rural areas and (2) those who came

of Uttar Pradesh v. Pradip Tandon</a>'s case (supra) Court first
rejected  the	plea  that   party  could   be	a  basis  of

	  "In Balaji's	case (supra)  the  Court  said	that

     result of	poverty to  a  large  extent  and  that	 the
     problem of	 back  ward  classes  is  in  substance	 the
     problem of	 rural India.  Extracting these observations
     the Attorney General contended that poverty is not only
     relevant but is one, of the elements in determining the
     social backwardness.  We are  unable to accept the test
     of	 poverty   as  the   determining  factor  of  social
     backwardness." D
     Then it  held that	 reservation for  rural areas on the
ground of  poverty was	unconstitutional.  In  doing  so  it
observed at page 769 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">	  "The	reservation   for  rural   areas  cannot  be
     sustained on  the ground that the rural areas represent
     socially  and   educationally   backward	classes	  of

     majority population  of the  State. 80  per cent of the
     population of  the State cannot be a homogeneous class.
     Poverty  in   rural  areas	  cannot  be  the  basis  of
     classification to	support reservation for rural areas.
     Poverty  is  found	 in  all  parts	 of  India.  In	 the
     instructions for  reservation of  seats it	 is provided
     that in  the application  form a candidate for reserved
     seats from rural areas must submit a certificate of the
     District  Magistrate   of	the  District  to  which  he
     belonged that  he was  born in  rural area	 and  had  a
     permanent home  there, and is residing there or that he
     was born  in India	 and his  parents and  guardians are
     still living there and earn their livelihood there. The
     incident of  birth in  rural areas	 is made  the  basic
     qualification. No	reservation can be made on the basis

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">476</span>
<p id="p_236">     But it  upheld the	 reservations made  in favour of the
hill and  A Uttrakhand areas with these observations at page
767:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">	  "The hill  and Uttrakhand  areas in  Uttar Pradesh
     are instance  of socially	and  educationally  backward
     classes for  these reasons.  Backwardness is  judged by
     economic basis  that each region has its own measurable
     possibilities for	the maintenance	 of  human  numbers,
     standards	of   living  and  fixed	 property.  From  an
     economic point of view the classes of citizens are back
     ward when	they do not make effective use of resources.
     When large	 areas of land maintain a sparse, disorderly
     and illiterate  population whose  property is small and
     negligible	 the   element	of  social  backwardness  is
     observed. When  effective territorial specialisation is
     not possible  in the  absence of means of communication
     and technical  processes as  in the hill and Uttrakhand
     areas the	people	are  socially  backward	 classes  of
     citizens. Neglected  opportunities and people in remote
     places raise walls of social backwardness of people.
	  Educational  backwardness   is  ascertained	with

     traditional apathy	 for education	on account of social
     and   environ   mental   conditions   or	occupational

<p id="p_237">     The reading  of the  above passages shows that there is
inherent inconsistency	between one part of the decision and
the other.  The Court  could not  have arrived	at  the	 two
divergent conclusions  set  out	 above	since  many  of	 the
reasons urged by the State Government were almost identical.
This is	 due to the earlier approach adopted by the Court to
the question.  If caste had been taken into consideration as
a relevant  test which	could not  be ignored in determining
the classes  entitled to  the benefit  of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_467">Article 15 (4)</a> and

<p id="p_238">     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_469">Article 14</a>	 of the	 Constitution consists of two parts.
It asks	 the State not to deny to any person equality before
law. It	 also asks  A  the  State  not	to  deny  the  equal
protection of the laws. Equality before law connotes absence
of  any	  discrimination  in   law.  The  concept  of  equal
protection required  the  State	 to  meet  out	differential
treatment to  persons in  different situations	in order  to
establish an  equilibrium amongst  all. This is the basis of
the rule  that equals should be treated equally and unequals
must be	 treated unequally if the doctrine of equality which
is one	of the	corner stones  of our  Constitution is to be
duly implemented.  In order  to do justice amongst unequals,
the State  has	to  resort  to	compensatory  or  protective
discrimination, <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_470">Article	 15 (4)</a>	 and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_471">Article  16 (4)</a>  of the

to such	 persons only.	But if	there are persons who do not
belong to  socially oppressed  castes and minorities but who
otherwise belong  to weaker  sections, due to poverty, place
of habitation,	want of	 equal opportunity etc. the question
arises whether	such reservation can be made in their favour
under any  other  provision  of	 the  Constitution  such  as
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_472">Article 14</a>,  <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_473">Article 15	 (1</a>), <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_474">Article  16 (1)</a> or <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_475">Article 46.</a>
The decision  in <a href="/doc/1130169/" id="a_476">State of Kerala and Anr. v. N.M. Thomas and
Ors</a>.(l) which  was rendered  by 15  a Bench of seven learned
Judges of  this Court  attempted  to  deal  with  the  above
question. The  facts of that case were these: Rule 13 (a) of
the Kerala  State Subordinate  Service Rules,  1958 provided
that no	 person would  be eligible  for appointment  to	 any
service	 or  any  post	unless	he  possessed  such  special
qualifications and had passed such special tests as might be
prescribed in  that behalf  in the  Ir	Special	 Rules.	 For
promotion of  a lower division clerk to the next higher post
of upper  division clerk,  the Government prescribed certain
departmental tests.  By Rule  13A which was introduced later
on temporary  exemption was given for a period of two years.
That Rule  also provided  that an  employee who did not pass
the unified  departmental tests	 within the  period  of	 two
years from  the date  of introduction  of the tests would be
reverted to  the lower post and further stated that he would
not be eligible for appointment under that Rule. Proviso (2)
to this Rule gave temporary exemption for an extended period
of two years in the case of candidates belonging

<p id="p_239">  to   Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes.  When	 the
Government  A  found  that  a  large  number  of  candidates
belonging to  Scheduled Castes	and  Scheduled	Tribes	were
facing reversion  under that  Rule, on a representation made
on their  behalf, it  gave exemption  to them  for a further
period of two years by promulgating Rule 13A. As a result of
this Rule, respondent No. I in the above case who had passed

     with   reference	to   the   purpose   of	  law.	 The
     classification in the present case is justified because
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">479</span>
     the purpose  of classification  is to enable members of
     Scheduled Castes and Tribes to find representation by A
     promotion to  a limited  extent. From the point of view
     of time a differential treatment is given to members of
     Scheduled Castes  and Tribes  for the purpose of giving
     them equality consistent with efficiency".</blockquote>
<p id="p_240">     Khanna, J.	 who upheld  the judgment  of the High Court
was of the view that since the impugned Rule did not get the
protection of  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_490">Article 16  (4)</a> which  was the only provision
under which preferential treatment could be given to members
belonging  to	backward  classes,   Scheduled	Castes	 and
Scheduled Tribes,  the Rule could not be upheld on the basis
of classification under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_491">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_492">Article 16 (1)</a> of the
Constitution. The  learned Judge  observed at  pages 939-940
thus;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">	  "It has  been argued	on behalf  of the appellants
     that equality  of treatment  does not forbid reasonable
     classification. Reference	in this	 context is  made to
     the well  accepted principle  that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_493">Article	 14</a>  of	 the
     Constitution forbids  class legislation  but  does	 not
     forbid classification.  Permissible classification,  it
     is equally	 well established,  must be  founded  on  an
     intelligible differential	which distinguishes  persons
     or things	that arc  grouped together  from others left
     out of  the group	and the	 differential  must  have  a
     rational relation	to the	object sought to be achieved
     by the  statute in	 question. It is urged that the same
     principle should apply when the court is concerned with
     the equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters
     P relating	 to employment	or appointment to any office
     under the	State. In  this respect	 I may	observe that
     this   Court    has   recognised	the   principle	  of
     classification in	the context of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_494">article
     16</a> in matters where appointments are from two different
     sources, e.g. guards and station masters, promotees and
     direct  recruits,	degree	holder	and  diploma  holder
     engineers. [See  All India	 Station Masters  and Asstt.

     we are concerned, however, is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">480</span>
whether we  can extend the above principle of classification
so as  to allow	 preferential treatment	 to employees on the
ground that  they are  members of  the scheduled  castes and
scheduled tribes.  So far as this question is concerned I am
of the view that the provision of preferential treatment for
members of  backward classes, including scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes, is that contained in clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_497">article
16</a> which  permits reservation of posts for them. There is no
scope for  spelling out such preferential treatment from the
language of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_498">article 16</a> because the language of
that clause  does not  warrant any preference to any citizen
against another	 citizen. The opening words of clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_499">article 16</a>  that "nothing  in this article shall prevent the
State from  making any	provision  for	the  reservation  of
appointments  or  posts	 in  favour  of	 backward  class  of
citizens' indicate that but for clause (4) it would not have
been permissible  to make any reservation of appointments or
posts in favour of any backward class of citizens."
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_76">     Khanna, J. proceeded to observe at page 944 thus:
	  "The matter  can also	 be locked  at from  another
     angle.  If	  it  was  permissible	to  accord  favoured
     treatment to  members of  backward classes under clause
     (1) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_500">article 16</a>,  there would have been no necessity
     of inserting  clause (4)  in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_501">article  16.</a> Clause (4) in
     <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_502">Article 16</a> in such an event would have to be treated as
     wholly superfluous	 and redundant.	 The normal  rule of
     interpretation is that no provision of the Constitution
     to be  treated as	redundant and superfluous. The Court
     would, therefore,	be reluctant  to accept a view which
     would have	 the  effect  of  rendering  clause  (4)  of
     <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_503">Article 16</a> redundant and superfluous".</blockquote>
<p id="p_242">     Mathew, J.	 more or  less agreed with Ray, C.J. He said
at pages 954-955 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_77">	  "It is  said	that  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_504">Article  16  (4)</a>	specifically
     provides for reservation of posts in favour of backward
     classes which  according to  the decision of this Court
     would  include   the  power   of  the   State  to	make
     reservation at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">481</span>
     stage of  promotion also  and therefore  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_505">Article 16 (1)</a>
     cannot include within its compass the power to give any
     adventitious aids	by legislation	or otherwise  to the
     back ward	classes which  would  derogate	from  strict
     numerical equality.  If reservation is necessary either
     at the initial stage or at the stage of promotion or at
     both to  ensure for the members of the Scheduled Castes
     and Scheduled  Tribes equality  of opportunity  in	 the
     matter of	employment, l  see no reason why that is not
     permissible under	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_506">Article 16  (1)</a> as  that alone might
     put them  on a  parity with  the forward communities in
     the matter	 of achieving  the result  which equality of
     opportunity would produce. Whether there is equality of
     opportunity can be gauged only by the equality attained
     in the  result. Formal  equality of  opportunity simply
     enables people  with more education and intelligence to
     capture  all  the	posts  and  to	win  over  the	less
     fortunate	in   education	and  talent  even  when	 the
     competition is  fair. Equality of result is the test of
     equality of opportunity".</blockquote>
<p id="p_243">     Beg, J.  (as he  then was)	 agreed	 with  the  view  of
Khanna, J. that the principle of classification could not be
extended to  cases of  this nature  but upheld	the Rule  as
squarely falling  within the scope of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_507">Article 16 (4)</a> itself.
He observed at page 959:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">	  "Strictly speaking, the view adopted by my learned

     available to  members of  backward classes of citizens,
     is exhausted  by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_508">Article  16 (4)</a>  of the  Constitution,
     seems inescapable. <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_509">Article 16</a> is, after all, a facet of
     the grand	principles embraced  by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_510">Article	 14</a>  of	 our

     absolute terms.  It is  a necessary  consequence and  a
     special application of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_511">Article 14</a> in an important field
     where denial  of  equality	 of  opportunity  cannot  be
     permit ted.  While <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_512">Article 16 (1)</a> sets out the positive
     aspect of	equality of  opportunity in matters relating
     to employment  by the  State, <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_513">Article 16 (2)</a> negatively

<p id="p_244">     Beg, J.  (as he then was) proceeded to hold at page 961
thus:
</p><p id="p_245">	  "Members of a backward class could be said to be
discriminated against  if severer  tests were prescribed for
them. But,  this is  not the position in the case before us.
All promotees,	belonging to any class, caste, or creed, are
equally subjected  to efficiency  tests of the same type and
standard. The  impugned rules  do not  dispense	 with  these
tests for  any class  or group. Indeed, such tests could not
be dispensed  with for employees from Scheduled Castes, even
as a  backward class,  keeping in  view	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_521">Article 335</a>  of the  Constitution. All	that happens here is
that the  backward class  of employees	is  given  a  longer
period of  time to pass the efficiency tests and prove their
merits as  determined by such tests. It has been, therefore,
argued that, in this respect, there is substantial equality.
In other words, the argument is that if <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_522">Article 16 (1)</a> could
be interpreted	a little less rigidly and more liberally the
discrimination involved	 here will not fall outside it. Even
if this	 was a	tenable view,  I would,	 for all the reasons
given here,  prefer to	find the  justification, if  this is
possible, in  the  express  provisions	of  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_523">Article  16	 (4)</a>

lie."
</p><p id="p_246">     Krishna Iyer,  J. after  recording the statement of the

Scheduled Tribes. Perhaps he would have struck down the Rule
if the	benefit A  of the  Rule had  been extended  to other
backward classes  as can  be seen from the following passage
occurring at page 981:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">	  "If <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_527">Art.  14</a> admits  of reasonable classification,
     so does  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_528">Art. 16(1)</a>  and this Court has held so. In the
     present case, the economic advancement and promotion of
     the  claims   of  the   grossly  under-represented	 and
     pathetically neglected  classes, otherwise described as
     Scheduled Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes,	consistently
     with the  maintenance of  administrative efficiency, is
     the object, constitutionally sanctioned by Arts. 46 and
     335 and  reasonably accommodated  in  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_529">Art.	 16(1).</a>	 The
     differentia so  loudly obtrusive,	is the dismal social
     milieu of	harijans.  Certainly  this  has	 a  rational
     relation to the object set out above. I must repeat the
     note  of	caution	 earlier   struck.  Not	  all  caste
     backwardness is recognised in this formula. To do so is
     subversive of  both <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_530">Art.  16(1)</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_531">(2).</a>	 The  social
     disparity must  be so  grim and substantial as to serve
     as a foundation for benign discrimination. If we search
     for such  a class,	 we cannot  find any  large  segment
     other than	 the Scheduled	Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
     Any other caste, securing exemption from <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_532">Art. 16(1)</a> and
     <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_533">(2</a>), by exerting political pressure or other influence,
     will   run	   the	 high	risk   of   unconstitutional
     discrimination. If	 the real basis of classification is
     caste masked  as backward	class, the Court must strike
     at	  such	  communal   manipulation.   Secondly,	 the
     Constitution recognizes  the claims  of  only  harijans
     (<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_534">Art. 335</a>) and not of every backward class. The profile
     of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_535">Art. 46</a> is more or less the same. So, we may readily
     hold that	casteism cannot	 come back  by the back door
     and, except in exceptionally rare cases, no class other
     than  Harijans   can  jump	  the  gauntlet	  of  'equal

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_80">     "<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_543">Article 335</a>  of the Constitution contains a mandate to

     for the  respondent No.  I submitted  that the  mandate
     given in  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_544">Art. 335</a>	 is  violated  because	by  granting
     exemption to  the members	of the	scheduled castes and

     be impaired.  We are, however, unable to agree with the
     argument. Both  the respondent  No. I and the promotees
     were members  of the  same service and had been working
     as Lower  Division Clerks	for a  pretty long time. The
     promotees were  members of	 the  scheduled	 castes	 and
     tribes are	 admittedly senior  to respondent  No. I and
     have gained  more experience. Further the rule does not
     grant complete  exemption to the promotees from passing
     the test;	it only	 provides for  grant of extension of
     time to  enable  them  to	clear  the  test.  In  these

<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_548">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution was a complete code so far
as reservation	of posts  A was concerned. The learned Judge
observed at page 1002 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_81">	  "Clause (4)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_549">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution cannot

     the question  that arises is that can be done to enable
     them to  join the	services and  have a  sense of equal
     participation. One	 course	 is  to	 make  a  reasonable
     classification under  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_552">Art. 16(1)</a> in the manner to which
     I have  already adverted  in great	 detail.  The  other
     method to	achieve the  end may  be  to  make  suitable
     reservation for  the backward  classes in such a way so
     that the  inadequate  representation  of  the  backward
     classes in	 the services is made adequate. This form of

     point. That  is to	 say clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_554">Art. 16</a> is not an

<p id="p_250">     16(1) itself.  Since clause  (4) is a special provision

     can be made under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_560">Art. 16(1)".</a> (Emphasis added)
     The result	 is that  at least according to four learned
Judges	-   Khanna;  Beg,   Gupta  and	Fazal  Ali,  JJ.  no
reservation of	posts can be made in Government services for
backward classes  including Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled
Tribes under  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_561">Article 14</a>  or  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_562">Article  16(1).</a>  According  to

given under  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_563">Article  16(1)</a>  to	 the  Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled Tribes  only. Other  backward classes	 could	not,
except in  exceptionally rare  cases be	 extended  the	same

     Now reverting  to the  power of  the Government to make

and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_568">Article  16(4)</a> of  the Constitution	 is no doubt left to
the Government. But it is not open to the Government to call
any caste or group or community as backward according to its
sweet will  and pleasure and extend the benefits that may be
granted under  those provisions	 to such  caste or  group or
community.  The	  exercise  of	uncontrolled  power  by	 the
Government in  this regard may lead to political favouritism
leading to  denial of the just requirements of classes which
are truly  backward. The power of the Government to classify
any caste  or group  or community  as  backward	 has  to  be
exercised in  accordance with  the guidelines  that  can  be
easily gathered	 from the  Constitution. It  is now accepted
that the  expressions 'socially	 and educationally  backward
classes of  citizens' and  'the	 Scheduled  Castes  and	 the
Scheduled Tribes'  in  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_569">Article	15(4)</a>  of  the	Constitution
together are  equivalent to backward classes of citizens' in
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_570">Article	 16(4).</a>	  Dealing  with	 the  question	whether	 any
particular caste  or group  or community could be treated as
socially and  educationally backward for purposes of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_571">Article
15(4</a>), the  Court observed  in Balaji's case (supra) at page
465 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_82">     "Therefore, we  are not  satisfied that  the State	 was
     justified in taking the view that communities or castes
     whose ave	rage of	 student population was the same as,
     or just  below, the State average, should be treated as
     educationally back	 ward classes  of citizens.  If	 the
     test has  to be  applied be  a reference  to the  State
     average of	 student population,  the legitimate view to
     take would	 be  that  the	classes	 of  citizens  whose
     average  is  well	or  substantially  below  the  State
     average can be treated as educationally backward."</blockquote>
<p id="p_251">     This was further explained by Shah, J. (as he then was)
in Sagar's  case (supra) when he observed that the criterion
for deter  mining the  backwardness must not be based solely
on religion,  race, caste,  sex or  place of  birth and	 the
backwardness being social and educational must be similar to
the backwardness  from which  the Scheduled  Castes and	 the
Scheduled Tribes  suffered. A  Constitution, Bench  of	this
Court reiterated the above principle in Janki Prasad Parimoo
&amp; Ors. etc. etc. v. State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir &amp; Ors. in which
it was observed at page 252 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_83">     (1) [1973] 3 S.C.R. 236.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">487</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_84">     "That accounts  for the raison d 'etre of the principle
     explained in  Balaji's  case  which  pointed  out	that
     backward	  classes  for	 whose	improvement  special
     provision was  contemplated by  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_572">Article 15(4)</a>  must  be
     comparable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who
     are standing  examples  of	 backwardness  socially	 and
     educationally".</blockquote>
<p id="p_252">     This  view	  is  in   conformity  with   the  intention
underlying clause  (6) of  the resolution regarding the aims
and objects of the Constitution moved by Jawaharlal Nehru on
December 13,  1946 which  asked the  Constituent Assembly to
frame  a  Constitution	providing  adequate  safeguards	 for
minorities, backward  and tribal  areas	 and  depressed	 and
other backward	classes and  also  with	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_573">Article 338</a>  and <a href="/doc/1559958/" id="a_574">Article 340</a> of the Constitution. Unless the
above restriction  is imposed  on the  Government, it  would
become possible	 for the  Government to	 call any  caste  or
group or  community which  constitutes a  powerful political
lobby in the State as backward even though in fact it may be
an advanced  caste or group or community but just below some
other forward  community. There	 is another important reason
why such advanced castes or groups or communities should not
be included in the list of backward classes and that is that
if castes  or groups  and communities  which are fairly well
advanced and  castes and  groups and  communities which	 are
really	backward   being  at   the  rock-bottom	  level	 are
classified together  as backward  classes,  the	 benefit  of
reservation  would  invariably	be  eaten  up  by  the	more
advanced sections  and the  really deserving  sections would
practically  go	 without  any  benefit	as  more  number  of
children  of   the  more   advanced  castes   or  groups  or
communities amongst them would have scored higher marks than
the  children	of  more   backward  castes   or  groups  or
communities. In	 that event  the whole object of reservation
would become  frustrated. It  is stated	 that it  was with a
view to avoiding this anomalous situation, the Government of
Devaraj Urs  had to  appoint the  Havanur Commission to make
recommendations for  the purpose of effectively implementing
the objects of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_575">Article 15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_576">Article 16(4).</a> Hence as far
as possible  while preparing  the list	of backward classes,
the State Government has to bear in mind the above principle
as a  guiding factor.  The adoption  of the  above principle
will not  unduly reduce	 the number  of persons	 who will be
eligible for  the benefits  under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_577">Article  15(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_578">Article
16(4)</a> of  the Constitution since over the years the level of
the Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled Tribes is also going up
by reason of several remedial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">488</span>
measure taken  in regard  to them  by the  State and Central
Government. At	the same  time, it  will  also	release	 the
really backward	 castes, groups	 and  communities  from	 the
strangle-hold of  many advanced	 groups which  have had	 the
advantage of  reservation along	 with  the  really  backward
classes for  nearly three  decades. It	is  time  that	more
attention is  given to	those castes, and groups communities
who have  been at  the lowest  level suffering	from all the
disadvantages	 and	 disabilities	 (except     perhaps
untouchability) to  which many	of the	Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  have been  exposed but without the same or
similar advantages that flow from being included in the list
of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
</p><p id="p_253">     Since economic  condition is also a relevant criterion,
it would be appropriate to incorporate a 'means test' as one
of the	tests in determining the backwardness as was done by
the Kerala  Government in Jayasree's case (supra). These two
tests namely,  that the	 conditions of	caste  or  group  or
community should  be more  or less similar to the conditions
in which  the  Scheduled  Castes  or  Scheduled	 Tribes	 are
situated and  that the	income of  the family  to which	 the
candidate belongs  does not exceed the specified limit would
serve as useful criteria in determining beneficiaries of any
reservation to	be made under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_579">Article 15(4).</a> For the purpose
of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_580">Article  16(4)</a> however,  it should also be shown that the
backward  class	 in  question  is  in  the  opinion  of	 the
Government not	adequately  represented	 in  the  Government
services.
</p><p id="p_254">     There is one other basis on which a classification made
for purposes  of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_581">Article  15 (4)</a>  or <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_582">Article  16 (4)</a>  of the
Constitution has  received the	approval of  this  Court  in
Chitralekha's case  (supra). In	 that  case  the  Court	 was
concerned with	a list	of backward  classes prepared on the
basis of  economic condition  and occupation.  According  to
that Government	 order, persons	 whose family income was Rs.
1,200 per  annum or less and who were engaged in occupations
such as	 agriculture.  petty  business,	 inferior  services,
crafts or  other occupations  involving manual	labour	were
treated as belonging to backward classes. The petitioner who
had filed  the petition	 in the High Court did not challenge
the validity of the said classification. But on a submission
made on	 behalf of the State Government, the Court expressed
its general  approval to  the method of classification. Even
in the	case before us now, there is a reservation of 15 per
cent of	 seats of posts in favour of members falling under a
classification styled  as 'special  group' which is based on
similar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">489</span>
occupation-cum-income considerations.  Even here  no serious
objection is  taken by	any party to the said classification
treating A  persons who	 satisfied the	prescribed tests  as
being eligible	for reservation.  It is	 apparent that	this
'special group'	 is  a	creature  of  social,  economic	 and
political necessity.  Since a  classification  made  on	 the
above said basis has received the approval of a Constitution
Bench  of   equal  strength   and  its	correctness  is	 not
challenged before  us, we  treat this  classification  as  a
valid  one   even  though   a  criticism  of  this  kind  of
classification was made, not unjustifiably as we now see, by
the Mysore  High Court	in D.G.	 Viswanath's  case.(1)	This
classification would  include persons  of all castes, groups
and communities	 provided the  two tests  namely, occupation
test and income test are satisfied.
</p><p id="p_255">     Next comes the vexed question relating to the extent of
reservation that  can be  made under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_583">Art. 15 (4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_584">Art. 16
(4)</a> of the Constitution. In Balaji's case (supra) this Court
took the  view that  since <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_585">Article 15 (4)</a> is an exception to
<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_586">Article 15 (1)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_587">Article 16 (4)</a> is an exception to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_588">Article
16 (1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_589">(2)</a> any reservation made under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_590">Article 15 (4)</a> and
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_591">Article 16  (4)</a> should	not exceed  50 per cent of the total
number of seats or posts, as the case may be. The Court held
that reservation  of 68	 per cent  of seats under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_592">Article 15
(4)</a> which  was a  special provision  was invalid.  The Court
further held  that 'speaking  generally and in a broad way a
special ID  provision should  be less  than 50 per cent, how
much less  than 50  per cent  would depend upon the relevant
prevailing circumstances  in each  case'. This statement was
understood by  a Constitution  Bench of	 this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1466728/" id="a_593">T.
Devadasan v.  The Union	 of India and Anr</a>.(2) as laying down
the rule that reservation under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_594">Article 15 (4)</a> or <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_595">Article 16
(4)</a> could not be more than 50 per cent of seats or posts. In
that case  Mudholkar, J.  speaking for	the majority said at
page 698:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_85">	  "Even if  the	 Government  had  provided  for	 the
     reservation of  posts for Scheduled Castes and Tribes a
     cent per  cent reservation of vacancies to be filled in
     a particular year or reservation of vacancies in excess
     of 50  per cent  would, according	to the	decision  in
     Balaji's case, not be constitutional".

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">490</span>
<p id="p_256">     But in  the <a href="/doc/1130169/" id="a_596">State of Kerala and Anr. v. N.M. Thomas and
Ors</a>. (supra) the question relating to the permissible extent
of reservation	arose for  consideration. Ray,	C.J. came to
the conclusion	that taking  into consideration	 the  entire
Government service,  there was no excessive concession shown
to the	employees belonging  to	 the  Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled Tribes.  Beg, J.  (as he then was) was also of the
same view. Fazal Ali, J. Observed at page 1005 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_87">	  "This means  that the reservation should be within
     the permissible  limits and  should not  be a  cloak to
     fill all  the posts  belonging to a particular class of
     citizens  and   thus  violate   <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_597">Art.  16	(1)</a>  of	 the
     Constitution indirectly. At the same time clause (4) of
     <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_598">Art. 16</a>  does not	fix any	 limit on  the power  of the
     Government to  make reservation.  Since clause (4) is a
     part of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_599">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution it is manifest that
     the State	cannot be  allowed to  indulge in  excessive
     reservation so  as to  defeat the	policy contained  in
     <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_600">Art. 16 (1).</a> As to what would be a suitable reservation
     within permissible	 limits will  depend upon  the facts
     and circumstances	of each	 case and  no hard  and fast
     rule can  be laid	down, nor can this matter be reduced
     to a mathematical formula so as to be adhered to in all
     cases. Decided  cases of  this Court have no doubt laid
     down that	the percentage	of  reservation	 should	 not
     exceed 50 per cent. As I read the authorities, this is,
     however, a	 rule of  caution and  does not	 exhaust all
     categories. Suppose  for instance	a State	 has a large
     number of backward classes of citizens which constitute
     80 per  cent of  the population  and the Government, in
     order to  give them  proper representation, reserves 80
     per cent  of the jobs for them, can it be said that the
     percent age  of reservation  is bad  and  violates	 the
     permissible limits	 of clause  (4) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_601">Art.  16  ?</a>	 The
     answer  must   necessarily	 be  in	 the  negative.	 The
     dominant object  of this  provision is to take steps to
     make inadequate representation adequate."</blockquote>
<p id="p_257">     Krishna Iyer, J. in the same case observed at page 981
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_88">	  "I agree  with my learned brother Fazal Ali, J. in
     the view  that the arithmetical limit of 50 per cent in
     any one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">491</span>
     year set  by some	earlier rulings	 cannot	 perhaps  be
     pressed too far. Overall representation in a department
     does not  depend on  recruitment in  a particular year,
     but the  total strength  of a  cadre. I  agree with his
     construction of  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_602">Art. 16  (4)</a> and	his view  about	 the
     'carry forward' rule."</blockquote>
<p id="p_258">     After carefully going through all the seven opinions in
the above  case, it  is difficult  to held  that the settled
view of this Court that the reservation under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_603">Article 15 (4)</a>
or <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_604">Article  16 (4)</a>  could not  be more	than 50 per cent has
been unsettled by a majority of the Bench which decided this
case. I	 do not propose to pursue this point further in this
case because  if reservation is made only in favour of those
backward castes	 or classes  which  are	 comparable  to	 the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it may not exceed 5()
per cent  (including 18	 per cent reserved for the Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  and 15  per cent	reserved for
'special group')  in view  of the  total population  of such
backward classes  in the  State of  Karnataka.	The  Havanur
Commission has	taken the  number of  students passing	at S
S.L.C. examination  in	the  year  1972	 as  the  basis	 for
determining  the   backwardness.  The	average	 passes	 per
thousand of  the total	population of the State of Karnataka
was 1.69  in 1972.  The average in the case of the Scheduled
Castes was  0 56  and in  the case  of Scheduled  Tribes was
0.51. Even if we take all the castes, tribes and communities
whose average is below 50 per cent of the State average i.e.
below .85  per cent  for classifying them as backward, large
chunks of population which are now treated as backward would
have to go out of the list of backward classes. Consequently
the necessity  for reservation	which would  take the  total
reservation under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_605">Article 15  (4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_606">Article 16 (4)</a> beyond
50 per	cent of	 the total number of seats/posts would cases
to exist.  The present	arrangement has been worked for more
than five  years already. It is now necessary to redetermine
the question  of backwardness  of the various castes, tribes
and communities	 for purposes  of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_607">Article 15 (4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_608">Article
16 (4)</a> in the light of the latest figures to be collected on
the various  relevant factors  and to  refix the  extent  of
reservation for	 backward classes. The reservation of 15 per
cent now  made under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_609">Article 15  (4)</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_610">Article 16 (4)</a> but

'special group'	 based on  occupation-cum-income can  in any
event be  availed of  by  members  of  all  communities	 and
castes.
</p><p id="p_259">     At this  stage it	should be  made clear  that if	on a
