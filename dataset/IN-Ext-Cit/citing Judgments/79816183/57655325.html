      the   accused   persons   subsequent   to   the   marriage.     Tilak 

      ceremony took place about 10 days prior to the marriage. 

      The demand was made on the day of Tilak.  He was short of 

      Rs.5000/­ which was to be paid to the accused persons.  The 

      accused   persons   told   him   that   they   would   not   accept   the 

      Tilak   if   the   balance   of   Rs.5000/­   was   not   paid.     On   this 

      issue, he had a talk with mediator Mr. Shukla.  He told him 

      that he should make arrangement of Rs.5000/­ since accused 

      persons   were   not   ready   to   accept   the   Tilak   unless   their 

      demand   was   fulfilled.   Despite   the   fact   that   the   accused

      stated   that   in   his   presence   the   demand   was   made   by   the 

      accused side and the marriage was finalized on the cash of 

      Rs. 51,000/­.  This amount was finalized with the consent of 

      both the sides.  Though PW3 Savitri stated that there was no 

      demand of dowry from the side of accused persons at the 

      time or prior to marriage.  PW1 Ram Kishan Mishra (father

       of   the   deceased)   is   totally   silent   on   the   point   that   Rs.

      51,000/­ cash was demanded by the accused persons at the 

      time of finalization of the marriage.  PW­9 has further stated 

      that he had visited the house of accused persons thrice and 

      these occasions were faldaan (roka), tilak and 'GONA' and 

      on these occasions demand of dowry was made. They did 

      not report the matter to the police. He volunteered that they 

      thought it proper to discuss the matter mutually instead of 

      lodging  formal  complaint  with  the  police  as  the  marriage 

      had taken place. He also stated that no body made complaint 

      to the police when the girl informed them regarding threat 

      given by the accused persons to kill her if demand was not 

      fulfilled.

<p id="p_38">   17.       The   testimony  of   prosecution   witnesses   suffer  from 

      inconsistencies and discrepancies which go to the root of the 

      matter and shake the basic version of the prosecution case. 

      They   have   materially   contradicted   statements   at   various 

      stages and being relatives of the deceased in their anxiety to 

      secure   conviction   have   given   shaky   and   unconvincing 

      statements before the court.

</p><p id="p_41">    18.       It  has  been  contended  by Ld. Defence Counsel  that 

      there   is   unexplained   delay   in   lodging   of   FIR,   that   the 

      conduct of father of deceased is very strange and there is no 

      explanation   of   late   FIR   by   the   prosecution.     PW1   Ram 

      Kishan   Mishra   stated   in   his   cross   examination   that   on 

      4.2.2007  he kept  on roaming here and there in Delhi. On 

      04.02.07 they stayed in the house of Akhilesh who was their 

      relative and on 5.2.2007 they went to the police station.  It is 

      contended that it is very strange that the father of the girl 

      who had died would roam here and there in Delhi and would 

      not   go   to   the   police   station   when   he   reached   Delhi   on 

      3.2.2007.  There is an unexplained inordinate delay of more 

      than   one   day   in   lodging   the   FIR   which   is   fatal   to   the 

      prosecution   case.   I   find   force   in   the   contention   of   Ld. 

      defence counsel.   It is settled that if there is delay without 

      any plausible explanation from the prosecution side, it gives 

      chance of improvement, tutoring, introduction of falsehood, 

      embezzlement  etc.   It  is admitted  case  of the  prosecution 

      that accused Ajay Mishra had himself given information to 

      the   police,   the   complainant   was   also   informed   about   the 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                            28/48
       incident on 2.2.2007 and they reached Delhi on 3.2.2007 but 

      the FIR was lodged only on 5.2.2007.  The prosecution has 

      failed   to   tender  any  explanation  regarding  delay  of  about 

      three days in filing of the FIR.  I place reliance on 2006(1) 

      Crimes 312, State of U.P. Vs Anil Kumar &amp; Ors., wherein 

      it was observed as under:­

              "Unexplained   inordinate   delay   of   more 
              than   one   day   in   lodging   FIR   of   the 
              occurrence   is   fatal   to   the   prosecution 
              case.  The object of insisting upon prompt 
              lodging of the FIR is to obtain the earliest 
              information   regarding   the   circumstances 
              in   which   the   crime   was   committed, 
              including the names of actual culprits and 
              the part played by them and the names of 
              eye witnesses, if any.   Delay in lodging 
              the   FIR   quiet   often   results   in 
              embellishment which is a creature of after 
              thought.   On   account   of     unexplained 
              delay the FIR not only gets bereft of the 
              advantage   of   spontaneity,   danger   also 
              creeps in of the introduction of coloured 
              version  of  the  occurrence.    Since  in the 
              instant case delay of more than one day in 
              lodging   the   FIR   has   not   been   explained 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                     29/48
                satisfactorily   the   FIR   looses   all   its 
               corroborative value and authenticity.

<p id="p_42">   19.       <a href="/doc/919369/" id="a_6">In  Dilawar Singh vs State of Delhi</a>, 2007 (4) JCC 

      2593, it was observed by the court that:­

               "In   criminal   trial   one   of   the   cardinal 
               principles   for   the   Court   is   to   look   for 
               plausible explanation for the delay in lodging 
               the   report.     Delay   sometimes   affords 
               opportunity   to   the   complainant   to   make 
               deliberation upon the complaint and to make 
               embellishment   or   even   make   fabrications. 
               Delay defeats the chance of the unsoiled and 
               untarnished   version   of   the   case   to   be 
               presented   before   the   Court   at   the   earliest 
               instance.     That   is   why   if   there   is   delay   in 
               either coming before the police or before the 
               Court, the Courts always view the allegations 
               with   suspicion   and   look   for   satisfaction 
               explanation. If no such satisfaction is formed, 
               the delay is treated as fatal to the prosecution 
               case".
</p>
<p id="p_43">      The   delay   in   lodging   FIR   has   not   been   explained   by   the 

prosecution.   Therefore,   unexplained   delay   severely   dents   the 

prosecution case.

<p id="p_44">   20.       PW12 SI Pramod (IO of the case) has also stated in 

      his testimony that on 5.2.2007 father of the deceased namely 

FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                                30/48
       Sh.   Ram   Krishan   Mishra   and   uncle   Hari   Kishan   Mishra 

      came to the police station.   He took them to the office of

      Mishra   (father   of   the   deceased)   was   recorded   vide 

      Ex.PW1/B.  In his cross examination, PW12 SI Pramod has 

      stated that none of the relative of the deceased who were put 

      up in Delhi met him prior to 5.2.2007. PW­12 SI Pramod 

      stated   that   statement   of   complainant   was   recorded   at   the 

      office of Executive  Magistrate. Pw­1 Ram Kishan  Mishra 

      also   stated   that  they  went  to  Tehsil  Seelampur  where  his 

      statement was recorded by Tehsildar whereas Pw­13 A.K. 

      Pasi the then Executive Magistrate Seelampur stated that he 

      recorded statement of Ram Kishan Mishra Ex. Pw­1/B in the 

      mortuary.

<p id="p_45">   21.       It   has   been   contended   by   the   defence   that   in   the 

      instant case there has been tutoring by a legal brain i.e. PW2 

      Hari Kishan who is an Advocate by profession.  It is stated 

      by PW3 Savitri that when the news of death of her daughter 

      was received at her house, in all three persons came to Delhi 

      including her dewar namely Hari Kishan who is an advocate 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                          31/48
       by   profession   and   Rajiv   Mishra.   It   is   submitted   by   Ld. 

      defence   counsel   that   whole   family   of   the   accused   was 

      booked in this case on the basis of advice of Advocate PW2 

      Hari Kishan. It has been contended by defence counsel that 

      there was no previous complaints in the matter from the side 

      of the complainant.   It  is true that  there was no previous 

      complaints   in   the   matter.   PW3   Savitri   in   her   cross 

      examination stated that she was not aware if any complaint 

      was made to sarpanch or any other authority by her husband 

      regarding   cruelty   and   demand   of   dowry   by   the   accused 

      persons   from   her   daughter.     PW12   IO   SI   Pramod   also 

      admitted that there was no complaint from the side of the 

      deceased family or anyone regarding harassment / cruelty / 

      demand of dowry / ill treatment so far his memory went.

</p><p id="p_46">   22.       It has been contended by Ld. defence counsel that the 

      relevant  witnesses  have  been  withheld  by  the  prosecution 

      and thereby adverse inference is liable to be drawn against 

      them.  It has been submitted that PW3 Savitri stated that her 

      husband and brother used to go to the matrimonial home of 

      deceased and she used to apprise about her ordeals to her 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                         32/48
       father and brother despite which brother of the deceased has 

      not been examined as a prosecution witness. Per contra it is 

      contended  by  Ld. Prosecutor  that  there is no necessity  of 

      examining all the witnesses.  It is prerogative of prosecution 

      to   decide   its   witnesses.     The   prosecution   has   already 

      examined   sufficient   witnesses   to   prove   that   the   deceased 

      was harassed by her husband and inlaws and she was forced 

      by   them   to   bring   more   dowry.   It   is   not     the   number   of 

      witnesses but quality of evidence brought before the court 

      which matters. 
</p>
<p id="p_47">   23.       It is contended by defence counsel that there was no 

      previous complaint to the police or FIR registered by father, 

      mother or uncle of the deceased in relation to any atrocities 

      committed   by   the   accused   persons   on   the   deceased.     It 

      seems that that relations were   cordial among the families 

      and   between   the   couple.     Only   because   the   deceased 

      committed   suicide   due   to   her   hyper   sensitive   nature   and 

      suspicion on her husband, the entire family of the husband 

      of the deceased had been booked.   There was no external 

      injury on the body of the deceased except the ligature mark 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                             33/48
       present over her neck.   PW11 Dr. Atul Gupta specifically 

      stated in his cross examination that no violence mark was 

      found on the dead body.
</p>
<p id="p_48">   24.       It  has  been  contended  by Ld. Defence Counsel  that 

      both   the   families   were   poor   and   the   marriage   was 

      solemnized in a very simple manner.  It is stated that though 

      PW1 Ram Kishan Mishra (father of the deceased) stated that 

      he had given dowry as per his capacity, however, no list of 

      dowry articles was given to the police nor produced in the 

      court.     It   is   further   submitted   that   DW1   Prasidh   Narain 

      Pandey stated in his examination in chief that the marriage 

      had taken  place in a very simple manner.   Puri­subzi  and 

      churwa ­dahi were served to the baraties besides sweet.  He 

      also stated that in his presence, no dowry article was given 

      to the accused from the side of the girl in terms of gifts or 

      cash.  He also stated that he remained present with Anirudh 

      Mishra   throughout   the   marriage.     DW1   Prasidh   Narain 

      Pandey also stated that no demand was made from the side 

      of the accused persons from the family of Vijay Laxmi nor 

      anything was given by the girl's side to the accused side at 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                         34/48
       the time of 'GONA' ceremony.   The girl had brought  one 

      bedding, a cot and one box and one suit case with her at the 

      time   of   'GONA'   ceremony.     There   were   no   electrical 

      equipments   like   refrigerator,   T.V.   etc.   in   the   house   of 

      accused   as   there   was   no   electricity   in   the   village.     The 

      electric connection has now been provided in the village the 

      last   year   itself.   He   also   stated   that   house   of   the   accused 

      persons is partially kachcha with khaprel (earthen roof).  In 

      his   cross   examination   he   has   stated   that   there   was   no 

      arrangement of tent or even generator or light at the time of 

      marriage.   He   volunteered   that   only   patromax   were   there. 

      DW3 Ram Santosh Pandey also stated in his testimony that 

      accused did not do any job except the tuitions.  He had not 

      seen any T.V., cooler etc. in the house of the accused.  There 

      was only takhat (bed) and one wooden shelf available in the 

      house of the accused.  PW1 Ram Kishan Mishra also stated 

      that photographs of the marriage were not taken by any side. 

      Even videography was not done of the marriage ceremony 

      or Tilak ceremony and therefore, the status of the parties is 

      evident from the way in which the marriage was performed.

       From the evidence brought on record it is proved that both 

      the sides were financially not very sound and marriage was 

      performed in a very simple manner.

<p id="p_50">   25.       The defence witness DW2 Manju Pandey who used to 

      teach stitching to the deceased stated that on 4.2.2007 she 

      alongwith   her   husband   had   gone   to   the   house   of   Ajay 

      Mishra,   as   a   courtesy   call.     She   saw   father   and   other 

      relatives of the deceased and father of accused Ajay Mishra. 

      The   relatives   of   the   deceased   including   her   father   were 

      making demands of money from the accused and his father 

      and accused was telling something that he cannot afford to 

      make such huge payment.   He also told to his inlaws that 

      wherefrom he could arrange such amount as he was a small 

      tutor.   DW3 Ram Santosh Pandey (husband of DW2) also 

      stated that on 4.2.2007, he alongwith his wife had gone to 

      the house  of accused Ajay where he met Anirudh Mishra 

      (father of the accused), Ram Kishan Mishra (father in law of 

      accused) and Hari Kishan Mishra (relative of Ram Kishan 

      Mishra).  Father in law of accused demanded Rs.5 lacs from 

      the accused persons which he had spent on the marriage and 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                         36/48
       directed them to pay the same within one or two days.  He 

      further threatened that in case accused persons did not pay 

      Rs.   5   lacs   to   him,   he   would   falsely   implicate   them   in   a 

      dowry   case.     DW4   accused   Ajay   Mishra   stated   that   on 

      3.2.2007,   Ram   Kishan   Mishra,   Hari   Kishan   Mishra   and 

      Rajiv   Mishra   (his   inlaws)   alongwith   his   father   Anirudh 

      Mishra   reached   at   his   house   after   visiting   the   house   of 

      D.D.Pathak.     Ram Kishan Mishra (father of the deceased) 

      seeing his mental condition consoled him and said that "it is 

      all GOD's will and it is not your mistake".  It is contended 

      that from the behaviour of PW1 Ram Kishan Mishra (father 

      of   the   deceased)   it   is   reflected   that   since   there   was   no 

      demand of dowry or harassment by the deceased and he did 

      not   hold   accused   persons   guilty   for   the   death   of   the 

      deceased,   father   of   the   deceased   was   trying   to   console 

      accused Ajay Mishra.   It is also intriguing that though the 

      father   of   the   deceased   PW1   Ram   Kishan   Mishra   came 

      alongwith father of the accused Anirudh Mishra, however, 

      he   has   concealed   it   and   nowhere   disclosed   that   accused 

      Anirudh Mishra was also present alongwith them. It is only 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                              37/48
       in the testimony of PW2 Hari Kishan that it has come that 

      on  2.2.2009,  one D.D.Pathak informed them  on telephone 

      that   Vijay   Laxmi     had   died   and   thereafter   they   went   to 

      village of accused persons and informed about the incident. 

      Accused Anirudh Mishra also came to Delhi with them and 

      went to the house of Ajay.   Had there been complaints of 

      demand  of dowry and harassment  by the accused  persons 

      including   Anirudh   Mishra,   the   father   of   the   deceased 

      alongwith his brother would have never gone to their house 

      in  village  before proceeding  to Delhi.   The fact  that  they 

      travelled   together   indicates   that   the   relations   between 

      Anirudh   Mishra   (father   of   the   accused   Ajay   Mishra)   and 

      Ram Kishan Mishra (father of the deceased) were cordial.  

</p><p id="p_51">   26.       It has been contended by the defence counsel that the 

      actual reason  for committing suicide by the deceased was 

      that the accused was very studious and did not devote much 

      time to the deceased as he was busy in studies and giving 

      tuitions   thereby   earning   his   livelihood,   therefore,   the 

      deceased  suspected  that  since he was involved with some 

      other   girl,  he  was  not  giving  due  attention  to  her.    DW1 


FIR No.47/2007 PS New Usman Pur                                          38/48
       Prasidh   Narain   Pandey   stated   that   deceased   Vijay   Laxmi 

      told him when he was taking tea that she was fed up with the 

      studies of accused Ajay Mishra and he appeared to be very 

      studious (paraku). She also told him that she apprehended 

      that Ajay was having illicit relations with some other girl 

      and   he   consoled   Vijay   Laxmi   that   he   would   make   Ajay 

      understand in this regard.  DW2  Manju Pandey also stated 

      that deceased used to tell her "Didi that if  Ajay wanted to 

      study   only   then   why   he   had   married   me".       DW3   Ram 

      Santosh Pandey also stated that on subsequent visit with his 

      wife to the house of accused,  Vijay Laxmi (wife of accused) 

      told his wife in his presence that she had suspicion that Ajay 

      was having relations with other lady or Ajay was a paraku

      reader) and used to study all the time and also alleged that 

      he was having affair with some other lady.  His wife used to 

      taunt him that he used to study all the time and was giving 

      very   less   time   to   her.   Therefore,   the   deceased   did   not

                  prosecution   by   adducing   reliable   and 
                  cogent   evidence.     Presumption   of 
                  innocence   has   been   recognized   as   a

<p id="p_56">   30.       Ld.   Prosecutor   has   relied   upon  <a href="/doc/79816183/" id="a_9">Pathan   Hussain 

      Basha vs State of A.P</a>., 2012 STPL (Web) 343 SC,  "that 

      once the prosecution proves its case with regard to the basic 

      ingredients   of   <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_10">Section   304B</a>,   the   Court   will   presume   by 

      deemed   fiction   of   law   that   the   husband   or   the   relatives 

      complained of, has caused her death.   Such a presumption 

      can  be drawn  by  the Court  keeping  in  view the  evidence 

      produced  by the prosecution in support of the substantive 

      charge  under  <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_11">Section  304B</a>  of  the  Code.    Applying  these 

      principles to the facts of the present case, it is clear that the 

      ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_12">Section 304B</a> read with <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_13">Section 498A</a> IPC are 

      completely   satisfied   in   the   present   case.     By   a   deeming 

      fiction in law, the onus shifts on to the accused to prove as 

      to how the deceased died.  It is for the accused to show that 

      the   death   of   deceased   did   not   result   from   any   cruelty   or 

      demand of dowry by the accused persons.  The accused did

       not care to explain as to how the death of his wife occurred. 

      Denial cannot be treated to be the discharge of onus.  Onus 

      has to be discharged by leading proper and cogent evidence. 

      It was expected of the accused to explain as to how and why 

      his wife died, as well as his conduct immediately prior and 

      subsequent   to   the   death   of   the   deceased.     Maintaining 

      silence   cannot   be   equated   to   discharge   of   onus   by   the 

      accused.  In the present case, the prosecution by reliable and 

      cogent   evidence   has   established   the   guilt   of   the   accused. 

      There being no rebuttal."  However, the case referred to by 

      the   prosecution   is   not   applicable   to   the   present   as   the 

      accused Ajay Mishra has given explanation as to how the 

      deceased   died   and   also   proved   the   same   through   leading 

      evidence.

<p id="p_57">   31.       In the instant case there is no direct evidence relating 

      to harassment to the deceased by the accused persons. The 

      allegations  regarding  demands  made from  the deceased  is 

      hearsay   evidence   which   is   inadmissible   under   law.     The 

      evidence   brought   on   record   is   general,   vague   and 

      contradictory.  The burden is on the prosecution to establish

      inadmissible evidence, conviction cannot be made. Though

      lower   standard   of   proof   -   due   to   enactment   of   a 

      presumption, yet the prosecution is under an obligation to 

      prove the foundational facts pertaining to behaviour which 

      amounts   to   cruelty   and   dowry   harassment.     The   mere 

      circumstance that one fact i.e. unnatural death within seven 

      years   of   marriage   is   established   does   not   absolve   the 

      prosecution's burden of proving the other two ingredients. 

      The   prosecution   has   neither   brought   on   record   any 

      complaints made by the deceased or her family to the police 

      or Panchayat or any other forum nor there was any mark of 

      violence   on   the   body   of   the   deceased   which   could   have 

      supported   the   prosecution   case.     There   was   a   delay   in 

      lodging   of   FIR   by   the   father   of   the   deceased   and   the 

      testimony   of   the   prosecution   witnesses   are   also 

      contradictory   and   unconvincing.   No   neighbour   was 

      examined   who   could   have   established   that   deceased   was 

      being harassed at Delhi also for dowry demand.

         harassment and beatings given to the deceased for bringing 

         insufficient dowry.   There are no specific allegations as to 

         how   the   deceased   was   subjected   to   cruelty.     The   generic 

         statements   that   the   deceased   was   given   beatings   without 

         specifications as to how the beatings were given, whether 

         any  object  /  weapon was used  to give those  beatings  and 

         similarly   without   the  details   as   to  how   the   deceased   was

         304 B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">IPC</a> means that the foundational ingredients leading 

         to the presumption, which the law mandates by <a href="/doc/462524/" id="a_17">section 113</a> 

         of the Evidence Act, have to be satisfied, the prosecution 

         still had to prove that deceased was compelled to commit 

         suicide   or   that   unnatural   death   took   place   as   a   result   of 

         cruelty.   <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_18">Section   304</a>   B   mandates   that   to   complete   the 

         offence the prosecution  must prove that the deceased was

      cause depression in the mind of the victim, the cruelty and 

      harassment envisaged by <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_19">section 304</a> B is to be soon before 

      the   death   of   a   woman.   The   courts   are   to   scrutinize   the 

      evidence   carefully   because   cases   are   not   rare   in   which 

      occasionally   there   is   demand   and   then   the   atmosphere 

      becomes   calm   and  quiet  and  then  again  there  is  demand. 

      Where a wife dies in the house of the husband within the 

      short   span   of   seven   years   of   her   marriage,   it   is   of 

      considerable difficulty to assess the precise circumstances in 

      which the incident occurred because ordinarily independent 

      witnesses are not available as the torture and harassment is 

      confirmed   in   the   four   walls   of   the   house.   However,   the 

      courts are to be vigilant to scrutinize the evidence regarding 

      the   harassment   and   torture   carefully   if   the   witnesses   are 

      relatives of the deceased and relations between them and her 

      in laws are strained for any reason whatsoever it might be.
