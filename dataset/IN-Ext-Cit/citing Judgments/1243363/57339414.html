financing pharmacy college. Petitioner's college fell under the

purview of the Kerala University. By Ext.P1, on application, the

petitioner was issued with a letter of consent by the Kerala

University dated 24.4.2010 for the establishment of a new course

M. Pharm - Pharmacuetical Chemistry. The Governor of Kerala

initially promulgated an Ordinance, called the Kerala University of

Health &amp; Allied Sciences, 2009 which came into force in

November, 2009. The Ordinance came to be replaced by an Act in

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;

the year 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_1">University Act</a>). All

the colleges coming under the medical and allied fields of

education which were affiliated to any of the Universities in Kerala

stood affiliated to the new University, 2010 - 2011. The first

respondent vide Ext.P2 order, approved the consent of affiliation in

respect of the course of M. Pharm - Pharmaceutical Chemistry in

respect of the petitioner's college. Petitioner addressed Ext.P3

letter stating that the Central Regulatory Authority for the M.

Pharm Course is the All India Council for Technical Education

(AICTE) and it had granted its approval which was uploaded in the

website of AICTE. Affiliation for the M. Pharm Course without

any further delay was requested for.       By Ext.P4, the Kerala

University notified various colleges which stood affiliated to the

said University. By Ext.P5 dated 20.7.2010, the petitioner was

requested to furnish certain details for considering the petitioner's

request for affiliation to the M. Pharm Course. They include the

following:

<p id="p_10">
One of the documents required under Ext.P5 was permission by

Government of Kerala after executing an agreement. Ext.P6 letter

was sent wherein it was, inter alia, mentioned that the petitioner is

not liable to get consent letter from the Government, nor execute

any agreement for the same. The undertaking mentioned therein

was forwarded. Petitioner came to be served with Ext.P7 dated

13.8.2010 from the University which reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "With reference to your letter cited, I am to
      inform you that in accordance with the policy of the
      Government of Kerala, this University has taken a

      under Government merit quota.           Hence you are
      requested to furnish the permission of Kerala
      Government for granting affiliation.             In this
      connection, you have to also submit the original Letter
      of Permission issued by the AICTE for granting
      affiliation."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">
</blockquote><p id="p_11">Thereafter, the petitioner came to be served with Ext.P8 from the

AICTE wherein, it is stated that the petitioner's college was granted

approval for the M. Pharm (Chemistry) for the first shift with an

intake of eighteen for the year 2010-2011. Petitioner forwarded

the said communication to the respondent/University. Petitioner

moved a Writ Petition seeking a direction to consider the

application for affiliation without insisting for any condition of No

Objection Certificate (letter of permission) from the Government

of Kerala. Ext.P10 is an interim order directing the University to

pass orders on the application of the petitioner for affiliation for

the M. Pharm Course, ignoring the conditions stipulated in Ext.P7.

Thereafter, by Ext.P11, sanction was granted by the Vice

Kerala University of Health and Allied Sciences Ordinance, 2010

for grant of provisional affiliation to M. Pharm in Pharmaceutical

Chemistry with an annual intake of 18 students for the academic

year 2010-11, subject to various conditions. We notice that in fact

Condition No.8 is to the following effect:

      Permission from Govt. of Kerala after executing the

</blockquote><p id="p_12">The AICTE granted permission to the petitioner college for two

more M.Pharm Courses vide Ext.P12 dated 10.5.2012. Petitioner

gave Ext.P13 representation to the University seeking affiliation.

Ext.P14 is a consent of affiliation issued by the Registrar of the

Kerala University which reads as follows:

<p id="p_13">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           "The Kerala University of Health Sciences

</p><p id="p_15">      13.

            The grant of Consent of Affiliation does not
      entitle the institution to make admission to the new
      course. Admissions as per the prescribed rules shall
      be made only after provisional affiliation is granted by
      the Kerala University of Health Sciences to the new
      course.
</p>
<p id="p_16">            The Kerala University of Health Sciences will

      the State Government and Kerala University of Health
      Sciences.

      and 2013-14 academic years."
</p>
<p id="p_18">
When enquiries were made, petitioner came to understand that the

Government had addressed a Circular to the University on

22.11.2010 that no affiliation shall be granted to any new college

or to any new course, unless the college agrees to surrender fifty

per cent of the seats to the Government and Government issues its

letter of permission thereof. Ext.P15 is produced as the Circular.

</p><p id="p_20">      3.    A Counter Affidavit is filed on behalf of the third

respondent (State of Kerala). It is, inter alia, stated as follows:

</p><p id="p_21">      Petitioner has not approached the Government for issuance of

No Objection Certificate. This may be to avoid the conditions that

may be stipulated by the Government. Government issued Circular

to ensure quality in education and to give opportunity to students

of low income groups in self-financial institutions, like the

petitioner's institution. To ensure the latter, Government mandates

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">13371/2012V                      10</span>

the institutions to enter into an agreement regarding seat sharing

(fifty per cent of the sanctioned seats to Government) and fees

structure. It appears that the petitioner institution was not willing

to share fifty per cent of the total seats sanctioned to them by

AICTE for admitting students from the merit list prepared by the

Government or such other body entrusted by the Government. The

petitioner was also not willing to follow the fee fixed by the

Government in those seats set apart for the Government in those

seats set apart for the Government. There is reference to the

objects of the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_2">University Act</a>. Reference is made to <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_3">Sections 6(ix)</a>

and <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_4">56(1)</a>. There are wide and pervasive powers and control with

the University and the State Government and to impose conditions

or regulations for the purpose of affiliation of the colleges. After

promulgation of the Act, the statutes have been prepared. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_5">The Act</a>

never contemplates a vacuum for functioning of the University as

well as the affiliated colleges. Since statutes have been prepared,

specific guidelines and formalities in comparison with the

procedure of admission to other professional courses are being

followed for the issuance of No Objection Certificate. Approval

process of AICTE to start recognized courses states that one copy

of the application submitted before the AICTE is required to be

submitted to the State Government or the Union Territory

Administration concerned. The views will be forwarded with valid

reasons.    Government will arrange inspection by the technical

team. After Government gets report, the Government will consider

and take decision in granting NOC for starting the course subject

to such conditions. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_6">The Act</a> contemplates withdrawal of affiliation

if the institution affiliated fails to comply with the conditions of

affiliation or recognition as provided in the Act or Statutes. It is

the prerogative of the Government to fix appropriate conditions.

Reference placed on the Judgment of this Court in W.P.(C).

No.24933/11 to hold that the process of granting affiliation is not

an empty formality. Government has ample power to fix any

condition for the purpose of No Objection Certificate or letter of

is, inter alia, stated therein that the petitioner did not raise any

</p><p id="p_24">      5. The case of the petitioner, in brief, is as follows:

      Petitioner is an Educational Agency of a Self Financing

Pharmacy      College    by   name,     Ezhuthachan       College of

Pharmaceutical Sciences. The college has been approved by the

AICTE and affiliated to the University for the purpose of

conducting B. Pharm Courses. Petitioner was trying to get M.

Pharm Courses sanctioned to its college. Approval of the AICTE

and the University was required. Petitioner applied to the AICTE

for grant of approval of M. Pharm Course in August, 2009. While

the same was pending, petitioner applied to the respondent

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">13371/2012V                     13</span>

University for affiliation in August, 2010 vide Ext.P1. Petitioner

was informed by the Officers of the University that it should also

obtain NOC from the Government. Without knowing the legal

implications, petitioner had also applied to the Government for

NOC as well. The Government initially dilly dallied the issue,

saying that the infrastructural facilities in the college were not

sufficient enough. Petitioner had rectified all the defects. The

University had conducted inspection and pointed out some defects

in the infrastructure. The same also were rectified. The University

was thereafter satisfied. Thereafter, the University issued Ext.P2

letter directing to remit the amount of fees and also to produce

NOC from the Government. Petitioner forwarded a Demand Draft

for Rs.1,90,000/= as the required fees and also pointed out that the

petitioner was awaiting NOC from the Government vide Ext.P3.

At that time, the petitioner could not do anything because the

formal orders of approval of the AICTE had not come.           The

AICTE issued Ext.P4 dated 1.9.2011 granting formal orders of

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">13371/2012V                      14</span>

approval and granted sanction only for one Course, though what

was requested was two.        The sanction was for M. Pharm in

Pharmaceutical Chemistry.      Petitioner forwarded Ext.P4 to the

University. The University again directed to remit `.1,00,000/= as

registration fee and inspection fee vide Ext.P5. After inspection,

the University requested the petitioner to rectify the defects vide

Ext.P6. Petitioner rectified the defects and submitted a compliance

report on 28.1.2012 as per Ext.P7. The University granted consent

of affiliation as per Ext.P8 dated 7.2.2012. It is stated that there is

no provision in the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_7">University Act</a> for issuance of any consent of

affiliation.  Petitioner did not challenge the condition that the

petitioner should obtain approval of the AICTE for 2012-13 and

NOC which the petitioner did not have. The AICTE issued Ext.P9

granting approval for 2012-13 on 10.5.2012. Petitioner forwarded

the same to the University for affiliation. The University then

issued Ext.P10 stating that the petitioner should produce NOC

from the Government and also should pay an additional amount of

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">13371/2012V                       15</span>

Rs.50,000/= as affiliation fee. Petitioner was agreeable to pay the

fees, but was not able to produce the consent. Petitioner relies on

Ext.P10 interim Order passed by this Court in WP(C).

No.2468/2011 by which the University was directed to pass orders

on the petitioner's application for affiliation ignoring the conditions

mentioned in Ext.P7. When enquiries were made, the petitioner

came to know that the Government had issued Ext.P11 Circular to

the University on 22.11.2010 directing that no affiliation shall be

granted to any new college or to any new Course in any existing

</p><p id="p_31">      7. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners would address

the following contentions before us:
</p>
<p id="p_32">      The State has no authority in law to insist that the petitioners

should obtain permission from it. Reliance is placed on the

decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1243363/" id="a_8">Jaya Gokul Education Trust v.

Commissioner &amp; Secretary to Government</a> (2000 (2) KLT 267).

It is contended that even assuming that the State has any such

power, it cannot further insist that such consent or permission will

be given only if the petitioners enter into agreements with the

State, agreeing for seat sharing and regulation of fees. It is next

contended that the University is not bound by the Circular.

Expatiating, he would submit that the issue relating to the right of

managements be they minority or non-minority, to admit students

and to fix fees has engaged the attention of the highest court. An

Eleven Bench in <a href="/doc/512761/" id="a_9">T.M.A.Pai Foundation And Others v. State of

Karnataka And Others</a> ((2002) 8 SCC 481) dwelt at length on this

issue. Still later, a Constitution Bench in Islamic Academy of

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">13371/2012V                        18</span>

Education And Another v. State of Karnataka And Others

((2003) 6 SCC 697) made various observations. This, in turn, led

to the constitution of a Seven Bench in the <a href="/doc/1390531/" id="a_10">P. A. Inamdar And

Others v. State of Maharashtra And Others</a> ((2005) 6 SCC 537),

which has specifically dealt with the issues with which this Court

would have to express its views. He invited our attention to

paragraphs 124 and 125 of the decision in Inamdhar's case

(supra) which read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">           "124. So far as appropriation of quota by the

      State enforcement of its reservation policy is concerned,

      we do not see much of a difference between non-

      minority and minority unaided educational institutions.</blockquote><p id="p_33">

</p><p id="p_34">      We find great force in the submission made on behalf of

      the petitioners that the States have no power to insist on

      seat-sharing     in    unaided    private    professional

      educational institutions by fixing a quota of seats

      between the management and the State.          The State

      cannot insist on private educational institutions which

      receive no aid from the State to implement the State's

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">13371/2012V                         19</span>

      policy on reservation for granting admission on lesser

      percentage of marks i.e. on any criterion except merit.

</p><p id="p_35">             125. As per our understanding, neither in the

       judgment of Pai Foundation nor in the Constitution

       Bench decision in Kerala Education Bill which was

       approved by Pai Foundation is there anything which

       would allow the State to regulate or control

       admissions in the unaided professional educational

       institutions so as to compel them to give up a share of

       the available seats to the candidates chosen by the

       State, as if it was filling the seats available to be filled

       up at its discretion in such private institutions. This

       would amount to nationalisation of seats which has

       been specifically disapproved in Pai Foundation.

       Such imposition of quota of State seats or enforcing

       reservation policy of the State on available seats in

       unaided professional institutions are acts constituting

       serious encroachment on the right and autonomy of

       private professional educational institutions.        Such

       appropriation of seats can also not be held to be a

       regulatory measure in the interest of the minority

       within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_11">Article 30(1)</a> or a reasonable

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">13371/2012V                     20</span>

       restriction within the meaning of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_12">Article 19(6)</a> of the

       Constitution.   Merely because the resources of the

       State in providing professional education are limited,

       private educational institutions, which intend to

       provide better professional education, cannot be

       forced by the State to make admissions available on

       the basis of reservation policy to less meritorious

       candidates.    Unaided institutions, as they are not

       deriving any aid from State funds, can have their own

       admissions if fair, transparent, non-exploitative and

       based on merit."
</p>
<p id="p_36">No doubt, voluntary agreement for seat sharing is not

impermissible. The Court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">            "128. We make it clear that the observations in

      Pai    Foundation    in  paragraph    68   and   other

      paragraphs mentioning fixation of percentage of

      consensual arrangement which can be reached

      between unaided private professional institutions and

He would therefore contend that the condition contemplated in the

impugned Circular would occasion violation of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_13">Article 19(i)(g)</a> of

the Constitution of India as also      <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_14">Article 30.</a>   Learned senior

Circular is bad for the reason that it cannot be treated as issued in

accordance with <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_15">Article 154</a> of the Constitution. It is pointed out

that an Officer has without complying with the formalities which

the Constitution prescribes, issued the impugned Circular. It is not

stated to be issued by or on behalf of the Governor. In the absence

of such an incantation that it is made by or under the Order of the

Governor, no sanctity can be attached to the same, he contends.

</p><p id="p_38">      8. Per contra, Shri P. Sreekumar, learned counsel for the

University would, no doubt, contend that the University is acting

on the basis of the Circular. He would further submit that there is

no fundamental right to affiliation either under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_16">Article 19(i)(g)</a> or

<a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_17">Article 30</a> of the Constitution.      He would point out that the

Gokul Educational Trust v. Commissioner &amp; Secretary to

Government</a> (2000 (2) KLT 267) may not apply to the facts

&amp; Research Institute &amp; Ors</a>. (1995 (4) SCC 104), which was the

basis for Jaya Gokul's case has been considerably diluted down

by virtue of the subsequent decisions which we will advert to.

</p><p id="p_39">      9. Learned Government Pleader would also reiterate that

there is no fundamental right to affiliation. He would further

submit that the Government has power to issue the impugned

Circular under Section 47 of the Kerala Professional Colleges or

Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee, Regulation of

Admission, Fixation of Non-Explorative Fee and Other Measures

to Ensure Equity and Excellence in Professional Education Act,

2006 (hereinafter referred to as the Kerala Professional Colleges

only seeking to implement its policy of equitable distribution of

seats. Government is interested in ensuring the establishing of a

fair fee structure. Government has ample power under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_25">Article 162</a>,

it is submitted.
</p>
<p id="p_40">       10. Whether the Government has authority to issue the

          impugned Circular ?
</p>
<p id="p_41">       The principal argument of the petitioners is that the impugned

Circular cannot stand judicial scrutiny for the reason that the

Government has no authority to insist upon its consent for

establishing the college as it has purported to do in the Circular. In

the decision in <a href="/doc/1243363/" id="a_26">Jaya Gokul Educational Trust v. Commissioner &amp;

Secretary to Government</a> (2000 (2) KLT 267), the Apex Court was

actually dealing with a situation where an application was made for

affiliation and the matter was being processed by the University.

Under the concerned Statutes, the procedure contemplated

included ascertaining the views of the Government. It appears that

the college authorities in the said case applied for the consent of

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">13371/2012V                       24</span>

the Government to establish the college. The Government declined

to grant consent.     It was a case which was covered by the

legislation framed under Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule

to the Constitution of India, namely the AICTE Act. Entry 66

reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">           "66. Co-ordination and determination of

      standards in institutions for higher education or

      research and scientific and technical institutions."


</blockquote><p id="p_42">Entry 25 of List III of Seventh Schedule reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">      "25.    Education,    including   technical   education,

      medical education and universities, subject to the

      provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I;

      vocational and technical training of labour."

</blockquote><p id="p_43">The Apex Court in the course of its Judgment proceeded to hold as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">            "19. Learned Additional Solicitor General

      stated before us that there was no statute in the State

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;

      1976 nor any other law which specifically required

      the 'approval' of the State Government.        It was

      however contended that the Tamil Nadu case was

      concerned only with the standards of education and

      as to who could fix them. We are not inclined to

      agree.    We have already pointed out under Point 1

      that in the Tamil Nadu case, S.10 (K) of the AICTE

      Act was referred to and the power of 'approval' for

      establishing a technical institution was considered.

      In our opinion, even if there was a State law in the

      State of Kerala which required the approval of the

      State    Government      for    establishing technical

      institutions, such a law would have been repugnant to

      the AICTE Act and void to that extent, as held in the

      Tamil Nadu case.

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      20. The only provision relied on before us by the State

      Government which according to its learned senior

      counsel, amounted to a statutory requirement of

      'approval' of the State Government, was the one

      contained in Clause 9 (7) of the Kerala University

      First Statute. It reads as follows:

<p id="p_44">WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;

      ascertaining the view of the Government also,

      whether the affiliation be granted or refused, either in

      whole or part. In case affiliation is granted, the fact

      shall be reported to the Senate at its next meeting".

      It will be noticed that Clause 9 (7) of the Statute

      required that before the University took a decision on

      "affiliation", it had to ascertain the "views" of the

      State Government.

      any, assets of the management, constitution of the

      clause (2) of clause (9) stated that the affiliation

      "shall depend upon the fulfillment by the management

      of all the conditions for the satisfactory establishment

      and maintenance of the proposed institution/courses

      of studies and on the reports of Inspection by the

      may appoint for the purpose."
</p>
<p id="p_49">      "22. As held in the Tamil Nadu case, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_28">Central Act</a>

      of 1987 and in particular, S.10 (K) occupied the field

      relating the 'grant of approvals' for establishing

      technical institutions and the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_29">Central

      Act</a> alone were to be complied with. So far as the

      provisions of the Mahatma Gandhi University Act or

      its statutes were concerned and in particular statute

      9 (7), they merely required the University to obtain

      the 'views' of the State Government. That could not

      be characterized as requiring the 'approval' of the

      State Government. If, indeed, the University statute

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">13371/2012V                      28</span>

      could be so interpreted, such a provision requiring

      approval of the State Government would be repugnant

      to the provisions of S.10 (K) of the AICTE Act, 1987

      and would again be void. As pointed out in the Tamil

      Nadu case there were enough provisions in the

      <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_30">Central Act</a> for consultation by the council of the

      AICTE with various agencies, including the State

      Governments and the Universities concerned. The

      State Level Committee and the Central Regional

      Committee contained various experts and State

      representatives. In case of difference of opinion as

      between the various consultees, the AICTE would

      have to go by the views of the Central Task Force.

      These were sufficient safeguards for ascertaining the

      views of the State Governments and the Universities.

      No doubt the question of affiliation was a different

      matter and was not covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_31">Central Act</a> in the

      Tamil Nadu case, it was held that the University

      could not impose any conditions inconsistent with the

      AICTE Act or its Regulation or the conditions

      imposed by the AICTE. Therefore, the procedure for

      obtaining the affiliation and any conditions which

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">13371/2012V                       29</span>

      could be imposed by the University could not be

      inconsistent with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_32">Central Act</a>.

      The University could not, therefore, in any event have

      sought for 'approval' of the State Government."


Thereafter, in paragraph 23, the Apex Court also held as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">             "23. Thus we hold, in the present case that there

       was no statutory requirement for obtaining the

       approval of the State Government and even if there

       was one, it would have been repugnant to the AICTE

       Act. The University statue 9 (7) merely required that

       the 'views' of the State Government be obtained before

       granting affiliation and this did not amount to

       obtaining 'approval'.       If the University statute

       required 'approval', it would have been repugnant to

       the AICTE Act. Point 1 is decided accordingly."

</blockquote><p id="p_50">In short, when a law is made under Entry 66, then, going by the

aforesaid decision, it may not be open to the State to prescribe the

obtaining of its consent for affiliation of the college. It would be a

case of legislative incompetence.

</p><p id="p_52">      11. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners would, in fact,

point out that though the word used is "established", the facts

which are set out in the Judgment, leave no room for doubt that

what was contemplated was the approval of the Government for

affiliation. Therefore, it is submitted that on all fours, the decision

clearly concludes the issue which we are called upon to decide.

</p><p id="p_53">      12. Shri P. Sreekumar, on the other hand, would contend that

Entry 66 actually relates to the standards of education and no

doubt, in respect of standards of education, it is a matter which is

beyond the powers of the State Legislature or the Government as

held by the Apex Court, and that too, in so far it adversely affects

the standards.    Government cannot make any inroad into the

province reserved by law made by the Parliament under its

authority under Entry 66. But, in this case, he would submit that

the Government has issued a general circular wherein it declares

that unless No Objection Certificate is obtained, affiliation need

not be granted by the University. The scope of the prohibition and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">13371/2012V                      31</span>

the purport of the Circular is to achieve social justice and to

promote the principle of merit which is why the Government

sought to insist on seat sharing and also to provide for fair fees.

He drew our attention to paragraph 134 of Inamdar's case which

reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">            "134. However, different considerations would

      apply for graduate and postgraduate level of

      education, as also for technical and professional

      educational institutions.   Such education cannot be

      imparted by any institution unless recognised by or

      affiliated with any competent authority created by law,

      such as a university, Board, Central or State

      Government or the like. Excellence in education and

      maintenance of high standards at this level are a must.

      To fulfil these objectives, the State can and rather

      must, in national interest, step in.     The education,

      knowledge and learning at this level possessed by

      individuals collectively constitutes national wealth."

</blockquote><p id="p_54">He submits that the Government has power under Entry 25 and

there is executive power also. He would also no doubt contend

that there is statutory support from <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_33">Sections 40</a>, <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_34">41</a> and <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_35">47</a> of the

<p id="p_55">      13. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner would submit

that the matter is squarely covered by the decision of the Apex

Court and there is absence of power with the Government. He

would also point out that seat sharing has been frowned upon by

the Apex Court and that it amounts to nationalisation of seats. In

paragraph 137 of the decision in <a href="/doc/1390531/" id="a_36">P.A. Inamdar and Others v.

<p id="p_58">In this connection, we must also bear in mind the arguments of the

learned counsel for the respondents that the petitioners in these

<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_38">Article 19</a> provides for fundamental freedoms including the right to

carry on an occupation which, it is well settled, includes the right

to run a self-financing educational institution. But, this right is

petitioners cannot be treated as citizens of India. They would,

therefore, contend that the Supreme Court has expounded the

principle that Government cannot force an Unaided Institution to

share seats with it or prescribe fees, which is the result of the

interpretation of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_39">Article 19(i)(g)</a> and <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_40">Article 30</a> of the Constitution.

Learned senior counsel for the petitioners would point out that in

one of the Writ Petitions (WP(C).No.12323/12), the petitioner is

entitled to invoke the right under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_41">Article 30.</a> As far as the judicial

veto of interference in fees is concerned, petitioners contend that it

is done by interpreting <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_42">Article 14</a>, which right is available to non-

citizens also. He would further submit that as far as want of power

with the Government to require its consent as contemplated in the

provides that Government shall make the first statute of the

is challenged, is not a direction issued to the professional colleges

or institutions as contemplated. On the other hand, it is directed

against the University and, therefore, it cannot be supported under

Section 14 of the Kerala Professional Colleges Act. He would

further point out that <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_54">Section 5</a> of the Act speaks about the objects

of the University. So also, <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_55">Section 6</a> (xx) of the Act speaks about

the power of the University to monitor and evaluate the academic

performance of the affiliated colleges. It is also pointed out that

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_56">Section 40</a> of the Act deals with the power to make Statutes in

relation to affiliation or withdrawing the same. It is pointed out

that no Statutes have been made. As far as <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_57">Section 41</a> of the Act is

concerned, it may be true that the Government can make the first

Statute.   Admittedly, no Statutes have been made.          It is also

submitted that <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_58">Section 41(3)(iv)</a> of the Act is an embargo against

passing of any Statute in relation to affiliation without the previous

approval of the Government. But, that is besides the point which

is urged before us, he contends.
</p>
<p id="p_70">      16. We are of the view that the attempt made by the learned

counsel for the University and also the learned Government

Pleader to support the impugned Circular with reference to the

statutory provisions which we have adverted to, is without merit.

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_59">Section 5</a> of the Act deals with the objects of the University. No

doubt, it has a laudable object to regulate academic standards of

affiliated colleges or institutions. But, it is inconceivable as to

how the Government which is a different Body from the

University can assume any authority to issue the impugned

Circular seeking support under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_60">Section 5(iii)</a> of the Act which

relates to regulation of academic standards. Likewise, <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_61">Section 5</a>

</p><p id="p_71">(xii) of the Act, no doubt, also is intended to declare that one of the

objects of the University is to promote equitable distribution of

facilities in education, health and allied sciences. The laudable

object which the University is expected to achieve, cannot form the

legal basis for the Government of a State to issue the impugned

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">13371/2012V                       41</span>

Circular. Likewise, <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_62">Section 6</a> of the Act speaks about powers and

functions by the University. No doubt, it includes controlling and

regulating admission of students in affiliated colleges, inter alia,

and also monitoring and evaluating the academic performance of

affiliated colleges. But here, we are not called upon to sit in

Judgment over the exercise of any power by the University. We

are essentially called upon to decide upon the authority of the

Government to dictate to the University that it need not give

affiliation, unless and until certain conditions are satisfied, which

include the obtaining of No Objection Certificate from it. We

would think that no support can be drawn by the Government with

reference to the powers and functions of the University under

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_63">Section 6</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_72">      17. As far as <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_64">Section 40</a> of the Act is concerned, it relates to

the power to make Statutes. No doubt, Statutes can be made by the

Governing Council in relation to the conditions and procedure for

affiliation of colleges of for withdrawing the affiliation of colleges.

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">13371/2012V                       42</span>

Undoubtedly, under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_65">Section 41</a>, the first Statute has to be made by

the Government. Therefore, the Government has power to make

first statute. On a reading of <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_66">Sections 40</a> and <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_67">41</a> of the Act

together, we can proceed on the basis that Government may make

the first statutes providing for conditions and procedure for the

affiliation of colleges or for withdrawing the affiliation of colleges.

Admittedly, no such Statutes have been made. We notice that the

Act was published in the Gazette on 24.1.2011 and it is deemed to

have come into force on 7.12.2009, even after the passage of more

than fifteen months. Government has not even made the first

Statutes. No doubt, learned Government Pleader submits that they

are being made. But, that is besides the point. Without the prior

approval of the Government, the Governing Council cannot pass

any Statute in relation to affiliation of private colleges. But, the

question which falls for our decision is the authority of the

Government to pass such a Circular. We would think that neither

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_68">Section 40</a> nor <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_69">Section 41</a> of the Act provides for authority with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">13371/2012V                      43</span>

the Government to issue the Circular in question.            <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_70">The Act</a>

specifically clothes the Government with power to make Statutes

which it has desisted from doing, as things stand. There is no

power under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_71">Section 40</a> or <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_72">Section 41</a> to issue the Circular which

is impugned in these cases.
</p>
<p id="p_73">      18. As far as <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_73">Section 47</a> of the Act is concerned, no doubt, it

declares that admission to all courses in the University departments

and affiliated colleges shall be made in accordance with the

reservation policy of the Government and for weaker sections of

the society and on the basis of competitive merit in accordance

with the Rules, if any, made by the Government. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_74">Section 47</a> of the

Act, in our view, apparently gives effect to the provisions of

<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_75">Article 15(5)</a> of the Constitution of India. <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_76">Article 15(5)</a> indeed

permits reservation for the scheduled castes and socially and

educationally backward sections and it is not applicable to

minority institutions. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_77">Section 47</a> of the Act reflects the intention of

the State Legislature to make available the benefit of the

Constitutional amendment by which reservation is permitted under

<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_78">Article 15(5).</a> No doubt, admissions are to be made on the basis of

comparative merit. The words "comparative merit" are followed

by the words "in accordance with the Rules" which in turn is

followed by the words "if any" made by the Government. It is an

injunction contained in the Statute that admission shall be on the

basis of comparative merit. It may not be appropriate to hold that

the principle of comparative merit will not apply unless Rules are

made. No doubt, Rules may be made. Even otherwise, in respect

of unaided educational institutions, the principle of merit has been

recognized in all the three major decisions dealing with the issue,

namely TMA Pai, Islamic and Inamdar. It may not be out of

place to recollect that in all these decisions, the Apex Court has

directed that merit must indeed be the criterion. It has declared the

law as to how the criteria of merit is to be arrived at. We see

nothing in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_79">Section 47</a> of the Act to support the Circular issued by

the Government. No Rules have been framed by the Government

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">13371/2012V                      45</span>

under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_80">Section 47</a> of the Act to support the Circular issued by the

Government. As far as the reservation is concerned, the concept of

reservation which, of course, is not applicable to minority

institutions is something which can be insisted upon. No doubt,

<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_81">Article 15(5)</a> speaks about the reservation policy being made by a

law. We are not pronouncing on the reservation policy which is

embedded in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_82">Section 47</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_83">Section 47</a> of the Act is not

challenged before us. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_84">Section 47</a> of the Act will, therefore, apply

in its own sphere. Nothing turns in these cases, on the provisions

of <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_85">Section 47</a> of the Act, in our view. At any rate, we do not see

how the Government can seek support on the basis of the

provisions of <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_86">Section 47</a> of the Act. Incidentally, we may observe

that in paragraph 4 of the Counter Affidavit filed by the

Government in W.P.(C).No. 12323/12, it is, inter alia, stated as

follows:

      avoid the conditions that may be stipulated by the

      Government at the time of issuance of NOC

      regarding sharing of 50% seats and execution of

      agreement with the Government. Government issues

      No Objection Certificate to institutions desirous to

      start courses brought under the purview of Kerala

      University of Health Sciences after conducting

      inspection to ensure that norms and standards set for

      the course by State or Central Councils are strictly

      adhered to and to ensure quality in education.

      ensure the latter, Government mandates the

      institutions to enter into an agreement regarding seat

      sharing (50% of the sanctioned number of seats to

      Government) and fee structure. It appears that the

      petitioner institution is not willing to share 50% of the

      total seats sanctioned to them by the AICTE for

</p>
<p id="p_76">Therefore, it appears to be clear that the purport of the Government

by issuing the Circular is to compel the colleges to agree for seat

sharing and fixation of fees for which, support cannot be drawn

<p id="p_77">      19. As far as Section 14 of the Professional Colleges Act is

concerned, we are of the view that no support can be derived from

the said Section. Section 14 of the Professional Colleges Act, in

fact, provides with power to the government to issue direction to

the colleges or institutions for the purpose of carrying out the

purpose of the Professional Colleges Act or to give effect to the

provisions contained in the Rules. Incidentally, we may notice that

Section 10 of the Professional Colleges Act provided for allotment

of seats. It is not in dispute that the said provision came to be

declared as unconstitutional by this Court in Lissy Institution v.

State of Kerala (2007 (1) KLT 409). We may notice that we

cannot possibly hold that the Circular is a direction to the colleges

for the purpose of carrying out the Act. It is in fact a Circular

addressed to the University. We may further notice that in the

absence of <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_88">Section 10</a> as things stand, (we are told that an Appeal

is pending before the Apex Court from the Judgment in Lissy

Institution's case), it cannot be said to be issued for enforcing

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_89">Section 10</a>. No doubt, we may notice the principle which has been

enunciated by the Apex Court in a catena of decisions including

<a href="/doc/1100563/" id="a_90">Mysore State Road Transport Corpn. v. Gopinath Gundachar

Char</a> (AIR 1968 SC 464). We would refer to the Judgment of the

Apex Court in V. Balasubramaniam, etc. etc. v. Tamil Nadu

Housing Board and Others etc. etc. (AIR 1988 SC 6). Therein,

the question arose in the context of the promotion given by a

The Apex Court did not decide the issue as such as to whether the

non publication rendered the regulations relating to promotion

ineffective. But, the Court took the view that the Board had the

power to make the appointments. The said view has been followed

by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1629835/" id="a_95">Meghalaya State Electricity Board And

Another v. Jagadindra Arjun</a> (AIR 2001 SC 2440). Actually, the

principle enunciated by the Apex Court is traceable to the concept

of interpreting the powers of a statutory body with reference to the

statute which governs its creation and its powers.            When

confronted with this Judgment, the learned senior counsel for the

petitioners would submit that in place of the Board or the statutory

Corporation which was considered by the Apex Court, we may

substitute the University. The University may have all the powers

which are necessary for carrying on its functions under the Act.

But, it will not result in conferment of power with the State which,

according to him, is an external body to determine that NOC must

be obtained from it before the University could exercise its powers.

provisions.

<p id="p_79">      20. We may now revert back to the principal and the first

question which arises is whether we should grant relief to the

petitioners    on the basis of the principle enunciated in Jaya

Gokul's case. Undoubtedly, the Courses which are the subject

matter of dispute in these cases, are the Courses of M. Pharm. As

far as M. Pharm is concerned, the matter is admittedly governed by

the provisions of the AICTE Act. The said Act is a law made by

Parliament which is in the exercise of its law making power under

Entry 66 of List 1 of VIIth Schedule. The question which fell for

consideration and which was considered by the Apex Court in

Jaya Gokul's case also related to a Statute made in the exercise of

Entry 66. We have already extracted and referred to the decision

of the Apex Court in Jaya Gokul's case. Therein, the Apex Court

has, inter alia, held that even if there was a State law in the State of

Kerala which required the approval of the State Government for

establishing an educational institution, such a law would be

repugnant to the AICTE Act and void to that extent. We may

further notice that the Court was also dealing with a case where

affiliation was sought. The party had, no doubt, sought permission

of the Government which was refused. The affiliation process was

going on. It was held that the concerned Act only contemplated

getting the views of the Government. The Court held that this

could not be characterised as requiring the approval of the State

Government. More importantly, the Apex Court further held

that indeed if the University Statute could be so interpreted,

such a provision requiring approval of the State Government

would be repugnant to the provisions of Section 10(k) of the

AICTE Act and is void. Only the views were to be obtained and

that if the Act required approval, it would be repugnant to the

AICTE Act.

<p id="p_80">      21. What is done under the impugned Circular is to, no

doubt, require of the University that it need not give affiliation

unless the institutions obtained the No Objection Certificate from

the State Government.        This means that even in respect of

institutions which are otherwise governed by a Statute made under

Entry 66, affiliation is to be refused unless and until the no

objection of the Government is procured.        The No Objection

Certificate itself, no doubt, in turn is to be withheld unless the

college agrees to abide by the conditions regarding admission and

fees structure and execution of an agreement in this regard. As to

what is to be the nature of the condition regarding admission, we

would think that the vagueness of the Circular is supplied by the

clarity with which it is adverted to in the Counter Affidavit. That

is to say, what is contemplated is that the colleges must surrender

fifty per cent of the seats to the Government or share fifty per cent

of the seats.

unconstitutional being a negation of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_96">Article 19(i)(g)</a> and also an

<p id="p_82">      23. We have already adverted to paragraphs 124 and 145 of

Inamdhar's case. Learned counsel for the respondents on the

other hand would point out that the petitioners cannot claim the

decisions of the Apex Court, it is now well settled that even a

minority institution under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_100">Article 30</a> cannot claim any fundamental

right to affiliation as distinguished from the establishment.

Apex Court has held that any direction for seat sharing would

amount to nationalisation of seats and it will amount to violation of

<a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_102">Article 30</a> as it cannot be treated as a reasonable regulation. He

would further submit that while it is true that the Apex Court has

held that there is no fundamental right to affiliation, he would

submit that the Apex Court has also dwelt on the conditions which

may be imposed for the grant of affiliation which are in conformity

with <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_103">Article 30</a> and conditions which would occasion violation of

<a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_104">Article 30.</a>    In this regard, he would draw our attention to

paragraph 121 of the Inamdar's case, which reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">           "121. Affiliation or recognition by the State or

      the Board or the university competent to do so, cannot

      be denied solely on the ground that the institution is a

      minority educational institution. However, the urge or

      need for affiliation or recognition brings in the concept

      of regulation by way of laying down conditions

      consistent with the requirement of ensuring merit,

      excellence      of     education     and       preventing

      maladministration.    For example, provisions can be

      made indicating the quality of the teachers by

      prescribing the minimum qualifications that they must

      possess and the courses of studies and curricula. The

      existence of infrastructure sufficient for its growth can

      be stipulated as a prerequisite to the grant of

      recognition of affiliation. However, there cannot be

      interference in the day-to-day administration.       The

      essential ingredients of the management, including

      admission of students, recruiting of staff and the

      quantum of fee to be charged, cannot be regulated. "

</blockquote><p id="p_85">The said paragraph, no doubt, deals with the affiliation of minority

institutions. It gives the impression that minority institutions can

seek freedom from regulation in the matter of admission of

students and the fees to be charged. But, then, learned counsel for

the University as also the learned Government Pleader would point

out that in other paragraphs of the Judgment, there are

observations which would show that the observations made in

paragraph 121 should not be read in isolation. They would point

out that they are all following the direction in the Islamic's case

and Committees have been set up both in regard to the supervision

of admission and also for regulation of fees (to prevent profiteering

and also charging of capitation fees).     Therefore, both admission

and collection of fees can be the subject matter of regulation, even

in respect of minority institutions, runs the argument of the learned

counsel for the respondents.

<p id="p_86">      25. There is also a case for the learned senior counsel for the

petitioners that the State cannot exercise executive powers if a

right under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_105">Article 19</a> is involved, as executive powers are

anathema in an area where the right is under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_106">Article 19 (See the

      several rights enumerated in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_116">Article 19</a>,

      the right at sub-clause (a) is not merely a right of

      speech and expression but a right to freedom of speech

      and expression. The enumeration of other rights is not

      by reference to freedom. In the words of the then Chief

      Justice Patanjali Sastri in <a href="/doc/973363/" id="a_117">State of W.B. v. Subodh

      Gopal Bose</a> these rights are great and basic rights

      which are recognized and guaranteed as the natural

      rights, inherent in the status of a citizen of a free

      country. Yet, there cannot be any liberty absolute in

      nature and uncontrolled in operation so as to confer a

      right wholly free from restraint. Had there been no

      restraints, the rights and freedoms may tend to become

      the synonyms of anarchy and disorder. The founding

      fathers of the Constitution, therefore, conditioned the

      enumerated rights and freedoms reasonably and such

      reasonable restrictions are found to be enumerated in

      ask what is the sweep of the fundamental right

      guaranteed by the relevant sub-clause out of sub

      clauses (a) to (g) of clause (1). If the right canvassed

      falls within the sweep and expanse of any of the sub-

      clauses of clause (1), then the next question to be asked

      would be, whether the impugned law imposes a

      reasonable restriction falling within the scope of

      clauses (2) to (6) respectively. However, if the right

      sought to be canvassed does not fall within the sweep of

      the fundamental rights but is a mere concomitant or

      adjunct or expansion or incidence of that right, then the

      validity thereof is not to be tested by reference to

      clauses (2) to (6). The test which it would be required

      to satisfy for its constitutional validity is one of

Preeti Srivastava And Another v. State of M.P. And Others</a>

((1999) 7 SCC 120) and held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">              "Entry 25 of List III and Entry 66 of List I have

       to be read together and it cannot be read in such a

       manner as to form an exclusivity in the matter of

       admission. If certain prescription of standards have

       been made pursuant to Entry 66 of List I, then those

       standards will prevail over the standards fixed by

       the State in exercise of powers under Entry 25 of List

       III in so far as they adversely affect the standards

       laid down by the Union of India or any other

       authority functioning under it.         But if higher

       minimum is prescribed by the State Government than

       what had been prescribed by AICTE, it cannot be

       said that it is in any manner adverse to the standards

       fixed by AICTE or reduces the standard fixed by it.</blockquote><p id="p_99">

       to prescribe higher qualifications for purposes of

       admission to the engineering colleges than what had

       been prescribed by AICTE.
</p>
<p id="p_101">             If it is considered that the norms fixed by

       AICTE would allow admission only on the basis of

       the marks obtained in the qualifying examination,

       then the additional test made applicable is the

       common entrance test by the State Government. If

       the standard fixed by AICTE is considered to be the

       common entrance test, then the prescription made by

       the State Government of having obtained certain

       marks higher than the minimum in the qualifying

       examination in order to be eligible to participate in

       the common entrance test is in addition to the

       common entrance test. In either event, the streams

       proposed by AICTE are not belittled in any manner.

       What had been prescribed by the State is not

       contrary     to  but    only   complementary      or

       supplementary to what had been prescribed by

       AICTE. The manner in which the High Court has

       proceeded is that what has been prescribed by

       AICTE is inexorable and that, that minimum alone

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">13371/2012V                      69</span>

       should be taken into consideration and no other

       standard could be fixed even the higher.
</p>
<p id="p_102">             The standards fixed should, however, always

       be realistic which are attainable and are within the

       reach of the candidates.   It cannot be said that the

       prescriptions by the State Government in addition to

       those of AICTE in the present case are such which

       are not attainable or which are not within the reach

       of   the   candidates   who    seek   admission    for

       engineering colleges.      It is not a very high

       percentage of marks that has been prescribed as

       minimum of 60% downwards, but definitely higher

       than the mere pass marks.
</p>
<p id="p_103">             Excellence in higher education is always

       insisted upon by a series of decisions of the Supreme

       Court.     If higher minimum marks have been

       prescribed, it would certainly add to the excellence

       in the matter of admission of the students in higher

       education.    The State can always fix a further

       qualification or additional qualification to what has

       been prescribed by AICTE even though there may be

       situations when a large number of seats may fall

       vacant on account of the higher standards fixed.

       The mere fact that there are vacancies in the

       colleges would not be a matter which would go into

       the question of fixing the standard of education.

       Therefore, it is difficult to subscribe to the view that

       once they are qualified under the criteria fixed by

       AICTE they should be admitted even if they fall short

       of the criteria prescribed by the State. "

       with an entirely different issue in relation to fee

       Seventh Schedule to the Constitution does not merely

       mean evaluation.    It means harmonisation with a

       view to forge a uniform pattern for a concerted action

       according to a certain design, scheme or plan of

       development. It, therefore, includes action not only

       for removal of disparities in standards but also for

       preventing the occurrence of such disparities. It will

       include power to do all things, which are necessary

       to prevent what would make "coordination" either

       impossible or difficult. This power is absolute and

      The Court held that "essentiality certificate" cannot

required production of a No Objection Certificate from the State

argument of Shri P. Sreekumar that the Court was dealing with the

provisions of the NCTE Act which in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_140">Section 14</a>, mandated that

once approval is given by the Body constituted under the said Act,

the University is bound to give recognition. In fact, the learned

       to the institution on receipt of the order of NCTE

       granting recognition to such institution. This only

       means that recognition is a condition precedent for

       affiliation and that the examining body does not have

       any discretion to refuse affiliation with reference to

       any of the factors which have been considered by

       NCTE while granting recognition.        For example,

       NCTE is required to satisfy itself about the adequate

       financial    resources,    accommodation,     library,

       qualified staff, and laboratory required for proper

       functioning of an institution for a course or training

       in teacher education. Therefore, when recognition is

       granted by NCTE, it is implied that NCTE has

       satisfied itself on those aspects. Consequently, the

       examining body may not refuse affiliation on the

       ground that the institution does not have adequate

       financial    resources,    accommodation,     library,

       qualified staff, or laboratory required for proper

       functioning of the institution.    But, this does not

       mean that the examining body cannot require

       compliance with its own requirements in regard to

       eligibility of candidates for admission to courses or

       manner of admission of students or other areas

       falling within the sphere of the State Government

       and/or the examining body.        Even the order of

       recognition dated 17-7-2000 issued by NCTE

       specifically contemplates the need for the institution

       to comply with and fulfill the requirement of the

       affiliating body and the State Government, in

       addition to the conditions of NCTE.
</p>
<p id="p_114">       24. The examining body can therefore impose its

       own requirements in regard to eligibility of students

       for admission to a course in addition to those

       prescribed by NCTE. The State Government and the

       examining body may also regulate the manner of

       admissions.     As a consequence, if there is any

       irregularity in admissions or violation of the

       eligibility criteria prescribed by the examining body

       or any irregularity with reference to any of the

       matters regulated and governed by the examining

       body, the examining body may cancel the affiliation

       irrespective of the fact that the institution continues

       without any kind of discretion in the examining body

       to   examine    whether    the  institution   deserves

       affiliation or not, independent of the recognition. An

       institution requires the recognition of NCTE as well

       as affiliation with the examining body, before it can

       offer a course or training in teacher education or

       admit students to such course or training. Be that as

       it may."

rendered on 12.12.2002. Therein, a Bench of two Judges was

dealing with a case where the appellant, a trust which has set up a

Medical College having failed to obtain affiliation from the

University, sought a writ to the Government of the State to grant

approval to the proposal for affiliation and also a direction to the

University to grant affiliation. In the State of Bihar, under the

Bihar State Universities Act 1976, <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_148">Section 21</a> dealt with the

powers and the duties of the Senate. It, inter alia, provided that

affiliation or disaffiliation of colleges shall not take effect unless it

is approved by the State Government. It was further provided that

no Medical College shall be affiliated except with the prior

approval of the State Government.           The Government was to

consider financial viability of the college, the proposed

management of the college, the viability of the academic standard

and all other conditions which are likely to have an adverse effect

on the interest of the student admitted to such college. The High

Court took the view that the prior approval of the Government was

necessary, and that the State Government had rightly refused

approval, and dismissed the Writ Petition. The Medical Council of

India came to be impleaded before the Apex Court. The appellant

drew support from the decision in Jaya Gokul's case. The Court,

inter alia, held as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_60">             "5. In the matter of medical education in the

      permission for recognition of any medical institution,

      is required to inspect the intending applicants for

      establishment of the new medical college or even new

      and looking at the procedure adopted by the said

      Council before granting the permission in question as

      engrafted in the regulation referred to earlier, it

      would be difficult for us to hold that notwithstanding

      those stringent provisions and stringent requirements

      being complied with and the Medical Council on

      being satisfied, yet the State Government has its say in

      the matter of affiliation of the institution to the

      fully satisfied about the capability of the Institution to

      impart MBBS course for 60 students annually. After

      having examined the aforesaid materials on record,

      we really faila to understand how the State

      Institution in question.      Mr. B.B. Singh, learned

      counsel appearing for the State in the course of his

      arguments has contended that the Institution may

      deteriorate either in its management amounting to

      maladministration or even with regard to taking

      appropriate steps (sic) so far for academic and

      curricular activities and, therefore, the State cannot

      be     denuded      of     its     power     even      to

      derecognise/deaffiliate the said Institution.    Such a

      situation had been considered by this Court in the

      second case i.e. Jaya Gokul and it was observed that

      if, on account of fresh facts which come to light after

      the Institution receives affiliation to the University on

      the basis of recommendations made by MCI or any

      capable body, the State Government can always bring

      that to the notice of the competent authority and the

      power of the competent authority to derecognise or

      deaffiliate is always there in a given case. This being

      the position and in view of the subsequent events

      which have happened in the case in hand, while the

      matter was pending in this Court, in relation to the so-

      called inspection and recommendations made by MCI

      as well as by the Central Government, we direct that

      the appropriate authority, namely, the University may

      grant permanent affiliation to the Institution which

      has not been granted so far because of the pendency

      of the matter in this Court.     The affiliation would

      necessarily be in relation to the intake capacity as

      recommended and approved by MCI.           This appeal

      stands disposed of accordingly."

High Court, relying on the decisions of the Court in Jaya Gokul's

case and another, took the view that the State could not withhold

the essentiality certificate on any policy consideration, as the

policy in the matter of establishment of a new Medical College

now rests with the Central Government alone. The Apex Court

noted that there is no abdication of parliamentary powers in favour

of the State, and that the State has a positive role in the selection of

the location, that an essentiality certificate to set up a Medical

College at the proposed site, is required to be obtained in Form 2

appended to the Regulations made under the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_154">Medical Council of

establishment of the College would resolve the problem of

deficiency of qualified medical personnel in the State and improve

the availability of such medical man-power in the State and full

justification for opening of the proposed College. The Court after

an exhaustive review of the case law, found that the High Court

was in error in taking the view that the State has no role to play in

the matter of identification of the location of the sites where the

Medical Colleges are proposed to be established. No doubt, a final

decision was to be taken by the Central Government. The Court

highlighted the importance of appreciating the local needs. In this

context, it is necessary to bear in mind the facts which led to the

said principles being laid down.      The Government of Andhra

Pradesh approved certain locations for establishment of Medical

and Dental Colleges.          This was on the basis of the

recommendations of a Committee. This was challenged in a large

number of Writ Petitions.      The Writ Petitions were allowed.

the Regulations made under the concerned Central Legislation

which contemplated a role for the State Government by insisting

upon an essentiality certificate.

<p id="p_125">      33. We further find that the Apex Court had referred to the

decision in Jaya Gokul's case in its decision in <a href="/doc/665682/" id="a_155">Govt. of A.P. And

Another v. J.B. Educational Society and Another</a>, etc. (AIR 2005

SC 2014).       The writ petitioners before the High Court were

Educational Institutions. They wanted to establish Engineering

Colleges in the State.     Approval was granted to them for the

academic year 1997 - 1998 by the AICTE Council. They made

applications under Section 20 of the Andhra Pradesh Education

Act, 1982 for permission to establish the Institution.         The

permission was rejected on the ground that the permission was

sought in respect of places where there were number of colleges

and the State Government was not satisfied about the educational

needs of that locality.     It was the said decision which was

successfully questioned before a Division Bench of the Andhra

Pradesh High Court. <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_156">The Andhra Pradesh Act</a> had received the

assent of the President. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_157">Section 20</a>, inter alia, contemplated the

issuance of the Notification by the competent authority after a

survey to identify the educational needs, calling for applications

for establishment of Educational Institutions. The said Section

also contemplated the educational agencies satisfying the authority

that there is a need for providing educational facilities to the

people in the locality.   The Section further provided that no

educational institution could be established except in accordance

with the provisions of the Act. The Apex Court referred to the

provisions of the AICTE Act, Entry 25 of the Concurrent List, and

held as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">            "7. The petitioners in the Writ Petitions

       contended that in view of Section 10 of the AICTE

       Act, no permission of the State Government under

       <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_158">Section 20</a> of the Act was required as the field is

       completely covered by the AICTE Act. It was argued

       that once the approval was granted by the Council,

       the State Government cannot refuse permission on

       the ground that the proposed educational institution

       may not subserve the educational needs of the

       locality. The learned Counsel for the State, on the

       other hand, contended that Section 20 of the AP Act

       and Section 10 of the AICTE Act operate in different

       fields, there is no conflict between these provisions

       and that they are not repugnant to each other and the

       decision of the Division Bench is erroneous. It was

       also contended by the appellant's Counsel that the

       State Legislature has legislative competence to pass

       the enactment and that, in view of Entry 25 of the

       Concurrent List, the State alone would be competent

       to say whether an institution should be established in

       an area to serve the educational needs of that

       locality.

       the   Parliamentary      legislation  would   prevail

       contained in the two legislative enactments have to

       be scrutinised. The provisions of the AICTE Act are

       intended to improve the technical education and the

       various authorities under the Act have been given

       exclusive responsibility to co-ordinate and determine

       the standards of higher education. It is a general

       power given to evaluate, harmonise and secure

       proper relationship to any project of national

       importance. Such a co-ordinate action in higher

       education with proper standard is of paramount

       importance to national progress. Section 20 of the

       AP Act does not in any way encroach upon the

       powers of the authorities under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_160">Central Act</a>.

       <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_161">Section 20</a> says that the competent authority shall,

       educational   needs    of  the   locality  under   its

       jurisdiction notified through the local newspapers

       calling for applications from the educational

       agencies. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_162">Section 20(3)(a)(i)</a> says that before

       permission is granted, the authority concerned must

       be satisfied that there is need for providing

       educational facilities to the people in the locality.

       The State authorities alone can decide about the

       educational facilities and needs of the locality. If

       there are more colleges in a particular area, the

       State would not be justified in granting permission to

       one more college in that locality. Entry 25 of the

       Concurrent List gives power to the State Legislature

       to make laws regarding education, including

       technical education. Of course, this is subject to the

       provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I.

       Entry 66 of List I to which the legislative source is

       traced for the AICTE Act deals with the general

       power     of the    Parliament    for   co-ordination,

       determination of standards in institutions for higher

       education or research and scientific and technical

       educational institutions and Entry 65 deals with the

       vocational and technical training, including the

       training of police officers, etc. The State has certainly

       the legislative competence to pass the legislation in

       respect of education including technical education

       and <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_163">Section 20</a> of the Act is intended for general

We have already referred to the said decision. We need only say

that therein, no doubt, the case arose under the NCTE Act which,

in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_173">Section 14</a>, mandates that once approval is granted by the Body,

the University is bound to give approval. In the said decision, the

held as follows:

case of conflict between two Judgments rendered by Benches of

between the two (See the decision in <a href="/doc/111747316/" id="a_174">Raman Gopi v. Kunju

there is no repugnancy between the provisions contained in the

AICTE Act and Circular. He would submit that the decision in

Jaya Gokul's case, is not attracted to a situation wherein the

Government provides for securing of its No Objection Certificate.

by the University before it granted affiliation and all that the Apex

Court held was that if the said provision was interpreted to mean

that Government must give its approval, then such a statutory

provision would be void.       Here, it is not approval, but a No

Objection Certificate, it is contended.

the Apex Court has declared the principle of repugnancy in a

general or wide manner. It may also be that in the later decision,

the Apex Court was dealing with a Statute providing for

permission from the State Government before starting an

State to mandate its approval as a condition for the University

granting affiliation, must still hold good.

approval for the conduct of Courses in M. Pharm from the

statutory authority acting under a law made by the Parliament,

traceable to Entry 66 of List I of the Constitution. On the one

hand, the Apex Court has held, as already referred to in Inamdar's

case, that the State cannot compel an unaided educational

institution to share seats with it or provide for reservation.

Equally, it was held impermissible for the Government to regulate

the fees.    No doubt, the Apex Court in Inamdar's case, has

clarified that it will always be open to the institution concerned,

voluntarily to enter into a seat sharing agreement with the

Government. But, no State can compel any unaided educational

institution to share the seats with it. Be it a minority institution or

a non-minority institution, they have the right to admit students to

the college. Quite clearly, it is one of the most important right

which an unaided institution has, namely to admit students. But,

the unaided institutions are bound to have a fair and transparent

method of selecting students. The methods have been indicated in

the decisions of the Apex Court. At any rate, there cannot be any

compulsion to share seats. As far as the dictum in Inamdar's case

that Government cannot provide for reservation in unaided and

self-financing institutions are concerned, considerable inroad has

been made into the said position by virtue of the incorporation of

enabling provision, the State may provide for reservation for the

Scheduled Castes and Tribes and also members of socially and

educationally backward sections in all educational institutions.

But, the said provision is not applicable to institutions run by

minorities. <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_179">Article 15(5)</a> has been upheld by the Apex Court and it

majority judgment, it is, inter alia, stated as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">            "36.4. Lastly, the fundamental right to establish

      an educational institution cannot be confused with the

      of ways. Indeed, matters relating to the right to grant

      of recognition and/or affiliation are covered within

      the realm of statutory right, which, however will have

interpreted Articles 14, 19 and 21, any State action which is

arbitrary would per se become unconstitutional and invalid. As far

other purpose other than for the purpose of the educational

institutions.  More importantly, the self-financing institutions

cannot collect capitation fees or indulge in profiteering.

the decision of the Apex Court in Unnikrishnan's case, wherein

the Apex Court declared that educational institutions cannot be run

by individuals, Regulations have been framed by the Government

of India. These Regulations based on Unnikrishnan's case, no

doubt, came to be pronounced as unconstitutional by the eleven

Judges Bench in T.M.A. Pai's case. Therefore, the concepts, like

free seats, payment fees, etc. which were part of Unnikrishnan's

scheme, were found to be unconstitutional.            However, the

regulations in its present incarnation (regulations of the year 2010)

still provide that only Trusts, Societies and Government Bodies are

allowed to apply for approval for running technical institutions.

Individuals cannot apply. The corporate body or a society cannot

be treated as a citizen. The Apex Court in T.M.A. Pai's case

declared that citizens have a fundamental right to run an

educational institution.    Call it a profession or name it an

occupation, it is beyond dispute that all citizens have a

fundamental right to run an educational institution. However, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">13371/2012V                      108</span>

regulations, as we have noted, do not contemplate the running of

educational institutions by individuals. It was held by the Apex

Court that a firm could claim the fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_184">Article

19</a> on the basis that in substance, the firm must be treated as

collection of the partners and if the partners are citizens, they can

maintain an action for an enforcement of the fundamental right

under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_185">Article 19 (<a href="/doc/1001043/" id="a_186">See A.I. Works v. Chief Controller of Imports</a></a>

(AIR 1973 SC 1539). Even a firm is not entitled to maintain an

application for running an educational institution under the

regulations made by the AICTE. The net result is that once we

hold that the declaration of the law made by the Apex Court in

T.M.A. Pai's case that there is a fundamental right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_187">Article 19

(1)(g)</a> to run an educational institution and compelled seat sharing

or regulation of fees, would occasion a violation of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_188">Article 19(1)</a>

</p><p id="p_140">(g) and it would not be a reasonable restriction under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_189">Article 19(6</a>),

then, the petitioners who invoke <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_190">Article 19(1)(g)</a> may not be

entitled to protection of the decision of the Apex Court, as they do

not claim to be citizens.
</p>
<p id="p_141">      39. No doubt, in the case of Companies, the Apex Court has

taken the view that it is open to the Company along with one or

more of its share-holders to maintain a petition for enforcement of

rights under Article 19 (<a href="/doc/125596/" id="a_191">See Bennet Coleman <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_192">&amp; Co. v. Union of

<p id="p_142">      40. There is another aspect. <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_193">Article 19(1)(g)</a> would take in

the right to run the institution. But, it may not include the right to

affiliation of the institution to the University. Even the seemingly

absolute fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_194">Article 30</a> bestowed on linguistic

and minority communities to establish an educational institution of

their choice would not include a fundamental right to seek

affiliation.
</p>
<p id="p_143">      41. We would think that we can dispose of these cases on the

basis that there is no authority with the State Government to insist

upon the petitioners producing No Objection Certificate from the

State for the grant of affiliation in a case where there is approval

from the AICTE.       Under the 2010 Regulations made by the

AICTE, there is no requirement in respect of the M. Pharm Course

that application for AICTE approval must be accompanied by

NOC of the State Government. No doubt, the State Government's

views are to be ascertained. There can be, no doubt, that in Jaya

Gokul's case, the Apex Court has held that even if there is a law

made by the State by which it claims authority to seek its approval

for establishing technical institutions, such a law would be

repugnant to the AICTE Act and void to that extent. Thereafter,

the Court proceeded to refer to Clause 9(7) of the Kerala

University First Statute which required that the University must

ascertain the views of the Government. Considering the matter

further, the Apex Court also held that the said provision only

means that the University must obtain the views of the

Government. It was further held that it could not be understood as

meaning that there must be approval of the Government. More

importantly, it was held that if the Statute is to be so interpreted,

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">13371/2012V                     111</span>

such a provision requiring approval of the Government would be

repugnant to the provisions in Section 10(K) of the AICTE Act and

would again be void. The Court also proceeded to hold that the

University could not, therefore, in any event, seek the approval of

the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_144">      42. No doubt in <a href="/doc/665682/" id="a_195">Government of A.P. And Another v. J.B.

Educational Society and Another</a>, etc. (AIR 2005 SC 2014) the

Apex Court did refer to Jaya Gokul's case. It observed that similar

views were expressed in it and apparently another decision and left

the matter there. The principle which was enunciated in the said

case is, no doubt, that there is no conflict between the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_196">State Act</a>

and the provisions of the AICTE Act. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_197">Section 20</a>, in particular, of

the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_198">State Act</a> which required permission from the State

Government to establish the technical college was found to be not

in conflict with the provisions of the AICTE Act, in a case where

approval was obtained under the latter Act. The said Act, no

doubt, provided for establishing the institution with reference to

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">13371/2012V                     112</span>

the local needs of the area. The Apex Court took the view that the

State Government was best suited to assess the local needs and

there was nothing impermissible for the State by a law, to require

its permission for establishing the college. Undoubtedly, as we

understand, there is some deviation from the view taken by the

Apex Court in Jaya Gokul's case, in that, repugnancy was couched

in absolute terms in Jaya Gokul's case. The Apex Court in the

subsequent decision has allowed room for the State to enact law

requiring its permission on the basis of the local need for

establishing technical college. In fact, in Jaya Gokul's case, the

Apex Court considered the question whether there is power with

the State to seek its approval.    The Court, inter alia, held as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">           "25. As already stated, in view of the judgment

      of this Court in Tamil Nadu case, it is obvious that

      there is no need to approach the State of Kerala for its

      approval for starting the Engineering Colleges. There

      is no power vested in the State under any State Law to

      grant approval and even if it was so vested, it would

      have been in view of Tamil Nadu case. This ground of

      repugnancy alone would be sufficient to quash the

      State Government's letter dated 16.8.1996 refusing to

      give their approval."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_145">It may also be noted that the Court proceeded to consider the case

of the State on merits. The stand of the State was that it was not in

the interest of the students and employment to permit new

Engineering Colleges to be established, and that the Government

policy was not to grant fresh approvals. If more approvals were

granted, it would lead to commercialisation of education.

Commenting on the same, the Apex Court, inter alia, held as

follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_68">           "27.   The so called `policy' of the State as

      mentioned in the counter affidavit filed in the High

      (3) SCC 15), which was a case relating to Medical

      Education and which also related to the effect of a

      Central Law upon a law made by the State under

      Entry 25 List III, it was held (see p.35 para 34) that

      the "essentiality certificate cannot be withheld by the

      State Government on any policy consideration

      because the policy in the matter of establishment of a

      new medical college now vests with the Central

      Government alone." Therefore, the State could not

      have any "policy" outside the AICTE Act and indeed

      if it had a policy, it should have placed the same

      before the AICTE and that too before the latter

      granted permission. Once that procedure laid down

      in the AICTE Act and regulations had been followed

      under Regulation 8(4), and the Central Task Force

      had also given its favourable recommendations, there

      was no scope for any further objection or approval by

      the State. We may however add that if thereafter, any

      fresh facts came to light after an approval was

      granted by the AICTE or if the State felt that some

      conditions attached to the permission are required by

      the AICTE to be complied with, were not complied

the decision in <a href="/doc/665682/" id="a_201">Government of A.P. And Another v. J.B.

<a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_202">Article 254</a> of the Constitution of India, the relevant portion of

The said argument is fallacious. The AICTE Act, even according

to the petitioners, falls under Entry 66 of List I. List I deals with

Entries conferring exclusive legislative power on the Parliament.

What <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_203">Article 254</a> contemplates is, if a legislation is made in

respect of a matter falling under the concurrent list where both the

Parliament and State Legislatures can made law, the law made by

the Parliament will prevail over the law made by the State

Legislature. The exceptional case is when a law made by the State

Legislature in respect of a matter falling under the concurrent list

receives the assent of the President. It is only in such an

eventuality that the law made by the State Legislature will prevail

over the law made by the Parliament within the State concerned.

But, such supremacy of State which made the law which has the

assent of the President is bestowed only upon the law made by the

State in the exercise of the concurrent legislative power falling

under the concurrent list, vis-a-vis, the law made by the Parliament

which it has made with reference to its power drawn from the

noted, is a law made even according to the petitioners' version, in

exercise of the powers under the Union List.

</p><p id="p_151">      44. We are not impressed by the argument of the learned

counsel for the University based on some observations that the

State may provide for admissions. We hold that it may be out of

context in the facts of these cases. We would think that the matter

is squarely covered by the embargo against the State intervening

by any demand of a compulsory nature, on the basis of a law, when

it relates to the grant of affiliation by the University. We are of the

view that the State would not have the legislative power to

legislate by which it can say to the University that its approval be

obtained for the grant of affiliation. We may bear in mind in this

context that though originally the Apex Court in the Adhiyaman's

case had taken the view that it is not open to the State to prescribe

for higher standards than prescribed by the Central Authority

under the Central Law covered by Entry 66 of List I, in subsequent

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">13371/2012V                       119</span>

judgments, the Apex Court has taken a different view. The Apex

Court has taken the view that to achieve excellence in higher

education, it is open to the State and the University to fix higher

criteria than fixed by the AICTE. The said prescription of higher

standards, would also help the State to shortlist the applicants in an

effective manner, if there are applicants more than the available

seats (see <a href="/doc/89699822/" id="a_204">Visveswariah Technological University and Another v.

Krishnendu Halder and Others</a> - (2011) 4 SCC 606 para 13). To

that extent, certainly the decision in Adhiyaman's case stands

clarified. But, we may notice that this is not a case where we can

hold that the State is attempting to prescribe any higher standard

for admission than the one fixed by the AICTE under the AICTE

Act. Therefore, it cannot by any standard be held that in a matter

where approval under the AICTE has been obtained as in these

cases, it would be open to the State to thwart the consideration of

the applications for affiliation by the University by proscribing the

consideration of the affiliation without obtaining the No Objection

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">13371/2012V                     120</span>

Certificate. We would think that there is no merit in the contention

of the respondents that in Jaya Gokul's case, the Court was

dealing with a case of a law where views had to be obtained and

the Court only must be treated as laying down the law that if it is

interpreted as a requirement of approval, it must be void and,

therefore, the said decision would not apply to a case where

instead of approval, the State commands the University that it need

not give affiliation without its No Objection Certificate being

obtained. We would think that the matter cannot be reduced to a

mere semantic play.      The University is an autonomous body

established under the Act and which        is the body which is

primarily concerned with the question of affiliation. This is not a

case where the State is seeking that its permission be obtained so

that the local needs are addressed as was the position in

<a href="/doc/665682/" id="a_205">Government of A.P. &amp; Anr. v. J.B. Educational Society &amp; Anr.

Etc</a>. (AIR 2005 SC 2014). In the said Judgment, it is clear that the

Court took the view that the general survey contemplated under

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">13371/2012V                      121</span>

Section 10 of the AICTE Act does not pertain to the educational

needs of any particular area in a State and it is the State which

alone would be competent where the institution should be

established, having regard to the need. It was in regard to the said

aspect alone that the Apex Court took the view that there was

legislative competence for the State. The purpose of insisting on

NOC, it is plain, is to compel compel the educational institutions to

agree for seat sharing and fee regulation.             Even without

pronouncing on the permissibility of those conditions, in view of

the obstacle faced by the petitioners that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_206">Article 19(i)(g)</a> is

inapplicable to the petitioners as such, and that <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_207">Article 30</a> also does

not confer a fundamental right to affiliation, we would think that

there cannot be power with the State to interdict the University

against grant of affiliation without obtaining its NOC. Call it a No

Objection Certificate or approval or permission, all these concepts

involve the State Government being in a position to prohibit the

University from taking an independent decision in a matter where

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">13371/2012V                     122</span>

approval was obtained from the AICTE.
</p>
<p id="p_152">      45. We would now have to consider another aspect of the

matter.   In WP(C).No.12323/12, the petitioner had originally

obtained Ext.P1. That is a letter of consent. It is dated 24/4/2010.

The University of Kerala had stipulated that affiliation will be

considered subject to, inter alia, fulfillment of condition by the

State Government.    Learned senior counsel would submit that

subsequently the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_208">University Act</a> established the Kerala University

of Health And Allied Sciences Act which issued Ext.P2. No

doubt, the learned Government Pleader would point out that

Ext.P2 must be understood as issued in continuation of Ext.P1.

Learned senior counsel for the petitioner would then point out that

at the time when Ext.P1 was issued, the impugned Circular was not

issued. But, the Circular was issued in November, 2010. We

further notice that Ext.P5 as such is not challenged. Ext.P5, as

already noted, is a letter by the University calling upon the

petitioner to produce the permission from the Government of

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">13371/2012V                      123</span>

Kerala after executing agreement. Learned senior counsel for the

petitioners would contend that the petitioners had joined issue with

the Government by sending Exts.P6 and P7 issued by the

Registrar.   We notice, in fact, that Ext.P7 has already been

challenged in the other Writ Petition.     Petitioner had, in fact,

challenged Ext.P7 in this case also. Learned senior counsel would

put it as an oversight. We are not deciding the Writ Petition

challenging Ext.P7 wherein the petitioner obtained interim order.

It was pointed out that we need consider the question of grant of

affiliation sought, for the batch for which the approval is granted

for this year. The same is based on the impugned Circular. In the

other Writ Petition filed by the Ezhuthachan National Academy,

the petitioner had in fact written to the University agreeing to

produce the No Objection Certificate. Learned senior counsel for

the petitioner would submit that it could not be obtained as it was

not issued. We may notice that even as on the date of Ext.P7, the

Circular had not been issued (in WP(C).No.12323/12). In WP(C).

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">13371/2012V                        124</span>

No.13371/12, when Ext.P3 dated 04/6/2011 was sent by the

petitioner, it was stated that the NOC from the Government will be

produced. The Circular was in existence. In WP(C).No.13371/12

is concerned, it was so done as the NOC was given in so far as the

B. Pharm Course is concerned for which NOC was insisted upon

and given also after signing the agreement, it is submitted. More

importantly, we have already noted the stand of the University that

it is acting on the basis of the Government Circular and we are also

only pronouncing on the power of the State Government. We

would also think that in the view we are taking about the lack of

power with the Government and the facts of the cases, it would not

be appropriate to refuse to grant relief, when the Government has

no power under the constitutional scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_153">       46. Shri P. Sreekumar, learned counsel drew our attention to

the recent order passed by a Division Bench of this Court.

Therein, a Bench of this Court apparently disturbed by the fall in

standards in imparting education in Engineering Colleges in the

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;

State of Kerala, proceeded to make certain observations and

directions and the same was brought to our notice. We notice that

the Court has issued interim prohibitory orders against the

Government issuing NOC for starting new colleges. The Court has

also ordered, inter alia, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">             "In any case, if the Government proposes to

       issue/consider NOC for any new Engineering

       College, it should permit it only after being convinced

       that buildings, laboratory and teaching staff are

       provided in advance, and the Government should also

       insist that the Management should produce bonds

       from qualified teaching staff to serve the College in

       the event, NOC, recognition and affiliation are

       granted by the Government, AICTE and University."



</blockquote><p id="p_154">We may also notice that, that was a case of Writ Appeals filed by

Managements of two newly set up Engineering Colleges

challenging orders declining NOC even after the colleges obtained

approval from the All India Council for Technical Education

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">13371/2012V                     126</span>

(AICTE). Learned senior counsel for the petitioners would submit

that the issue which we are called upon to decide, namely the effect

of the Judgment in Jaya Gokul's case (supra), was not considered

by the Bench and, on the other hand, we are called upon

specifically to decide the effect of the dictum in Jaya Gokul's

case. In this case also, we may notice that we are deciding the

issue relating to affiliation.
</p>
<p id="p_155">      47. We are of the view that the issue which we are called

upon to decide, did not arise before the Division Bench.

Undoubtedly, we share the anxiety of the Division Bench that there

is a deplorable fall in the standards of education in Engineering

Colleges in the State. We would, in this regard, notice that the

powers of the University include the power to prescribe conditions

for recognition of institutions for conducting research or other

programmes of the University and to grant recognition to

institutions satisfying the conditions and to withdraw such

recognition (Section 6 Clause (ix) of the Kerala University of

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;

Health Sciences Act, 2010). <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_209">Section 6(xx)</a> deals with the power to

monitor and evaluate the academic performance of affiliated

colleges and recognised institutions for granting continuation of

affiliation and periodical accreditation. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_210">Section 6(xxi)</a> deals with

the power to inspect, where necessary, affiliated colleges and

recognised institutions through suitable machinery established for

the purpose, and take measures to ensure that proper standards of

instruction, teaching and training are maintained by them and

adequate library, laboratory, hospital, faculty and other academic

facilities are provided for. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_211">Section 6(xxviii)</a> deals with power to

prescribe a code of conduct for managements of affiliated or

recognised colleges or institutions. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_212">Section 6(xxxi)</a> deals with

power to rescind affiliation granted to the colleges in violation of

Statutes of the University. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_213">Section 50</a> deals with affiliation and

recognition.     <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_214">Section 50</a> provides for wide powers to the

University. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_215">Section 53</a> deals with continuation of affiliation and

finally <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_216">Section 56</a> deals with the power to withdraw affiliation.

WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">13371/2012V                      128</span>

We would think that there are ample powers with the University to

deal with the problem of fall in standards which we would expect

the University to adopt all possible measures in accordance with

law, so that the alarming fall in standards is arrested. There are

also ample powers with AICTE.
</p>
<p id="p_156">        48. But, all this will not result in the conclusion which we

have arrived at on the basis of the decision of the Apex Court in

Jaya Gokul's case that it is not open to the State Government to

insist for NOC as is done in this case. We would think, therefore,

that the Circular issued by the Government in so far as it relates to

the Courses which are specifically covered by the provisions of the

AICTE Act and covered by the decision in Jaya Gokul's case, is

clearly beyond the powers of the State Government. In the light of

our conclusion regarding the absence of power with the State to

insist on a NOC as adumbrated above, we are not pronouncing on

the other questions.

<p id="p_157">WP(C).NOS.12323/12M &amp;

</p><p id="p_158">      49. In view of the fact that we are holding that Government

does not have the power to insist upon NOC in the matter of

affiliation, necessarily the conditions subject to which the NOC

can be given would also automatically not survive, as the question

of imposing conditions would arise only if the power is ceded to

the Government to demand NOC. Resultantly, we allow WP(C).

No.12323/12 and WP(C).No.13371/12 as follows:

</p><p id="p_159">         We quash Exts.P15 Circular in WP(C).No.12323/12 in so

far as the same insists on compliance of the condition of

production of NOC imposed by the Government as a condition for

grant    of   affiliation.  Ext.P7   also   is   quashed.    The

respondent/University will consider the question of grant of

affiliation to the M. Pharm Course in the petitioner's College

sanctioned by the AICTE vide Ext.P12 for the year 2012-2013 as

expeditiously as possible and in accordance with law. We make it

clear that we have not pronounced on the powers of the University

and it will be open to the University to pass such orders and

stipulate such conditions as are lawful as it may be advised to

impose.
</p>
<p id="p_160">       We also quash Ext.P8 in W.P.(C).No.13371/12 in so far as it

insists on the NOC from the State Government to grant affiliation.

Ext.P11 Circular is also quashed in so far as it insists on the

compliance of the condition imposed by the Government, namely

the production of NOC from the Government as a condition for

grant of affiliation. We direct the University to consider the

question of grant of affiliation for the M. Pharm Course in the

petitioner's college as sanctioned by the AICTE for the academic

year 2012-2013 at the earliest. We make it clear that we have not

pronounced on the powers of the University and it will be open to

the University to pass such orders and stipulate such conditions as

are lawful as it may be advised to impose.

apprehension of the learned Government Pleader, we make it clear

are governed by the AICTE Act. We make it further clear that we
