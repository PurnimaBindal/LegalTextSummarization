                          1.    KEI Industries Ltd, the plaintiff, alleges infringement, by the

                          registration both as a word mark and as the               device mark.
                          Accordingly, the plaint seeks a decree of permanent injunction,

                           2.      With the plaint, the plaintiff has filed an application, under
                          Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
                          (CPC), seeking interlocutory injunctive reliefs. Learned Counsel for
                          both sides have been heard at length on this application, which the
                          present order disposes of.


                          Facts</pre>


<p id="p_1">                          3.      The dispute, in the present case, is not so much one of whether
                          the mark used by the defendants does, or does not, infringe the
                          plaintiffs registered marks, but whether the defendants are entitled to
                          use the said mark. Given the nature of the controversy, it would be
                          appropriate to proceed by setting out the rival stands of both sides, as
                          they emerge from the pleadings.

</p><p id="p_3">                          4.      According to the plaintiff, it was initially functioning as
                          Krishna Electrical Industries, a partnership firm, which was
                          subsequently incorporated into the plaintiff-public limited Company
                          on 31st December, 1992.           It claims to have been using the
                          trademark/trade name/corporate name &#x27;KEI&#x27; since the commencement
                          of its business in 1968, and that the word mark &#x27;KEI&#x27; was first
                          registered in favour of the plaintiff in Class 9 for Wires and Cables
                          (Electric and Telecommunication) on 27th September, 1988.
                          Thereafter, the said word Mark &#x27;KEI&#x27; was registered, in favour of the
                          plaintiff, in Classes 6 , 16, 35, 37 and 42.

                          adopted the logo mark &quot;             &quot; in 2007, with respect to its goods
                          and services, since which time the plaintiff claims to have been using
                          the said logo extensively, exclusively and continuously. Registrations

                          for the said Device Mark                  are held, by the plaintiff, in
                          Classes 6 and 9, w.e.f. 14th June, 2007 and 29th June, 2007,
                          respectively, as well as in Classes 16, 35, 37 and 42. Among the
                          goods in respect of which the plaintiffs word and device marks are
                          registered are wires and cables and electrical items.

                          registrations held by the plaintiff, it may not be necessary, for the
                          purposes of the present order, to make exhaustive reference thereto.
                          Equally, the recitals, in the plaint, regarding the reputation that the
                          plaintiff claims to have amassed over the years, and the various
                          encomiums earned by it, relating to the use of the aforesaid marks, are
                          also not of particular significance. Suffice it to state that the plaintiff
                          avers that, by dint of long and extensive usage, the &#x27;KEI&#x27; mark has
                          acquired considerable goodwill and reputation.

                          noticed that the defendant had applied for registration of the

                          &quot;         &quot; Mark under Classes 7, 11 and 35. In view of the fact that

                          assert its exclusive rights over the &#x27;KEI&#x27; mark, addressed a cease and
                          desist notice, dated 31st October, 2017, to the defendants, calling upon
                          the defendants to cease and desist from using the Mark &#x27;KEI&#x27; and to
                          withdraw the applications filed by them with the Trade Marks
                          Registry, for registration of the said marks. The defendants responded
                          to the legal notice, to which the plaintiff rejoined on 31st October,
                          2017.    Oppositions were also filed, by the plaintiff, before the
                          Registry of Trade Marks, against the applications for registration filed
                          by the defendants.

                          suit, seeking injunction as noticed here in before. The plaintiff alleges
                          that, as the trademark &#x27;KEI&#x27; has, with the passage of time, become a
                          source identifier of the goods and businesses of the plaintiff, and as
                          &#x27;KEI&#x27; is the most prominent, essential and striking part of the

                          defendants&#x27;            mark, it was inevitable that a person who came
                          across the defendants mark would be immediately deceived and
                          confused, and misled into believing that the defendants&#x27; goods
                          emerged from the plaintiff&#x27;s stable. This possibility of deception,
                          asserts the plaint, is exacerbated by the fact that the defendants are
                          also using the impugned mark in connection with electrical goods.
                          The plaintiff alleges that the defendants are clearly trying to illegally
                          capitalise on the goodwill and reputation earned by the plaintiff, and
                          its mark. This, it is further alleged, has also diluted the goodwill and

                          and business, in the name and style of Kwality Electrico (India) was
                          commenced, by Om Prakash Kwatra (&quot;OPK&quot;, hereinafter), the father
                          of Defendant 1 Raman Kwatra, in 1966, under the trademark/label


                          &quot;         &quot;, in relation to electrical goods such as electric fans, room
                          coolers, geysers, electric heating apparatus, electric rods, and the like.
                          It is averred that Kwality Electrico (India) was registered, on 1 st
                          September, 1966, as a sole proprietorship of OPK. Thereafter, two
                          partnership deeds came to be executed, the first on 1st April, 1998 and
                          the second on 1st April, 2001. Though the former partnership deed,
                          dated 1st April 1988, is not on record, the latter partnership deed dated
                          1st April 2001 makes reference to the former. The partnership deed
                          dated 1st April, 2001, states that OPK, Rakesh Kwatra and Defendant
                          1 Raman Kwatra executed a partnership deed on 1st April, 1998, to
                          work as a partnership under the name and style of Kwality Electrico
                          (India), and that the second partnership deed, dated 1st April, 2001,
                          was only executed to modify the terms of remuneration of the
                          partners. Later, by a Dissolution Deed dated 31 st March, 2004, the
                          aforesaid partnership Kwality Electrico (India) was dissolved, as
                          Rakesh Kwatra did not desire to continue as a partner.               The

                          partnership deed was executed between OPK and Raman Kwatra on
                          17th April, 2004, in which the intent of OPK and Raman Kwatra to

                          Electrico (India), was again reiterated, with the partnership coming
                          into effect on 1st April, 2004, i.e. immediately consequent to the
                          dissolution deed dated 31st March 2004 becoming operative. This
                          third partnership deed dated 17th April, 2004 recorded that the
                          partnership would be dealing in the business of electrical goods and

                          liabilities of the erstwhile partnership, comprising OPK, Rakesh
                          Kwatra and the Raman Kwatra were taken over by this firm.

                          firm under the trademark &#x27;KEI&#x27;. It is further asserted, in the written
                          statement, that, in 2008, Defendant 1 conceived the impugned

                                    mark, which he has been using since then. The written
                          statement also asserts that the abbreviated &#x27;KEI&#x27;, in the format in

                          which it finds place in the impugned             mark, was in use since
                          1966, through OPK.
</p>

<p id="p_22">                          15.   On 11th May, 2016, the defendants filed applications under
                          Classes 7 and 11 with the Trade Marks Registry, seeking registration

                          of the impugned             Mark in respect of electric motor pumps,
                          juicer, mixer, grinders, cooler pumps, fans, exhaust fans, air
                          conditioners, toaster, geysers, electric oven, electric kettles, electric

                          trace their right to use the &#x27;KEI&#x27; mark back to 1966, when its use was
                          commenced by OPK. As such, the defendants claim priority of user,
                          over the plaintiff, of the &#x27;KEI&#x27; mark.

                          Defendant 1 Raman Kwatra inherited, from OPK, the right to use the
                          &#x27;KEI&#x27; mark. There is no line of succession, points out Mr. Lal, to be
                          found in the written statement of the defendants, on the basis whereof
                          it could be said that the defendants succeeded to the rights to use the


                          &#x27;KEI&#x27; mark or the device mark &quot;           &quot; which was originally being
                          used by OPK since 1966. That being the position, Mr. Lall submits
                          that the coinage and adoption, by Defendant 1 Raman Kwatra of the

                          impugned            Mark is of 2008 vintage, so that the plaintiff has
                          priority of user.
</p>

<p id="p_26">                          18.   Mr Lall submits that, by virtue of the Indemnity Bond and
                          Consent Letter dated 25th May, 2009 and the DSIDC letter dated 24th
                          November, 2009, it was the erstwhile firm, of which OPK and
                          Defendant 1 Raman Kwatra were partners, which was converted into
                          a sole proprietorship of Raman Kwatra. As such, Mr. Lall submits
                          that Raman Kwatra succeeded only to the firm, which was converted
                          into a sole proprietorship in his name. Insofar as the right to use the

                          which Rajiv Kwatra succeeded. Mr. Yadav places reliance, in this
                          context, on the judgement of a learned Single Judge of this Court in

                          by the plaintiff, as contained in the plaint, Mr. Yadav submits that the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s registration is only in Class 9 for wires and cables and that
                          it has not succeeded in obtaining registration under Class 11, whereas
                          the defendant is manufacturing electrical appliances, which fall under
                          Classes 7 and 11, under the impugned mark. As such, contends Mr.

                          2008, whereas the plaintiff&#x27;s adoption is of 1968. He refers, in this
                          context, to the sales figures provided in para 8 of the plaint, and points
                          out that, even in 2008, the sales of products using his client&#x27;s mark
                          were to the tune of ₹ 1055 crores. Clearly, therefore, submits Mr.
                          Lall, the user, by the defendants, of the impugned mark, is subsequent
                          in point of time to the user by the plaintiff of its registered mark.

                          by OPK to Rajiv Kwatra. As Rajiv Kwatra was using the said mark in
                          the same business as Defendant 1 Raman Kwatra, Mr. Lall submits
                          that Defendant 1 cannot seek shelter under <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_13">Section 12</a> of the Trade

                          provision which applies only to registration and not to use. Referring
                          to the registrations held by his client, Mr. Lall submits that they
                          extended to the areas covered by the products of the defendants, as
                          they cover &quot;all kinds of electrical and electronic instruments&quot;.

                          said decision, the Supreme Court held that the registration granted for
                          tobacco would cover cigarettes as well, though it did opine that the
                          registrant ought to have got the mark rectified to lessen its sweep. He
                          points out that the defendants have not applied to the Trade Marks
                          Registry for rectification of the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark. Nor
                          have they pleaded, in their written statement, that the plaintiff
                          registered trade marks are unduly wide.

                          status on the website of the Registry of Trademarks. It is also

                          the written statement of the defendants in the present suit, that the
                          right to use the &quot;KWALITY&quot; brand was granted, prior to his demise,
                          by OPK to Rajiv Kwatra and that it was on that basis that Rajiv


                          Kwatra applied and obtained the registration for the mark

                           the right to use the         mark had been specifically bequeathed by
                          OPK to Rajiv Kwatra. Defendant 1 has not disputed the legitimacy of
                          the registrations obtained by Rajiv Kwatra in respect of the said


                                    mark under Classes 9 and 11 on 23rd April, 2005 and 2nd

                          OPK, entirely in his elder brother Rajiv Kwatra, and that he had no
                          right to use the said mark. In view thereof, it is not open to Defendant


                          1 to plead that he had succeeded to the right to use the           mark
                          from OPK.      Despite the line of succession by which the initial
                          proprietorship of OPK was converted into a partnership of OPK,
                          Rakesh Kwatra and Defendant 1, thereafter, into a partnership of OPK
                          and Defendant 1 and, thereafter, into a proprietorship of Defendant 1,


                          the right to use the           mark was specifically vested by OPK,

<p id="p_57">                          40.   Insofar as similarity between        and the plaintiff&#x27;s registered
                          marks are concerned, the aspect of infringement is self apparent. The
                          plaintiff holds a valid and subsisting word mark registration for the
                          word &#x27;KEI&#x27;, in respect of electric wires and cables. Any use, by any
                          other party, of the acronym &#x27;KEI&#x27;, in respect of identical or similar
                          goods would amount to infringement. The use, by the defendants, of

                          the impugned          mark, in respect of electric fans, electric water
                          heaters, immersion water heaters etc. is, therefore, prima facie

                          and          device mark, within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the

<p id="p_58">                          41.   I also find substance in the contention of Mr. Lall that, in

                          removing, from the impugned            mark, the reference to &quot;Kwality


                          Electrico India&quot;, which figured in the earlier          mark being used

                          have removed the main feature by which a customer could know that

                          instruments. There is, therefore, clear prima facie infringement, by

                          the defendants, by use of the impugned            mark, of the plaintiff&#x27;s

<p id="p_60">                          43.     The defendants, admittedly, coined the impugned mark only in
                          2008.    The plaintiff&#x27;s word mark registration dates back to 27th
                          September, 1988 and its device mark registrations to 14th and 29th
                          June, 2007. The plaintiff, therefore, has priority of registration, vis-à-
                          vis the defendants. The planitiff has claimed user since 1966, which
                          has been accepted by the Registry of Trade Mark while granting
                          registration to the plaintiff. The earliest invoices of the defendants, as
                          Mr. Lall, has correctly points out are of the year 2015. The plaintiff
                          has, therefore, not only priority of registration but also priority of user
                          vis-à-vis the defendants.

                          in respect of same or similar goods. It does not envisage honest and

                          to the judgement of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_25">Power Control Appliances

                           considered opinion, an authority for the proposition that a provision
                          which permits grant of concurrent registrations of identical or similar
                          trade marks, if the use of the latter mark is honest and concurrent,
                          cannot be used as a defence to a charge of infringement. To that
                          extent, the position, as it obtained in the 1958 Act, vis-à-vis the
                          <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_32">Copyright Act</a>, is identical to the position which obtains in the present
                          <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_33">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_34">The Trade Marks Act</a>, too, envisages honest
                          and concurrent user only as a ground on which concurrent
                          registrations of similar or identical marks could be granted by the
                          Registry of Trade Marks. There is no provision, in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_35">Trade Marks
                          Act</a>, which contemplates honest and concurrent user as a defence to a
                          charge of infringement of trade mark. Where a case of infringement
                          is made out, therefore, injunction has necessarily to follow, and it is
                          no defence to the defendant to urge that the user, by the defendant, of
                          the allegedly infringing mark, was honest and concurrent. \

                          this regard. It states that &quot;the registration of trademark shall, if valid,

                                       the time of seeking registration and when confronted
                                       with &#x27;HMT&#x27;, &#x27;HMV&#x27;, &#x27;HMW&#x27;, &#x27;H.M. Tex Kamal&#x27; and
                                       &#x27;H.M.C.&#x27;, having taken a stand that the mark has to be
                                       considered in entirety, may be considered at this stage.
                                       The question to be adjudicated is, whether the
                                       plaintiffs, having taken such a stand, is estopped from
                                       suing for infringement. The question, in my opinion,
                                       cannot be answered in abstract and has to be answered
                                       on facts. None of the businesses, marks whereof as
                                       aforesaid the plaintiffs were confronted with, were in
                                       any business even remotely connected to business of
                                       the plaintiffs. In fact the marks HMT &amp; HMV were
                                       abbreviations of their earlier namesHindustan Machine
                                       Tools and His Masters Voice respectively and which
                                       businesses, over the years had come to be referred by
                                       their abbreviation. Merely because the plaintiffs at the
                                       stage of seeking registration took a stand as aforesaid,
                                       cannot stop the plaintiff from exercising its statutory
                                       and natural rights. There is no estoppels against
                                       statute.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_75">                                42.    In any event, as there is no estoppel against statute, the
                                stand taken by plaintiff in reply to the examination report is
                                not relevant.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_76">                          50.   As, on facts, I have found there to be a prima facie case of
                          infringement, by the defendants, of the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trade
                          marks, I do not deem it necessary to burden this judgement with a
                          discussion of all the judgements cited at the Bar, many of which are,
                          in any event, merely interlocutory orders, which cannot be said to be
                          of binding precedential authority.
