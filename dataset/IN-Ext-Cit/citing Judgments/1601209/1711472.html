<p id="p_1">ORDER
 

L. Narasimha Reddy, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1. These two Transfer C.M. Ps are between the same parties and in relation to the same cause of action. Hence, they are disposed of through a common order. For the sake of convenience the parties are referred to, as arrayed in Transfer C.M.P. No. 298 of 2006.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2. The petitioner is a Corporation established by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. It issued a notice, dated 5-10-2004 inviting tenders for sale of cleaning nuts of about 2500 quintals, stored at four centers. The second respondent submitted its tender for purchase of quantity at Hyderabad center and it emerged as the highest bidder, by quoting Rs. 4,500/- per quintal. The tender was accepted and the contract came into existence.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3. The petitioner initiated steps for forfeiture of the E.M.D. of about Rs. 10 lakhs. The respondents filed O.S. No. 209 of 2006 in the Court of Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, challenging the forfeiture. The petitioner, on the other hand, filed O.S.No.112 of 2006 in the Court of II Additional District Judge, Visakhapatnam for recovery of a sum of Rs. 54,80,000/- towards damages said to have been suffered by it, on account of breach, alleged to have been committed by the respondents.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">4. Transfer C.M.P. No.298 of 2006 is filed with a prayer to transfer O.S. No.209 of 2006 from the Court of Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, to the Court of II Additional District Judge, Visakhapatnam, so that it can be tried along with O.S. No. 1 12 of 2006 pending in that Court. Transfer C.M.P. No. 395 of 2006 is filed by the respondents for exactly opposite relief.
</p> 

<p id="p_6">5. Sri Sridhar Reddy, learned Standing Counsel for the petitioner submits that the tender notification emanated from the Head Office of the petitioner at Visakhapatnam, and there is a clause in the conditions conferring exclusive jurisdiction at Visakhapatnam, and in that view of the matter the suit filed by the respondents herein deserves to be transferred to the appropriate Court at Visakhapatnam.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">6. Sri Surya Prakash Rao, learned Counsel for the respondents on the other hand submits that the entire transaction i.e., receiving tenders, finalization of contract had taken place at Hyderabad and in that view of the matter, it cannot be said that his client has filed the suit in a Court, which does not have jurisdiction. Both the Counsel placed reliance upon the judgments of the Supreme Court, in support of their respective contentions.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">7. The effect and purport of clauses conferring jurisdiction in the Courts at a particular place has been dealt with by the Supreme Court on number of occasions. For instance, in <a href="/doc/1695101/" id="a_1">Patel Roadways Limited v. Prasad Trading Co</a>. , it was held that parties to contract cannot confer jurisdiction on Courts, which in fact do not have such jurisdiction. In the matter of corporate persons a slightly different approach was indicated. It was held that where a corporate person had a principal office at one place and a branch or subordinate office at different place, a suit can be maintained at both the places, notwithstanding the clause conferring exclusive jurisdiction in the Courts at any particular place. Discussion was undertaken on similar and certain other aspects in <a href="/doc/1601209/" id="a_2">Main Paul v. State of Haryana</a> . However, an important aspect to be noted is that in both the cases the question was as to whether the Courts in which the suits were instituted have territorial jurisdiction at all, particularly, in the context of clauses, conferring exclusive jurisdiction at named places, and from the point of view of transfer of proceedings on the ground of convenience.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">8. In the instant case, the sequence of events and nature of transaction are such that the Courts at Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad can be said to be having territorial jurisdiction. The reason is that the Court at Hyderabad would have jurisdiction because tender forms were received, tenders were submitted and negotiations were held at Hyderabad. The tender notice as such, on the other hand, emanated from Visakhapatnam and the letter of acceptance was issued from that place by the Managing Director of the petitioner. Therefore, the Court at Visakhapatnam can entertain the suit in relation to the same transaction. In matters of this nature, the place of residence of the defendants in the respective suits assumes secondary importance.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">9. It is also settled principle of law that while dealing with the application under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court cannot delve into the existence or lack of territorial jurisdiction of the respective Courts. The predominant factor would be of convenience to both the parties and no pronouncement can be made on the issue relating to territorial jurisdiction. In fact, such issues have to be decided by the Courts, in which, the suits are filed.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">10. Viewed from the context of the convenience of the parties, it emerges that the petitioner had its Head Office at Visakhapatnam and an equally important Regional Office, in the State capital, at Hyderabad. A substantial portion of transaction has taken place at Hyderabad, in the form of issuance and acceptance of tenders, undertaking negotiations etc. The respondents are residing at Hyderabad. No inconvenience could be caused to the petitioner if the suits are decided by the Court at Hyderabad. On the other hand, the respondents would be put to hardship, though not of serious nature, if they are required to defend or prosecute the matters at Visakhapatnam, to which place they are absolutely strangers.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">11. For the foregoing reasons, the Transfer C.M.P. No. 298 of 2006 is dismissed. The Transfer C.M.P. No. 395 of 2006 is allowed. Consequently, O.S. No. 112 of 2006 shall stand transferred from the Court of II Additional District Judge, Visakhapatnam to the Court of the Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, and on such transfer, it shall be heard along with O.S. No.209 of 2006 pending in that Court. No costs.
