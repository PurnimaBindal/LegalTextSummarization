Applicability of.



HEADNOTE:
     The Hindustan  Commercial Bank, the Bank of Cochin Ltd.
and Lakshmi  Commercial Bank  were amalgamated	with  Punjab
National Bank, Canara Bank, State Bank of India respectively
in  terms  of  separate	 schemes  drawn	 under	the  <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_3">Banking
Regulation Act</a>,	 1949, and pursuant thereto 125 employees of
these  banks   were  excluded  from  employment,  and  their
services were  not taken  over by  the respective transferee
banks. Some of these excluded employees filed writ petitions
before the  High Court	which granted partial relief, but on
appeal by  the	transferee  Bank  the  Writ  Petitions	were
dismissed by the Division Bench.
     Against this,  appeals  by	 Special  Leave	 were  filed
before this Court. Some of the excluded employees filed writ
petitions before this Court directly.
     It was  contended on  behalf of  the excluded employees
that the draft schemes did not include any name of employees
intended to  be excluded; that no opportunity of being heard
as afforded  to them  before exclusion	was ordered, and the
authorities concerned  had not	acted fairly;  that none  of
them was responsible for ficticious, improper or
189
on-business  like   advances  of  loan	to  parties  thereby
bringing conditions nearabout bankruptcy for the appropriate
banking companies,  that many  other employees	against whom
there were  definite charges already pending enquiry or even
orders of  dismissal had  been proposed	 had been taken over
and retained  in service of the transferee banks while these
excluded employees,  without justification,  had been called
upon to face this unfortunate situation.
     The transferee banks, the Reserve Bank of India and the
Union of  India	 filed	affidavits  in	opposition.  It	 was
contended on behalf of the Union of India that the scheme in
respect of  each of  the amalgamated banks had been approved
by it  as required  under the  Act and	since  finality	 was
attached  to   such  schemes,	the  schemes  could  not  be
challenged, particularly in view of the provisions contained
in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_4">Article  31-A</a> of  the Constitution.	It was	contended on
behalf of the Reserve Bank of India that law did not require
that the  draft scheme	should	contain	 the  names  of	 the
employees to  be excluded,  that the  incorporation  of	 the
names finalised	 on the	 basis of  scrutiny of	the  records
before the schemes were placed before the RBI was sufficient
compliance  of	 the  requirements  of	the  law;  that	 the
provisions of  the Act	did not	 confer	 any  right  on	 the
employees of being heard; that the scheme-making process was
legislative in character and, therefore, did not come within
the ambit  of natural  justice, and  the action,  not  being
judicial  or   quasijudicial  and,   at	 the   most,   being
administrative or  executive was  also not open to challenge
on allegations	of violation  of rules	of natural  justice;
that moratorium	 under the statutory provisions could not be
beyond six  months and	in view	 of the fact that the entire
operation had to be finalised within a brief time frame, the
requirement of	an enquiry  by notice to all the officers to
be excluded  could not	have been  intended to	be implanted
into the  provisions of	 <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_5">section 45</a>  and that  provision  of
compensation had  been made for those who were excluded from
the respective schemes.
     Allowing the writ petitions and appeals, this Court,
^
     HELD:  1.	 Rules	 of   natural	justice	  apply	  to
administrative action  and the decision to exclude a section
of the	employees without  complying  with  requirements  of
natural justice was bad. [206H]
     2.1 Fair  play is part of public policy and a guarantee
for justice to citizens. In our system of Rule of Law, every
social agency conferred with power is required to act fairly
so that	 social action	would be  just, and  there would  be
furtherance of the well-being of citizens. [207E]
190
     2.2 The  rules of	natural justice	 have developed with
the growth  of A  civilization and  the content	 thereof  is
often considered  as  a	 proper	 measure  of  the  level  of
civilization and  Rule of  Law prevailing  in the community.
[207E-F]
     2.3 Natural  justice generally  requires  that  persons
liable to  be directly	affected by  proposed administrative
acts, decisions	 or proceedings	 be given adequate notice of
what is	 proposed so  that they	 may be in a position (a) to
make representation on their own behalf; (b) or to appear at
a hearing  or enquiry  (if one is held); and (c) effectively
to prepare  their own  case and	 to answer the case (if any)
they  had   to	meet.	Even  when   a	State	agency	acts
administratively,   rules    of	  natural    justice   would
apply.[206C-D]
     3.1 <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_6">Section  45</a> of the Banking Regulations Act provides
a legislative  scheme and the different steps required to be
taken have  been put  one  after  the  other.  On  a  simple
construction of sub-sections (5) and (6) and on the basis of
the sequence pattern adopted in <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_7">section 45</a>, it is clear that
the Act	 contemplates the  employees to	 be excluded  to  be
specifically named  in the draft scheme. Since it is a draft
scheme prepared	 by RBI	 and right  to	object	or  to	make
suggestions is	extended to both the banking company as also
the transferee bank, and in view of the fact that clause (i)
of sub-section	(5) specifies this item to be a matter which
may be	included in  the scheme,  it must  follow  that	 the
legislative intention  is that	the scheme would incorporate
the names  of such  employees as are intended to be excluded
in accordance  with the	 scheme. Once  it is incorporated in
the scheme,  the banking company as also the transferee bank
would be  entitled to  suggest/object to  the  inclusion  of
names of employees. [199E-F; H; 200A-B]
     3.2 In  case some	employees of the banking company are
intended to be excluded, their names have to be specifically
mentioned in  the scheme at the draft stage. The requirement
of specific  mention is significant and the legislature must
be taken  to have  intended compliance of the requirement at
that stage. The excluded employees in the instant case, were
in employment  under the  contract in  the banking companies
which were  private banks.  They  have	been  excluded	from
service under  the transferee  banks and  the contracts	 had
been terminated	 as a  result of inclusion of their names in
the schemes.  This exclusion  has  adversely  affected	this
category of  employees and  has brought	 about prejudice and
adverse civil consequences to them. [200D-E]
     4.1 Natural  justice cannot be employed in the exercise
of legisla-
191
tive power.  Power has	been conferred on the RBI in certain
situations to  A take  steps for  applying  to	the  Central
Government for	an order of moratorium and during the period
of  moratorium	 to   propose	either	 reconstruction	  or
amalgamation of	 the  banking  company.	 A  scheme  for	 the
purposes contemplated  has to  be framed  by RBI  and placed
before the  Central Government	for sanction. Power has been
vested in  the	Central	 Government  in	 terms	of  what  is
ordinarily known  as a Henery-8 clause for making orders for
removal of difficulties. [201H; 202A-B]
     4.2 <a href="/doc/601446/" id="a_8">Section  45(11)</a> requires  that copies of the scheme
as also such orders made by the Central Government are to be
placed before  both Houses  of Parliament.  This requirement
does  not   make  the	exercise  in  regard  to  schemes  a
legislative process.  Framing of the scheme under <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_9">section 45</a>
does not  involve a  legislative process, and as such, rules
of natural  justice are	 applicable  to	 the  instant  case.
[202C]
     4.3 The fact that orders made by the Central Government
for removing  difficulties as  contemplated under sub-clause
(10) were  also to  be	placed	before	the  two  Houses  of
Parliament makes it abundantly clear that the placing of the
scheme before  the two	Houses is  not a  relevant test	 for
making the scheme framing process legislative. [203B]
     5.1 RBI  which monitored  the three  amalgamations	 was
required to  act fairly	 in  the  facts	 of  the  case.	 The
situation necessitated	a participatory enquiry in regard to
the excluded  employees.  If  an  opportunity  to  know	 the
allegations and	 to have  their say  had been afforded, they
could have  no grievance  on this score. The action deprives
them  of   their  livelihood   and  brings   adverse   civil
consequences and  could obviously  not be  taken on the ipse
dixit of  RBI owners  without verification of facts. In view
of the	time frame,  a detailed	 enquiry may not be possible
but keeping  the legislative  scheme  in  view,	 perhaps,  a
simpler enquiry could be afforded. [206E-F]
     5.2 In the facts of the case, there is no justification
to hold	 that rules  of natural	 justice have been ousted by
necessary implication  on account  of the time frame. On the
other hand,  the time  limited by statute provides scope for
an opportunity	to be  extended	 to  the  intended  excluded
employees before  the scheme  is finalised so that a hearing
commensurate to	 the situation	is afforded before a section
of the employees is thrown out of employment. [207F-G]
     5.3 There	is no  justification to	 think	of  a  post-
decisional hearing. H
192
on the	other  hand,  the  normal  rule	 should	 apply.	 The
excluded  employees   have  already   been  thrown   out  of
employment and	having been deprived of livelihood they must
be facing serious difficulties. There is no justification to
throw  them  out  of  employment  and  then  given  them  an
opportunity of	representation when  the requirement is that
they should have the opportunity as a condition precedent to
action. It  is common  experience that	once a	decision has
been  taken,  there  is	 a  tendency  to  uphold  it  and  a
representation may  not really	yield any  fruitful purpose.
[208A-C]
     6. Protection of the umbrella of conclusive evidence is
not attached to a situation as in the instant case, so as to
bar the question regarding the requirements of the procedure
laid down  under the Act and the opportunity afforded to the
excluded employees from being examined. There is, therefore,
nothing in  sub-section	 (7A)  of  <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_10">section  45</a>	to  preclude
examination of the question. [208G]
     [Each of  the three  transferee banks  should take over
the excluded  employees on  the same terms and conditions of
employment under  the respective  banking companies prior to
amalgamation. The employees would be entitled to the benefit
of continuity  of service  for all purposes including salary
and  perks   throughout	 the  period.  It  is  open  to	 the
transferee banks to take such action as they consider proper
against these  employees in accordance with law. There is no
justification to penalise some of the excluded employees who
have not  come to  the Court.  They too shall be entitled to
the same benefits as the petitioners.] [208H; 209A-<a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_11">B]

of the Constitution and appeals by special leave are against
the judgment  of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court
in writ	 appeals have  a common set of facts as also law for
consideration. These  matters have  been heard	together and
are disposed of by this common judgment.
</p><p id="p_5">	  Hindustan Commercial Bank ('Hindustan' for short).
The Bank  of Cochin  Ltd. (hereafter  referred to as 'Cochin
Bank') and  Lakshmi Commercial	Bank ('Lakshmi'	 for  short)
were private banks. Action was initiated under <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_20">section 45</a> of
the Banking  Regulation Act,  1949  ('Act'  for	 short)	 for
amalgamation of these three banks with Punjab National Bank,
Canara Bank and State Bank of India respectively in terms of
separate schemes  drawn under  that provision  of  the	Act.
Amalgamation has  been made.  Pursuant to  the	schemes,  28
employees of  Hindustan, 21  employees of Cochin Bank and 76
employees of Lakshmi were excluded from employment and their
services were  not taken  over by  the respective transferee
banks. Some  of these  excluded employees of the Cochin Bank
went before  the Kerala	 High Court for relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article
226</a> of	the Constitution.  A learned  Single Judge gave them
partial relief but on an appeal to the Division Bench by the
transferee bank	 concerned  the	 writ  petitions  have	been
dismissed. The civil appeals are against the decision of the
Division Bench.	 The writ  petitions directly  filed  before
this  Court  are  by  some  of	the  excluded  employees  of
Hindustan and Lakshmi respectively.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">194</span>
<p id="p_6">     Though  employees	of  the	 other	two  banks  had	 not
challenged the	vires of <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_22">section 45</a> of the Act, on behalf of
Lakshmi such a challenge has been made. Since the grounds of
attack on  this score  did not	Impress us at all, we do not
propose to refer to that aspect of the submissions involving
interpretation of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_23">Article 31-A</a>,  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_24">Article 16</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_25">Article 21.</a>
It has	often been said by this Court that Courts should not
enter into  constitutional issues and attempt interpretation
of its provisions unless it is really necessary for disposal
of the	dispute. In  our opinion, this group of cases can be
disposed of  without reference	to question of vires of some
part of	 <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_26">section 45</a>  of the  Act being	examined. Counsel on
behalf of the excluded employees have broadly contended that
the draft  schemes did	not include  any name  of  employees
intended to  be excluded;  no opportunity of being heard was
afforded to  them before  exclusion was	 ordered  under	 the
schemes and the authorities concerned have not acted fairly;
they deny  the allegation  that any  of them was responsible
for ficticious,	 improper or  non-business like	 advances of
loan to	 parties  thereby  bringing  conditions	 near  about
bankruptcy for the appropriate banking companies; many other
employees against  whom there  were definite charges already
pending	 enquiry  or  even  orders  of	dismissal  had	been
proposed have been taken over and retained in service of the
transferee banks  while	 these	excluded  employees  without
justification have been called upon to face this unfortunate
situation.
</p><p id="p_7">     The  transferee   banks,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India
(hereafter referred  to as  RBI for  short) and the Union of
India have  appeared and filed affidavits in opposition. The
Union of  India has  contended that the scheme in respect of
each of the banks that has got amalgamated had been approved
by it  as required  under the  Act and	since  finality	 was
attached to  such schemes challenge was not open against the
schemes particularly  in view of the provisions contained in
<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_27">Article 3</a>  I-A of the Constitution. On behalf of the Reserve
Bank of	 India, several	 contentions were  raised by  way of
opposition and shortly stated these submissions are:-
</p><p id="p_8">	  (1) Law  does not  require that  the draft  scheme
should contain the names of the employees to be excluded;
</p><p id="p_9">	  (2) The  incorporation of  the names	finalised on

</blockquote><p id="p_12">Allegations advanced  on behalf of the excluded employees is
that the  draft scheme	contemplated under  sub-<a href="/doc/1463767/" id="a_35">section 6(a)</a>
did not specifically mention names of the excluded employees
and at	a later stage when the scheme was sent up by the RBI
to the Central Government a schedule containing the names of
the excluded  employees was attached to each of the schemes.
<a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_36">Section 45</a>  of the Act provides a legislative scheme and the
different steps required to be taken under this section have
been put  one after  the other.	 A reading  of this  section
indicates a sequence oriented pattern. What would ordinarily
be incorporated	 in the	 draft scheme  is indicated  in sub-
section (5).  After the	 requirements of sub-section (5) are
complied with  and the	scheme comes to a presentable shape,
sub-section (6)(a)  requires a	copy thereof  as prepared by
RBI to	be sent	 to the banking company (transferer) as also
to the	transferer  bank.  Clause  (b)	of  sub-section	 (6)
authorises RBI	to make modifications in the draft scheme as
it may	consider necessary  in the  light of suggestions and
objections  received   from  the  banking  company  and	 the
transferee bank.  On a	simple construction  of sub-sections
(5) and (6) and on the basis of the sequence pattern adopted
in <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_37">section  45</a> it  would be  legitimate to hold that the Act
contemplates the employees to be excluded to be specifically
named in  the draft  scheme. Since  it	is  a  draft  scheme
prepared  by  RBI  and	the  right  to	object	or  to	make
suggestions is	extended to both the banking company as also
the transferee bank, and in view of the fact that clause
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">200</span>
</p><p id="p_13">(i) of	sub-section (5)	 specifies this	 item to be a matter
which may be included in the scheme, it must follow that the
legislative intention  is that	the scheme would incorporate
the names  of such  employees as are intended to be excluded
in accordance  with the	 scheme. Once  it is incorporated in
the scheme  the banking	 company as also the transferee bank
would be  entitled to  suggest/object to  the  inclusion  of
names of  employees. It may be that the names of some of the
employees may  have been  wrongly included  and the  banking
company-the hither-to  employer would  be in  a position  to
suggest/object to  the inclusion of the names or it may even
be that	 names of  some undesirable  employees which  should
have been left out have been omitted and the banking company
as the	extant employer	 of such  employees  would  be	most
competent to  deal with	 such a	 situation  to	bring  about
rectifications by  exercising the power to suggest/object to
the draft  scheme. The	contention advanced on behalf of RBI
that since  it is  open to  it under  sub-section (6)(b)  of
<a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_38">section 45</a>  to make  modifications of the draft scheme, even
if the	names were  not included  earlier, at  the stage  of
finalising the	scheme for  placing it	before	the  Central
Government as  required under  sub-section (7),	 the earlier
non-inclusion is  not a	 contravention is not acceptable. We
are of	the view  that in case some employees of the banking
company are  intended to be excluded, their names have to be
specifically mentioned in the scheme at the draft stage. The
requirement of	specific  mention  is  significant  and	 the
legislature must be taken to have intended compliance of the
requirement at that stage. Mr. Salve for the RBI adopted the
stand that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_39">section 45</a> did not specifically
concede a  right of  objection or  making of  suggestions to
employees and in sub-section (6)(b) mention was made only of
members, depositors  or other  creditors. For the reasons we
have indicated above, this aspect of the contention does not
impress us.
</p><p id="p_14">     It is  the common	case of	 RBI as	 also the transferee
banks that  the records	 of service of each of the employees
had been  scrutinised and  the names  for inclusion  in	 the
scheme were  picked  up	 on  the  basis	 of  materials	like
irresponsible action  in regard	 to sanction  of  loans	 and
accommodations to  customers which  affected  the  financial
stability  of	the  banking   company	concerned.  Such  an
allegation made	 in the	 counter-affidavit in this Court has
been  seriously	  disputed  by	 the   litigating   excluded
employees. It  is their	 positive case	that  there  was  no
foundation in such allegation and dubious loans, if any, had
been sanctioned	 under instructions  of the  superior in the
banking	 company   and,	 therefore,   did  not	involve	 any
delinquency on	the part  of such employees. Since it is the
case of the respondents that exclusion had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">201</span>
been ordered on the basis of an objective assessment and the
very  A	  foundation  of  the  allegation  upon	 which	such
assessment has	been made  is disputed,	 a  situation  arose
where  facts   had  to	 be  ascertained,  and	it  involved
assessment. That has admittedly not been done.
</p><p id="p_15">     These employees  were in  employment under	 contract in
the banking  companies which  were private  banks. They have
been excluded  from service  under the	transferee banks and
the contracts  have now	 been  terminated  as  a  result  of
inclusion of  their names  in  the  schemes.  It  cannot  be
disputed-nay  has  not	been-that  exclusion  has  adversely
affected this  category of  employees and  has brought about
prejudice  and	adverse	 civil	consequences  to  them.	 Two
contentions have  been raised  with reference to this aspect
of the matter:-,,
	  (1) There  has been  infraction of natural justice
and
	  (2) The transferee banks which are 'State' and RBI
     which has monitored the operation being admittedly
     'State' their action in excluding some of the employees
     of the banking company and taking over the services of
     others who are similarly situated is hit by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a>
     of the Constitution. It may be pointed out that
     according to the excluded employees, many facing
     similar allegations and/or in worse situation have been
     taken over.
</p><p id="p_16">     Whether there  is	infraction  of	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_41">Article	 14</a>  of	 the
Constitution on	 the allegation	 advanced would	 depend upon
facts  relating	 to  the  excluded  employees  as  also	 the
allegedly derelict  employees whose services have been taken
over. In  the absence  of an  enquiry in  which the excluded
employees  should   have  been	 given	an   opportunity  of
participation it  has become  difficult for us to probe into
the matter further. F
     Admittedly the excluded employees have neither been put
to notice that their services were not being continued under
the transferee	banks nor had they been given an opportunity
of  being  heard  with	reference  to  the  allegations	 now
levelled against  them. Learned	 counsel  for  RBI  and	 the
transferee banks have taken the stand that the scheme-making
process under  <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_42">section 45</a>  is legislative  in character and,
therefore, outside  the purview	 of  the  ambit	 of  natural
justice under  the protective  umbrella whereof	 the need to
put the excluded employees to notice or enquiry arose. It is
well-settled that  natural justice  will not  be employed in
the exercise  of legislative power and Mr. Salve has rightly
relied upon  a recent  decision of this Court being <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_43">Union of
India H
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">202</span>
&amp; Anr.	v. Cynamide  India Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., [ 1987] 2 SCC 720 in
support of such a position. But is the scheme-making process
legislative? Power  has been conferred on the RBI in certain
situations  to	take  steps  for  applying  to	the  Central
Government for	an order of moratorium and during the period
of  moratorium	 to   propose	either	 reconstruction	  or
amalgamation of	 the  banking  company.	 A  scheme  for	 the
purposes contemplated  has to  be framed  by RBI  and placed
before the  Central Government	for sanction. Power has been
vested in  the	Central	 Government  in	 terms	of  what  is
ordinarily known  as a Henery-8 clause for making orders for
removal of difficulties. <a href="/doc/601446/" id="a_44">Section 45(11)</a> requires that copies
of the	schemes as  also such  orders made  by	the  Central
Government  are	  to  be   placed  before   both  Houses  of
Parliament. We	do not	think  this  requirement  makes	 the
exercise in  regard to	schemes a legislative process. It is
not necessary  to go  to any  other authority  as  the	very
decision relied	 upon by  Mr. Salve  in the case of Cynamide
India Ltd. (supra) lays down the test. In paragraph 7 of the
judgment it has been indicated:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	  "Any attempt	to  draw  a  distinct  line  between
	  legislative and  administrative functions,  it has
	  been said,  is 'difficult in theory and impossible
	  in practice'.	 Though difficult,  it is  necessary
	  that the line must sometimes be drawn as different
	  legal	 rights	 and  consequences  may	 ensue.	 The
	  distinction  between	the  two  has  usually	been
	  expressed as	'one between  the  general  and	 the
	  particular'. 'A  legislative act  is the  creation
	  and promulgation  of a  general  rule	 of  conduct
	  without  reference   to   particular	 cases;	  an
	  administrative act  is the  making and  issue of a
	  specific direction or the application of a general
	  rule to  a particular	 case in accordance with the
	  requirements	of   policy'.  'Legislation  is	 the
	  process of  formulating a  general rule of conduct
	  without reference  to particular cases and usually
	  operating in future; administration is the process
	  of  performing   particular	acts,	of   issuing
	  particular orders  or of  making  decisions  which
	  apply general	 rules to  particular cases'. It has
	  also been  said: "Rule-making is normally directed
	  towards the  formulation of  requirements having a
	  general application  to all  members of  a broadly
	  identifiable class"  while, "an  adjudication,  on
	  the other hand, applies to specific individuals or
	  situations. But  this is only a broad distinction,
	  not necessarily always true."
</blockquote><p id="p_17">Applying these	tests it  is difficult to accept Mr. Salve's
contention that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">203</span>
the framing  of the  scheme  under  <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_45">section  45</a>	 involves  a
legislative process.  There are similar statutory provisions
which require  placing of  material before the two Houses of
Parliament yet	not involving  any legislative activity. The
fact that orders made by the Central Government for removing
difficulties as	 contemplated under sub-clause (10) are also
to be  placed before  the two  Houses of Parliament makes it
abundantly clear  that the  placing of the scheme before the
two Houses  is not  a relevant	test for  making the  scheme
framing process	 legislative. We accordingly hold that there
is no  force in the contention of Mr. Salve that the process
being  legislative,   rules  of	 natural  justice  were	 not
applicable.
</p><p id="p_18">     The alternate  contention on  this score  is  that	 the
scheme-making  process	 being	an   executive	activity  or
alternately  an	 administrative	 matter,  rules	 of  natural
justice have no application. This contention has again to be
rejected. Neither  in "Privy  Council, Natural	Justice	 and
Certiorari" has indicated:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	       "Formerly the presumption had been that there
	  WAS  obligation  to  give  a	hearing	 unless	 the
	  statute itself  indicated such  an obligation; now
	  the  presumption   is	 that	there  is   such  an
	  obligation unless the statute clearly excludes it,
	  notwithstanding  the	 vesting  of   a  power,  in
	  subjective terms,  in a  minister  responsible  to
	  Parliament."

	  ministerial, or  they may  embody  some  quasi  or

	  "administrative", or	"quasi-judicial" but whether

it meant  giving K  an opportunity of satisfying the officer

SCR 457	 a  Constitution  Bench	 quoted	 with  approval	 the
observations of	 Lord  Parker  in  Re:	(H)  K	(an  infant)
(supra). Hegde, J. speaking for the Court stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	       "Very  soon   thereafter	 a  third  rule	 was
	  envisaged  and   that	  is   that   quasi-judicial
	  enquiries must be held in good faith, without bias
	  and not  arbitrarily or  unreasonablly. But in the
	  course of years many more subsidiary rules came to
	  be added  to the  rules of  natural justice.	Till
	  very recently	 it was	 the opinion  of the  courts
	  that unless  the authority  concerned was required
	  by the  law  under  which  it	 functioned  to	 act
	  judicially there  was no  room for the application
	  of the  rules of  natural justice. The validity of
	  that limitation  is now questioned. If the purpose
	  of the  rules of  natural justice  is	 to  prevent
	  miscarriage of  justice one fails to see why those
	  rules	  should    be	  made	  inapplicable	  to
	  administrative enquiries.  Often times  it is	 not
	  easy	 to    draw   the   line   that	  demarcates
	  administrative   enquiries   from   quasi-judicial
	  enquiries.   Enquiries   which   were	  considered
	  administrative  at   one  time   are	 now   being
	  considered   as   quasi-judicial   in	  character.
	  Arriving at  a just  decision is  the aim  of both
	  quasi-judicial enquiries as well as administrative
	  enquiries. An unjust decision in an administrative
	  enquiry may  have more  far reaching effect than a
	  decision in a quasi-judicial enquiry."

Mills v.  Union of  India</a>, [1981]  2 SCR  533 a	 three-Judge
Bench of this Court examined this aspect of natural justice.
Sarkaria, J. who spoke for the Court, stated:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	  "During the last two decades, the concept of
	  natural justice has made great strides in the
	  realm of administrative law. Before the epoch-
	  making decision of the House of Lords in Ridge v.
	  Baldwin, it was generally thought that the rules
	  of natural justice apply only to judicial or
	  quasi-judicial proceedings; and for the purpose,
	  whenever a breach of the rule of natural justice
	  was alleged, Courts in England used to ascertain
	  whether the impugned action was taken by the
	  statutory authority or tribunal in the exercise of
	  its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">206</span>
	  administrative or quasi-judicial power. In India
	  also, this was the position before the decision of
	  this Court in Dr. Bina Pani Dei's case (supra);
	  wherein it was held that even an administrative
	  order or decision in matters involving civil
	  consequences, has to be made consistently with the
	  rules of natural justice. This supposed
	  distinction between quasi-judicial and
	  administrative decisions, which was perceptibly
	  mitigated in Bina Pani Dei's case (supra) was
	  further rubbed out to a vanishing point in A.K.
	  Kraipak's case (supra) .........................
	  ".
</blockquote><p id="p_27">On the	basis of these authorities it must be held that even
when a	State agency acts administratively, rules of natural
justice would  apply. As  stated, natural  justice generally
requires that  persons liable  to be  directly	affected  by
proposed administrative	 acts, decisions  or proceedings  be
given adequate	notice of  what is proposed so that they may
be in  a position  (a) to  make representations on their own
behalf; (b)  or to appear at a hearing or-enquiry (if one is
held); and  (c) effectively to prepare their own case and to
answer the case (if any) they have to meet.
</p><p id="p_28">     Natural justice has various facets and acting fairly is
one of them. RBI which monitored the three amalgamations was
required to  act fairly	 in  the  facts	 of  the  case.	 The
situation necessitated	a participatory enquiry in regard to
the excluded  employees. Since	the decision to exclude them
from service  under the	 transferee banks is grounded upon a
set of	facts the  correctness	whereof	 they  deny,  if  an
opportunity to	know the  allegations and  to have their say
had been  afforded, they  could have  no grievance  on	this
score. The  action deprives  them of  their  livelihood	 and
brings adverse civil consequences and could obviously not be
taken on the ipse dixit of RBI officers without verification
of facts. It is quite possible that a manoeuvring officer of
the  banking   company	adversely   disposed  of  towards  a
particular employee of such bank could make a report against
such employee  and have	 him excluded  from further  service
under the  transferee bank.  The possibility of exclusion on
the basis of some mistake such as to identity cannot also be
ruled out.  There is  all the more apprehension of this type
is the	process has  to be  completed quickly and very often
the records  of a  large number	 of  employees	have  to  be
scrutinised. We	 are of	 the  view  that  rules	 of  natural
justice apply  to administrative  action and  in the instant
cases the  decision to	exclude a  section of  the employees
without complying  with requirements  of natural justice was
bad.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">207</span>
<p id="p_29">     It has  been contended  on behalf	of respondents	that
moratorium could  be for  a total  period of  six months and
that was  the time  allowed for	 the entire  operation to be
conducted.  In	 view  of   the	 time  frame,  by  necessary
implication it	must  follow  that  application	 of  natural
justice compliance  of which  would involve a time-consuming
process was  ruled out.	 We do	not think  that there is any
merit in  this contention  either. As  a fact, in respect of
the three  banks the  total number  of excluded employees is
around	125.   It  is	the  common  case  of  parties	that
proceedings were  pending against  some of  them. It  may be
that in	 view of the time frame a detailed enquiry involving
communication of  allegations, show  cause,  opportunity  to
lead evidence  in support  of the allegations and in defence
of the	stand of  the employees may not be possible. Keeping
the legislative	 scheme in  view perhaps  a simpler enquiry,
for instance,  communication  of  the  allegation  and	even
receiving an  explanation and  in cases where the allegation
was serious  or there  was a  total denial  though there was
firm basis  for the  allegation a  single  personal  hearing
could be  afforded. In this case we are not really concerned
with the  manner or  extent of	hearing as there has been no
hearing at  all. It must, therefore, be held that the action
of excluding  these employees  in the  manner done cannot be
supported.
</p><p id="p_30">     Fair play	is a  part of  the public  policy and  is  a
guarantee for  justice to citizens. In our system of Rule of
Law every  social agency conferred with power is required to
act fairly  so that  social action  would be  just and there
would be  furtherance of  the well-being  of  citizens.	 The
rules of  natural justice  have developed with the growth of
civilisation and  the content thereof is often considered as
a proper  measure of  the level	 of civilisation and Rule of
Law prevailing in the community. Man within the social frame
has struggled  for centuries to bring into the community the
concept of fairness and it has taken scores of years for the
rules of  natural justice  to conceptually  enter  into	 the
field of  social activities. We do not think in the facts of
the case  there is  any justification  to hold that rules of
natural justice have been ousted by necessary implication on
account of  the time  frame. On the other hand we are of the
view that  the time limited by statute provides scope for an
opportunity  to	  be  extended	 to  the  intended  excluded
employees before  the scheme  is finalised so that a hearing
commensurate to	 the situation	is afforded before a section
of the employees is thrown out of employment.
</p><p id="p_31">     We may  now point	out that the learned Single Judge of
the Kerala  High  Court	 had  proposed	a  post-amalgamation
hearing to  meet the  situation but that has been vacated by
the Division Bench. For the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">208</span>
reasons we  have indicated,  there is  no  justification  to
think of  a post-decisional  heading. On  the other hand the
normal rule should apply. It was also contended on behalf of
the  respondents  that	the  excluded  employees  could	 now
represent and their cases could be examined. We do not think
that would  meet the ends of justice. They have already been
thrown	out  of	 employment  and  having  been	deprived  of
livelihood they	 must be  facing serious difficulties. There
is no justification to throw them out of employment and then
given  them   an  opportunity  of  representation  when	 the
requirement  is	  that	they  should  have  the	 opportunity
referred to  above as a condition precedent to action. It is
common experience that once a decision has been taken, there
is a  tendency to  uphold it  and a  representation may	 not
really yield any fruitful purpose.
</p><p id="p_32">     'Amalgamation' as such saved under <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_50">Article 31A(1)(c)</a> of
the  Constitution   is	not  under  challenge  here.  Strong
reliance, however, had been placed on the provisions of sub-
section (7A)  of <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_51">section 45</a> of the Act. The relevant part of
it is as requoted here for convenience:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">	       "The  sanction	accorded  by   the   Central
	  Government  under  sub-section  (7)  ..  shall  be
	  conclusive evidence  that all	 the requirements of
	  this section relating to ............ amalgamation
	  have been complied-with
     This provision  is indeed one for purposes of evidence.
</blockquote><p id="p_33"><a href="/doc/1536600/" id="a_52">In Smt. Somavanti &amp; ors. v. State of Punjab &amp; Ors</a>., [19631 2
SCR 774	 this Court  pointed out  that	there  was  no	real
difference  between   'conclusive  proof'  provided  for  in
<a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_53">section 4</a>  of the  Evidence Act and 'conclusive evidence' as
appearing in  sub-section (7A).	 This provision does not bar
the raising  of a dispute of the nature received here. As we
have  already	pointed	 out,	amalgamation  is  not  under
challenge. Parties  are disputing as to what exactly are the
requirements of	 the procedure	laid down  under the Act and
the  position  that  no	 opportunity  was  afforded  to	 the
excluded employees is not in dispute. To a situation as here
protection of  the umbrella  of conclusive  evidence is	 not
attached so  as to  bar the  question from  being  examined.
There is, therefore, nothing in sub-section (7A) to preclude
examination of the question canvassed here
     The writ petitions and the appeals must succeed. We set
aside  the  impugned  judgments	 of  the  Single  Judge	 and
Division Bench of the Kerala High Court and direct that each
of the three transferee banks
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">209</span>
should take  over the  excluded employees  on the same terms
and conditions	of employment  under the  respective banking
companies  prior   to  moratorium.  The	 employee  would  be
entitled to  the benefit  of continuity	 of service  for all
purposes including  salary and	perks throughout the period.
We leave it open to the transferee banks to take such action
as  they   consider  proper   against  these   employees  in
accordance with law. Some of the excluded employees have not
come to	 Court. There  is no  justification to penalise them
for not	 having litigated. They too shall be entitled to the
same benefits  as the petitioners. Ordinarily the successful
parties should	have been  entitled to	costs but in view of
the fact  that they  are going back to employment, we do not
propose to  make orders of costs against their employers. We
hope and  trust that  the transferee banks would look at the
matter with  an open mind and would keep themselves alive to
the human problem involved in it.
