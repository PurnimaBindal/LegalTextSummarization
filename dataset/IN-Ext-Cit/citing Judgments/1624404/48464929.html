            (A­2),   Gurkaran   Singh   (A­3)   and   Ishleen   Kaur(A­6),   have   been 

            convicted, in addition, for the offences punishable under  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_10">sections  420</a> 

            and  <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_11">471</a>   IPC.      Convicts,   namely,  Virender   Kumar   Sayal   (A­4)  and

            offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_12">section 420</a> IPC.  



3.          It has been strongly contended  on behalf of the State by the Ld. Sr. PP 

            for the CBI   that this is a  corruption case,  in which, the convicts have 

            been convicted, as  they were operating as an organised racket and have 

            caused illegal   huge pecuniary loss to the  State Bank of Bikaner and 

            Jaipur,  Govt. of India Undertaking.     That they have cheated the said 

            bank   and caused wrongful loss to the tune of  Rs. 40.83 lakhs and Rs.

                                                                        4
                                                                                                                 CBI Case No.  38/11

            12,54,202.79,  when   loan   was   fraudulently   sanctioned.     They   have, 

            therefore, caused loss to the public exchequer of the said amount.  It has 

            further   been   stated   that   the   amount,   to   the   extent   to   which   the 

            Government   has   been   cheated,   was   not   a   small   amount   as   the   case 

            pertains to the period prior to the year 2006, when it was a huge and fat 

            amount.

                

4.          The   State   has   further   contended   that   the   maximum     prescribed 

            substantive punishment with fine be handed over to all the convicts, so 

            that enough and clear  message goes to one and all and especially to the 

            potential offenders, who are in the waiting to commit such like   frauds 

            so   that   the   punishment   act   as   a   deterrence   and   the   intent     of   the 

            legislature is fulfilled. 



5.          Convict, Sri Kant Chawla (A­1), has prayed that a lenient view be taken 

            on the ground that  there is no allegation against him that he has been 

            benefited even with single penny.   That he has an old and ailing  mother 

            of 80 years of age.     That he is the only male member in the family to 

            support his wife and  his son, who is bed ridden.   That he, himself, has 

            also been afflicted with health problems.   That he has faced long trial.

                                                                                                                 CBI Case No.  38/11




6.          Convicts, namely,  Bhupinder Pal Singh Bakshi (A­2), Gurkaran Singh 

            (A­3) and Ishleen  Kaur (A­6), have submitted that they have already 

            deposited the outstanding amount and they have not been previously 

            convicted in any other case and prayed for probation.   That benefit of 

            <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_13">section 4</a> of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, be given to them and 

            that <a href="/doc/1301218/" id="a_14">Section 18</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not applicable in 

            their case.   That a lenient view may be taken. 



7.          Convict, Virender Kumar Syal, too prayed for  a lenient view stating that 

            he   has   a   marriageable   daughter   of   21   years   of   age   and   two   other 

            children.  That he is ready to deposit the outstanding amount. That he 

            has not been previously convicted in any other case.  



8.          Convict Sanjay Kumar Rathi prayed that he is 46 years of age and is a 

            practicing lawyer for the last 21 years and is a responsible member of 

            Bar.  That he is sole earning member  of the family  and that  he has a 

            school going son and a daughter of  marriageable age, who is pursuing 

            B. Sc. That no wrongful gain has been made by him and that he is not a 

            previous convict.

                                                                        6
                                                                                                                 CBI Case No.  38/11




9.          The   above  said  convicts  have,  thus,  prayed  for  taking  a  lenient  view. 

            They have further prayed  for release on probation.  



10.         The   contentions,   raised   by   the   the   convicts,   have   met   stiff   and   very 

            strong opposition on behalf of the State.  It has been urged that convict, 

            Sri   Kant   Chawla,   the   then   public   servant,   has   been   convicted,   in   as 

            many   as  three  different   cases   as   he   had   illegally   and   dishonestly 

            sanctioned   loans/   Cash   Credit   Limits   on   the   basis   of   false   and 

            fraudulent documents in the year 2006, when it was quite a big sum.   It 

            has,  further,  been   stated  on  behalf of  the  State  that    being  a public 

            servant at the relevant time, convict Sri Kant Chawla  acted  corruptly 

            with full vigour,   in sanction of loan and, then in granting over­draft 

            withdrawal beyond his discretion, one after the other.   It has, therefore, 

            been   urged     that   this   convict     is   a   habitual     offender     and   was   the 

            Kingpin in defrauding the bank and deserves maximum punishment. 



11.         Regarding   the   convicts,   Bhupinder   Pal   Singh   Bakshi,   Gurkaran   Singh 

            and   Ishleen   Kaur,   it   is   stated   that   they   were   the   beneficiary   of   the 

            fraudulent loan amount.   That they   pocketed the loan money, in this 

CBI vs Sri Kant Chawla  &amp; Ors                                                                                                 Page 6 of  97 
                                                                        7
                                                                                                                 CBI Case No.  38/11

            case,   to   which     they   were   not   legally   entitled   to.    They     successfully 

            cheated  the  public  sector  bank  i.e.  State  Bank  of  Bikaner  and  Jaipur, 

            Nagal Raya Branch, alongwith other convicts.  That they are not entitled 

            to any mercy or compassion. 



12.         Similarly, it is stated that convict Sanjay Kumar Rathi is fully involved in 

            the   conspiracy   and   that   in   pursuance   to   the   systematic   and   well­

            planned conspiracy, he fabricated  report and acted in connivance with 

            other convicts in this case to cheat the bank.



13.         It is further urged on behalf of the State that most of the pleas taken by 

            the convicts   are routine and stock pleas and in any case, in the case 

            under   the   <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_15">Prevention   of   Corruption   Act</a>,     these   pleas   taken     are   not 

            considered as  mitigating circumstances.  It has, therefore,  been  prayed 

            that exemplary punishment  be awarded to the convicts  herein.

15.         On behalf of the convicts, following case law have been cited:

            (i) Isher Das Vs. State of Punjab , AIR, 1972 Supreme Court 1295



16.         At the very outset, it is observed that there is no quarrel over the settled 

            propositions of law discussed in the aforesaid case law,   cited by the 

            parties. 



17.         The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case law, reported as Dr. Subramanyam 
            Swami  Vs. Dr. Manmohan Singh, 2012, AIR(SC) page 1185, has observed 
            that ­:
                                   "The   magnitude   of   corruption   in   our   public   life   is  
                       incompatible with the concept of socialistic secular democratic  
                       public.   The duty of the Court is that any anti corruption law  
                       has to be interpreted and worked out in such a fashion as to  
                       strengthen to fight against corruption."

18.         It has further been observed in the same case that  "In a situation where 

            two constructions are eminently reasonable, the Court has to accept the 

            one   that   seeks   to   eredicate     corruption     to   the   one   which   seeks   to  

            perpetuate it."

19.                    It   has   been   held   in   case   reported   as  Narendra     Champak   Lal 

            Trivedi  Vs. State of Gujrat, 2012 (7) SCC page 80 that­:                                                 "Corruption 

            at any level does not deserve either  sympathy or leniency."  



20.         The  Hon'ble  Apex  Court  in  the   case  of  State   of  Rajasthan  Vs. Vinod 

            Kumar, decided on, 18th May, 2012 (Criminal Appeal No. 1887) reiterated 

            the law laid down in State of  J&amp;K  Vs.  Vinay Nanda, AIR 2001 SC P 611, 

            and observed  that superannuation of the convict  and the pendency  of  

            criminal   trial   for over a period of time cannot   be treated   a special 

            reason to reduce  the sentence.   



21.         In the same appeal quoting 'M B Joshi Vs. State   of Maharashtra, AIR 

            2001 SC 147' the Hon'ble  Apex  Court observed that­:

                        "It is the defect  of the system that longevity  of the cases tried  
                        under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_16">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> is too lengthy.  If that is  
                        regarded  as sufficient  for reducing  the sentence  mandated by  
                        the Parliament legislative exercise  would stand defeated."

22.        It was observed by the Hon'ble High Court in the cases reported as   Jai 

           Bhagwan    Vs.   State   (NCT   of   Delhi),    2008   150   DLT   46   (Delhi)   and 

           Ravinder Kumar Arora Vs. CBI  Manu/DE/8816/2007 (Delhi) ,  that ­: 

                       "It   is   a   normal   thing   that   'trial'   of   the   person   is  
                       considered   a period of 'agony' undergone by him.  But  
                       we   tend   to   forget   the   agony   of   the   society   and   the  
                       complainant   who   dared     lodge   the   complaint.   The  
                       entire   purpose   of   the   legislature   of   sentencing   the 
                       offenders   stands defeated   and that is the one reason  
                       that wages of corruption are considered more attractive  
                       in this country.  The person caught is not always  a first­
                       timer   corrupt.       He   may   have   been   indulging     into 
                       corrupt activities / practices for a long number  of years.  
                       It is to his advantage that the trial is prolonged.     He  
                       spends a fraction of amount, earned by corrupt practices 
                       on litigation and professionals  to see that ultimately  he 
                       makes   Criminal   Justice System   a laughing stock.     In 
                       this process, the entire  legislative purpose of punishing 
                       a corrupt stands defeated. 


23.        It was further observed by the Hon'ble Court in the aforesaid case  that

24.        It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case reported as 

           State of J &amp; K  Vs. Vinay Nanda, AIR 2001 SC  P 611,  that ­:

                       "Corruption     at   any   level,   by   any   person,   of   any

                       by   the   Judicial   Courts,   when   proved.     No   leniency   is

                       differently than the general penal offences.  The convicts 
                       of the offences under the Act are to be dealt with heavy 
                       hand  and deterrant  rod.   No  populous  or sympathetic  
                       approach  is needed in such cases."

                       corruption.   Large scale  corruption retards  the nation 
                       building activities and everyone has to suffer   on that  
                       count."
                        
26.                    It was observed by the Hon'ble High Court in the case reported as

                       "Infliction of a lenient sentence will defeat the purpose  
                       of the P. C. Act."

28.                    The convicts, therefore,  cannot be enlarged on probation in this 
            case relating  to serious  offences.

                       not only contagious  but if  not controlled  spreads like a  
                       fire in a jungle.    Its virus is compared with HIV  leading 
                       to   AIDS   being   incurable.     The   socio­political   system  
                       exposed to such  a dreaded   communicable   disease is  
                       likely to crumble   under its own weight.   Corruption is  
                       opposed to democracy  and social order, being  not only  
                       anti people, but aimed and targeted against them.   It 
                       affects the economy and destroys  the cultural heritage."

33.        In the case of  Siddarama and Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka, 2006 IV AD 

           (Cri.) (SC) 78, it was  held that­: 

                       "undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would  
                       do more harm to the justice system to undermine the  
                       public confidence in the efficacy of law and society can  
                       no   longer   endure   under   such   serious   threats.   It   is,  
                       therefore,   the   duty   of   every   court   to   award   proper 
                       sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and  
                       the manner in which it was executed or committed etc."


34.        It was further held in the case law reported as  <a href="/doc/175789958/" id="a_21">Kishan Dayal vs. State</a>, 

           1958 Raj LW 596 that­:

                        " A corrupt official   is a menace to the society and far  
                        from   helping   in   the   proper   functioning   of   the 
                        Government and implementing of the laws, brings the  
                        Government and the society at large into disrepute. It is 
                        through the agency of the public servants that the policy  
                        of   the   Legislature   as   well   as   of   the   Government   is  
                        implemented.   It   is   through   the   public   servants   that  
                        crimes are detected and offenders are brought to book. It  
                        is   through   strictly   honest   and   incorruptible   public 
                        servants that the welfare of the society can be ensured. If 
                        such public servants are open to corruption and coerce  
                        the   public   into   paying   them   illegal   gratification,   the  

CBI vs Sri Kant Chawla  &amp; Ors                                                                                                 Page 15 of  97

                        whole structure of  the society would be upset and the

                        howsoever, beneficial it may be, would gravely suffer. A  
                        public servant, therefore, once he is found to be guilty of 
                        accepting or obtaining illegal gratification, deserves no 
                        soft corner or indulgence from the Courts of Law."



35.        It was held in the case reported as <a href="/doc/922592/" id="a_22">Madhukar Bhaskarrao Joshi vs. State 

           of Maharashtra</a>, 2001 Cr. LJ 175(SC):  that­:

                         "When corruption was sought to be eliminated from the 
                         polity all possible stringent measures are to be adopted 
                         within   the   bounds   of   law.   One   such   measure   is   to  
                         provide condign punishment. Parliament measured the 
                         parameters   for such condign punishment and in that  
                         process   wanted   to   fix   a   minimum   sentence   of  
                         imprisonment   for   giving   deterrent   impact   on   other  
                         public  servants  who are prone   to corrupt deals. That 
                         was precisely the reason why the sentence  was fixed as  
                         seven years and directed  that even if the said period of 
                         imprisonment need not be given, the sentence shall not 
                         be   less   than   the   imprisonment   for   one   year.   Such   a  
                         legislative insistence  is reflection of Parliament's resolve  
                         to meet corruption cases with very strong hand to give 
                         signals   of   deterrence   as   the   most   pivotal   feature   of  
                         sentencing of corrupt public servants. All public servants

                         have to face very serious consequences.   If on the other  
                         hand any public servant  is given the impression that if  
                         he succeeds in protracting the proceedings that  would 
                         help him to have the advantage of getting a very light  
                         sentence even if the case ends in conviction, its fallout  
                         would   afford   incentive   to   public   servants   who   were 
                         susceptible to  corruption  to  indulge  in  such   nefarious  
                         practices   with   immunity.   Increasing   the   fine   after  
                         reducing   the   imprisonment   to   a   nominal   period   can  
                         also defeat  the purpose as  the corrupt  public  servants  
                         could     easily   raise  the   fine   amount   through   the   same 
                         means."

           also examined the asserted mitigating and aggravating circumstances, 

           pointed   out     by   the   parties.   I   am   of   the   considered   opinion   that 

           considering all the aspects of the matter, the following sentence shall be

           (2001) 7 SCC 596  that "the rationale of conspiracy is that the required  

           objective manifestation of disposition to criminality is provided by the 

           act of agreement. Conspiracy is a clandestine activity. Persons generally  

           do not form illegal covenants openly. In the interest of security, a person  

           may carry out his part of a conspiracy without even being informed of the 

           identity of his co­conspirators. An agreement of this kind can rarely be  

           shown by direct proof, it must be inferred from circumstantial evidence of  

           what lies in their minds".

<p id="p_142">

           "Regarding admissibility of evidence, loosened standards prevail  
           in  a  conspiracy  trial. Contrary  to the  usual   rule,  in conspiracy  
           prosecutions,   any   declaration   by   one   conspirator,   made   in  
           furtherance of a conspiracy and during its pendency, is admissible  
           against each co­conspirator. Despite the unreliability of hearsay  
           evidence,   it   is   admissible   in   conspiracy   prosecutions.   Thus 
           conspirators   are   liable   on   agency   theory   for   statements   of   co­
           conspirators,   just   as   they   are   for   the   overt   acts   and   crimes

           accused persons, without   any written requisition of the bank and was 

           later on used by accused (A­1), who sanctioned the loan. Had there been

           Ex.PW2/O that accused (A­5) has stated that the name of the mortgagor

           advocate giving merely the search report, he ought to have no occasion 

           to see Municipal/revenue record. There is no whisper in the report that 

           he actually visited any such authority or even was asked by the bank to 

           do   so.   It   is,   therefore,  apparent   that   this   was   recorded   falsely   at   the  

           instance of other co accused persons, especially, when the mortgagor, in
