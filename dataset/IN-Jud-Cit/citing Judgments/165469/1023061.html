                            JUDGMENT

<p id="p_1">      The defendant in a suit for perpetual injunction filed under

<a href="/doc/114856/" id="a_1">Sections 135</a> and <a href="/doc/853023/" id="a_2">136</a> of the Trade Marks Act , being aggrieved

by the judgment and decree passed against them, has preferred

this appeal. The plaintiff in the suit is the respondent and the

parties are referred to hereinafter as they were before the trial

court.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   The case of the plaintiff, as averred in the plaint in

brief, is that they are a company incorporated in      Delaware,

U.S.A. and is one of the world's largest and leading hoteliers,

having their outlets all over the world including the former

"RENAISSANCE"       Goa    Resort, Goa and the "RENAISSANCE"

Mumbai Hotel and Convention Centre at Mumbai.        The plaintiff

has   been    continuously    using   the   Mark "RENAISSANCE"

throughout the world from 1981 and in India from 1990. The

plaintiff operates or franchises more than 130 hotels all over the

world and is using the mark "RENAISSANCE" to represent its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">RFA.No.235/2008                  2</span>

Hotels. The plaintiff is expending crores of rupees every year for

advertisement and promotion of its business and thereby the

mark "RENAISSANCE" has become famous and associated with

the plaintiff's well known "RENAISSANCE" Hotel brand.         The

plaintiff also operated the domain name www.renaissancehotels.

com.      in connection with providing information about the

"RENAISSANCE" hotel chain and its hotel services.      As a result

the public associates the mark "RENAISSANCE" when used in a

domain name with the plaintiff's high quality services. The high

quality services rendered by the plaintiff to its customers has

earned a reputation and developed a goodwill associated with

the mark "RENAISSANCE" throughout the world. In India the

plaintiff has operated two Hotels, one at Goa and one at Mumbai.

The Goa "RENAISSANCE" hotel was founded in 1990 and changed

its name to       RAMADA CARAVALE in 2003.          The Mumbai

"RENAISSANCE" hotel has operated continuously since 2001.

Both    Hotels   of  the   plaintiff are   popularly  known    as

"RENAISSANCE" Hotels.       In these two hotels, the plaintiff has

rendered extremely high standards of service and thereby has

earned reputation and goodwill in the hospitality industry.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RFA.No.235/2008                    3</span>

Though the plaintiff arranged a change of the name of the Goa

Renaissance Hotel in 2003 since it has been continuously and

extensively rendering hospitality services from its hotel in

Mumbai since 2001, it can be seen that in India from 1990, the

mark "RENAISSANCE" is associated with the hotels operated by

the plaintiff. The plaintiff also applied for registration of the trade

name "RENAISSANCE" in India by an application made in 1993

which was pending with the Registry at the time of filing the suit.

Subsequently the Registry has granted registration in favour of

the plaintiff. The plaintiff also applied for registration of the trade

name "RENAISSANCE" in India by an application made in 1993

which was pending with the Registry at the time of filing the suit.

Subsequently the Registry has granted registration in favour of

the plaintiff. The plaintiff further alleged that they are a member

of Marriot Rewards Program. The Marriot Rewards is the world's

largest multi brand frequent guest programme and offers its

members the opportunity to earn/redeem points at nine distinct

holding brands, including the plaintiff's hotels. For the past five

years, the Marriot Reward has been named the " Best Hotel

Reward Program in the world" by Business Traveller's Magazine.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RFA.No.235/2008                   4</span>

Currently there are 27616/- Marriot Rewards members residing

in India.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. It is further averred that the defendants are operating a

hotel in Cochin under the Trading Name "THE         "RENAISSANCE

COCHIN".     The plaintiff came to know of this when one of its

customers through an e-mail reported that he was misled to

believe that the Defendant Hotel was part of the plaintiff's hotel

chain and had stayed there.     The plaintiff issued a notice dated

3/12/2001 calling upon the defendant to desist from using the

mark "RENAISSANCE".        The defendant through a reply dated

28/12/2001 issued through its Advocates expressed                its

willingness to change the name, but sought permission to use

the expression "formerly the "RENAISSANCE" Cochin for two

years. Subsequently in November 2002 the plaintiff received a

letter from another lawyer said to be representing the defendant

informing that     the earlier letter was not authorized by the

defendant.    The plaintiff therefore, after issuing another notice,

filed suit for prohibitory injunction against passing off and in

respect of      the dispute relating to the use of the word

"RENAISSANCE". The defendant filed written statement raising

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RFA.No.235/2008                  5</span>

various contentions.   Pleadings have been narrated correctly by

the learned Subordinate Judge and I do not propose to narrate

them over again. In essence the contention of the defendant is

that they have      renamed     its hotel (previously by     name

Polakulath Tourist Home)        as "RENAISSANCE" Cochin and

submitted application for registration of the trade name

"RENAISSANCE" in 1997.        According to the defendant, the

plaintiff cannot claim exclusivity for the word "RENAISSANCE"

and since the plaintiff had changed the name of the Goa Hotel

from Renaissance to Ramada it would show that the name had no

significance to the business of the plaintiff.       The learned

subordinate Judge formulated the following issues for trial ;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   1. Whether the plaintiff has acquired

              right  to  exclusive   use   of  the  trade

              name/mark "RENAISSANCE" ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   2. Whether the defendant has acquired

              right  to  exclusive   use   of  the  trade

              name/mark Renaissance Cochin ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   3. Whether the user of the trade

              name/mark Renaissance Cochin by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RFA.No.235/2008                  6</span>

             Defendant has      infringed the right if any

             acquired by the plaintiff ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                   4. Whether the plaintiff has got a

             cause of action to sue ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   5. Is the Plaintiff entitled to a decree

             of injunction as prayed for ?
</blockquote>
                   6. Reliefs and Costs ?<p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">      4. At trial the evidence consisted of the oral testimony of

PW1, Director of Human Resources of the plaintiff Company in

India and that of DW-1 Managing Director of the defendant

company.    The documentary evidence consisted of Exts.A1 to

A101 and B1 to B12. The documents have been              described

correctly  in the appendix to the impugned judgment.         Even

though no specific contention had been raised in the suit that the

suit is not maintainable in law for the reason that the

authorisation issued to the signatory of the plaint was not

produced and only some passing questions were asked to PW1

with respect to this and the trial court observed that no such

contention was raised by the defendant in its written statement,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">RFA.No.235/2008                  7</span>

the trial court considered the argument and found that the suit is

maintainable and that in any event the non production of the

authorization is only a curable defect.   It would appear from the

judgment that the court recast the issues as follows;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     1). Whether the suit is maintainable?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     2). Is the defendant res trainable as prayed for ?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     3. Reliefs and costs.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">With respect to the merits of the matter, the Trial court on an

assessment of the evidence on record found that the plaintiff had

started the Goa Hotel in 1993 and the Mumbai Hotel in 2001 and

the various certificates of registration and     Travel Directories

overwhelmingly suggest the presence of the plaintiff in the

hospitality industry all over the world from 1984 onwards and in

India from 1993.     The court further held that at the same time

the defendant started its hotel only in 1998 and since the name

of the hotel of the defendant      is similar to the name of the

plaintiff's hotel it is obvious that the plaintiff is entitled to

maintain the passing off action.     The trial court also did not

accept that the initial reply given by a lawyer on behalf of the

defendant was not authorized and held that the said reply

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">RFA.No.235/2008                  8</span>

provides a set back to the defendant.     The trial court therefore

became pleased to restrain the defendant from passing off its

hotel by using the name "RENAISSANCE" and also from using the

domain name www.renaissancecochin.com.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     5. Raising grounds A to F in the memorandum of appeal, it

is prayed that the judgment and decree be set aside and the suit

be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     6.   I have heard the submissions of        Sri.Sathish Ninan

learned counsel for the appellant and also those of Sri. Joseph

Markose, learned Senior counsel for the respondent. Sri.Sathish

Ninan would place reliance on a number of judicial precedents in

support of the various propositions    argued by him.    He argued

that the suit is not maintainable in law. He conceded that the

written statement does not project any contention regarding the

maintainability of the suit due to the reason that the signatory to

the plaint is not competent to represent the plaintiff company or

to sign and verify pleadings on behalf of the plaintiff company.

But since the institutional maintainability of the suit is being

disputed, according to him it is open to the defendant to raise the

contention. He submitted that the suit is filed by a company and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">RFA.No.235/2008                  9</span>

the plaint is said to have been signed by the power of attorney

of the company.         The Signatory is not an officer of the

company, but a mere power of attorney holder. The Power of

attorney was not produced. After affixing the signature to the

plaint, the signatory is not heard of.      But for the power of

attorney, the signatory is incompetent to sign the plaint on behalf

of the company since he is not a Director or an officer of the

Company. Therefore, the production of the power of attorney

was mandatory for the institution of the suit.   He relied on the

judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1555740/" id="a_3">United Bank of India v.

Naresh Kumar and others</a> (AIR 1997 SC 3) in support of the

argument that since the       signatory is not an officer of the

company, he will become competent to sign the plaint on behalf

of the company only if there is authorization by the Board of

Directors or there is a power of attorney in his favour.    Strong

objection was raised by him in respect of the power of attorney

which was filed by the plaintiff before this court along with a

petition under Rule 41 of Order 27 CPC.      He argued that the

power of attorney is not properly stamped. And since the non

production of the power of attorney along with the suit is       a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">RFA.No.235/2008                  10</span>

matter which goes to be very institution of the suit, the suit is to

be held as not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      7. Coming to the issue as to whether the defendant is liable

to be restrained by a decree of injunction from using its trade

mark, Sri.Sathish Ninan submitted that the trade mark of the

plaintiff  is just  "Renaissance"   and that of the defendant is

"The Renaissance Cochin" (also) Crown of an ancient Soldier.

Sri.Satish Ninan submitted that decisions on the        subject will

show that in actions for passing off, mainly four issues arise for

consideration.    (a) The first issue, according to the learned

counsel, is the "Time Factor" i.e.      whose business (whether

plaintiff's or defendant's) commenced prior in point of time. (b)

Incidentally can/whether prior sales in small quantities establish

priority.   The second issue is "Reputation"; whether the goodwill

has been established in the country.           The third issue is

"Deception"; actual or possible. The forth issue is "Damages"'

actual or likelihood of.      According to Sri.Satish Ninan, the

plaintiff in order to secure a decree of prohibitory injunction, will

have to prove that the plaintiff's business commenced prior in

point of time, that goodwill/reputation has been established by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">RFA.No.235/2008                   11</span>

the plaintiff in the country, that the mark used by the defendant

is    deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff and that

consequently there has been actual deception or possibility of

deception and finally that consequent to the use of the mark by

the defendant the plaintiff has sustained damages. It is only if all

the above mentioned elements are proved by the plaintiff, the

plaintiff will be entitled to get a decree of injunction. According

to him, the issue of "Time Factor" and "Reputation" can be

considered together in the light of the pleadings raised by the

parties and the evidence adduced by        them in this case.   He

further submitted that in paragraphs 3 and 5, it is stated that the

plaintiff has earned reputation and goodwill in India since 1993.

However, it is not stated as to which was the location in which

the plaintiff set up the Hotel. In paragraph 5 of the plaint the

amounts expended for advertisement and promotion of the

business of the plaintiff has been referred. It only relates to the

period from 2001. Coming to the evidence, the plaintiff produced

A1 to A101 documents.          Most of them were mere Photostat

copies and inadmissible in evidence. Most of the advertisements

produced by the         plaintiff are in Foreign Newspapers and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">RFA.No.235/2008                  12</span>

Magazines. Advertisements produced as having been published

in India is only since 2003. The chief examination of PW1 para 7

refers to the worldwide turn over of the plaintiff and does not

give specifics regarding the turn over in India.         In chief

examination of PW1, at para 10, the expenses incurred in India

relates only to the period 2001. Regarding the time factor and

reputation, relevant portion of the evidence of PW1 is up to para

12 of the chief examination. There is nothing to indicate that

prior to the year 2001 anything was practically done in India by

the plaintiff to acquire goodwill and Reputation.     Though the

plaintiff would claim that it had a hotel at Goa since 1990 the

cross examination of PW1 at pages 16, 18,19 and 25 casts

doubts on the same. Going by the evidence of the defendant as

DW1 read with Exts.B2, B3, B4, B7, B8 and B11 it is in evidence

that the defendant had been doing business and using the mark

ever since the year 1996.     Sri.Satish Ninan further submitted

that even assuming that the plaintiff had a Hotel at Goa in the

year 1990, the mere small business earlier in point of time is not

sufficient to constitute priority.   There has   to be sufficient

evidence to show that though it was a prior small scale business

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">RFA.No.235/2008                   13</span>

the plaintiff ahd established goodwill and reputation during that

period. In the instant case there is no evidence to show that

prior to the year 2001, the plaintiff had done anything in the

country to establish reputation and goodwill.       Therefore, even

assuming that the plaintiff commenced its business in India

earlier in point of time by commencing business in Goa, still it will

not help the plaintiff to seek a decree for injunction unless it is

shown that by the prior business the plaintiff had established

goodwill and reputation in India.     The learned counsel further

pointed out that even according to the plaintiff and the plaint

averment in para 3, the Hotel at Goa was re-branded under a

different mark.    That itself goes against the claim of the plaintiff

regarding goodwill and reputation.       If the plaintiff had really

acquired a goodwill and reputation in respect of the mark and the

business, plaintiff would not have changed the name of the Hotel

to any other name. This very conduct of the plaintiff cuts at the

very root of the plaintiff's case.    As regards the question of

"Trans Border Reputation", Sri.Satish Ninan submitted that in

order to earn reputation and goodwill in a country it is not

essential that business must have been actually conducted in that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">RFA.No.235/2008                  14</span>

country.   By way of advertisements or        other materials also

goodwill or reputation could be established in a country in spite of

the fact that actual business is not being carried on there. This

kind of reputation that transgresses the limits of jurisdiction of

the country where actual business is being done to another

country is termed "Trans Border Reputation" In the instant case

the plaintiff could have produced material to show that by

advertisements and publications the plaintiff had acquired a Trans

Border Reputation in India prior to the starting of the business by

the Defendant.       However,    the newspapers and magazines

produced by the plaintiff relating to the advertisements made in

India are all for the period after 2002. Coming to the aspect of

deception, Sri.Satish Ninan submitted that except            vague

statements     in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the plaint, no specific

averments have been made by the plaintiff.       Even the name of

the customer who allegedly sent E-mail is disclosed in the plaint.

E-mail message contrary to the averment in the plaint was not

produced along with the plaint.    Though Ext.A77 purporting to

be E-mail message is produced,         maker of Ext.A77 is not

examined. Referring to the judgment of the Supreme Court in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">RFA.No.235/2008                  15</span>

2001(5) SCC page 73, Sri.Satish Ninan submitted that for

proving deception, relevant factors to be taken into account

are ;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     a) Nature of Marks
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     b). Degree of resemblance.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     c). Nature of goods.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     d). Similarity in the nature, character and purpose of the
         goods.</blockquote><p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     e). The class of customers, their education, intelligence,
degree of care and
</p><p id="p_12">     f). Dissimilarities between the marks.
</p>
<p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">     8. Referring to the evidence of PW1 in cross examination

at page 33    and the evidence of DW1 in chief examination at

paras 5, 9 and 10 and cross examination of pages 13 and 14

Sri.Satish Ninan submitted that when the relevant aspects are

taken into account, it will be seen that there has been no

deception or possibility of deception.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     9. Sri.Satish Ninan dealt next with the aspect of damages.

He conceded that in a quai timet action proof of actual damages

may not necessary. According to him, proof of actual damages

may apply in cases where         an interlocutory application for

injunction is being considered.      In a quai timet action the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">RFA.No.235/2008                 16</span>

apprehension of an injury is sufficient.     The proceedings are

initiated before the injury actually results. In this context, the

learned counsel referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/1742704/" id="a_4">Kuldip Singh v. Subhash Chander Jain and others</a> (2004

(4) SCC 50.).      The counsel submitted that the defendant

commenced business in the year 1996. The suit is filed only in

the year 2005.    By no stretch of imagination,the action can be

said to be quai timet action.   If any damages are resulted, the

plaintiff  could very well have proved the same.      There is no

proper plea or evidence regarding damages. In paragraph 12 of

the plaint what is given is only a vague statement regarding

damages. In the evidence of PW1 in chief examination, there is

not even a whisper regarding damages. There is no case that

any damages has resulted to the plaintiff consequent to the

action of the defendant. There was no interim injunction and the

plaintiff could have atleast proved the damages if any which

resulted from the date of the suit till the date of the decree.

There is no      evidence regarding     damages.    According to

Sri.Satish Ninan in the absence of evidence or even a proper plea

regarding damages, the plaintiff is not entitled for injunction.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">RFA.No.235/2008                17</span>

Sri.Satish Ninan's submissions were cemented by various judicial

precedents. Judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_5">Ramdev Food

Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel And Others</a>

(2006(8) SCC 726), Laxmikant V.Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah

(2004 (12 Supreme Court Cases 624)     were relied on by him in

support of his submissions made with reference to the time

factor.   Sri.Satish Ninan cited the judgment of the Supreme

Court in 2001 (5) SCC 95 (supra) and <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_9">Satyam Infoway Ltd. v.

Sifynet Solutions (P) Ltd</a>. (2004 (6) SCC 145) to expatiate

his argument regarding the establishment of priority. Similarly,

learned counsel relied on the judgments of the <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_10">Ramdev Food

Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel And Others</a>

(2006 (8) SCC 726), <a href="/doc/1335881/" id="a_11">Heinz Italia And Another v. Dabur India

Ltd</a>. (2007 (6) SCC 1), 2002 (3) SCC 65(supra) in support of

his argument regarding the goodwill and reputation. As regards

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">RFA.No.235/2008                 18</span>

his arguments in the context of     deception factors, Sri.Satish

Ninan relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in 2001 (5)

SCC 73(supra)     2006 (8) SCC 726(supra), 2007 (6) SCC 1

(supra), 2004 (6) SCC 145 (supra).    Sri.Satish Ninan relied on

the judgment of the Supreme Court in 2001 (5) SCC 73 (supra),

2004 (12) SCC 624 (supra) to mention that stricter approach is

contemplated only in action in support of medicinal products.

Sri.Satish Ninan relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in

2006 (8) SCC 726(supra) 2007 (6) SCC 1 (supra) 2004 (6) SCC

145(supra) and 2002 (3) SCC 65(supra) so as to expatiate the

relied on the judgment of the 2006 (8) SCC 726 and 2002 (3)

SC 65 (supra) to expound the concept of trade mark.      To make

out the distinction between infringement of Trade Mark and

passing off he relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in

defence of the judgment under the appeal. Answering Mr.Satish

Ninan's argument that the suit is not maintainable due to the

reason that signatory to the plaint is not competent to represent

passing off is not one of quick time action. In action for passing it

is not necessary to prove actual damages. It is sufficient that

likelihood of damages is established. The learned counsel relied

</p>
<p id="p_21">      11. I have very anxiously considered the rival submissions

addressed at the Bar in the light of the ratio emerging from the

various decisions cited before me both by Sri.Satish Ninan and

Sri.Joseph Markose.    It is difficult to accept the argument of

Satish Ninan that the suit should fail for the reason that the

signatory to the plaint is not competent to sign and verify

pleadings on behalf of the plaintiff. On going through the written

statement it is seen that no dispute is raised by the defendant

regarding the authority of the signatory to the plaint to sign and

verify pleadings on behalf of the plaintiff.        In the written

statement I do not find any denial of the signatory's authority

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">RFA.No.235/2008                  22</span>

to sign and verify the plaint despite the claim of signatory in the

verification of the plaint that he is duly authorised to sign and

verify the plaint.   The power of attorney is referred to in the

affidavit in support of the plaint. However, still no contention is

raised in the written statement that the suit is not maintainable.

No issue was also framed before the parties went for trial in the

context of maintainability with reference to competence of the

signatory.     It is held by this court in AIR 1970 Kerala 138

(supra) that by virtue of Rule 14 of Order 6 CPC, a person duly

authorised can sign the plaint on behalf of a company. Non

denial of the averments in the plaint that the signatory to the

plaint has been duly authorized by the company in my opinion is

of consequence. Importantly in an obvious endorsement of the

claim of the signatory to the plaint that he is duly authorised, the

company     authorised him to give evidence and he only gave

evidence on behalf of the company as PW1. Non production of

the power of attorney is only a curable defect as held by this

court in <a href="/doc/880339/" id="a_19">Iyakku Mathoo v. Julius Elias Metropolitan</a> (1962

Kerala 19). It is trite that when interests of substantial justice

and those of technicalities are pitted against each other, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">RFA.No.235/2008                  23</span>

court shall strive to advance the interests of substantial justice

rather than of technicalities. In fact Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1555740/" id="a_20">United

Bank of India v. Naresh Kumar and Others</a> (AIR 1997 SC 3)

held that procedural defects which do not go to the root of the

matter should not be permitted to defeat a just cause. There is

sufficient power in the court under the Code of Civil Procedure to

ensure that injustice is not done    to any parties who has a just

cause.    The original of the power of attorney is subsequently

produced in this court and according to me the contention on

the question of maintainability - that the suit is not maintainable

due to the non competence of the signatory to the plaint cannot

any longer survive.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      12.    The Supreme Court      has described a passing off

action in <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_21">Ruston and Hornby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engineering

Co</a>. (AIR 1970 SC 1649). At para 4, the Supreme Court has

stated that in a passing off action the issue is as follows;

</p><p id="p_23">      "Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed
or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the
plaintiff's goods?
</p>
<p id="p_24">Later in <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_22">Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Sifynet Solutions (P) Ltd</a>.

(2004 (6) SCC 145) the Supreme Court has held in paragraph 13

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">RFA.No.235/2008                    24</span>

that an action for passing off, as the phrase " passing off"

suggests, is to restrain the defendant from passing off its goods

and services to the public as that of the plaintiff's. It is an action

not only to preserve the reputation of the plaintiff but also to

safeguard the public . As explained by the Supreme Court in its

judgment in 2004 (6) SCC 145 (supra) the three elements of

passing off action are a). Prior user, b) likelihood of deception

and c) loss or likelihood of it.    The legal position emerging from

the judgments of the Supreme Court in 2001 (5) SCC 95, 2007

(6) SCC1, 2004 (6) SCC 145, 2004 (12) SCC 624 and 2002 (3)

SCC 65, (supra) which were cited by Sri.Satish Ninan is that the

question as to whose business has started first is one of the most

important factors to be considered in deciding as to whether the

plaintiff is entitled to the injunction in a passing off action.  The

case of the plaintiff is that           it started using the name

RENAISSANCE much prior to the use of the said name by the

defendant. The argument of Sri.Satish Ninan was that there is

no evidence to show the use of the name RENAISSANCE by the

plaintiff in India prior to 2001 and even if the plaintiff had a

hotel in Goa by name RENAISSANCE from 1990 the mere small

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">RFA.No.235/2008                   25</span>

business earlier in point of time is not sufficient to claim priority

and in any event the rebranding of the hotel shows that the name

RENAISSANCE has no significance.         It is seen from the plaint

that it has been clearly averred in the plaint that the petitioner

had operated the Goa RENAISSANC from 1993. In evidence it is

clarified by PW1, that Goa Renaissance was in existence actually

from 1990.     At the same time in the written statement the

defendant has not denied that the plaintiff      had operated the

RENAISSANCE       hotel in Goa.     On the contrary the defendant's

contention in para 4 and 5 of the written statement concentrates

on the fact    that the plaintiff had changed the name of Goa

RENAISSANCE to Ramada and that the admitted change of name

by the plaintiff of its Goa hotel would go to show that the name

RENAISSANNCE is not a prominent and dominant feature of the

plaintiff's hotel business. The defendant does not at any time

contest the fact that the plaintiff had been running RENAISSANCE

Goa from 1993.         The plaintiff has also produced various

advertisements and travel directories including Exhibits A-23, 24

and A-97, 98 which are travel directories and Travel agent

Brochures for the year 1993, which clearly advertises existence of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">RFA.No.235/2008                 26</span>

RENAISSANCE       Goa in that year.    The fact that the name

RENAISSANCE is itself registered in the name of the plaintiff as

a trade mark in many countries of the world is also not disputed.

That the plaintiff has been using the name RENAISSANCE from

1984 is in evidence from various registration certificates

produced.    In particular Exhibit A4 issued by the Registry of

Trade Marks in China evidencing registration in China from 1996,

A11 in Indoneisa from 1995, A14 in Russia from 1993, A16 in

South Africa from 1984, A17 in Portugal from 1992, A18 in USA,

A18(d) in Great Britain, A20 in Mexico from 1993 etc. clearly

show that even prior to 1990 the plaintiff had been using the

name RENAISSANCE worldwide. The defendant has argued that

many of the documents (registration certificates from other

countries) are photocopies and so inadmissible. But the cross

examination of PW1 would show that since the defendant has

examined PW1 with reference to the         documents and the

contents of the documents as well and the statement of PW1

regarding the registration of the mark in various countries in

chief examination are not disputed.        The contents of the

documents can therefore be treated as admitted substantially.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">RFA.No.235/2008                 27</span>

Atleast A-4 (China) A16 (South Africa), A18 Great Britan are

original documents.    Ext.A1 is the registration granted by the

Trade Mark Registry in India for the name RENAISSANCE. This

clearly establishes usage of the name RENAISSANCE         by the

plaintiff from 28/10/1993 with respect to class 16. Pertinently in

1993 it was not possible in India to register Service Marks and

therefore hotels registered their marks in class 16 for printed

matter, magazines, publications, etc.    Even the defendant has

tried to register its mark under Class 16. After registration of

Service Marks was permitted from 1/10/2003 the Registry has

also granted registration of RENAISSANCE under Class 42 to the

plaintiff as can be seen from the subsequent registration also

marked A1. The existence of Goa RENAISSANCE hotel in India

1990 and the continued usage of the word RENAISSANCE by the

establishments of the plaintiff - Renaissance Bombay Hotel in

2001 will show that RENAISSANCE has been a presence in India

continuously from 1990. The defendant on the other hand has

started using the name, RENAISSANCE in Cochin only from

1996/1998. It is important to note that prior to using of this

name the defendant's hotel was known as " Polakulath Tourist

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">RFA.No.235/2008                   28</span>

Home". It is also on record that the Defendant sought to change

the name after certain incidents that occurred in the defendant's

hotel. There is force in the argument of Sri.Joseph Marakose that

the     defendant should have been aware of the existence of

Renaissance Goa Hotel during the relevant time.       Therefore, in

my opinion, usage of the word RENAISSANCE in India by the

plaintiff prior to the usage of the same by the defendant is clearly

established in this case.     The   argument raised by Sri.Satish

Ninan is that      cross examination of PW1 casts doubt in the

existence of the Goa RENAISSANCE since 1990. I do not find

much force in this argument.          While there are questions

pertaining to the ownership of the        hotel, PW1 at page 16

confirms the averment in the Plaint that the plaintiff operated the

RENAISSANCE Goa Hotel. Importantly, the defendant never had

a case that the plaintiff did not operate the Goa RENAISSANCE in

1993 which is confirmed by the        answer given to a specific

question put to PW1 in page 14. The question is ;
</p>
<p id="p_25">I say as per A23 the name of your hotel is Goa Renaissance
Resort in the year 1993 in India.
</p><p id="p_26">A. Yes.
</p>
<p id="p_27">     13. The alternate argument that even if the plaintiff had a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">RFA.No.235/2008                 29</span>

hotel at Goa the small business is not sufficient to constitute

priority and that the plaintiff has in any event rebranded the

hotel under a different mark and so is not entitled to the

injunction also cannot succeed. In support of this, judgments of

the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1850663/" id="a_23">Uniply Industries v. Unicorn</a> plywood

Pvt.Ltd. And others (2001 (5) SCC 95) and <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_24">Satyam Infoway

Ltd. v. Sifynet Solutions (P) Ltd</a>. 2004 (6) SCC 145 were

relied on by Sri.Satish Ninan. Careful reading of those decisions

will show that the Supreme Court has observed that even prior

small sales is sufficient to establish priority. This contention,

according to me, will be relevant only when there is a genuine

dispute as to who started the business first.      In the instant

case the plaintiff's hotel was operational from 1990 well before

the defendant's hotel in 1998.      The admitted position even

according to the defendant is that the plaintiff was operating a

class hotel in Goa under the name "Renaissance" which obviously

is not a small operation.   Further, the defendant started using

the name "Renaissance" by changing the name of his hotel whose

original name was Polakulath Tourist Home in Kochi only in 1998.

I find merit in the submission of Mr. Joseph Markose that it is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">RFA.No.235/2008                  30</span>

Polakulath Tourist Home in Kochi which was relatively smaller

business than Renaissance, Goa. Moreover, it is settled law that

user of the name worldwide is relevant and it is not correct to

consider user of a name in a country alone as the criteria.     The

courts in India have accepted trans-boarder reputation also as an

important factor.       The decision of the Supreme Court in

Whirlpool's case      reported in 1996(5) SCC 714 confirms this.

Further in <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_25">M/s. Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. M/s. Sifynet Solutions

Pvt. Ltd</a>. - AIR 2004 SC 3540 the Supreme Court has again

confirmed this.    In the instant case, the fact that the name

"Renaissance" is itself registered in the name of the plaintiff as a

trade mark in many countries of the world is not disputed and

that the plaintiff has been using the word "Renaissance" from

1984 is evident from the various registration certificates

produced.     So there is no scope for dispute that the mark

"Renaissance" is associated with the plaintiff worldwide for long.

</p><p id="p_28">     14.    The case of the defendant/appellant is that people in

India are not aware of the trans-boarder reputation of the

plaintiff and the re-branding of the Renaissance      Goa     Hotel

shows that the name has not much significance.        Importantly

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">RFA.No.235/2008                  31</span>

trans-boarder reputation is relevant both for people in India and

in the case of hospitality industry also for foreign tourists who

travel to India when foreign travellers      who are familiar with

Renaissance     hotels of the plaintiff, arrive in India and come

across the Renaisance hotel, they naturally presume it as one

belonging to the Plaintiff's group of hotels.  If other persons are

allowed to use the name "Renaissance" for a hotel in India, the

possibility of confusion in the minds of travelling public cannot be

ruled out.      That the plaintiff has spent huge amounts for

advertisement is not seriously in dispute and the details are given

in the plaint.   The existence of Goa Renaissance Hotel in India

from 1990 and the continued usage of the word "Renaissance" by

the establishments of Renaissance Bombay Hotel in 2001 will

clearly show that the Renaissance has been a presence in India

continuously. This itself is sufficient to sustain the injunction

granted and it may not be necessary even to rely upon trans

boarder reputation. But all the same I am in agreement with Sri

Joseph Markose who argues that A23, 24, 97 and 98 publications

of the year 1993 establishes trans boarder reputation.          The

defendant admittedly started using the name "Renaissance" in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">RFA.No.235/2008                 32</span>

Cochin only from 1998.         No evidence is produced by the

defendant to show that advertisements have been made using

the name "Renaissance". Before the defendant's hotel started

using the name "Renaissance",       it was known as "Polakulath

Tourist Home".     The version of the plaintiff that the defendant

must have been aware of the existence of Renaissance Goa Hotel

during the relevant time is a probable one.        The defendant's

witness has only sought to feign ignorance regarding the

existence of Renaissance Goa Hotel.     The plaintiff has produced

various advertisement material and publications, published both

in India and abroad.     It is not disputed that the plaintiff has

many hotels worldwide and in connection therewith various

advertisements, travel brochures      and directories have been

published.    According to me the finding of the trial court based

on Exts.A57, 59, 61, 62 and 65 to 71 that substantial amounts

have been spent by the plaintiff in advertisements for promoting

the reputation in the hospitality industry is justified.  Likewise,

the finding based on Exts.A31, 33, 39 to 43 and 72 to 76 that the

plaintiff's hotels are part of the Marriott Rewards Programme

catering to the need of the travelling public is correct. Therefore

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">RFA.No.235/2008                  33</span>

I am of the view that the conclusion of the learned Subordinate

Judge that the plaintiff is the prior user of the name

"Renaissance" worldwide as well as in India and that the various

pieces     of   literature,   advertisements,    directories    etc.

overwhelmingly suggests the presence of the plaintiff in the

hospitality industry all over the world from 1984 onwards

maintaining very high standards and acquiring a reputation of

their own is a correct and reasonable one.

<p id="p_29">      15. It is now necessary to examine the case in the context

of deception or likelihood of deception. The Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_26">Ruston and Hornby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engineering Co</a>. - AIR 1970

SC 1649 at paragraph 6 drawing the distinction between a case

of infringement of trade mark and one for restraining passing of

held:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">      "On the other hand, the gist of a passing off action is that A

      is not entitled to represent his goods as the goods of B, but

      it is not necessary for B to prove that A did this knowingly

      or with any intent to deceive.   It is enough that the get-up

      of B's goods has become distinctive of them and that there

      is a probability of confusion between them that and the

      goods of A.      No case of actual deception nor any actual

</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">The plaintiff's case is that use of the name "Renaissance" by the

defendant will deceive the travelling public to presume that

defendant's hotel is a part of the plaintiff's chain of hotels.

Ext.A77 is an e.mail message from one person complaining that

he was misled to believe that the defendant's hotel was part of

the plaintiff's chain of hotels.     A77 is clearly pointed out in

Ext.A78 notices to the defendant.     The defendant's case is that

the use of the prefix "the" and suffix "Cochin" to the name

"Renaissance"     and the logo of a soldier with a helmet will

distinguish the mark of the defendant and therefore there will not

be any confusion for the public. It was argued by the defendant

on the authority of the judgment of the Supreme Court in

Cadila's case (AIR 2001 SC 1952) that the relevant factors to be

considered are:-(a) nature of marks, (b) degree of resembleness,

) nature of goods,(d) similarity innature, character and purpose,

</p><p id="p_31">(e) class of customers, and (f) dissimilarities between the marks.

But, here in this case, the trade mark is the word "Renaissance"

itself.

73 is applicable only when the marks in question are deceptively

similar and not when they are the same, is fairly strong and is

supported by the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1850663/" id="a_27">Uniply

Industries Ltd. v. Unicorn Plywood Pvt. Ltd</a>. - AIR 2001 SC 2083.

At paragraph 6 of the above judgment it has been held by the

Supreme Court as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_33">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     "Considering the nature of the pleadings in the two suits

     filed by the parties, it is clear that there is common field of

     activity between the parties in respect of goods and trade

     marks sought to be used by either are identical. Hence the

     decision in Cadila case (2001 AIR SCW 1411) and of similar

     context may not be of much use in this case.       In as much

     as the areas of activity and the nature of goods dealt with

     or business carried on being identical, and the trade marks

     being of similar nature, the only question that needs to be

     decided is as to who is the prior user."



</blockquote><p id="p_34">Admittedly, both the plaintiff and the defendant are in the field of

hospitality and the mark is also the same viz. "Renaissance".

</p><p id="p_35">     16. The argument of Mr. Satheesh Ninan, though supported

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">RFA.No.235/2008                  36</span>

by the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_28">Kaviraj Pandit Durga

Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutial Laboratories</a> - AIR

1965 SC 980 that the defendant in this case can escape the

liability since the added matters viz. the prefix "the" and the

suffix "Cochin" are sufficient to distinguish the defendant's

business from that of the plaintiff cannot be accepted. According

to me the added material viz. the prefix "the" and the suffix

"Cochin" are not sufficient to distinguish the hotels because the

public does not associate the hotel with "the" or "Cochin". The

public will always go by the name "Renaissance". The argument

of Mr. Joseph Markose in this case has support of the judgment of

the Supreme Court in Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and

another - 2002(3)SCC 65. That was a case where a passing on

action in respect of the name "Muktajivan" was defended

contending where "defendant" on the basis of a use of prefix

"QSS". Repelling the argument the Supreme Court held:-




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "It is the word "Muktajivan", the employment of which

       makes distinctive the business name of the plaintiff and it

       is the continued use of "Muktajivan" in the business name

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">RFA.No.235/2008                   37</span>

      which has created a property therein linked with the

      plaintiff".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">The argument of the respondent is that employment of the word

"Renaissance" is the important and distinctive business name of

the plaintiff and the continued use of the said name from 1990 in

India and from 1984 worldwide has created the property therein

linked with the plaintiff, according to me has force.     The use of

the same word "Renaissance" by the defendant will cause or is

likely to cause confusion among the public and the use of any

prefix "the" or suffix "Cochin" is immaterial.   It is on record that

the plaintiff's hotels worldwide are also normally described with

reference to the place where the hotel is situated as in the case

of Renaissance, Mumbai and Renaissance, Goa.               The mere

difference in the style of writing is not important. PW.1 has only

stated what is evident that the style of writing "Renaissance" by

the two parties is different.   But this cannot give licence to the

defendant to use the name "Renaissance". The logo of a soldier

with a helmet is a device mark.         There is no quarrel for the

plaintiff that the defendant is free to use this logo, but the

defendant has to use this log with any other name and not with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">RFA.No.235/2008                  38</span>

the name "Renaissance".
</p>
<p id="p_37">       17.   The observations of the Supreme Court in Cadila's

case certainly support the argument of Mr. Satheesh Ninan that

when medicinal products are involved, a strict approach has to be

taken implying that in other products the approach may be less

strict. This is not a case where two marks which are deceptively

similar to each other are being considered.    In the instant case

the mark is the same and the dispute is with regard to use of the

same name "Renaissance" and under such circumstances the only

factor to be considered will be prior user.
</p>
<p id="p_38">


</p><p id="p_39">      18. It is now necessary to consider the arguments of Mr.

Satheesh Ninan raised in the context of damages or likelihood of

damages.     The argument was that the plaintiff having filed the

suit in 2005 ought to have by now proved damages and that the

action initiated by the plaintiff is to be treated as similar to a

quick time action and the argument was on the basis of the

judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1742704/" id="a_29">Kuldip Singh v. Subash

Chander Jain and others</a> - (2000) 4 SCC 50. This argument is

also convincingly answered       by Mr. Joseph Markose on the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">RFA.No.235/2008                    39</span>

authority of the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_30">Satyam

Infoway Ltd. v. Sifynet Solutions (P) Ltd</a>. - 2004 (6) SCC 145 and

Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and another - 2002(3)

SCC 65.    Action for passing off according to the Supreme Court

is not one quick time action. In actions for passing off it is not

necessary to prove actual damages and it will be suffice that

likelihood of damages is proved.         There is pleading and proof

that the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable damages and loss

to its reputation and good will by the continued user of the mark

"Renaissance" by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_40">      19. Another aspect of the matter also cannot be lost sight

of.   Upon the plaintiff becoming aware of the use of the name

"Renaissance" by the defendant, plaintiff had issued Ext.A77

notice dated 3.12.2001 to which the defendant replied by letter

dated 28.12.2001 through its advocates agreeing to change its

name to Renaissance, Cochin.        This would clearly prove that the

defendant   was     well   aware    that   the   use  of  the  word

"Renaissance" was in contravention of law. Of course, the above

admission was subsequently sought to be retracted from by the

defendant who went to the extent of saying of that the first

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">RFA.No.235/2008                 40</span>

lawyer was not authorised to issue such a reply.     The trial court

was not very much impressed by the above contention and I also

feel that the contention that the first lawyer had issued the reply

unauthorisedly is not convincing in the absence of any cogent

evidence adduced by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      20.   Ext.P1 decision of the National Arbitration Forum

constituted in accordance with the uniform domain name dispute

resolution policy adopted by the Internet Corporation for

Assigning Names and Numbers (ICANN) where it is ordered that

the    domain    name    www.renaissancecochin.com      shall    be

transferred from the defendant to the plaintiff also has some

relevance in resolving the issue. The above order it is seen was

passed by the appropriate authority after enquiry and the same is

not seen challenged    by the defendant before the appropriate

appellate authority.
</p>
<p id="p_42">      21. The above discussion would lead this appeal to the

following result:
</p>
<p id="p_43">      The appeal stands dismissed. However, in deference to the

ability and learning with which Mr.Satheesh Ninan, learned

counsel for the appellant, addressed his submissions before me, I

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">RFA.No.235/2008                   41</span>

direct that costs will not follow the event. The parties will suffer

their costs in this appeal.
