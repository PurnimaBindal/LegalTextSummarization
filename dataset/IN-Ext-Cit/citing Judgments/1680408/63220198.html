<p id="p_1">         (Passed on this 24th day of April, 2012)

 (Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">/227</a> of the Constitution

                         of India)


</p><p id="p_2">1.   By  this petition the petitioner seeks to quash  the
     order dated 04.05.2010 (Annexure - P/9) passed by the
     Secretary to the Government of Chhattisgarh, Department of
     Revenue and Disaster Management. 
</p><p id="p_3">2.   The facts, in brief, are that earlier the petitioner
challenged the departmental enquiry proceedings before
this Court in W. P. No. 4743 of 2005. The said petition
was dismissed by this Court on 28.04.2009 (Annexure - 
P/1), however, liberty was granted to the petitioner to
take recourse on all the grounds available to him under
the provisions of law, if so advised. Thereafter, the
petitioner preferred an appeal before the Commissioner,
Bilaspur Division, Bilaspur on 12.05.2009 (Annexure -
P/2). The said appeal was allowed on 25.06.2009 (Annexure 
</p><p id="p_4">- P/3). Consequent thereupon, the petitioner joined the
service on 07.07.2009 (Annexure - P/4). Thereafter, the
Collector sought a direction from the respondent No.1. The
respondent No.1 suggested to file an appeal before the
appropriate authority.
</p><p id="p_5">3.   Thereafter, the Collector preferred a revision
against the order dated 25.06.2009, passed by the
Commissioner, Bilaspur Division before the State
Government. The petitioner filed an application on
12.04.2010 {sic 03.04.2010 (Annexure -   P/8)} in the said
revision, to afford an opportunity of hearing to him. The
Secretary, by the impugned order dated 04.05.2009 
(Annexure - P/9) held that since the question of
jurisdiction was being considered, there was no necessity
to afford the opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and
consequently, the order dated 25.06.2009, passed in appeal
by the Commissioner, Bilaspur Division, was quashed.
</p><p id="p_6">4.   Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits
that under the provisions of the Chhattisgarh Civil
Services (Classification, Control &amp; Appeal) Rules, 1966
(for short "the Rules, 1966") in Schedule as item No.5,
which deals with that Revenue Inspector appointing
authority is Collector and the appellate authority is
Commissioner of the Revenue Division. The decision of the
Secretary to the Government held that the Commissioner, 
Bilaspur Division, is not the appellate authority and, as
such, the order passed by the Commissioner, Bilaspur 
Division, cannot held as legal and in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_7">5.   Learned counsel further submits that the impugned
order dated 04.05.2010 (Annexure - P/9) passed by the
State Government is illegal and otherwise void and non est
being in violation of principles of natural justice, as
also of Rule 29 of the Rules, 1966. Learned counsel
further submits that the provisions of the Rules require
that no order shall be reviewed without affording
opportunity of hearing. Though the petitioner submitted an
application on 12.04.2010, seeking opportunity of hearing,
respondent No.1 refused to grant opportunity of hearing
before passing the impugned order.  It is next contended
that admittedly the Rules, 1966 is applicable in respect
of the service of Revenue Inspectors and under service
rules, the appellate authority is the concerned Divisional
Commissioner.  
</p><p id="p_8">6.   On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the
State submits that the impugned order dated 04.05.2010,
passed by the State Government is just and proper.  The
Commissioner, Land Records is a proper appellate 
authority. In support of his contention, no document has
been produced. 
</p><p id="p_9">7.   Learned counsel further submits that the respondent
No.1 has passed a detailed and reasoned order after
following the due process of law. Thus, the petitioner is
not entitled to any relief. Even otherwise, the State
Government has not decided the matter on merits, but has
decided the issue on the question of jurisdiction. Thus,
the question of affording opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner does not arise.
</p><p id="p_10">8.   I have heard learned counsel appearing for the
parties, perused the pleadings and the documents appended 
thereto.
</p><p id="p_11">9.   Proviso to sub-rule (1) (iv) Rule 29 of the Rules,
1966 clearly provides that no order imposing of enhancing
any penalty shall be made by any reviewing authority
unless the Government servant concerned has been given a 
reasonable opportunity of making a representation against
the penalty proposed/made. 
</p><p id="p_12">10.  In the case on hand, the Commissioner, Bilaspur
Division vide order dated 25.6.2009 set aside the order
passed by the Collector.  The Secretary to the Government
without affording an opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner has quashed the order passed by the
Commissioner, which is not sustainable under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_3">Article 311 (2)</a> of the Constitution of India
as well as Rule 29 of the Rules, 1966.
</p><p id="p_13">11.  Be that as it may, it is well settled principle of
law that the basic opportunity of hearing must be afforded
to the concerned person. Thus, the impugned order is
illegal and cannot be sustained under the provisions of
law.
</p><p id="p_14">12.  This Court in <a href="/doc/101258473/" id="a_4">Roshan Prasad Sidar v. State of
Chhattisgarh and Others1</a> observed as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "13.   It  is  well settled principle of  law
           that  if  any  order  visits  with  civil
           consequences,  the same is  vitiated,  if
           passed  without affording an  opportunity
           of  hearing  to  the  employee(s).  (See:

<p id="p_15">13.  This  Court,  in  Ku.  Punam &amp; Others  v.  State  of
Chhattisgarh &amp; Others14, wherein an identical issue came up
     for consideration, observed as under:
       "20.     It  is well settled that the purpose
           of  rules  of natural justice is  not  to
           administer  justice alone but to  prevent
           miscarriage of justice and the principles
           of  natural justice are applicable to the
           administrative  order,  if   such   order
           affects right of a citizen.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       21.Applying well settled principle of law  to
           the facts of the cases, there is a common
           thread  that  the  principle  of  natural
           justice   is   not  unruly   horse.   The
           principles   of   natural   justice   are
           required  to  be  complied  with,  having
           regard  to  the facts situation  obtained
           therein. Thus, the principles of  natural
           justice  may  not  be  required   to   be
           followed  in the cases, where  the  facts
           are   admitted.  Secondly,  that  it   is
           practically    impossible    or    highly
           improbable  to  afford an opportunity  of
           hearing,  in  the event, of  quashing  of
           selection   on  account  of  irregularity
           committed  on  mass  scale,  or  en-masse
           cancellation. Thirdly, no useful  purpose
           would   be   served   by   affording   an
           opportunity of hearing."
</p>
<p id="p_17">14.  Section 44 of the MP/CG Land Revenue Code, 1959 (for 
     short "the Code, 1959") provides for appeal and appellate
     authorities.  Against the order passed by the Collector,
     the appeal is maintainable to the Commissioner under sub-
     section (1) (e) Section 44 of the Code, 1959.   Vide
     notification dated 25.8.2008 (Annexure - P/12),  the
     following amendment has been incorporated in Section 44 :
        "(2)    Save  as otherwise provided a second
           appeal  shall  lie  against  every  order
           passed in first appeal under this Code or
           the rules made thereunder -</p><pre id="pre_2">

             (i)  by  the Sub-Divisional Officer  or
                  the      Collector     to      the
                  Commissioner."

</pre><p id="p_18">     There is no mention that in case of service matters,
     the  appeal  shall  be  maintainable  to  the  other
     Commissioner,   not  Divisional   Commissioner,   as
     pleaded by the State.
</p><p id="p_19">15.  In  the  impugned order dated 4.5.2010, it has  been
     held by the Secretary to the Government that the appeal
     ought to have been preferred to the Commissioner, Land
     Records, on the basis of Section 106 of the Code, 1959, is
     frivolous, as Section 106 provides that the  Revenue
     Inspectors would be appointed by the Collector.
</p><p id="p_20">16.  For the reasons mentioned hereinabove and
particularly on account of the fact that the request for
affording an opportunity of hearing was rejected on the
technical ground that the jurisdiction was under
consideration, the impugned order dated 04.05.2010
(Annexure - P/9) is liable to be and is hereby quashed.
</p><p id="p_21">17.  As an upshot, the writ petition is allowed to the
extent indicated above, leaving the parties to bear their
own costs.
