</pre><p id="p_1">                        (27.02.2012)

      The petitioners have sought to challenge the award
passed pursuant to the notification dated 15.06.1990 and
the entire proceedings of acquisition of lands bearing
Khasra No.119, situated at village Kolua Kalan of Tahsil
Huzur, District Bhopal, and other lands description of which
has been given in the writ petition. It is mainly contended
that the entire proceedings of acquisition are vitiated on the
ground that the award was not passed within two years
from the date of publication of the notification and
declaration under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_1">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_2">6</a> of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 (herein after referred to as 'Act') and that there
was no case made out to exercise power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_3">Section 17</a>
of the Act. It is contended that appropriate opportunity of
hearing was not granted to the petitioners and, therefore,
such award was bad in law.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    Briefly stated facts as given in the writ petition by the
petitioners, for the purposes of deciding the controversy,
are, that certain lands belonging to the petitioners were
situated at village Kolua Kalan. It is contended that the use
of lands in village Kolua Kalan, Narela Shakari, Damkheda of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>




Tahsil Huzur, District Bhopal, was agriculture. The villages
are situated near about Bhopal city and are part of the
Bhopal Urban Agglomeration. Sometime before 1995, land
use of village Kolua Kalan was changed to industrial and
that of village Narela Shakari to residential, but in the
revised plan of Bhopal Urban Agglomeration, the land use of
village Kolua Kalan has been changed to be residential. It is
contended that certain colonies have been developed in the
said area not only by the State Government but by the
Madhya Pradesh Housing Board also.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.   The respondent No.2, the Industries Department,
made an application for acquisition of the land of village
Samrakala, Narela Shakari, Damkheda and Kolua Kalan for
the purposes of establishing the industrial area on the said
land. Case No.4/A-82/89-90 was, thus, registered and the
respondent No.2 was required to make an application for
obtaining no objection certificate from the Directorate of
Town &amp; Country Planning, Bhopal. Though prior to making
of the application for acquisition of the land, such no
objection certificate was applied for by the respondent No.2
but same was not issued.            Even when the matter was
considered by the respondent No.3, for initiating the
proceedings for acquisition of the land aforesaid for the
purpose of making it available to respondent No.2, no
objection certificate from the Directorate of Town &amp; Country
Planning, Bhopal    was    not produced.        Even when a
peremptory order was issued directing respondent No.2 to
obtain such a no objection certificate, the Land Acquisition
Officer, the Collector, Bhopal, inspected the spot, took a
complete   somersault     and   made     a   reference   to   the
Commissioner, Bhopal Division, seeking permission to
invoke emergency powers under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_4">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act for
the purposes of acquisition of the land in dispute.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>




<p id="p_4">4.   Consequently, the notifications were issued in the
Gazette     of    Madhya    Pradesh     dated     15.06.1990   vide
Annexure P-9 &amp; P-10, under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_5">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_6">6</a> of the Act.
Though the notifications so issued were in complete
violation of provisions of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_7">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act, yet
without granting any opportunity of hearing to the persons
concerned, conducting any enquiry in respect of any such
objection, proceedings were done and land was said to be
acquired.        It is said that the proceedings so done were
placed in the office of Commissioner, Bhopal Division, where
certain defects were pointed out and it was said that draft
award was not signed by competent authority.              The draft
proposal was finalized and thus the award was passed. It is
contended that such action was not completed within the
time prescribed under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_8">Section 11-A</a> of the Act and,
therefore, the award was a nullity. At the same time, since
there was no such compliance of provisions of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_9">Section 17</a> of
the Act nor there was any case made out to exercise
emergent power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_10">Section 17</a> of the Act, therefore,
such an award was bad in law.               The proprietary rights
conferred under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_11">Article 300-A</a> of the Constitution of India
are not to be taken away in an illegal manner. Therefore, it
is claimed that entire proceedings are liable to be quashed
and the lands of the petitioners are to be restored in their
possession. It is the submission made by the learned Senior
Counsel for the petitioners that even for the industrial
purposes, the land in residential area was not to be
acquired and since the purposes for which the land was
acquired have not been achieved by establishing any
industries,      not   a   single   brick   has    been   laid-down
establishing any industry on the land in question till now,
such action of the respondents was bad in law and the lands
of the petitioners are required to be restored in their
possession.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>




<p id="p_5">5.   In response to the notice of writ petition, a return has
been filed by the respondents contending that the award
passed was called in question by certain persons in a writ
petition filed before this Court being W.P. No.2986/2002. It
is contended that such submissions were taken into
consideration and this Court by order dated 01.07.2002 has
dismissed the writ petition. It is contended that once such
an issue has already been adjudicated by this Court in a writ
petition, it is not open to the petitioners to challenge the
validity of the award.        It is also submitted by the
respondents    that   since   a    proposal   was   made   for
establishing an industrial area, the State Government was
intending to acquire the lands in the particular villages. For
the said purposes, looking to the need and emergent
requirement of the land, the power under sub-section (1) of
<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_12">Section 17</a> of the Act was exercised and the notification was
published under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_13">Section 4</a> of the Act on 25.05.1990, giving
complete description of the lands along with corresponding
area situated in the village. A declaratory notification under
<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_14">Section 6</a> of the Act was also published in the Gazette on
15.06.1990.   It is contended that no objection certificate
from the Housing &amp; Environment Department was not
necessary as the same is not the requirement of law for
initiating acquisition proceedings. It is contended that after
completing the proceedings in terms of provisions of
<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_15">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_16">6</a> and <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_17">17</a> of the Act, the award was passed and,
therefore, it cannot be said that illegality was committed in
the manner alleged against the respondents and thus it
cannot be said that the entire acquisition proceedings were
bad. It is contended that the claim made by the petitioners
is identical to that of the claim of Charan Singh &amp; others,
who have filed W.P. No.2986/2002 and since the said writ
petition has been dismissed, the present petition is also
liable to be dismissed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>




<p id="p_6">6.      The petitioners have filed their rejoinder categorically
contending that such submissions made by the respondents
are not justified in view of the fact that the order passed by
this Court in case of Charan Singh &amp; others (supra) is not an
order    on    merits   touching       all   the   issues,   which   the
petitioners have raised in the present writ petition. Further
it is contended that the award could not have been passed
in such a proceedings where the notification itself had
lapsed on expiry of period of two years from the date of
publication.    It is contended that the correspondence was
done indicating that even the draft award was not signed by
the competent authority and this fact was brought to the
notice of the concerning authority and thereafter since
approval was granted later on, the award was passed much
after lapse of two years from the date of notification and
declaration. It is submitted that in view of the law laid-down
by the Apex Court, such an award is a nullity in the eye of
law. It is contended that because of lapses on the part of
the respondents themselves, the entire proceedings lapsed.
These questions were not subject matter of the writ petition
of Charan Singh &amp; others (supra) and, therefore, there is no
adjudication of these grounds in the order of this Court.
Therefore, there is no bar if such a ground is raised as the
principles of res judicata would not be attracted at all in
such circumstances.        It is further contended that lame
excuses have been raised by the respondents in their return
and they have not justified the action initiated by the
respondents. In such a case where there was no emergent
need of acquisition, the power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_18">Section 17(1)</a> of the
Act was exercised malafidely.            Thus, it is contended that
ignoring the entire stand taken by the respondents in their
return, the petitioners deserve to be granted the relief
claimed in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.      Heard learned Counsel for the parties at length and
perused the records.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>




<p id="p_8">8.     For the purposes of adjudication of this petition, it
would be appropriate to formulate the questions so as to
examine whether such questions were raised in the writ
petition of Charan Singh &amp; others (supra) or not and
whether there was any adjudication of these issues or not.
For the convenience the questions are formulated as
under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)     Whether the award was rightly passed by the
               Land Acquisition Officer within the prescribed
               period under the Act or not and if not, the
               effect ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii)    Whether there was any requirement of invoking
               the emergent power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_19">Section 17</a> of the Act
               for acquisition of the land in dispute or not ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (iii)   Whether the land acquired for the purposes of
               establishing an industrial area is still to be
               retained by the respondents-State though no
               industries have been established on the said
               disputed land after such long lapse of time ?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">9.     The main question, which is to be considered in the
writ   petition,    is   whether   the   award   passed   by    the
respondents acquiring the land in dispute was just and
proper and was within the provisions of the Act or not ?
Addressing this Court on first question, learned Senior
Counsel for the petitioners vehemently contended that the
documentary evidence indicates that the notifications were
issued on one day and not on different dates.                  It is
submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners
that such notifications placed on record as Annexure P-10
were published only on one day, i.e. on 15.06.1990 in the
Gazette of Madhya Pradesh. If any other date is mentioned
in the notification the same will not be material because the
date of publication of the notification in the Gazette is to be
taken into consideration and not the date, which is
mentioned in the proposal sent for publication.                It is
submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners
that the first notification said to be issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_20">Section 4</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                <a href="/doc/1789527/" id="a_21">7</a></span>




of the Act was also published on 15.06.1990 as is clear from
the note-sheet placed on record as Annexure P-11. Thus, it
is contended that since both the notifications were issued
on one day, in fact the provisions of the Act were violated.
It is further contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners that the proceedings were thereafter initiated
and since there was a notification issued by the State
Government as back as in the year 1985 conferring the
powers on the Divisional Commissioner to accord sanction
of awards of more than Rs.10 lacs and every award made
by Collectors as a Land Acquisition Officer were required to
be approved in the like manner, unless the approval is
granted, the draft award would not be treated as an award
under the provisions of the Act. It is contended that since
such a notification was issued in exercise of powers under
sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_22">Section 11</a> of the Act, it was necessary
that compliance of such a notification be done. Pointing out
the   proceedings   recorded       in   Annexure   P-13,   it   is
emphatically contended by the learned Senior Counsel for
the petitioners that the declaration was made that on
15.07.1992 the draft award was prepared and was sent for
approval but the same was not signed by the concerned
authority. In absence of any signature, the draft was not to
be approved and after obtaining the signature when the
same was sent, the period of two years had already
completed from the date of notification and thereafter on
the basis of approval, the award was passed, therefore, it is
clear that the award was passed after the period of two
years as prescribed under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_23">Section 11</a> of
the Act. Taking this Court to the various documents, it is
contended by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners
that if this particular aspect is examined, neither such a
ground was raised in the writ petition of Charan Singh &amp;
others (supra) nor there was any adjudication on this point.
It is contended that the said writ petition was with respect
to a limited prayer.   It is pointed out that the initial writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  8</span>




petition filed being W.P. No.398/1997 was in fact decided on
10.10.2000 and only since a prayer was made confining it to
the claim of a direction to the State Government to decide
the representation submitted by the petitioners in that case
to denotify the land under <a href="/doc/983800/" id="a_24">Section 48(1)</a> of the Act, the
earlier petition was disposed of with a direction to decide
such a representation by the month of December, 2000.
The period was extended by this Court by passing an order
in M.C.C. No.726/2001.          Since the representation was
rejected, only this much was the issue which was raised
before this Court in the writ petition filed by Charan Singh &amp;
others (supra) which was decided on 01.07.2002. Neither
the grounds as have been raised in this writ petition were
raised in the writ petition of Charan Singh &amp; others (supra)
nor there was any adjudication of such grounds, therefore,
it is contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners that the issues were not identical, though the
award was the same and, therefore, the present petition is
still maintainable and it is to be adjudicated on merits. It is
contended that no satisfactory answer was given to the fact
that the award was not passed within limitation prescribed
under the Act and, therefore, such an award is nullity.
</p>

<p id="p_10">10.   Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner
has further pointed out that in fact the documentary
evidence has been placed on record along with the
rejoinder of the petitioner to indicate the exact date on
which proceedings were ultimately culminated in award.
Taking this Court to document RJ-3 filed along with the
rejoinder,   learned   Senior    Counsel   for   the   petitioners
contended that Commissioner, Bhopal Division, Bhopal has
returned back the draft proposal vide his memo dated
15.07.1992 stating therein that the draft award was not
signed by any competent officer and there was calculation
error of area of the land, which is sought to be acquired.
There was no calculation of total amount required to be paid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  9</span>




as compensation in the proposed valuation form. Since the
award    itself   was     returned   back    vide    memo      dated
15.07.1992, that itself was beyond the period of two years
from    the   date   of   publication   of   the     notification   of
acquisition, it is clear that the award was signed and passed
after this date and thus as has been alleged, the award has
been passed on 06.09.1993.           These facts have not been
rebutted by the respondents by filing any additional return
and, therefore, the contentions raised by the petitioners are
to be accepted. For the purpose of showing the procedure
of effective making of award, learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners   has    placed    his   reliance   in    the   case    of
<a href="/doc/600998/" id="a_25">Kaliyappan vs. State of Kerala and others</a>, (1989) 1
SCC 113. Further placing the reliance in case of <a href="/doc/1982588/" id="a_26">State of
U.P. and others vs. Rajiv Gupta and another</a>, (1994) 5
SCC 686, it is contended that in case the proceedings are
not completed within the period prescribed under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_27">Section
11-A</a> of the Act, the same lapse automatically. It is further
contended that the similar view has been expressed by the
Apex Court in the recent decision rendered in case of <a href="/doc/56073873/" id="a_28">Delhi
Airtech Services Private Limited and another vs.
State of Uttar Pradesh and another</a>, (2011) 9 SCC
354, wherein it has been categorically held by the Apex
Court that there is no survival of proceedings after the lapse
of such period of two years. It is contended that since there
was lapses on the part of the respondents, the proceedings
are not to be saved.          Thus, it is contended that the
proceedings were to be dropped and no award was required
to be passed.
</p>

<p id="p_11">11.    In reply to these submissions, Shri Samdarshi Tiwari,
learned Government Advocate, contended that as a whole
the proceedings will not go only because the acquisition of
land was not completed within the period of two years from
the date of notification by passing an award.                   It is
contended that the reasons for such delay was explained
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>




though it was nothing but a technical objection, therefore,
after such a long period, specially when the award has been
affirmed by this Court in the writ petition filed by some of
the persons aggrieved by the award, it will not be justified
by this Court to quash the proceedings. Placing reliance in
case of <a href="/doc/81544/" id="a_29">Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay vs.
Industrial Development Investment Co. Pvt. Ltd. and
others</a>,    (1996)   11        SCC        501,   learned     Government
Advocate    contended         that        in    some      what   similar
circumstances the Apex Court has held that once the
acquisition proceedings are completed, the land vests in the
State Government free from all encumbrances, proceeding
becomes final and thus are not opened to challenge under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India on the ground of non-
compliance with any statutory requirement. It is contended
that in such circumstances a writ petition filed after such a
long period was not maintainable. It is, thus, submitted that
on this ground, the petition is liable to be dismissed.
Placing reliance in the case of <a href="/doc/1627618/" id="a_31">Mohan and another vs.
State of Maharashtra and others</a>, (2007) 9 SCC 431, it
is   contended   that    if   the        publication   of   notification/
declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_32">Section 6</a> of the Act is taken into account,
limitation prescribed under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_33">Section 11-A</a> of the Act would
start running from the said date of publication. Accordingly,
it is contended that if it is taken into account, if a formal
approval   was necessary        and        for that some time is
consumed, it cannot be said that said period is not to be
excluded from the limitation prescribed.                    Thus, it is
contended that in view of the aforesaid annunciation of law
by the Apex Court, there is no justified claim made out in
the writ petition and merely on technical objection of
limitation as prescribed, the petitioners cannot claim that
the proceedings of acquisition of land in question were bad
in law. Thus, it is contended that the petition being devoid
of any merit, deserves dismissal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              11</span>




<p id="p_12">12.   To appreciate these rival submissions, it would be
appropriate to reproduce the provisions of <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_34">Section 11-A</a> of
the Act, which read thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "11A. Period within which an award shall be
           made.- (1) The Collector shall make an award
           under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_35">section 11</a> within a period of two years
           from the date of the publication of the
           declaration and if no award is made within that
           period, the entire proceedings for the acquisition
           of the land shall lapse :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 Provided that in a case where the said
           declaration has been published before the
           commencement       of  the   <a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_36">Land    Acquisition
           (Amendment) Act</a>, 1984 (68 of 1984), the award
           shall be made within a period of two years from
           such commencement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           Explanation.- In computing the period of two
           years referred to in this section, the period
           during which any action or proceeding to be
           taken in pursuance of the said declaration is
           stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">The opening words of this Section makes it emphatically
clear that the period prescribed for completing the process
of acquisition under the Act is two years and a consequence
of not completing the process within the aforesaid period is
also prescribed in clear words.       The intention of the
legislature is to be inferred from the words used in this
Section. The legislature has specifically prescribed a period
for completing the process of acquisition and has kept in
mind that unlimited period should not be allowed for
keeping such proceedings pending, which may result in loss
to both ways. On one hand the purpose for which the land
is sought to be acquired will not be achieved unless the
proceedings are expeditiously concluded and on other hand
the land losers will not get the monetary benefit of
compensation in lieu of taking away of right of property
expeditiously unless an award is passed. To put a caution
on this, the legislature has specifically prescribed that in
case no award is made within the period of two years as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                     12</span>




prescribed, the entire proceeding for acquisition of the land
shall lapse.       Here the use of word shall makes it
abundantly clear that it was never intended by the
legislature to extend the period of acquisition proceedings.
However, certain safeguards are provided, such as the time
consumed in ascertainment of the land, preparing a
notification, which is required to be published under the Act
and, therefore, it is provided that the period of limitation will
commence from the date the notification/declaration has
been published in the Gazette.              Another safeguard is
provided by way of explanation where it is specifically
provided that the period which is spent on account of any
stay by an order of the Court of the declaration made
pursuant to <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_37">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_38">6</a> of the Act will be excluded
while computing the period of two years. Thus, in sufficient
ways protection has also been granted to such proceedings,
which are required to be lapsed in case the same are not
concluded within the period of 2 years. The Apex Court in
the case of State of U.P. and others (supra) has earlier
examined this aspect and the nature of provisions of
<a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_39">Section 11-A</a> of the Act. In paragraph 5 of the report, the
Apex Court has very categorically held that in case the
proceedings      are   not   completed/concluded       by   way   of
passing an award within the period prescribed under
<a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_40">Section   11-A</a>    of   the   Act,    the   entire   proceedings   of
acquisition are to lapse. It will be appropriate to reproduce
the specific findings of the Apex Court in this respect
contained in paragraph 5 of the report, which reads as
under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           "5. Its bare reading indicates and emphasises
           the limitation within which the award should be
           made and has been statutorily determined,
           namely, the Collector shall make an award within
           a period of two years from the date of the
           publication of the declaration. It is common
           knowledge that after declaration was published,
           years used to roll by to make the award and the
           owners of the lands were put to great hardship.
           Parliament intended to relieve the owners of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                              13</span>




           lands from this hardship and pegging of the price
           prevailing as on date of publication of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_41">Section
           4(1)</a> notification. It is, therefore, a mandatory
           duty cast on the Land Acquisition Collector to
           make the award strictly in accordance with the
           limitation under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_42">Section 11-A</a>. If no award is
           made within that period, the entire proceedings
           for the acquisition of the land shall lapse. In
           other words, on expiry of two years from the
           date of the publication of the declaration unless
           the proviso is attracted, if no award is made in
           the meantime, in the eye of law the proceedings
           initiated under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_43">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act culminated
           in the declaration made under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_44">Section 6</a> shall
           stand lapsed and no proceedings, in the eye of
           law thereafter do exist, to take further action."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">Recently the Apex Court in the case of Delhi Airtech
Services Private Limited and another (supra) has
considered this provision specifically and has categorically
held in paragraph 161 of the report thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           "161. A bare reading of the above provision
           shows that the legislature places an obligation
           upon the Collector to make an award at the
           earliest. Wherever the award under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_45">Section 11</a>
           of the Act has not been made within two years
           from the date of publication of the declaration,
           the entire proceedings for acquisition of land
           shall lapse. The Explanation to <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_46">Section 11-A</a> of
           the Act further excludes from this period, any
           period during which any action or proceeding, to
           be taken in pursuance of the said declaration, is
           stayed by an order of a court which had been in
           force.     Exclusion of no other period is
           contemplated under this provision.       Thus, a
           definite intention of the framers of law is clear
           that the award should be made at the earliest
           and, in any case, within a maximum period of
           two years from the declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_47">Section 6</a>
           of the Act, if the acquisition proceedings are to
           survive."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">In view of the law laid-down by the Apex Court in the cases
aforesaid, it is clear that there is no safeguard of the
proceedings in case the same are not concluded within a
period of two years from the date of publication, except
those prescribed in <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_48">Section 11-A</a> of the Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                              14</span>




<p id="p_16">13.    Now the only question remains as to on what date
the award would be said to be passed. It is not disputed
that notification was issued on 15.06.1990.    It is also not
disputed that on 15.07.1992 the draft award was sent back
for signing of the authorities because the Commissioner was
not prepared to approve a draft award if it was not signed
by the authority concerned. If an award is required to be
passed even with the approval, the period of approval is
one part which is also included in the period prescribed
under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_49">Section 11-A</a> of the Act. It is no where said in this
Section that the period required for seeking approval of the
draft award is to be excluded from the period prescribed
under the aforesaid Section.      In specific words used in
<a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_50">Section 11-A</a> of the Act, it is said that the award should be
made within a period of two years.      What would be the
meaning of "making of award", has been considered by the
Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/600998/" id="a_51">Kaliyappan vs. State of Kerala
and others</a> (supra).      The Apex Court has categorically
held that 'to make an award' in this Section means 'sign the
award'. That is the ordinary meaning to be ascribed to the
words 'to make an award'. It is further held by the Apex
Court that the extended or different meaning assigned to
the word ' the date of the award' by the Apex Court in Raja
Harish Chandra case cannot be applied in the case of land
acquisition, since an extended or different meaning is
neither warranted by equity nor it will advance the object of
the statute. The distinction between the two provisions of
the Act namely <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_52">Section 11-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_53">Section 18</a> were also
considered by the Apex Court. In view of the annunciation
of law by the Apex Court in the aforesaid cases, the stand
as taken by the respondents cannot be accepted.       Firstly
the reliance placed by the respondents in the case of
Mohan and another (supra) is totally misconceived.
There the only question under consideration was what is the
meaning of declaration and whether a notification issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                              15</span>




under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_54">Section 6</a> of the Act is relevant or not. Since in the
case in hand the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_55">Section 4</a> and the
declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_56">Section 6</a> were published on one day in
the Gazette, the law laid-down by the Apex Court in the
aforesaid case would not be attracted at all. Similar is the
position with respect to the law laid-down by the Apex Court
in the case of Municipal          Corporation   of   Greater
Bombay (supra).      The issue before the Apex Court was
with respect to the change of requirement of public
purposes. Such is not the case in hand. Here the entire
case taken up by the petitioners is that the land was being
sought to be acquired for the purposes of establishing an
industrial area and not a single brick has been placed on it
till now. No use of the land has been made for the purposes
for which the land was sought to be acquired. The reliance
placed by the learned Government Advocate for the
respondents is, thus, totally misconceived looking to the
controversy involved in this case.
</p>

<p id="p_17">14.   In view of the law laid-down by the Apex Court and in
view of the facts as have come on record, which could not
be disputed or dislodged by the respondents, it is clear that
the award was passed after expiry of period of two years
prescribed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_57">Section 11-A</a> of the Act
and in terms of unequivocal provisions made in the Section,
the entire proceedings for acquisition of the land lapsed on
expiry of the period of two years.        The land of the
petitioners could not be said to be acquired under the
impugned notification by virtue of the impugned award
because of the said bar.
</p>

<p id="p_18">15.   Another question raised by the learned Senior Counsel
for the petitioners as formulated is whether there was any
occasion for invoking power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_58">Section 17</a> of the Act.
<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_59">Section 17</a> of the Act specifically prescribed special powers
in case of emergency to be exercised by the Land

           occupier thereof at least forty-eight hours' notice
           of his intention so to do, or such longer notice as

</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">16.   Learned   Senior   Counsel   for   the   petitioners   has
emphatically contended that the law is well settled in this
respect where it has been specifically provided that in the
given circumstances the power should be exercised as an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                 18</span>




exception and not generally. It is contended by the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioners that the notification
nowhere depicts the reasons as to why emergent powers
were being exercised. As have been quoted herein above,
it was stated by the petitioners that in the year 1986 the
application was made by respondent No.2 for grant of a no
objection certificate for the purposes of establishing the
industrial area within the Urban Agglomeration before the
competent      authority   of    Directorate,   Housing      and
Environment Department.         In 1988 even when no no
objection certificate was issued by the Housing and
Environment Department, only on the basis of no objection
certificate granted by the Director of Town &amp; Country
Planning, Bhopal, an application was submitted proposing
acquisition of land in dispute.      The proceedings were not
immediately initiated on such a request and the respondent
No.2 was called upon to submit the no objection certificate.
There   were     certain   discrepancies    with   respect    to
mentioning of the land, boundary of Khasra numbers and
the partition lines of land, which were not available on the
plan so submitted for acquisition of the land.               The
proceeding in that respect were done and on 15.06.1990
only the notification was published in the Gazette for the
purposes of acquisition of land.       It is contended by the
learned Senior Counsel that looking to necessity and need
of respondent No.2, there was no reason to invoke
emergent powers prescribed under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_70">Section 17</a> of the Act.
Further, such an action of the respondents was not justified
in view of the fact that there was no such declaration made
in the notification so issued under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_71">Section 6</a> of the Act, as
was required to be done in view of the provisions of sub-
section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_72">Section 17</a> of the Act. Thus, there was a fault
on the part of the respondents in issuing the notification/
declaration and that there was no justified reason shown as
to how and why emergent powers were being exercised.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                      19</span>




<p id="p_20">17.     Drawing    attention    of    this   Court      to    the   specific
pleadings in paragraph 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 of the writ
petition,    learned   Senior        Counsel      for   the    petitioners
contended that if these facts are taken into account, it will
be clear that there was no requirement of exercise of
emergent powers conferred under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_73">Section 17</a> of the Act. To
this extent, there is no specific reply except that there was
no requirement of seeking no objection certificate from
Housing and Environment Department. It is contended on
the basis of the pleadings of the respondents with respect
to aforesaid paras in their return that nothing satisfactorily
was explained as to why such a matter was kept pending
and if that was the period required for making up the mind
for initiating the process of acquisition of land, why not the
sufficient time was provided for raising objection as
prescribed under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_74">Section 5-A</a> of the Act as was necessary.
Further it is contended by the learned Senior Counsel that
since the proceedings were not completed within the
stipulated period prescribed under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_75">Section 11-A</a> of the Act,
it is clear that there was no need of invoking emergent
power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_76">Section 17</a> of the Act. Placing reliance on the
case of <a href="/doc/1992267/" id="a_77">Dev Sharan and others vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh and others</a>, (2011) 4 SCC 769, it is contended
that in view of the law laid-down by the Apex Court, the
slow process of action taken by the respondents itself was
enough to show that there was no urgency for acquiring the
land so as to warrant invoking <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_78">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act. Had
it not been done, the petitioners would have raised their
objections, which were required to be considered in
appropriate manner. Further, placing reliance in the case of
Radhy Shyam (dead) <a href="/doc/1002007/" id="a_79">Through LRS and others vs.
State of Uttar Pradesh and others</a>, (2011) 5 SCC 553,
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners contended that
the latest view expressed by the Apex Court is that even
fast action of development in any case cannot be said to be
a     sufficient   cause   or   reason       or   satisfaction      of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                20</span>




Government for invoking the powers under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_80">Section 17(1)</a> of
the Act. If the private property is sought to be acquired, not
for genuine purpose at all, the said exercise of power is
vitiated due to malafides or the authorities concerned did
not apply their mind to the relevant facts and the records.
Thus, it is contended that looking to such conduct of the
respondents in taking steps for acquisition all of a sudden,
the power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_81">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act was not required
to be invoked.   Lastly, learned Senior Counsel has placed
his reliance in the case of <a href="/doc/245444/" id="a_82">Devendra Singh and others
vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others</a>, (2011) 9 SCC
551 and has contended that the latest annunciation of law
by the Apex Court makes it clear that the public purpose by
itself shall not justify the exercise of power of eliminating an
enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_83">Section 5-A</a> of the Act in terms of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_84">Section
17(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_85">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act. These facts are to be
taken note of, the conduct is required to be examined and
then it is to be held whether such a power was rightly
exercised or not.      It is contended that in the given
circumstances as have come on record of this case, there
was no purpose of acquiring the land by invoking emergent
power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_86">Section 17</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_21">18.   To this, learned Government Advocate has contended
that the purpose for which acquisition has been done is
paramount and it is demonstrated that such a purpose
would be defeated in case emergent powers are not
exercised. Placing again reliance in the case of Municipal
Corporation of Greater Bombay (supra), it is contended
that for the purpose of acquisition of land for industrial
development, if such power is exercised, it cannot be said
that act done by the respondents, power exercised by them,
was unjustified. Again it is contended that because of the
lapses, the judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_87">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India is not warranted.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                21</span>




<p id="p_22">19.   Such a submission of learned Government Advocate is
liable to be rejected outrightly.    First of all it was to be
demonstrated by the respondents that there was acute
need of exercising the emergent power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_88">Section 17</a> of
the Act. True it is that the official machinery takes its own
time in moving the files from one place to another but that
official function is to carry out the provisions of law as well.
It was to be kept in mind by the respondent State that if the
land of private individuals are required to be acquired for
any purpose of industrial development, the State was
required to take appropriate steps speedily. It was not open
to the respondent State to say that whatever time was
required for making up the mind for issuance of notification,
has to be ignored and since they have made up the mind,
the State is free to exercise powers under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_89">Section 17</a> of the
Act. It is to be seen that when the emergent powers are
exercised under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_90">Section 17</a> of the Act, raising an objection
and hearing on the said objection is required to be taken
away on a cogent and germane ground.            If reasons are
spelled in such manner as has been done in the present
case, this Court is afraid that if such actions are given
stamp of approval, it will confer dictatorship and dictatorial
powers on the State ignoring the provisions of the law. This
cannot be done by a Court of law.
</p>
<p id="p_23">20.   The Apex Court has considered these aspects in the
case of Deo Sharan and others (supra) and has very
categorically, after examining each and every fact, has held
that lapses on this ground cannot be permitted to go on. It
is rightly said by the Apex Court that the manner in which
decisions were taken for publication of notifications under
<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_91">Section 4(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_92">Section 6</a> and a notification under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_93">Section
17</a> of the Act, were in gross negligence of the respondents-
authorities and on account of such a reason, it could not be
said that the right of hearing was rightly taken away as per
the provisions of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_94">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act. The Apex Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                               22</span>




in case of Radhy Shyam (dead) Through LRS and
others (supra) has categorically culled out the principles,
which are required to be followed in case of exercise of
emergent powers as have been mentioned in paragraph 77
of the report, which reads thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">           "77. From the analysis of the relevant statutory
           provisions and interpretation thereof by this
           Court in different cases, the following principles
           can be culled out :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">           (i)   Eminent domain is a right inherent in every
           sovereign to take and appropriate property
           belonging to citizens for public use. To put it
           differently, the sovereign is entitled to reassert
           its dominion over any portion of the soil of the
           State including private property without its
           owner's consent provided that such assertion is
           on account of public exigency and for public
           good - <a href="/doc/1880952/" id="a_95">Dwarkadas Shrinivas v. Sholapur Spg</a>.

           Union of India and <a href="/doc/1515136/" id="a_96">Jilubhai Nanbhai v. State of
           Gujarat</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">           (ii) The    legislations  which     provide    for
           compulsory acquisition of private property by the
           State fall in the category of expropriatory
           legislation and such legislation must be
           construed strictly - <a href="/doc/1119469/" id="a_97">DLF Qutab Enclave Complex
           Educational Charitable Trust v. State of Haryana</a>,

           Sharan v. State of U.P</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">           (iii) Though, in exercise of the power of eminent
           domain, the Government can acquire the private
           property for public purpose, it must be
           remembered that compulsory taking of one's
           property is a serious matter. If the property
           belongs to economically disadvantaged segment
           of the society or people suffering from other
           handicaps, then the court is not only entitled but
           is duty-bound to scrutinise the action/decision of
           the State with greater vigilance, care and
           circumspection keeping in view the fact that the
           landowner is likely to become landless and
           deprived of the only source of his livelihood and/
           or shelter.</blockquote>

<p id="p_24">           (iv) The property of a citizen cannot be
           acquired by the State and/or its agencies/
           instrumentalities without complying with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                   23</span>




mandate of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_100">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_101">5-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_102">6</a> of the Act. A
public purpose, however, laudable it may be
does not entitle the State to invoke the urgency
provisions because the same have the effect of
depriving the owner of his right to property
without being heard. Only in a case of real
urgency, the State can invoke the urgency
provisions and dispense with the requirement of
hearing the landowner or other interested
persons.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(v) <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_103">Section 17(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_104">Section 17(4)</a>
confers extraordinary power upon the State to
acquire private property without complying with
the mandate of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_105">Section 5-A</a>. These provisions
can be invoked only when the purpose of
acquisition cannot brook the delay of even a few
weeks or months. Therefore, before excluding
the application of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_106">Section 5-A</a>, the authority
concerned must be fully satisfied that time of
few weeks or authority concerned must be fully
satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely
to be taken in conducting inquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_107">Section
5-A</a> will, in all probability, frustrate the public
purpose for which land is proposed to be
acquired.
</p>
<p id="p_26">(vi) The satisfaction of the Government on the
issue of urgency is subjective but is a condition
precedent to the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_108">Section
17(1)</a> and the same can be challenged on the
ground that the purpose for which the private
property is sought to be acquired is not a public
purpose at all or that the exercise of power is
vitiated due to mala fides or that the authorities
concerned did not apply their mind to the
relevant factors and the records.
</p>
<p id="p_27">(vii) The exercise of power by the Government
under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_109">Section 17(1)</a> does not necessarily result
in exclusion of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_110">Section 5-A</a> of the Act in terms of
which any person interested in land can file
objection and is entitled to be heard in support of
his objection. The use of word "may" in sub-
section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_111">Section 17</a> makes it clear that it
merely enables the Government to direct that
the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_112">Section 5-A</a> would not apply to
the cases covered under sub-section (1) or (2) of
<a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_113">Section 17</a>. In other words, invoking of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_114">Section
17(4)</a> is not a necessary concomitant of the
exercise of power under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_115">Section 17(1)</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                              24</span>




<p id="p_28">          (viii) The acquisition of land for residential,
          commercial, industrial or institutional purposes
          can be treated as an acquisition for public
          purposes within the meaning of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_116">Section 4</a> but
          that, by itself, does not justify the exercise of
          power by the Government under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_117">Sections 17(1)</a>
          and/or 17(4). The court can take judicial notice
          of the fact that planning, execution and
          implementation of the schemes relating to
          development       of    residential,  commercial,
          industrial or institutional areas usually take few
          years. Therefore, the private property cannot be
          acquired for such purpose by invoking the
          urgency provision contained in <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_118">Section 17(1)</a>. In
          any case, exclusion of the rule of audi alteram
          partem embodied in <a href="/doc/1229923/" id="a_119">Sections 5-A(1)</a> and (2) is
          not at all warranted in such matters.
</p>
<p id="p_29">          (ix) If land is acquired for the benefit of private
          persons, the court should view the invoking of
          <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_120">Sections 17(1)</a> and/or 17(4) with suspicion and
          carefully scrutinise the relevant record before
          adjudicating    upon    the    legality  of    such
          acquisition."
</p>
<p id="p_30">Lastly, the law laid-down in case of Devendra Singh and
others (supra), the Apex Court has categorically held in
paragraphs 18, 20 and 21 the very same object and
purpose and the scope of exercising the power under the
aforesaid provisions. The aforesaid paras of the report read
thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">          "18. In view of the above it is well settled that
          acquisition of the land for public purpose by itself
          shall not justify the exercise of power of
          eliminating enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_121">Section 5-A</a> in terms of
          <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_122">Section 17(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_123">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act. The
          Court should take judicial notice of the fact that
          certain public purpose such as development of
          residential, commercial, industrial or institutional
          areas by their intrinsic nature and character
          contemplates       planning,     execution      and
          implementation of the schemes which generally
          takes time of few years. Therefore, the land
          acquisition for the said public purpose does not
          justify the invoking of urgency provisions under
          the Act.</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">          20. Moreover, in Dev Sharan case the
          acquisition of land for construction of new
          District Jail, since the old jail was overcrowded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                   25</span>




and causing hardships including health and
hygiene concerns to the inmates, by invoking the
urgency provisions under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_124">Section 17</a> was
quashed on the ground that the government
machinery had functioned at a very slow pace in
processing the acquisition which clearly evinces
that there was no urgency to exclude the
application of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_125">Section 5-A</a> of the Act. The Court
further observed :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">     "35. From the various facts disclosed in the
     said affidavit it appears that the matter

     and <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_127">Section 17</a> notifications. A meeting for
     selection of a suitable site for construction
     was held on 27-6-2008, and the proposal
     for such acquisition and construction was
     sent to the Director, Land Acquisition on
     2-7-2008. This was in turn forwarded to
     the State Government by the Director on
     22-7-2008. After due consideration of the
     forwarded proposal and documents, the
     State Government issued <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_128">Section 4</a>
     notification,  along    with    <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_129">Section    17</a>
     notification on 21-8-2008.             These

     Acquisition on 19-6-2009. The Director in

     Government finally issued the <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_131">Section 6</a>
     declaration on 10-8-2009. This declaration
     was published in the local dailies on

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">     37. Thus the time which elapsed between

     at which the government machinery had
     functioned in processing the acquisition,
     clearly evinces that there was no urgency

<p id="p_32">21. In the facts and circumstances of the
present case, it is clear that the district of Jyotiba
Phule Nagar was created in the year 1997 which
was, however, dissolved and recreated in 2004.
The District Magistrate, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, had
sent a proposal to the Principal Secretary, Home/
Prisons, Government of U.P. for acquisition of
land for the construction of District Jail on
24-1-2003 which is undoubtedly a public
purpose. After the lapse of 5 years, in the year
2008, the State Government asked the District
Magistrate to trace the availability of lands for
acquisition for construction of the District Jail in
the proximity to district headquarters and further
requested      the    Selection    Committee        to
recommend the land suitable for the said
purpose. Thereafter, the Selection Committee
recommended the acquisition of the said land as
suitable for the construction of the jail but it took
two years for the State Government to issue the
said notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_143">Section 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_144">Section 6</a>
respectively, thereby invoking the urgency
provisions under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_145">Section 17</a> of the Act. The
series of events shows lethargy and lackadaisical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                  27</span>




            attitude of the State Government. In the light of
            the above circumstances, the respondents are
            not justified in invoking the urgency provisions
            under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_146">Section 17</a> of the Act, thereby depriving
            the appellants of their valuable right to raise
            objections and opportunity of hearing before the
            authorities in order to persuade them that their
            property may not be acquired."
</p>
<p id="p_33">21.   Thus, it is clear that there was no need of exercising
emergent power under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_147">Section 17</a> of the Act, specially when
the land acquired has not yet been utilized for any purpose
of industrial development. When asked, it is contended by
learned Government Advocate that the land is reserved only
for the extension of the industrial area in future.       By no
stretch of imagination could it be said that the land of the
petitioners within the Urban Agglomeration is to be kept
reserved for industrial development. If the residential area
is to be increased in that particular portion, rather it would
be necessary for the respondent State to shift the industrial
area away from Urban Agglomeration. Keeping large piece
of land only for the purpose of development of industrial
area, whereas in future there is a requirement of shifting
the industrial area away from Urban Agglomeration, cannot
be said to be a wise decision of the State Government.
Thus, on such lame excuses if the emergent power was
exercised by the State Government even in the year 1990
or 1992, it cannot be said to be correct and proper action of
the respondents.      Such an action is not required to be
approved but since the entire proceedings are already to be
treated as lapsed on account of passing of award after
expiry of period prescribed under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_148">Section 11-A</a> of the Act,
no specific order is required to be passed on this issue.
</p>

<p id="p_34">22.   The last question which is required to be considered is
whether the purpose for which the land was acquired still
subsists.     Since   it   has   been   found   that   industrial
development in particular area was sought for, no objection
certificate to this effect was issued by the Director, Town
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                28</span>




and Country Planning only to the effect that in case the land
is acquired only for the purpose of expansion of industrial
area of Govindpura, the Directorate had no objection to this
effect but separate no objection certificate required from
other authorities may be obtained, it was necessary for the
respondents to make use of the land for the purposes of
industrial development.      It was nowhere stated in the
notification that the land shown to be acquired is to be kept
reserved for the purposes of expansion of industrial area in
future. At bar it has been categorically contended by the
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners that not a single
brick has been placed on the land so acquired, though it
remained in possession of the respondents right from the
date of passing of the award, for the purpose of establishing
any industry, it is clear that the land of petitioners was
acquired but for no real purpose, what to call a public
purpose.     Had it not been so, the land would have been
utilized properly.    Such acquisition of the land of the
petitioners, thus, cannot be given an approval by this Court.
The award to the said extent is still bad in law.
</p>
<p id="p_35">23.   Now the serious objection is taken with respect to
maintainability of petition on account of delay and laches as
also on the ground that the issue in relation to particular
award was considered by this Court and an order was
passed in the case of Charan Singh and others (supra).
Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has contended
that the respondents were well aware of the proceedings,
which were initiated as the earlier writ petition filed by
Charan Singh and others against the award was disposed of
by this Court. Taking this Court to the document annexed
to the rejoinder as Annexure RJ-1, learned Senior Counsel
for the petitioners contended that W.P. No.398/1997 was
initially filed challenging the award. Leaving aside all such
grounds raised by the petitioners in that case, they
restricted   their   claim   only   to   one   aspect   that   a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                              29</span>




representation has been made before the respondents-
authorities for denotifying the land so acquired, under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/983800/" id="a_149">Section 48(1)</a> of the Act and since such a
representation is not decided, the respondents-authorities
be directed to decide the said representation.          It is
contended that this Court vide order dated 10.10.2000
disposed of the writ petition with a direction to decide the
representation of the petitioners by the end of December,
2000. An M.C.C. was filed seeking extension of time by the
respondents and since the time was extended by this Court,
ultimately the representation made by Charan Singh and
others was rejected.    This rejection order was called in
question in W.P. No.2986/2002, which came to be decided
on 01.07.2002.   Reading opening paragraph of this order,
placed on record as Annexure R-1 along with the return of
the respondents, learned Senior Counsel has pointed out
that the petition was for challenging the order dated
29.04.2002 passed by the Principal Secretary refusing to
denotify the   land, which was acquired for industrial
purposes way back in the year 1990.          Learned Senior
Counsel further contended that the only issue raised before
the Court was whether the rejection of the representation of
the petitioners in that case was just or not. Whether the
award was rightly made or not, whether the proceedings
were saved despite the fact that as per provision of <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_150">Section
11-A</a> of the Act the same were not concluded within a
period of 2 years from the date of publication of the
notification and whether the purposes for which the land
was acquired is still subsist or not, were not at all issues
before this Court when the writ petition aforesaid was
decided.   Learned Senior Counsel has contended that the
law is well settled on this issue that in case a particular
issue is neither raised nor decided, the decision against the
same order/award would not become operative as res
judicata. It is contended that this being the situation, such
an order is not a bar and this court has still power to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                               30</span>




judicially review the conduct of the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_36">24.   There is much force in the submissions made by the
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners.         In the writ
petition of Charan Singh &amp; others (supra), the question was
never raised with respect to the lapse of the proceedings of
acquisition on account of not completing the same within
the period of two years from the date of publication of
notification as is required under <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_151">Section 11-A</a> of the Act.
Even if that issue was raised, the same was foregone and
the writ petition earlier filed in the year 1997 was disposed
of with a direction to decide the representation for
denotifying the land of the petitioners in that case. Apart
from that, there was no adjudication of the said issue at the
relevant time.   The Court itself has recorded that if the
petitioners in that case are serious for assailing the
acquisition, they should have raised the question when
earlier writ petition was filed. It makes it clear that there
was no adjudication of the grounds raised by the petitioners
in the present writ petition by this Court in the writ petition
of Charan Singh &amp; others (supra) and, therefore, such an
objection raised by the respondents cannot be sustained.
Further if the award was a nullity in the eye of law, delay in
filing petition will not come in the way of petitioners and as
such this objection is also to be ignored.

<p id="p_37">25.   Now the question would be whether the proceedings
can be quashed in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_152">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India setting free the land of the
petitioners only from the acquisition. This has to be seen
that there were no objections by others, whose lands were
acquired, and those who have file the objections, have not
challenged the orders before this Court.     Thus, who have
accepted the compensation of the land so acquired and
have chosen not to challenge such action, are not to be
benefited or not to be granted any advantage of this order

      simply because they are not before this Court.               The
      petitioners are the only persons, who have come against
      the acquisition of their land and have said that as far as
      acquisition of their land is concerned, the proceedings are
      lapsed and such relief can still be granted by this Court in
      exercise of its powers. The lands which have been vested
      in the State Government on payment of compensation and
      in respect of which no claims have been made before this
      Court, are not going to be affected by this order.
</p>
<p id="p_38">      26.   Since all the questions formulated are answered in
      affirmation in favour of the petitioners, this writ petition
      deserves to be and is hereby allowed.         The acquisition
      proceedings, in so far as the land of the petitioners is
      concerned, initiated vide notifications dated 15.06.1990
      (Annexure P-9 and P-10) and the award said to be passed
      on 06.09.1993 are hereby quashed.           The land of the
      petitioners be declared to be released from such acquisition
      proceedings. The respondents are directed to restore the
      possession of the petitioners over the land for all purposes.
      Looking to the circumstances that the petitioners have not
      initiated the proceedings at appropriate time after the
      acquisition in the year 1992-93, it is not justified to grant
      them any compensation. However, the petitioners will get
      the cost of this petition, if pre-certified, to the tune of
      Rs.25,000/-.
