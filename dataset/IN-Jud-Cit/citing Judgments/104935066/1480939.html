 Original Application No.80 of 2009
and Application No.409 of 2009
P.JYOTHIMANI,J.
</pre><p id="p_1">	The applicant is stated to be a company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, involved in teaching Arithmetic through Abacus and Mental Computation methods and other child development programs to children to enhance the learning and memory power through specialized methods of teaching.  The applicant is implementing the said object through a network of franchisees all over India using its own technical know-how and intellectual property.  It is stated that, all over India, the applicant has 22 Master Franchisees with 1000 Unit Franchisees/learning centers with more than one lakh students.  The methodology used by the applicant is stated to be unique and the applicant itself is affiliated to the Malaysian Abacus Mental Arithmetic Association, Malaysia and Zhejiang Abacus Association, China and is stated to be the first of its kind in India.  It is also stated that the applicant is also a member of Franchising Association of India and the petitioner is popularly called as 'Aloha India'.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. According to the applicant, the applicant has acquired exclusive right over the course programs.  It is stated that the applicant has appointed the respondent as Unit Franchisee in the State of Maharashtra for the course program 'Aloha Mental Arithmetic' under an agreement dated 1.9.2007, which is for a period of three years.  As per the said agreement, the applicant being a Company or its Master Franchisees or its agents alone shall conduct the examinations and the respondent, being a Unit Franchisee, has to conduct only the company's course and utilize only the materials provided by the applicant and market the company's courses.  In the said agreement, there is a clause stating that the respondent, being a Unit Franchisee, shall not be interested or concerned in any undertaking or business, which is similar in nature or being deceptively similar or passing off as that of the company, during the term of agreement and up to sixty months after the termination of the agreement, which is for a period of three years.  There is also a clause for arbitration in case of dispute, which shall be at Chennai.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. The complaint of the applicant is that a parent from Nasik  one Mrs.Swapnaja Prabhune has written a letter to the effect that she saw the respondent's staff counseling for one of the parents of Aloha that the admission of the child may be transferred from Aloha to Master Mind.  It is also stated that one Mr.Razzak Shaith, on behalf of the Master Franchisee of Maharashtra, has inspected the centre run by the respondent and has stated that the learning centre is being run by the respondent under the name of Aloha banner outside  the premises and the respondent is actually promoting the name of Master Mind.  Therefore, the grievance of the applicant is that, by using the Unit Franchisee agreement, the respondent is actually acting against the terms of the agreement, since the intellectual property, which exclusively belongs to the applicant, is being misused and by virtue of the terms in the agreement, the respondent is prohibited from using the same in any method which is deceptively similar.  The applicant also relied upon two receipts stated to have been issued by the respondent, one in the name of Master Mind Abacus and another in the name of Aloha India in respect of a candidate.  In these circumstances, the applicant, who intends to invoke the arbitration clause, has filed the O.A.No.80 of 2009 for granting an order of injunction restraining the respondent from conducting business which is similar and in contravention to the agreement dated 1.9.2007 and another application in Application No.409 of 2009 for appointment of an Advocate Commissioner to visit the learning centre of the respondent at Uday Bungalow, 1371/C, Kanheri Wadi, Near Sivaji Udayan, Nasik-422 001 to collect the course materials, receipts, bill book, pamphlets bearing the name of Master Mind or Aloha Mastermind and submit a report.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. This Court, by order dated 3.2.2009, has granted an order of interim injunction against the respondent from conducting business which is similar and in contravention to the agreement dated 1.9.2007 for a period of eight weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. The respondent has filed a counter affidavit in which it is stated that the said clause, which is relied upon by the applicant, is opposed to <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_2">Section 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act.  Since the agreement has been terminated by the letter of the respondent dated 7.2.2009 and the same has been confirmed by the applicant on 16.2.2009, the restriction cannot continue.  It is further stated that this Court has no territorial jurisdiction since the agreement was entered into between the parties at Nasik, in the State of Maharashtra and the alleged breach has been effected at Nasik and no part of the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court.  It is also stated that the contract was a tripartite agreement, and without making Aloha in Maharashtra, which is the Master Franchisee, as a party these applications, as such, are not maintainable and are liable to be dismissed for non-joinder of necessary parties.  It is stated that it is the respondent who has brought out the very concept on behalf of the applicant in the area, namely at Nasik.  It is also stated that Abacus is a tool which simplifies the method of Arithmetic and the same has been in existence time immemorial, which relates back to 2000 B.C. in China.  It is the case of the respondent that Aloha in Maharashtra, which is the Master Franchisee of the State of Maharashtra, run by one Mr.Srinivasan, to whom the respondent has paid the amount, has directed the respondent to conduct classes and it was based on that the applicant has appointed the respondent as an Unit Franchisee and the entire transaction took place at Nasik in the State of Maharashtra and never at Chennai.  It is also the case of the respondent that the contents of the agreement were not made known to the respondent and she was made to sign and in any event, the restrictive clauses contained in the said agreement  offend <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_3">Section 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act.  In respect of the alleged complaint of a parent, it is the case of the respondent that the said Mrs.Swapnaja Prabhune approached her for No Objection Letter in favour of her child, to get her child transferred from the Unit Franchisee of the respondent to some other Unit Franchisee of the applicant and it was in those circumstances, the respondent has directed her to admit her child in Dwaraka Centre, which is an Unit Franchisee of the applicant and thereafter, the No Objection Letter was given and therefore, it was a bona fide act.  The transfer of children to Master Mind is also denied by the respondent.  It is also denied that one Mr.Razzak Shaith has inspected her centre, apart from stating that he has no authority.  If really the applicant was suspicious about the respondent, the Master Franchisee should have alone been directed and not third parties. The respondent also denies that she is carrying on or promoting a competitive business. It is also denied that the respondent has started any other business similar in nature to that of the applicant during the subsistence of the franchisee agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6. It is the contention of Ms.N.Devi, the learned counsel for the applicant that, as per the clause in the agreement, an arbitrator has been appointed.  It is also not in dispute that the respondent has resigned as the Course Instructor for the Mental Arithmetic Program and Speed Maths Program as per the letter dated 7.2.2009.  She would rely upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_4">Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Co</a>., [1995] 5 SCC 545, apart from the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/987785/" id="a_5">Vivekananda English Academy &amp; Others v. Amoha Education Pvt. Ltd. and another</a>, 2005 [31] PTC 266 (Mad) . 
</p>
<p id="p_7">	7. On the other hand, Mr.V.Manohar, learned counsel for the respondent would submit that the applicant has filed these applications on vague allegations, without any substantial truth or materials.  It is also his contention that it is not as if imparting instruction through specialized methods is the whole domain of the applicant, the method was already available and in use and inasmuch as the applicant is not the owner of the methodology used, the injunction, as such, is not maintainable.  He would also submit that under <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_6">Section 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act such clause, which is putting a total embargo on the right of the respondent to carry on business or trade, is void.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	8. On a reference to the documents, it is clear that the franchisee agreement is a tripartite agreement in which apart from the applicant and the respondent, there is a Master Franchisee of the State of Maharashtra.   The application is filed on the basis that the applicant has exclusive licence to promote and market the specialized method of teaching Arithmetic and that exclusive licence has been obtained under an agreement with ALOHA Mental Arithmetic Sdn Bhd, a company incorporated in Malaysia.  Under general clauses of the agreement entered into between the parties dated 1.9.2007, in clause XIII (A) it is stated as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_9">"The Unit Franchisee shall not for any reason whatsoever communicate directly to the parent company at Malaysia ie., Aloha Mental Arithmetic Sdn Bhd, and further assures the Company that all its communications shall be addressed solely to the Company."
</p>
<p id="p_10">	9. In one of the clauses in the agreement, namely Clause XIV (S), it is stated as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_11">"The Unit Franchisee shall not be interested or concerned in any undertaking or business, which is similar in nature or being deceptively similar or passing off to that of the Company, during the term of this Agreement and up to 60 (Sixty) months after the termination of this Agreement; For any such breach in this clause the Unit Franchisee agrees to pay the Company a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) towards liquidated damages."
</p>
<p id="p_12">	10. After the termination of the contract, the applicant, as per the arbitration clause, which is clause XVIII (B),  appointed the Sole Arbitrator. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">	11. In the meantime, the application for injunction itself has been filed based on a letter of one of the parents  Mrs.Swapnaja Prabhune dated 17.12.2008, in which she has informed by way of a communication to the applicant that the respondent is changing her child's admission.  The case of the respondent in the counter affidavit in that regard is that the said parent wanted her child to be admitted in a nearby franchisee of the applicant at Dwaraka Centre and this has been confirmed by the endorsement made by the Master Franchisee of the State of Maharashtra at the backside of the said letter dated 17.12.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	12. There is one letter of Mr.Razzak Shaith dated 18.12.2008 addressed to the applicant wherein he has stated that when he visited the respondent's place, some other person, who was in the centre, was giving particulars only about Master Mind courses and not about Aloha courses.  In the circumstances that the respondent has come forward in the counter affidavit clearly denying the said allegation and especially when it is not in dispute that such enquiry was not conducted in the presence of the respondent and after giving opportunity to the respondent to explain, the apprehension of the applicant about the conduct of the respondent is not having any prima facie basis.
</p>

<p id="p_15">	13. Further, after the termination of the agreement between the applicant and the respondent and their relationship came to an end in February, 2009, as to whether the restriction imposed under the agreement is hit by <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_7">Section 27</a> of the Indian Contract Act is a matter to be decided only in the context of liquidated damages to which the applicant may be eligible, which is the exclusive domain of the Arbitral Tribunal.  In fact, the validity of such clause putting a restriction in the right of lawful  trade or business came to be elaborately discussed by the Supreme Court in  <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_8">Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Co</a>., [1995] 5 SCC 545.  It was held by the Supreme Court that in respect of a contract any restraint of trade during the operational period of contract is admissible and the said restraint is to be restricted after the termination of contract. The Supreme Court has held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_16">"A stipulation in a contract which is intended for advancement of trade shall not be regarded as being in restraint of trade.  Similarly, except in cases where the contract is wholly one sided, normally the doctrine of restraint of trade is not attracted in cases where the restriction is to operate during the period the contract is subsisting and it applies in respect of a restriction which operates after the termination of the contract.  The underlying principle governing contracts in restraint of trade is the same and as a matter of fact the courts take a more restricted and less favourable view in respect of a covenant entered into between an employer and an employee as compared to a covenant between a vendor and a purchaser or partnership agreements."
</p>

<p id="p_17">	14. <a href="/doc/987785/" id="a_9">In Vivekananda English Academy &amp; Others v. Amoha Education Pvt. Ltd. and another</a>, 2005 [31] PTC 266 (Mad), even though the Division Bench of this Court has held, on the facts and circumstances of that case, that there was no restraint of trade, it has categorically explained the principles to be followed while granting an order of injunction in such matters by following the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_10">Wander Ltd. v. Antox India P. Ltd</a>., 1991 PTC 1 (SC), as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_18">"19. While considering the grant of an interim order, we have to bear in mind the principles laid down by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_11">Wander Ltd. v. Antox India P. Ltd</a>., 1991 PTC 1 (SC):1990 (Supp) SCC 727 wherein it is held that an interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status-quo and if such an order is not granted, the plaintiff could not be adequately compensated in terms of damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial.  The need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against the injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated."
</p>
<p id="p_19">	15. Therefore, the yardstick for the purpose of granting interim injunction is that the damage which may be caused by allowing the respondent to proceed cannot be adequately compensated.  In the present case, in clause XIV(S), which is enumerated above, it is made clear that in case of any breach an amount of compensation of Rs.5 Lakhs has been quantified as liquidated damages.  Therefore, it is not as if the applicant cannot be compensated, even assuming that there has been any breach by the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	16. Further, in the absence of any concrete material to conclude that the applicant is the exclusive owner of the said unique method of teaching Arithmetic or the respondent is actually using the materials of the applicant and diverting the business of the applicant in the concerned area, viz., Nasik, it is not possible to presume that the respondent has committed breach.  In any event, the applicant can always be compensated in the event of the Arbitrator deciding the issue.  The Arbitrator, during the course of enquiry, can even pass an interim award, if he is satisfied that the applicant's interest must be protected.
</p>
<p id="p_21">	In such view of the matter, the applications stand dismissed and the order of injunction granted by this Court on 3.2.2009 stands vacated.
