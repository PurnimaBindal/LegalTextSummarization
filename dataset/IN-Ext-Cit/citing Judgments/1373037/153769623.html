<p id="p_1"> 1.               This Letters Patent Appeal is directed challenging the

 decision given by learned Single Judge of this Court, dated

 Deputy Collector, Land Reforms, Latur in File No.90/TN/0/8,

 dated 26.11.1991, petition under Section 98 of Hyderabad

 Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred as

 Hyderabad Tenancy Act in short) for summary eviction, and order

 of Member, Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal, dated 4.12.1997,

 passed in Appeal No.102/A/91/L.             This Letters Patent Appeal is

 disposed of along with Letters Patent Appeal No.90/2013.


</p><p id="p_2"> 2.               Appellants claim to be owners of the disputed land

 Survey No.116 (Gat No.304) to the extent of 12 acres and 2

 gunthas, situated at village Mahapur, Taluka and District Latur.

 The claim of respondent No.1 is as tenant of the disputed land.


</p><p id="p_3"> 3.               Undisputedly, respondent No.1 filed an application

 under Section 8 of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act before the

 Tahsildar, Latur, seeking declaration that he is tenant over the

 land in question.

<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5"> 4.               In that proceeding, the appellants were impleaded as

 respondents and the said proceeding ultimately came to be

 decided in favour of respondent No.1 Gurling. The order passed

 by Tahsildar was confirmed by learned Member, Maharashtra

 Revenue Tribunal as well as by this Court in Writ Petition

 No.221/1990. Against that decision, appellants preferred Letters

 Patent Appeal No.90/2013, which is also disposed by this Court

 today, but by passing separate judgment. Thus, present position

 is that, respondent No.1 is held to be tenant over the disputed

 land.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7"> 5.               The learned counsel for respondent No. 1 submitted

 that the appeal itself is not maintainable in view of clause 15 of

 Letters Patent and in view of the fact that the writ petition was

 filed by the present appellants against the decision of M.R.T.,

 Tribunal, over which this Court has power of superintendence.

 The learned counsel for respondent placed reliance on the

 observations made by this Court (Division Bench) in the case

 reported as Jagannath Vs. Gulabrao [1965 Mh.L.J. 426] and

 also subsequent orders made by this Court in various matters.

 The learned counsel for respondent submitted that right from the

 year 1965, this Court has consistently held that writ petition filed

 against the order of M.R.T. needs to be treated as petition under

 <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of Constitution of India and when learned Single

 Judge decides such petition, it needs to be presumed that the

 order was made by the learned Single Judge in exercise of power

 of superintendence and so, letters patent appeal does not lie. The

 learned        counsel        for   appellants    placed     reliance        on     the

 observations made by full bench of this Court in two cases

 reported as Jagdish Balwantrao Abhyankar and Ors. Vs.

 State of Maharashtra and Ors. [AIR 1994 Bombay 141]

 and Advani Oerlikon Ltd. Vs. Machindra Govind Makasare

 226</a> of the Constitution of India against the order of Court or

 subject to the power of superintendence of this Court. It is laid

 down that in some cases same subject can be considered under

 Articles 226 and 227 of Constitution of India. In second case, of

 Adwani (cited supra), the Full Bench of this Court has made

               the Supreme Court held that the appeal before the
               Division Bench was maintainable. A similar position
               arose in the decision of the Supreme Court in
               <a href="/doc/1373037/" id="a_26">M.M.T.C.        vs.        Commissioner    of    Commercial           Tax</a>
               (supra). The Division Bench of the High Court had
               held that since the petition before the Single Judge
               was under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_27">Article 227</a> of the Constitution, an appeal
               at the behest of the Respondent to the petition was
               not maintainable. The Supreme Court held that the
               High Court was not justified in holding that the
               Letters Patent Appeal was not maintainable since the
               High Court did not consider the nature of the
               controversy and the prayers involved in the Writ
               Petition.

 application filed by respondent No.1 under Section 98 of the

 Hyderabad Tenancy Act, dated 10.4.1990 before the Deputy

 Collector, Land Reforms, Latur, was itself barred by limitation

 and on that count itself, that application was not maintainable

 and consequently, the order passed by the authority directing

 removal of the appellants from the disputed property, is illegal

 and erroneous. He placed reliance on Radhu Gokul Gawali and

 others Vs. Mohan Kisan Gawali and others reported in

 [2007 (6) Mh.L.J. 117].          In the said matter, this Court held

 that, there should be reasonable period demonstrated for seeking

 restoration in terms of Section 98 of the Act.                It is further

 observed that, facts in each case may differ and, therefore, Court

 has to record finding about maintainability of remedy available to

 the parties.

 31.7.1987. That order was confirmed by Deputy Collector, Land

 disputed land under different sale deeds in between 1980 to

 recorded in revenue record of the suit land.                    Thus, the

 respondent No.1 was dispossessed by appellants in the year

 1980-81 after purchase of the suit land.        Considering the time
