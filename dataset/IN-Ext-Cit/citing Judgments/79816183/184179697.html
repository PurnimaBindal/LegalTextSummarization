      by prosecution in support of charges, I would like to discuss
      here the law with regard to offence of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_11">Section 304B</a> IPC.
</p>

<p id="p_49">   40.In order to attract <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_12">Section 304B</a> IPC, prosecution is required to
      prove the following ingredients:--
</p><p id="p_50">      (i) The death of a woman should be caused by burns or bodily
      injury or otherwise than under a normal circumstance.
</p><p id="p_51">      (ii) Such a death should have occurred within seven years of
      her marriage.
</p><p id="p_52">      (iii) She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by
      her husband or any relative of her husband.
</p><p id="p_53">      (iv) Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection
      with demand of dowry.
</p><p id="p_54">      (v) Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted
      out to the woman soon before her death.

<p id="p_55">   41.For appreciating <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_13">section 304B</a> IPC, presumption u/s 113(b) of
      <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_14">Indian Evidence Act</a> is also relevant. <a href="/doc/462524/" id="a_15">Section 113(b)</a> of the
      Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides that when the question is
      whether a person has committed dowry death of a woman or
      not then if it is shown that soon before her death such woman
      had been subjected to cruelty or harassment for, or in
      connection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall
      presume that such person had caused the dowry death.

      1872 can only be raised when proof of women being subjected
      to cruelty or harassment for the purpose of dowry soon before
      her death has been established by prosecution on record.

      the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the expression "soon before" is
      very relevant. Where any act of cruelty or harassment for the
      purpose of dowry had taken place soon before death of
      deceased or not, will depend upon the facts and circumstances
      of each and every case and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of

          there must be material to show that soon before

          expression `soon before' is very relevant where
          <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_22">Section 113B</a> of the Evidence Act and <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_23">Section
          304B</a> IPC are pressed into service. Prosecution is
          obliged to show that soon before the occurrence
          there was cruelty or harassment and only in that
          case presumption operates. Evidence in that
          regard has to be led by prosecution. `Soon before'
          is a relative term and it would depend upon
          circumstances of each case and no strait-jacket
          formula can be laid down as to what would
          constitute a period soon before the occurrence. It
          would be hazardous to indicate any fixed period,
          and that brings in the importance of a proximity
          test both for the proof of an offence of dowry death
          as well as for raising a presumption under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_24">Section
          113B</a> of the Evidence Act. The expression `soon
          before her death' used in the substantive <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_25">Section
          304B</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_26">Section 113B</a> of the Evidence Act is
          present with the idea of proximity test. No definite
          period has been indicated and the expression
          `soon before' is not defined. A reference to
          expression `soon after' used in <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_27">Section 114</a>
          (illustration (a)) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_28">Evidence Act</a> is relevant. It
          lays down that a Court may presume that a man
          who is in the possession of goods soon after the
          theft, is either the thief or has received the goods
          knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account
          for his possession. The determination of the
          period which can come within the term `soon
          before' is left to be determined by the Courts,
          depending upon facts and circumstances of each
          case. Suffice, However, to indicate that the
          expression `soon before' normally imply that the
          interval should not be much between the
          concerned cruelty or harassment and the death in
          question. There muse be existence of a proximate
          and live-link between the effect of cruelty based
          on dowry demand and the concerned death. If

          alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and

<p id="p_61">   45.In the light of law discussed herein above, the onus is upon
      prosecution to show that soon before death of deceased
      Babita, she was subjected to cruelty and harassment for the
      purpose of dowry.
</p>

<p id="p_62">   46.In the present case, death of deceased Babita is suicidal, is
      proved by evidence of her sister PW5 Rajnesh and the post
      mortem report Ex.PW13/A. It has come in the evidence of
      PW5 Rajnesh that immediately on receipt of information, she
      had reached at the matrimonial home of deceased Babita
      wherein at the first floor, room was found locked from inside.
      Thereafter, with the help of accused Vikas and other persons,
      door was broken and thereafter, she had found her sister
      i.e.deceased Babita hanging from ceiling fan with the help of
      chunni.

<p id="p_63">   47.The evidence of PW5 Rajnesh that deceased committed
      suicide is corroborated by her post mortem report Ex.PW13/A
      wherein cause of death has been opined to be asphyxia due to
      ante mortem ligature hanging. Further, death of deceased
      Babita by way of poisoning also stands ruled out in the light of

      on record proves that death of deceased was not homicidal but
      suicidal in nature.

<p id="p_65">   48.Now, prosecution is required to prove that deceased Babita
      was driven to suicide as soon before her death as she was
      harassed for the purpose of dowry. Although in the present
      case, victim i.e.deceased Babita is not alive to tell as to
      whether she committed suicide due to harassment by accused
      persons for the purpose of dowry or not but she had left behind
      a suicide note Ex.PW18/A. The suicide note Ex.PW18/A is the
      most crucial evidence to show whether deceased Babita was
      subjected to cruelty soon before her death by accused persons

      i.e.accused persons for the purpose of dowry. There is no
      allegation made by deceased in her suicide note Ex.PW18/A
      that due to torture and harassment by accused persons for the
      purpose of dowry, she was committing suicide. The suicide
      note Ex.PW18/A can be equated with the dying declaration of
      the deceased. It is a settled principle of law that lot of sanctity is
      attached to a dying declaration as a person while dying speaks
      truth and that the deceased was speaking truth through her
      suicide note Ex.PW18/A is borne          from the fact that in the
      suicide note Ex.PW18/A, deceased had herself mentioned that
      while dying, she will not tell lies. Therefore, suicide note
      Ex.PW18/A of deceased shows that deceased had pen down
      her honest feelings regarding accused persons. There is not
      an iota of allegation against any of accused made by deceased
      in her suicide note Ex.PW18/A that she was harassed or
      tortured for the purpose of dowry due to which she was
      committing suicide. Therefore, on the basis of suicide note
      Ex.PW18/A, it is not shown by prosecution that deceased was
      subjected to cruelty for the purpose of dowry soon before her
      death.
</p>

<p id="p_73">   53.It was contended by counsel for complainant during arguments
      that much reliance upon suicide note Ex.PW18/A cannot be
      placed as it is undated and it is quite possible that suicide note
      Ex.PW18/A might have been written long time back and,


FIR NO: 191/09                                                        22/41

</p><p id="p_74">                                                        FIR No: 191/09

      therefore, it does not reflect the circumstances which were
      existing soon before her death.
</p>

<p id="p_75">   54.Said contention of counsel for complainant is not acceptable as
      bare language of suicide note Ex.PW18/A shows that it was
      contemporous with the act of deceased committing suicide
      and, therefore, it being undated is of no consequence. The
      plain and clear language of suicide note Ex.PW18/A shows that
      it   was   written   prior   to   deceased   committing    suicide.
      Accordingly, this contention does not create any doubt that
      suicide note Ex.PW18/A was written by deceased long time
      back.
</p>

<p id="p_76">   55.Now, I shall examine other evidence which has been led on
      record by prosecution to show that deceased was subjected to
      cruelty for the purpose of dowry soon before her death.
</p>

<p id="p_77">   56.The second most important evidence is the deposition made by
      PW4 Sandeep, who happens to be the brother of deceased. In
      his statement to the police u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_29">Cr.P.C</a>. as well as in his
      deposition before this court, he had stated that in the morning
      of 02.06.2009, at about 8.30 a.m. or 9.00 a.m., her deceased
      sister had called him up and told him that since she is being
      beaten up since last night to bring more money and car,
      therefore, she is fed up and is ending her life.

</pre><p id="p_78">   57.The defence of accused persons was that no such call was
      made by deceased Babita to PW4. Therefore, onus was upon
      the prosecution to show that any such call was made in the
      morning of 02.06.2009 by deceased Babita to her brother PW4.
</p>

<p id="p_79">   58.Although in the statement of PW4 Sandeep u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_30">Cr.P.C</a>. he
      had given the mobile number of accused Vikas i.e.
      9650268441 from which deceased had called him up on his
      mobile no. 9971626730 but no call detail record of aforesaid
      two mobile numbers was filed on record to lend credence to
      deposition of PW4 that he had received call in the morning of
      02.06.2009 from deceased Babita.
</p>

<p id="p_80">   59.Further, it has also come in the evidence of PW18 ASI Ranbir
      Singh, who was the first person to reach at the matrimonial
      home of deceased that apart from suicide note Ex.PW18/A and
      chunni, no other thing was found in the room of deceased.
      Further, as per crime inspection report prepared by ASI Attar
      Singh Ex.PW7/A, after searching entire room, no mobile phone
      was found in the room of deceased.
</p>

<p id="p_81">   60.The first call to the police regarding suicide of deceased was
      made vide DD NO.14A Ex.PW19/J at 10.02 a.m. PW4
      Sandeep has deposed that he received call from deceased at


FIR NO: 191/09                                                   24/41

      around 8.30--9.00 a.m. If deposition of PW4 is believed that
      deceased had called him up at around 9.00 a.m.on his mobile
      phone and thereafter, she had committed suicide then the
      mobile phone should have been recovered from the room of
      deceased. However, absence of mobile phone or any other
      landline telephone in the room of deceased goes to show that
      no such call was made by deceased soon before her death to
      PW4 intimating that she is ending her life due to torture being
      done by accused persons.
</p>

<p id="p_83">   61.Further, it is not believable that deceased on one hand will
      inform her brother/PW4 on telephone regarding torture being
      done by accused persons due to which she was ending her life
      and on the other hand, she would write a suicide note
      Ex.PW18/A wherein she levels no allegations against accused
      persons for torturing her for the purpose of dowry. It is not
      believable that if deceased was so traumatized by demand of
      accused persons then she will absolve them in her suicide note
      Ex.PW18/A. If deceased can tell her brother PW4 regarding the
      acts of torture then she could have very well mentioned the
      same in her suicide note Ex.PW18/A. The absence of
      allegations of torture against accused persons in suicide note
      Ex.PW18/A also shows that no call was made by deceased to
      PW4 alleging that she was being tortured for the purpose of
      dowry by accused persons due to which she was committing


FIR NO: 191/09                                                    25/41

      suicide.
</p>

<p id="p_85">   62.Another factor which goes to show that no such call was made
      by deceased to PW4 is the admission made by PW4 that he
      was present before the SDM on 02.06.2009 and despite that he
      did not tell the SDM that he had received a call in the morning
      from deceased Babita. It is not believable that when SDM was
      recording the statement of parents of deceased in presence of
      PW4, he will not state before him a very crucial piece of
      incriminating evidence against accused persons of receiving
      call from deceased Babita in the morning of 02.06.2009.
</p>

<p id="p_86">   63.Lastly, it has come in the evidence of PW2 Om Prakash, father
      of deceased and PW5 Rajnesh, sister of deceased that they
      are not aware as to when deceased Babita had called her
      brother PW4 Sandeep. The very fact that family members of
      deceased i.e.father and sister are unaware of any such call
      made by deceased to PW4 even at the time of their cross
      examination, which was recorded a year after the suicide of
      deceased further goes to show that no such call was received
      by PW4 Sandeep otherwise PW4 Sandeep would have
      promptly apprised the SDM or his family members about the
      same.
</p>

<p id="p_87">   64.During the course of arguments, it was also contended by the


FIR NO: 191/09                                                    26/41

      counsel for complainant that PW5 had reached at the place of
      incident only after being      apprised by her brother PW4
      Sandeep, who in turn was told by deceased                about her
      committing suicide.    Therefore, this court can presume that
      deceased had called up her brother PW4 Sandeep to tell that
      she is committing suicide due to harassment by accused
      persons, who thereafter had called PW5 Rajnesh to reach at
      the house of deceased to prevent her from committing suicide.
      Therefore, in the light of telephone call made by deceased soon
      before her death, suicide note loses its significance.
</p>

<p id="p_89">   65.The contention of counsel for complainant cannot be accepted
      as in the criminal trial, facts cannot be presumed and they are
      supposed to be proved on record.
</p>

<p id="p_90">   66.PW5 Rajnesh although in her statement u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_31">Cr.P.C</a>.mark
      PW5/A has given her mobile number and mobile number of that
      of her brother PW4 Sandeep from wherein she had received
      the call but in the absence of call detail record filed by
      prosecution, it cannot be believed that information regarding
      commission of suicide was given to PW5 only by PW4
      Sandeep. Since PW5 Rajnesh was residing in the vicinity of
      deceased Babita, therefore, it is quite possible that news of
      suicide might have spread like a fire in the neighbourhood and
      PW5 Rajnesh might have come to know from the neighbours


FIR NO: 191/09                                                      27/41

      regarding commission of suicide and this is how she might
      have reached at the place of incident. In the absence of Call
      Detail Record, possibility of PW5 Rajnesh reaching at the place
      of incident after coming to know from neighbours cannot be
      ruled out.
</p>

<p id="p_92">   67.Therefore, the prosecution has failed to show that any call was
      made by deceased in the morning of 02.06.2009 prior to her
      suicide to her brother PW4 Sandeep informing him regarding
      her committing suicide. Therefore, testimony of PW4 Sandeep
      does not inspire confidence and is not believable.
</p>

<p id="p_93">   68.Now, I shall appreciate the evidence with regard to receipt of
      call from deceased Babita in the evening of 01.06.2009 by her
      mother i.e.PW3 Jaswanti wherein she had informed her mother
      that accused persons are harassing her as demand for dowry
      is not being fulfilled.
</p>

<p id="p_94">   69.The evidence of PW3 Jaswanti that she had received a call in
      the evening of 01.06.2009 from deceased Babita is not
      believable as firstly, no telephone numbers have been specified
      on which aforesaid call was made or received and secondly,
      even the call detail records of mobile phone of PW3 Jaswanti,
      has not been filed on record to lend credence to her deposition.
      Further, the receipt of call by PW3 Jaswanti on 01.06.2009 was

      within her knowledge on the date when she gave her statement
      to SDM Ex.PW1/C on 02.06.2009.          However, in the said
      statement, PW3 Jaswanti has made no mention of receipt of
      call from deceased in the evening of 01.06.2009. Therefore,
      deposition made by PW3 Jaswanti is an after thought and
      concocted one, hence cannot be believed. Even husband of
      PW3 Jaswanti i.e.PW2 Om Prakash has deposed about receipt
      of call by PW3 Jaswanti on 01.06.2009 but even in his
      statement before SDM on 02.06.2009 Ex.PW1/B, no such
      reference has been made to receipt of call by PW3 Jaswanti
      from deceased Babita. Hence, receipt of call by PW3 Jaswanti
      in the evening of 01.06.2009 from deceased Babita cannot be
      believed. It is not believable that such an important fact which
      was in the specific knowledge of PW2 Om Prakash and PW3
      Jaswanti regarding allegations of demand of dowry by accused
      persons soon before their daughter's death will not be told in
      the initial statement made to the SDM on 02.06.2009 recorded

<p id="p_97">   72.Next, I will appreciate the evidence of PW2 Om Prakash, father
      of deceased and PW4 Sandeep, brother of deceased wherein
      they have deposed that 5-6 days prior to incident, a demand of
      Rs.10 lacs was made by accused persons. The said deposition
      of PW2 and PW4 is also not believable as it has been admitted
      by PW2 in his cross examination that between the period from
      28.05.2009 till 31.05.2009, deceased Babita had gone on a
      pilgrimage to Vaishno Devi and Haridwar with accused
      persons. 5-6 days prior to 02.06.2009 comes to 28.05.2009.
      Since accused and deceased were not in Delhi on the date it is
      alleged that accused persons had demanded Rs.10 lacs,
      therefore, it is not believable that Rs.10 lacs were demanded
      from father of deceased i.e.PW2 and both PW2 and PW4 have
      deposed falsely to this effect.

<p id="p_98">   73.The falsity of deposition of PW2 and PW4 is also made out

      Ex.PW1/C.     PW3 Jaswanti in her cross examination has
      admitted that she had given a statement before the SDM. In
      the statement of PW3 Jaswanti Ex.PW1/C recorded before
      SDM, she had stated that three days prior to incident, accused
      Vikas and his maternal uncle Mahavir had come to their house
      and made a demand of Rs.10 lacs for the purpose of
      purchasing a plot. Although in her cross examination before this
      court, PW3 had denied that she had stated to the SDM
      regarding demand made by accused Vikas and Mahavir of Rs.
      10 lacs at her house three days prior to the incident but in the
      opinion of this court, this has been falsely stated by PW3
      Jaswanti in her cross examination knowing fully well that it had
      come in the cross examination of PW2 Om Prakash recorded
      on 26.07.20011 that deceased had gone alongwith accused
      persons to Vaishno Devi between the period from 28.05.2009
      till 31.05.2009. PW3 very well knew during her cross
      examination on 24.08.2011 that three days prior to incident,
      accused and deceased were not in Delhi being away to
      Vaishno Devi and, therefore, question of accused Vikas and
      Mahavir coming to her house and demanding Rs.10 lacs would
      affect her credibility, therefore, she has falsely stated in her
      cross examination that she did not tell so in her statement
      Ex.PW1/C before the SDM. Therefore, considering the
      statement of PW3 Ex.PW1/C or the evidence of PW2 and PW4
      recorded before this court, in either case, their evidence is not

      believable as there was no occasion for the accused persons to
      have demanded Rs. 10 lacs by either going to house of
      deceased or by making demand otherwise as accused persons
      and deceased were not in Delhi three days or five days prior to
      the incident being away to Vaishno Devi. Therefore, PW2 and
      PW4 have deposed falsely regarding demand of dowry of Rs.
      10 lacs made by accused persons and hence, their deposition
      cannot be believed.
</p>

<p id="p_101">   74.Another factor which belies the testimony of PW2 and PW4 is
      that in case accused persons were demanding dowry of Rs.1o
      lacs from PW2 Om Prakash and since it has come in their
      evidence that deceased Babita was also with PW2 Om Prakash
      at their house, no sane father will send his daughter alongwith
      very same persons, who were harassing and making a demand
      of Rs.10 lacs from his daughter. The very fact that deceased
      was allowed to accompany accused persons on a pilgrimage to
      Vaishno Devi goes to show that deceased was not being
      harassed for the purpose of dowry of Rs.10 lacs. Hence,
      prosecution has not been able to show that there was demand
      of dowry of Rs.10 lacs by accused persons, five-six days prior
      to incident.

      deceased three days after Holi Festival. It has come in the
      evidence of PW2 Om Prakash, PW3 Jaswanti, PW4 Sandeep
      and PW5 Rajnesh that accused were demanding Rs.2 lacs and
      it has come in the evidence of PW2 to PW4 that three days
      after Holi, Rs.1 lac was given to accused Vikas and Mahavir
      when they came to their house.
</p>

<p id="p_104">   76.The testimony of PW2 Om Prakash regarding handing over of
      Rs.1 lac three days after Holi Festival to accused Vikas and
      Mahavir is not believable as there is material contradiction from
      what was stated before the SDM in his statement Ex.PW1/B. In
      his statement made before SDM Ex.PW1/B, PW2 Om Prakash
      has stated that three months prior to the incident, he had given
      Rs.1 lac to his deceased daughter and there is no such
      allegation that accused Vikas and Mahavir had come to their
      house to collect the said payment. The statement of PW2 was
      recorded on 02.06.2009 and it is not believable that he will not
      recollect the correct fact with regard to payment of Rs. 1 lac
      which took place merely three months prior to recording his
      statement. A person, who had given money unwillingly will
      definitely remember the correct facts as to how the payment
      was made and to whom. However, in the present case, since
      there is contradiction in the testimony of PW2 regarding giving
      of Rs.1 lac, therefore, his testimony cannot be believed.

</pre><p id="p_105">   77.Similarly, the deposition made by PW3 Jaswanti and PW4
      Sandeep that immediately after Holi Festival, payment of Rs.1
      lac was given to accused Vikas and Mahavir at their house, is
      required to be discarded as it is in contradiction with what was
      stated by PW2 Om Prakash vide Ex.PW1/B where it was stated
      that amount of Rs.1 lac was given to accused through his
      deceased daughter and there is no mention that accused Vikas
      and Mahavir had come to their house.
</p>

<p id="p_106">   78.Even otherwise, demand of Rs.2 lacs made three months prior
      to incident will not qualify under the expression "soon before
      death" as there is no allegation of persistent demand of dowry
      or harassment made to deceased between the Holi period in
      March, 2009 till commission of suicide by deceased in June,
      2009. Further, although it is not proved that Rs.1 lac was paid
      to accused Vikas and Mahavir but even assuming that the
      same was done then also it will not qualify as an act done soon
      before death as the said act of harassment had become stale in
      the mind of deceased and had no proximate role to play in the
      commission of suicide by deceased.

      ashamed as Vikas is their only son. The said witness was
      confronted with the statement made to the police mark PW5/A
      wherein no such fact was recorded and, therefore, due to this
      contradiction, her deposition cannot be believed. It was further
      deposed to by PW5 that accused Roshni used to comment that
      their demands have not been fulfilled and their house has been
      filled up with steel only.    On this aspect also, PW5 was

</pre><p id="p_111">   83.In the light of above discussion, facts showing that deceased
      was being harassed for the purpose of dowry soon before her
      death, have not been established by prosecution. Therefore,
      presumption u/s 113(b) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_34">Indian Evidence Act</a>, 1872
      cannot be raised in this case to hold accused guilty of causing
      dowry death of deceased Babita. On the contrary, the suicide
      note Ex.PW18/A negates the testimony of PW2 to PW5 that
      she was being tortured with cruelty for the purpose of dowry
      which led her to commit suicide. If the deceased was tortured
      for the purpose of dowry which led her to commit suicide then
      she would not have absolved the accused persons in her
      suicide note Ex.PW18/A.

<p id="p_112">   84.The very fact that deceased had made a request to her parents
      in her suicide note Ex.PW18/A that no action be taken against
      accused Vikas, goes to show that deceased apprehended that
      her parents might hold her husband responsible for her death
      and that is why she had made a request to her parents not to
      take any action against accused Vikas by voluntarily penning
      down her request through suicide note Ex.PW18/A. Therefore,
      from suicide note Ex.PW18/A and having regard to the fact that
      demand of dowry and harassment has not been proved by
