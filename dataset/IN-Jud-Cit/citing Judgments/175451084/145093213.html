        confusingly and deceptively similar to the trademarks of Plaintiffs.

         deceptively similar to the trademarks of the Plaintiffs and were

        wrongly registered by Defendants no. 1 to 4.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">18.     It is pleaded that Plaintiffs initiated various proceedings against the

        Defendants and filed various applications as mentioned in para 21

        (pages 68 to 71 of the plaint). Most of the applications for obtaining

        similar trademarks were abandoned as mentioned in the tabulated

        form in para 21 of the plaint, whereas some oppositions initiated by

        Plaintiff no. 1 i.e., application bearing no. 801153 for the mark BON-

        E-WALKER in Class 33 and application bearing no. 845538 for the

        mark BONNIE-V-WALER in Class 32 filed by Defendant no. 1 were

        concluded successfully in favour of Plaintiff no. 1.


</p><p id="p_32">19.     It is pleaded that in the year 1991, Plaintiff no. 1 and its predecessors

        became aware of the adoption of the mark VAT 999 and passing off of

        the trademark of JOHNNIE WALKER RED LABEL brand of the

        Plaintiffs by the Defendants in relation to Whisky. The Plaintiffs filed

        a suit bearing no. 866/ 1996 against Defendant no. 1 and an interim

        injunction dated 23.04.1996 was passed against the Defendants as

        under:-
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "the Defendants are restrained from selling, offering for
                sale, advertising, directly or indirectly dealing in whiskies

                 under the mark VAT 999 or any other mark identical with or
                deceptively similar to the Plaintiff‟s trade mark VAT 69."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">20.     The said civil suit on account of increase in pecuniary jurisdiction of

        the District Court is pending before the Additional District Judge,

        Delhi and the injunction order is operating against Defendant no. 1. It

        is the case of the Plaintiffs that in early 2000, the Plaintiffs became

        aware of Defendant no. 1 having filed applications for the marks JOL-

        E- WALKER, BON-E-WALER, UNCLE WALKER and WALKER‟S

        CHOICE. Thus, perceiving a threat by the Defendants of introducing

        these marks in the market, Plaintiff no. 1 instituted a suit bearing no.

        2781/2000 against Defendant no. 1. The Delhi High Court again

        granted an ex-parte ad interim injunction against the Defendant by an

        order dated 15.12.2000 as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                ".... the Defendants, its distributors, servants, agents,
                representatives and assigns etc. are restrained from using
                the trade mark JOL-E-WALER, BON-E-WALKER, UNCLE
                WALKER AND WALKER‟S CHOICE and any other trade
                mark or trade marks which are deceptively or confusingly
                similar to the Plaintiff‟s registered trade mark "JOHNNIE
                WALKER" in respect of their goods or in advertising and
                promotional material or any other manner whatsoever
                infringing the Plaintiff‟s rights in and to their registered
                mark JOHHNIE WALKER".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">21.     A decree was passed for perpetual injunction in favour of the Plaintiffs

        therein and against the Defendants therein restraining them from using

         the trademarks JOL-E- WALKER, BON-E-WALKER, UNCLE

        WALKER and WALKER‟S CHOICE which were confusingly similar

        to the trademark of the Plaintiffs‟ JOHNNIE WALKER in respect of

        their goods or any advertisement and promotional material.


</p><p id="p_37">22.     It is alleged that despite the above suit having been initiated in the

        year 2000 and not contested by the Defendants, the predatory tactics

        of the Defendants continued unabated in as much as in the year 2003,

        the Defendants filed yet another application for registration of the

        mark PETER WALKER.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">23.     It is urged that malafides of the Defendants are evident from the fact

        that being in the alcoholic beverages trade, the Defendants who are

        well aware of the Plaintiffs‟ trademarks have deliberately adopted

        virtually identical or deceptively similar marks, or marks having

        essential and prominent portions of the Plaintiffs‟ marks, in respect of

        same or similar goods so as to cause confusion and deception in the

        market and to make unjust profits for themselves or by trying to ride

        on the reputation of the Plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">24.     The Plaintiffs have also given details of the well known global marks

        of the third parties which were opposed by the said parties by

         initiating oppositions to the applications for registration filed by the

        Defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">25.     Plaintiff no. 1 addressed a cease and desist notice dated 14.01.2009 to

        the Defendants no. 2 and 3 setting forth all the relevant particulars,

        pertaining to the Plaintiffs‟ right in their registered trademarks and

        calling upon the Defendants to withdraw the pending applications

        filed by them.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">26.     The Plaintiffs thus, sought ad interim injunction as stated above.


</p><p id="p_46">27.     Defendants no. 1 to 14 filed a joint written statement and joint reply to

        the application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC. The

        Defendants have denied that they are using deceptively similar marks

        or proposing to use similar or deceptively similar marks as that of the

        Plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">28.     It is stated that the Plaintiffs have sought a blanket injunction to

        restrain the Defendants from filing applications seeking registration of

        trademarks which is not permissible and will tantamount to pre-

        empting the Defendants even from applying for a trademark based on

        the subjective and biased evaluation of the Plaintiffs rather than the

        Registrar of Trade Marks. Thus, it is stated that the prayer in the suit

</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">29.     Defendants no. 1 to 14 have stated that Defendant no. 15 is a separate

        legal entity and the present suit cannot be allowed to be extended to

        Defendant no. 15. It is stated that in <a href="/doc/186988/" id="a_2">Diageo North America Inc. &amp;

        Anr. v. Shiva Distilleries Limited, CS (OS) No</a>. 255/2004 decided by

        Delhi High Court on 05.07.2007, it was held that there was no

        similarity between the trademarks SMIRNOFF and BRISNOFF. It

        was held that BRISNOFF is not deceptively similar and can in no

        manner be confused with the Plaintiffs‟ trademarks. The Defendants

        extracted paras 13 and 14 of the order passed in CS (OS) No.

        255/2004 as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                ".........the fact remains that the syllable „NOFF‟ has been in
                use in respect of alcoholic products and particularly in the
                case of vodka. Perhaps, the same is used to indicate a
                Russian connection as vodka is generally discerned as a
                Russian drink. Whether it has become a descriptive term or
                not is debateable, but, at this prima facie stage it cannot be
                said that the Plaintiffs have established their exclusive right

                in SMIR and the letter B in BRIS, this, to my mind, is of no
                consequence because the arrangement of the letters is
                entirely different, as is the phonetic and visual result. I also
                agree with the submission made by the learned counsel for
                the Defendant that the intending purchasers of the
                competing products are literate persons belonging to the
                affluent class of the society and who would be in a position
                to easily distinguish SMIRNOFF from BRISNOFF
                particularly when the eyebrow device and the colour
                combination is sought to be given up by the Defendant. The
                average person with imperfect recollection would have to be
                from amongst the sub-set of such persons i.e., discerning
                consumers of vodka. My prima facie view is that the trade
                mark BRISNOFF is not deceptively similar to, nor can it be
                confused with the Plaintiffs' trade mark SMIRNOFF."

<p id="p_52">30.     It was thus, stated that the mark METRONOFF and SMIRNOFF are

        also not similar and Defendant no. 15 cannot be disallowed from

        pursuing the application for registration of the earlier said trademarks.

        It was stated that the suit filed by the Plaintiffs as such was not

        maintainable as <a href="/doc/1587793/" id="a_3">Sections 18</a> to <a href="/doc/1782673/" id="a_4">26</a> of the Act lays down the procedure

        for registration of trademarks. Any person claiming a pre-existing

        right in the same as a right to file opposition and ultimately, it was for

        the registry to decide on the application. The Plaintiffs, therefore,

        cannot take away the statutory right of proposed Defendant no. 15 to

        apply for registration of the mark „METRONOFF‟.

        already been registered by Defendant no. 1. The Plaintiffs can take

        appropriate proceedings for cancellation of the marks as may be

        advised irrespective of their action for passing off against the

         Plaintiffs cannot be forced to always file an application for opposition

        restrained from lodging any such application with the Trade Marks

        make a trademark application. Such an application can only be made

        exclusive right to use the trademarks in respect of specified goods and

        learned counsel for the Plaintiffs has urged that registration of a

        trademark under the Act would be irrelevant in an action for passing

        off. Registration of a trade mark in fact does not confer any new right

        on the proprietor thereof than what already existed at common law

        without registration of the mark.

        barred by any statute either expressly or impliedly, the Plaintiffs are

        entitled to the relief as stated above.

        Act would be applicable only when the matter of registration or

        refusal of registration of any trademark is before an Appellate Board

        as provided in <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_12">Section 91</a> of the Act. This has nothing to do with the

        opposition to a large number of trademarks for which the Defendants

        sought registration, the Defendants either abandoned the application

        learned Sr. Counsel for the Defendants has contended that cause of

        action will arise only when a registered trademark is used or when an

        application is filed for registration of the trademark. An application for

        grant of registration certificate may or may not be allowed. A person

        in whose favour a Registration Certificate has already been granted

        indisputably will have an opportunity to oppose the same by filing an

        opposition before the Registrar who has the requisite jurisdiction to

        determine the said question. The learned Sr. Counsel for the

        Defendants has very strenuously stated that vigilance is the

        cornerstone of any right and it cannot be a ground to pre-empt filing of

        an opposition to an intended registration of any trademark which is the

        foundation of the concept of registration of trademark and the

        Plaintiffs cannot be allowed to contend that they cannot be forced to

        oppose every application filed by the Defendants.

        bonafidely apply for registration of the trademark which in their

        opinion is not deceptively or confusingly similar, but is held to be so

        by the Civil Court. It is urged that there is an elaborate machinery

        under <a href="/doc/1573447/" id="a_19">Section 21</a> of the Act to decide whether the proposed mark is to

        None of the marks have so far has been used by Defendant no.1,

        not intend to use the mark in foreseeable future. The fact that the

        trademark had not been used by the Defendants before applying for

        Defendants have been manufacturing liquor in India since before l968.

        It is stated in para 11 of the written statement that the Defendants have

<p id="p_106">57.     There is consensus of judicial opinion that a part of the trade mark

        which is likely to confuse the consumer will also amount to

        infringement of the trade mark. In De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co.,

        (1951) 68 RPC 103, the Plaintiffs were using the trade mark

        containing the words „Vick‟s VapoRub‟ as an essential feature

        registered in Jamaica. The Defendants used a similar label with words

        „Karsote Vapour Rub‟. It was held that the expression "VapoRub" had

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">                "25. After having considered the above mentioned
                decisions, it is clear to us that it is not the right test of a
                meticulous comparison of two marks, letter by letter and
                syllable by syllable. It is the person who only knows the
                one mark and has perhaps an impression, or imperfect
                recollection of it, who is likely to be deceived or
                confused. In fact it depends on first impression of a
                person. In case he is aware or familiar with both rival
                marks of the parties he will neither be deceived or
                confused. The degree of similarity between the two rival
                marks and which depends upon the first impression

                there is a risk of confusion which is the public interest

                dispute of inter se between the parties but it is matter of
                right by the registered proprietor who got the exclusive
                rights to protect the same, otherwise, many competing
                marks would be available in the market in due course
                and uncertainty might happen in case the infringer is
                allowed to use similar mark."

<p id="p_110"> 60.     Further, it has been held that the ascertainment of an essential feature

        of a trademark can be judged even if a word forming a part of a

        trademark has come in trade to be used to identify the goods of the

        owner of the trademark. Even use of that part of the mark would

        amount to infringement of the mark itself as the part of the mark is

        likely to result into confusion. The likelihood of confusion or

        deception in such cases is not disproved by placing the 2 marks side

        by side and demonstrating how small the chance of error is by any

        customer who places his order for the goods with both the marks

        clearly before him, for orders are not often placed under such

        conditions. In most cases, the eye is not an accurate recorder of visual

        detail and marks are rather remembered by general impressions or by

        some significant detail than by photographic recollection of the whole.

        Hence, in De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co., (1951) 68 RPC 103, the

        Defendants who used a similar label with words „Karsote Vapour

        Rub‟ to the Plaintiffs‟ label containing the words „Vick‟s VapoRub‟

        were held guilty of infringement. Similarly, this Court in <a href="/doc/175451084/" id="a_48">Himalaya

        Drug Company v. S.B.L. Limited</a>, 2013 (53) PTC 1 (Del.) (DB), held

        the Defendant using the mark „Liv-T‟ similar to Plaintiff‟s mark „Liv.

        52‟ guilty of infringement as the part of the mark „Liv‟ was similar.

</p><p id="p_111"> 61.     For a Plaintiff to be entitled to the relief of ad interim injunction, the

        Plaintiff has to satisfy the triple test of strong prima facie case,

        balance of convenience and irreparable loss and injury in case the

        injunction sought for is not granted.
</p>
<p id="p_112">
</p><p id="p_113">62.     I have earlier given detailed reasons to demonstrate that the

        Defendants, particularly Defendant no. 1 has attempted to use or has

        actually used or has applied for registration of the trade marks which

        are similar or are deceptively or confusingly similar to the marks of

        which the Plaintiffs are the proprietors. Defendant no. 1 got

        registration of some of the marks as mentioned in para 20 of the

        application which were deceptively similar to the registered trademark

        of the Plaintiffs. Out of these, the trademark CAPTAIN WALKER,

        PETEWALKER and PETEWALKR have not been renewed by

        Defendant no. 1. As stated above, Defendant no. 1‟s mark KHODEY

        BLACK &amp; WHITE, VAT 999, GUDNESS and BOND‟S GREEN

        LABEL are similar or confusingly or deceptively similar to the

        Plaintiffs‟ mark BLACK &amp; WHITE, VAT 69, GUINNES and

        GREEN LABEL respectively. It is also established that the

        Defendants have also been using or have adopted deceptively or

        confusingly similar marks to the marks of the third parties which have

         been opposed by them. Hence, the Plaintiffs have established a strong

        prima facie case in their favour.

        of the use of the deceptively or confusingly similar trademarks to

        those of the Plaintiffs, the Defendants are not only causing financial

        loss to the Plaintiffs but have also caused immense loss to the

        Plaintiffs‟ reputation. Although, Defendant no. 1 is an old company

        dealing in liquor and alcohol, yet no reason has been given by

        Defendant no. 1 for adopting the marks similar to the trademark of the

        Plaintiffs. Thus, it is also clear that there will be irreparable loss and

        injury if the injunction sought is not granted.
