<p id="p_1">PER HON'BLE JUSTICE SURENDRA KUMAR, JUDICIAL MEMBER

</p><p id="p_2">1.   The present Appeal under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_1">Section 111</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003,
has been preferred by PTC India Ltd. (in short, the 'Appellant'), against
the impugned order, dated 10.10.2013, passed by the Punjab State
Electricity Regulatory Commission (in short, the 'State Commission') in
Petition No. 15 of 2013, passed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the Electricity Act,
2003 read with Regulation 9 of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory
Commission (Conduct of Business) Regulations, 2005, whereby the State
Commission has rejected all the claims as prayed by the Appellant, which
are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (i)      For a compensation amounting to Rs.124,51,53,525/- for

<p id="p_3">2.   The learned State Commission, in the impugned order, has observed
as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "9.      Observations &amp; Findings of the Commission

                   filed by the petitioner vide its application, dated 12.4.2013,
                   is not initialled by either party. More importantly, the
                   Commission did not approve the said PSA for the long term
                   purchase of power from Baglihar HEP in its Order, dated
                   19.1.2011, in Petition No. 15 of 2009 filed by PSPCL. In the
                   absence of a valid PSA, at best, the letter, dated 31.3.2009,
                   together with the record of discussions, dated 26.3.2009,

                                                                             Page (2)
                                                          Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


                  mentioned therein, only could be the guiding documents for
                  supply of the aforementioned 100 MW power from Baglihar
                  HEP. These documents do not have any provision for
                  payment of any charges for discontinuation of supply of
                  power, by either party. The Commission is of the view that
                  to calculate the demand charges by PTC on the basis of a
                  non-existent    document     (unsigned    PSA)    is   not
                  justifiable........
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           (ii)   ................ The Commission notes that the calculation of
                  the amount of Rs.3,88,16,750/- on account of alleged short
                  payment of trading margin is based on the non-existent
                  PSA. In view of the above, the Commission holds that the
                  aforementioned amount is not payable by PSPCL to PTC
                  and the payment of trading margin has been rightly made
                  by PSPCL as per the letter, dated 31.3.2009, vide which,
                  PSPCL conveyed its acceptance to PTC for supply of 100
                  MW power from Baglihar HEP from 1.4.2009 @ Rs 3.65 per
                  kWh plus trading margin @ 4 paise per kWh on day-ahead
                  reservation of open access corridor basis."

<p id="p_4">3.   The learned counsel for the Appellant States that as regards the
claim of Rs 49,45,18,742/- for water usage charges consisting of Rs.
22,58,31,086/- for the supply of 100 MW made between 10.11.2010 to
8.6.2011 and Rs.26,86,87,656/- for the supply of 75 MW made between
1.4.2011 and 15.10.2011 under the short-term PPA signed on 31.3.2011,
the State Commission observed as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     (a)   PSPCL has contended that the 100 MW power purchased from
           Baglihar HEP was not based on cost plus tariff.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     (b)   PSPCL has submitted that the record of discussions, dated
           26.3.2009, provide only for payment of Cess/Tax/Duty imposed
           on generation, sale and trading of electricity and not other
           aspects such as water usage, etc.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     (c)   PSPCL has further asserted that before making a claim for
           water usage charge, PTC has to establish that it is a tax on
           generation of electricity.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                                                         Page (3)
                                                            Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     (d)   PSPCL has submitted that even though the provision for pass--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">           through of taxes, duties, cess, levy, fees or other imposition
           existed in the PPA with NHPC, an amendment to Tariff
           Regulation,   2009   was   carried   out   by    CERC        to     allow
           reimbursement of water usage charges.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">     (e)   Considering the detailed submissions made by the parties, the
           Commission is convinced of the submissions put-forth by PSPCL
           and the water charges amounting to Rs.22,58,31,086/-, in
           respect of the supply of 100MW power from Baglhar HEP, are not
           payable by PSPCL.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     (f)   Perusal of the copy of the said order, dated 1.2.2011, of
           SWARRA, filed by PTC in the petition, reveals that the said order
           was received in the office of JKSPDCL on 3.2.2011, vide receipt
           no. 1963. However, for reasons best known to JKSPDCL, the
           same is stated to have been communicated to PTC on 4.1.2012.
           This being a case of sale of power through competitive bidding,
           the inclusion of these charges by PTC would have altered the
           merit order and PTC's offer may have been rejected. Therefore, in
           view of the above, and the submission and argument put-forth by
           PSPCL, the Commission is convinced that the water usage
           charges amounting to Rs.26,86,87,656/-, in respect of supply of
           75 MW power from Baglihar HEP by PTC as per PPA, dated
           31.3.2011, based on competitive bidding process, are also not
           payable by PSPCL.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">4.   According to the Appellant, the State Commission erred both in fact
and in law and failed to appreciate that there was a concluded contract
between the Appellant and Respondent No.2 (PSPCL) for purchase of power
from 1.4.2009 on a long term basis, for a period of 12 years. The
Respondent No-2 had not only agreed for the Power Sale Agreement (PSA)
with the Appellant, but had acted upon it thereby making the PSA as
concluded and binding on both the parties. This is clearly evident from the

      upon the Respondent No.2 to make the payment immediately

      Respondent No.2 to indicate the reason for the discontinuation
      of purchase of power from Baglihar HEP which was on a long

      neither informed by the Respondent No.2 about the application
      nor the Appellant was made a party in the said petition before
      the State Commission.     Moreover, the Respondent No.2 even
      after disposal of the petition vide State Commission's order,
      dated 19.1.2011, did not inform the Appellant and kept on
      purchasing power till 8.6.2011 i.e. almost for five months. The
      conduct of the Respondent No-2 clearly speaks of the malafide
      intention of the Respondent No.2 to enjoy the benefit of
      purchase of electricity at lower rate than what was prevalent at
      that point of time. Respondent No.2 decided to discontinue the
      purchase the electricity on 8.6.2011, only when the rates in the
      market had crashed and had fallen below the rate in the said

      purchasing 100 MW of power from the Appellant from the
      Baglihar HEP since 1.4.2009 at a rate which was for long term
      contract. The rate was much lower than those prevalent for the
      short term bilateral contracts.   The said letter also indicated
      that the action of the Respondent No.2 in discontinuing the
      purchase of power w.e.f. 8.6.2011 was not only arbitrary and
      illegal but also in breach of the terms of the agreed PSA and
      also the Minutes of the Meeting, dated 26.3.2009. Accordingly,
      the Respondent No-2 was liable to make a payment of
      Rs.119,20.43,463 (subsequently revised to Rs 124,51,53,525)
      as compensation, as the Appellant has suffered serious
      financial loss and is entitled for compensation as per the clause

     the Appellant and the Respondent No-2 to enter into agreement
     for sale and purchase of power on a long term basis i.e. for the

     being petition no. 15 of 2009 before the State Commission. As

     "PSA shall be initialed after approval of Punjab State Electricity
     Board   &amp; signed     after   approval    of   the State     Regulatory
     Commission". Hence it was agreed by the Respondent No-2 that
     application would be made to the State Commission after the
     PSA is approved by the PSEB (State Electricity Board). Thus,
     the Respondent No-2 had approved the PSA and after the
     approval   the   Respondent      No-2,    approached        the      State
     Commission.

     the Respondent No.2 even after disposal of the petition for
     approval of the PSA on 19.1.2011, had continued to draw power
     under the said PSA for almost 5 months, which conduct of the
     Respondent No.2 clearly speaks of the intention of the
     Respondent No.2 to take benefit under the agreed PSA which
     was on the long term basis and discontinued the same when it
     did not suit them.

     agreed between the Appellant and the Respondent No.2 but
     advised the Respondent No.2 to consider initiating the process
     of obtaining power to the requisite extent under the competitive
     bidding route and then approach the State Commission for
     approval of the said PSA. Since, the said PSA was never rejected
     as such by the State Commission but Respondent No.2 was
     only advised to go in for competitive bidding process and then
     approach the State Commission for approval of the said PSA.
     This clearly indicates the fact that the intention of the State

     Commission was to determine whether the tariff in the said PSA
     was in commensurate with the prevalent market rates. If the
     Appellant would have been given an opportunity to plead its
     case then the Appellant could demonstrate to the State
     Commission that the tenure of the said PSA was on long term
     basis i.e. 12 years, and the tariff being charged under the PSA
     was as applicable for long term basis and not for the short term
     basis.

     power under the said PSA which was agreed to be on a long

     should have initiated the competitive bidding process as

     But the Respondent No.2 not only ignored the advice of the
     State Commission, but continued to draw power for almost five
     months thereafter, under the said PSA, which conduct of the

     the Respondent No.2 realized that the power was available at a
     lower tariff than that was under the PSA, the Respondent No-2
     arbitrarily, illegally and unilaterally decided to discontinue the
     purchase of power by terminating the PSA.

n.   The termination of PSA without assigning any reason
     clearly indicates the fact that the Respondent No.2 wanted
     to take unjust benefit. The Respondent No.2 continued to
     draw power till such time as it suited them vis-a-vis the
     prevalent market rates.
</p>
<p id="p_59">o.   that the State Commission has further failed to appreciate the
     fact that the abrupt termination of PSA by the Respondent No.2
     has caused serious financial loss to the Appellant as the
     Appellant could not locate an alternate buyer which becomes
     more difficult as the decision of discontinuation was informed
     to the Appellant on 8.6.2011 at the onset of monsoon by when
     most of HEPs had already sold power for next 3-4 months and
     bilateral rates/power exchange rates had drastically fallen in
     view of onset of monsoon.
</p>
<p id="p_60">p.   that the State Commission has also failed to appreciate the fact
     that the Appellant with great difficulty was able to sell 100 MW
     power from the Baglihar HEP to Power Company of Karnataka
     and     Vedanta    and   MSEDCL      in    September,        2011        and
     AP/Chandigarh/WBSEDCL in October, 2011 at a tariff which
     was much lower than the tariff agreed in the said PSA. The
     Appellant, accordingly, had suffered substantial financial loss
     on account of illegal act of Respondent No.2 in abruptly
     discontinuing the purchase of power. The Appellant had
     suffered genuine and bonafide loss, and accordingly, has
     sought the compensation from the Respondent No-2 on account
     of short scheduling and scheduling at lesser rates which is
     attributed to the illegal act of Respondent No.2 in suddenly
     discontinuing the purchase of power.
</p>
<p id="p_61">q.   that the State Commission has also failed to consider the fact
     that it was agreed between the Appellant and the Respondent

     there   was   no   cap    on   trading    margin    by     the     Central

     Commission. It was further agreed that the trading margin will
     be Central Commission prescribed ceiling or 3% whichever is
     lower. As per the Regulation on Trading Margin as notified by
     the Central Commission in January 2010, it did not prescribe a
     cap on Trading Margin for long term contracts.

     per the agreed terms i.e. 3% of the tariff. However, keeping in

      the Appellant has a contract with Respondent No.3/M/s
      J&amp;K Power Development Corporation, which owns the
      generating company in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and that the
      non-purchase of electricity has caused a loss to the
      Appellant.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_70">(c)   that the Appellant is only a trading licensee and does not
      generate and supply electricity on its own. If at all any loss is
      caused (even assuming any breach), it is only of the generator
      which is to generate and supply the electricity. The generator
      has not initiated any action nor is it the case of the Appellant
      that the Appellant has paid any damages or compensation to
      the generator for any alleged breach of contract. The generator
      was the Respondent before the State Commission and also
      before this Appellate Tribunal in the instant Appeal.                   The
      generator has not chosen to appear and claim compensation for
      any alleged loss or damages suffered by it.
</p>
<p id="p_71">(d)   that the claim of the Appellant as a trading licensee claiming
      compensation on that score is ex-facie incorrect because it is

<p id="p_72">(e)   that in any event, there is no actionable claims or right
      available to the Appellant to claim the said amount of

      no long-term agreement between the parties wherein there was
      an obligation for PSPCL to purchase electricity from the
      Appellant for a specified period of time. The Appellant has to
      first establish the contractual agreement between the parties
      where under Respondent No.2/PSPCL is under an obligation to
      purchase electricity for which default the compensation has
      been claimed by the Appellant.

</p><p id="p_74">(f)   that the Appellant is an inter-state trading licensee purchasing
      and selling electricity in the present case on principal to
      principal basis. The Appellant and Respondent-PSPCL had
      entered into negotiations to explore the purchase of electricity
      by PSPCL from the Appellant. The electricity was proposed to
      be procured by PSPCL based on the representation of the
      Appellant that it has an agreement with Jammu &amp; Kashmir
      for purchase of electricity.
</p>
<p id="p_75">(g)   that, however, the purchase of electricity on long term basis
      being subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the State
      Commission, it was not open to Respondent-PSPCL to tie-up
      purchase of electricity on long term basis without the specific
      approval of the State Commission. In these circumstances, the
      Appellant and Respondent-PSPCL had executed a minutes of
      meeting, dated 26.3.2009, prescribing certain modalities for
      purchase of electricity by Respondent-PSPCL.
</p>
<p id="p_76">(h)   that it was specifically agreed between the parties that the
      power will be purchased by the Appellant on day-ahead basis

      Commission, the parties will once again discuss for an

                                                      Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


</p><p id="p_81">(k)   that only draft of the PSA was discussed between the parties. In
      the meanwhile, the Respondent-PSPCL had approached the
      State Commission for approval of the procurement of electricity
      from the Appellant. However, by order dated, 19.1.2011, the
      State Commission did not approve the said procurement of
      electricity or the PSA.
</p>
<p id="p_82">(l)   that in view of the above, and as agreed to between the
      parties, the PSA was never signed. The PSA was specifically
      agreed to be executed only after the approval from the State
      Commission. In any event, by operation of law, the PSA
      could not have been signed and enforced without the
      specific positive approval of the State Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_83">(m)   that the legal effect of the power procurement not being
      approved and the non-execution of the PSA is that there are no
      rights or obligations vested in the parties for continued purchase
      of electricity. The procurement was agreed to only on short-term
      day ahead basis in the meanwhile.
</p>
<p id="p_84">(n)   that Respondent-PSPCL had continued to draw electricity on day
      ahead basis from the Appellant till 8.6.2011. However, by
      communication, dated 8.6.2011, Respondent-PSPCL informed
      the Appellant that it shall not be purchasing electricity for the
      future period. The electricity being procured on day ahead basis,
      the contract between the parties was only when the electricity
      was to be procured for the following day. There is no vested right
      whatsoever in the Appellant to claim continued purchase of
      electricity by PSPCL or for payment of compensation on failure to
      purchase electricity.
</p>
<p id="p_85">(o)   that Appellant's contentions that there was a contract between
      the parties by conduct and, therefore, PSPCL is liable to pay
      compensation for breach of the contract is misconceived. The
      contract between the parties specifically and expressly

                                                                    Page (24)
                                                     Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


      states that purchase of power will only be on day ahead
      basis. The long-term contract was to be executed only after
      the approval from the State Commission, which did not
      happen. In the circumstances, there can be no dispute for
      the fact that the long-term contract did not come into force
      between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_86">(p)   that with regard to the short-term day ahead contract,
      PSPCL has fulfilled its obligation for payment of the agreed
      tariff for the electricity procured. The decisions on contract
      by conduct and payment of consideration thereof relied on
      by the Appellant would have any application only if the
      PSPCL had refused to pay the consideration for the
      electricity procured. In such an event, it could not have been
      the contention of PSPCL that since no PSA was executed; PSPCL
      would draw the electricity for free and not pay the consideration
      to the Appellant. However, PSPCL having paid the agreed
      consideration for the day ahead basis electricity drawn, there
      can be no claim for any implied contract or contract by conduct
      as claimed by the Appellant to give any right to the Appellant to
      claim compensation for non-procurement of electricity by PSPCL
      for the future.
</p>
<p id="p_87">(q)   that in the circumstances, when the contract between the
      parties specifically being only on day ahead basis, the condition
      for execution of long-term PSA not being fulfilled, there can be
      no question of any claim for compensation by the Appellant for
      non-procurement of electricity by PSPCL.
</p>
<p id="p_88">(r)   that the contention of the Appellant that it was not aware of the
      order, dated 19.1.2011, passed by the State Commission
      whereby the approval to the procurement of electricity on long-
      term basis was not granted is misconceived. Since, the order
      passed by the State Commission is a public document and is
      available on the website of the State Commission. It is not that
                                                                   Page (25)

            the Appellant was not aware of the proceedings before the State
            Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_89">      (s)   that in any event being aware or not aware of the order of the
            State Commission is of no consequence. The contract between
            the parties being contingent upon the approval by the State
            Commission, there can be no actionable claims of the contract to
            be executed or any claim thereon by the Appellant without the
            specific positive approval of the State Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_90">      (t)   that, in case, the Appellant came to be aware of the order, dated
            19.1.2011, passed by the State Commission in the month of
            June, 2011, no action whatsoever was taken by the Appellant till
            the filing of the present impugned petition before the State
            Commission in March, 2013. No legal action was taken by the
            Appellant in the year 2011 immediately upon coming to know of
            the order, dated 19.1.2011 passed by the State Commission.
            Further, the Appellant approached a wrong forum, namely
            Central Commission (CERC), which had no jurisdiction to
            entertain the petition. When the Appellant has failed to take any
            action whatsoever for more than 20 months by its own
            admission, there can be no question of the Appellant claiming
            any relief for not being aware of the order for a period of about 6
            months.     Consequently, there is no merit whatsoever in the
            claim for compensation made by the Appellant and the same is
            liable to be dismissed.

      there was no cap of the Central Commission (CERC). This
      contention of the Appellant is misconceived.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_92">(b)   that the Agreement between the parties is captured in the
      Minutes of the Meeting, dated 26.3.2009, and the Letter of
      Intent/Acceptance of the Appellant, dated 31.3.2009, based on
      which the electricity supply commenced from 1.4.2009. In the
      said documents the trading margin was agreed only at 4
      paise/kWh. The trading margin on 3% was to be applicable only
      after removal of cap by the Central Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_93">(c)   that on 26.3.2009, when the Minutes of the meeting was signed,
      and on 31.3.2009, when the Letter of Intent was issued, the
      trading margin as per the Central Commission's Regulations was
      only 4 paise/kWh, which was also applicable to short term day
      ahead    transactions.   This    was    duly   captured         in     the
      communication, dated 31.3.2009, of the PSPCL. PSPCL had not
      agreed to any amendment of the 4 paise/kWh trading margin.
</p>
<p id="p_94">(d)   that, subsequently, the trading margin cap was removed only for
      long term transactions and not for short term transactions. For
      short term transactions, the trading margin was only increased
      from 4 to 7 paise/kWh. This stipulation of trading margin at 7
      paise/kWh was the maximum ceiling. The Regulations stated
      that the short term trading margin shall not exceed 7 paise/unit.
      It could be at any level from 0 paise to 7 paise/unit.
</p>
<p id="p_95">(e)   that in the present case, the communication, dated 31.3.2009,
      stipulated the trading margin at 4 paise/unit which was then
      prevalent. The same had to be revised only when the trading
      margin cap was removed in which case it was 3% of the tariff.
      The   trading   margin   was    never   removed     for     short-term
      transactions and, therefore, the trading margin continued to be
      4 paise/unit, which was duly paid by the Respondent-PSPCL.

</p><p id="p_97">(f)   that the Agreement between the parties was not that the trading
      margin will be the Central Commission's cap as applicable from
      time to time, but was specific to 3% of the tariff or the Central
      Commission's cap. The parties to an agreement enter into the
      agreement need to have a consensus on the commercial terms.
      The trading margin is a commercial term and is not statutory in
      nature. The law only prescribes the ceiling and there is no
      prohibition for the parties to agree to a very low trading margin
      or even zero trading margin.
</p>
<p id="p_98">(g)   that at the time when the parties had agreed to the trading
      margin, the same was 4 paise/unit, which was agreed to. The
      Letter of Intent also recognizes 4 paise/unit, which then existed.
      There is no particular clause in the Minutes of the Meeting or
      the Letter of Intent that the trading margin will vary from time to
      time. The expression 'CERC prescribed ceiling or 3% of the tariff
      whichever is lower' is in the context of the contention of the
      Appellant that there was no ceiling prescribed by the Central
      Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_99">(h)   that in the circumstances, the parties had agreed that if there
      was a ceiling by the Central Commission on the trading margin
      which was lower than 3% of the tariff, the same would be
      applicable. The fixation of the trading margin was at the time of
      the agreement and was not made subject to change from time to
      time. It was never agreed that the trading margin would vary
      from time to time based on the applicable trading margin
      regulations. If otherwise, the clause would have read as
      'trading     margin     will    be   CERC      prescribed     ceiling       as
      applicable from time to time or 3% of the tariff whichever is
      lower'. This would require addition of words to the contract
      which is impermissible.
</p>
<p id="p_100">(i)   that the claim for trading margin by the Appellant at 11
      paise/unit    is   illegal.    The   trading   margin   for     short-term
                                                                         Page (28)

            transactions was never withdrawn by the Central Commission
            and only the trading margin on long term agreements was
            removed. The present transaction between the Appellant and
            PSPCL being on day-ahead basis, does not qualify as long term
            supply for the trading margin to be claim at 11 paise per unit.
            The Appellant has not established the legal basis for the claim
            and the non-applicability of the trading margin Regulations,
            which onus is on the Appellant.

<p id="p_101">12.   Per contra, the learned counsel for the Respondent No.2/PSPCL, on
the issue of additional water usage charges in the State of Jammu &amp;
Kashmir, has made the following submissions:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      (a)   that the said claim of the Appellant for payment of water
            charges, is misconceived. At the outset, the said cess is to be
            paid by the generator, which is Respondent No.3. The Appellant
            has not even paid the said cess, or it is not even the case the
            Appellant that the Appellant is required to pay it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">      (b)   that in any event, even the merits of the said claim for payment
            of water charges is misconceived. Firstly, the contract between
            the parties was not for purchase of electricity on cost plus basis.
            It was not that individual cost and expenditure are identified and
            only a reasonable regulated tariff was being paid by PSPCL,
            wherein for additional cost and expenditure to be claimed as
            passed through. There was no restriction or provision for the
            total amount of profit that can be earned by the generator on
            generation of electricity. In such circumstances, claiming
            additional costs as alleged tax paid is not tenable.

<blockquote id="blockquote_40">      (c)   that, further, the minutes of the meeting between the parties
            provided for only cess, tax or duty imposed on generation, sale
            or trading of electricity to be additionally payable by PSPCL.

      Before claiming any amount under the said clause, the Appellant
      has to first establish that the tax is on generation of electricity.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_102">(d)   that the Appellant has neither placed the relevant provisions of
      law based on which the additional amount is claimed as a tax,
      nor the basis on which the same constitutes a tax on generation
      or trading or sale of electricity. The claim of the Appellant is that
      the tax is only on water that flows and not on the generation of
      electricity. The chargeability of tax appears to be on water and
      not on generation, though the calculation may be based on
      generation. The nature of a tax is based on the chargeability
      provision and so long the Appellant does not establish that the
      source and chargeability of tax is on generation, trading or sale
      of electricity, the claim cannot be entertained. The mere claim
      that the tax is payable, without producing the relevant
      provisions to establish that the said statutory provisions fulfill
      the conditions mentioned in the PPA for payment of tax cannot
      be considered.
</p>
<p id="p_103">(e)   that, further, even assuming that the tax is payable and is on
      generation of electricity, unless the Appellant establishes that
      the tax has been actually paid and produces evidence to show
      the payment, the same cannot be claimed by the Appellant from
      the Respondent-PSPCL.
</p>
<p id="p_104">(f)   that <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_11">Section 64A</a> of the Sale of Goods Act does not apply to the
      present case because the said provision applies only if there is
      no agreement between the parties to the contrary. In the present
      case, the Agreement specifically provides for specific elements to
      be a pass through, which automatically implies that other
      elements are not a pass through. In case all taxes are pass-
      through, there is no purpose of specifying specific elements.
</p>
<p id="p_105">(g)   that the said claim of the Appellant is misconceived by the fact
      that hydro stations in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the reimbursement of

      water cess in the tariff was occasioned not based on being a tax
      on generation of electricity, but by a separate regulation which
      was required to be framed by the Central Commission. The
      Respondent-PSPCL has certain allocations from the Hydro
      Plants of National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) in the State
      of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. NHPC is presently supplying power to
      PSPCL from ten hydro power plants as per share allocation by
      Ministry of Power/Government of India.

<p id="p_106">(h)   that in October 2010, the State Govt. of J &amp; K passed the
      Jammu &amp; Kashmir Water Resources (Regulation &amp; <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_12">Management)
      Act</a>, 2010. In terms of the said Act, water usage charges have
      been levied on usage of water including generation of electricity
      by any user and the user is required to obtain license. The State
      Water Resources Regulatory Authority established by Jammu &amp;
      Kashmir Govt. by its order, dated 1.2.2011, fixed the water
      usage charges for generation of electricity @ Rs. 0.25/cu.mtr. of
      water w.e.f. November 2010, valid for a period of 2 years.

      interim order, dated 4.5.2011, has directed the NHPC to apply
      for license and deposit the water usage charges raised by the J &amp;
      K State Water Resources Regulatory Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_108">(j)   that, thereafter, NHPC filed a petition before the Central
      Commission bearing Petition No.106/2011 for reimbursement of
      these   charges     from       the   beneficiary   states.    The      Central
      Commission,       vide   its    Order,    dated    21.10.2011,        allowed
      reimbursement of these charges from beneficiary states. Since
      there was no provision of recovering water usage charges in the
      Central Commission's Tariff Regulations 2009, the Central
      Commission, further, directed for an appropriate amendment to
                                                                           Page (31)

      the Tariff Regulations 2009. The said amendment was issued by
      the Central Commission on 31.12.2012 providing further that
      said amendment shall be subject to the decision of the Hon'ble

      NHPC to J &amp; K State Water Resources Regulatory Authority,
      Jammu was billed to PSPCL in six equal monthly installments
      along with interest. However, the crucial aspect in respect to the
      above is the relevant clause in the PPAs entered into between
      PSPCL and NHPC on 23.10.2012, which PPA contains the clause
      that any taxes, duties, cess etc in respect of generation and
      supply of electricity would automatically result in revision in
      tariff. However, the water cess, which was levied, was not
      covered by the above clause and it is for this reason that the
      regulation had to be amended by the Central Commission rather
      than by application of the change in law provision in the PPA.
</p>
<p id="p_110">(l)   that the claim of the Appellant is in fact not pursuant to the
      arrangement in issue wherein the electricity was procured on
      day ahead basis in terms of the minutes of the meeting, dated
      26.3.2009, and letter, dated 31.3.2009, but under a separate
      PPA, dated 31.3.2011, for a capacity of 75MW and, hence, the
      said claim is also misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_111">(m)   that the disputes under a separate PPA is a different cause of
      action and cannot be clubbed in one petition, wherein the claim
      was in relation to the 100 MW for which the PSA was not signed.

<p id="p_112">(n)   that in any event, the claim of water charges was prevalent even
      when the said PPA was entered into. Even assuming the water
      charges to be a tax on generation, the said tax was prevalent
      when the PPA was entered into and does not apply even as per

                                                           Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


the said PSA was not granted by the State Commission.      Consequently, the
said PSA remained unsigned by the parties. There are only two documents
i.e. Minutes of the Meeting, dated 26.3.2009, and the Letter of Intent, dated
31.3.2009, and on the basis of these two documents, both the parties
proceeded further and the 100 MW electricity was purchased by the
Respondent No.2 from the Appellant relying on the Minutes of the Meeting,
dated 26.3.2009.    As per clause 5 of the Minutes of the Meeting, the
Appellant has agreed for Day-Ahead open access booking for flow of power
from 1.4.2009 till CERC finalizes regulations of Medium-Term- open access.
The matter will again be discussed with PTC as and when the Medium-Term
regulations are finalized by CERC. It has been provided in the said Minutes
of the Meeting, dated 26.3.2009, that PSA shall be initialed after the
approval of PSEB and signed after the approval by the State Commission.
It is evident from the Letter of Intent, dated 31.3.2009, issued by the
Respondent No.2 to the Appellant that the power was to be procured on
Day-ahead basis by the Respondent No.2 @ Rs. 3.65/KWH plus trading
margin (presently 4 paise/unit). The Respondent No.2 requested the
Appellant to schedule the power from 1.4.2009 on day-ahead basis
reservation of open access corridor basis. The transaction was on day-ahead
basis of open access. The power was to be procured by the Respondent
No.2 from the Appellant on day-today basis only on the day-ahead basis and
the same was acted upon by the Appellant and the electricity was sold on
day-ahead basis by the Appellant to the Respondent No.2.
</p>

<p id="p_123">16.   It is further evident from the Minutes of the Meeting, dated 26.3.2009,
that even after the framing of Medium-Term Open Access Regulations by the
Central Commission, it was for the parties to once again discuss and agree
upon the procurement of electricity on medium-term basis, which occasion
did not arise. The Appellant and the Respondent No.2 have never discussed
and agreed for procurement of electricity on medium-term basis even after
framing of the Medium-Term Open Access Regulations by the Central
Commission.
</p>

<p id="p_124">                                                                         Page (36)
                                                            Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


</p><p id="p_125">17.    The position further emerges is that only the draft of PSA was
discussed between the Appellant and the Respondent No.2. In the
meanwhile, the Respondent No.2-PSPCL had approached the State
Commission for approval of the procurement of electricity from the
Appellant but, the State Commission, vide order, dated 19.1.2011, did not
approve the said PSA or the procurement of electricity. Thus, the PSA was
never signed. The PSA was specifically agreed to be executed and signed
only after the approval from the State Commission.       In our view, in any
event by operation of law, the PSA could not have been signed and enforced
without the specific approval of the State Commission, which is the
Electricity Regulatory Authority in the State. Consequently, the legal effect
of the power procurement not being approved and the non-execution and
non-signing of the PSA is that there are no rights or obligations vested in the
parties to continue purchase of electricity. The aforesaid procurement was
agreed only on the short term open access day-ahead basis in the
meanwhile. The Respondent No. 2 had continued to draw electricity on day-
ahead basis from the Appellant w.e.f. 1.4.2009 to 8.6.2011.                      The
Respondent No.2, vide its communication, dated 8.6.2011, informed the
Appellant that it shall not be purchasing electricity for future period. The
electricity being procured on day-ahead basis, the contract between the
parties was only when the electricity was to be procured for the following
day.    There is no vested right whatsoever in the Appellant to claim
continued purchase of electricity by the Respondent No.2-PSPCL or for
payment of compensation on failure to purchase electricity.
</p>

<p id="p_126">18.    We are unable to accept the Appellant's contention that in view of the
Minutes of the Meeting, dated 26.3.2009, and the Letter of Intent, dated
31.3.2009, issued by the Respondent No.2, there was a contract between
the parties by conduct and, therefore, the Respondent No.2-PSPCL is liable
to pay the compensation for breach of the contract. We may mention here
that the PSA between the Appellant and the Respondent No.2 expressly
states that purchase of power will be on day-ahead basis and long-term
contract was to be executed only after the approval of the State

                                                                          Page (37)
                                                          Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


Commission, which did not happen. In these circumstances, there appears
to be no dispute of the fact that the long-term contract did not come into
force or existence between the parties, as the PSA was not approved by the
State Commission and was never signed by the parties i.e. the Appellant
and the Respondent No.2-PSPCL.
</p>

<p id="p_127">19.   We further note that with regard to the short-term day-ahead contract,
the Respondent No.2 has fulfilled its obligations for payment of the agreed
tariff for the electricity procured. The decision on contract by conduct and
payment of consideration thereof as relied on by the Appellant, would have
application only if the Respondent No.2 had refused to pay the
consideration for the electricity procured.   The Respondent No.2-PSPCL
having paid the agreed consideration for the day ahead basis electricity
drawn, there can be no claim for any implied contract or contract by
conduct as claimed by the Appellant so as to give any right to the Appellant
to claim compensation for non-procurement of electricity by the Respondent
No.2-PSPCL in future. Since, the contract between the parties was only on
day-ahead basis, the decision for execution of long-term PSA was not
fulfilled hence; there is no question of any claim for compensation by the
Appellant for non-procurement of electricity by the Respondent No.2-PSPCL
from the Appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_128">20.   We further observe that the State Commission, in the impugned order,
has legally and correctly appreciated that there was no contract for supply
of 100 MW of electricity between the Appellant and the Respondent No.2 for
a period of 12 years.    Merely affirming the contents of the PSA agreed
between the Appellant and the Respondent No.2-PSPCL and the terms and
conditions of the said PSA which was subsequently confirmed in the
Minutes of the Meeting, dated 26.3.2009, and the Letter of Intent, dated
31.3.2009, issued by the Respondent No.2 does not constitute legal
agreement, which could not be approved by the State Commission and
which could not be signed by the parties i.e. Appellant and the Respondent
No.2-PSPCL. The said PSA was for purchase of power on day-ahead basis,

                                                                        Page (38)
                                                             Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


which cannot be termed as an arrangement for sale of purchase of power on
long term basis for the period of 12 years.        The parties agreed to the
arrangement of day-ahead basis power purchase and they continued for
more than 2 years to transact the business at the rate provided in the
Minutes of the Meeting and the Letter of Intent. The Respondent No.2 has
tried its best for approval of the said PSA from the State Commission by way
of filing the Petition No. 15 of 2009 but the said PSA was not approved by
the State Commission rather, it vide its order, dated 19.1.2011, suggested
the Respondent No.2 to initiate the process for competitive bidding and then
in the suitable situation to approach the State Commission again for
approval of the said PSA which did not happen.          It is evident that the
Respondent No.2-PSPCL has made all the outstanding payments to the
Appellant and all the claims made by the Appellant in the impugned Petition
No. 15 of 2013 cannot be said to be justified and the State Commission has
rightly rejected all the claims prayed for by the Appellant in the said petition
being Petition No. 15 of 2013.

</p>

<p id="p_133">24.   SUMMARY OF OUR FINDINGS:
</p>
<p id="p_134">24.1 In case, a Power Sale Agreement (PSA) is agreed between the power
trader and the distribution licensee for sale and purchase of electricity on a
long term basis for 12 years from the Commercial Operation Date (COD) of
the project of some power generator and the condition of the draft PSA is
that the said draft PSA shall be initialed after the approval of the concerned
State Electricity Board (the predecessor of the distribution licensee) and
after the initial of the draft PSA by the State Electricity Board, the petition
has to be filed for the approval of the said draft PSA before the State
Commission, as per the terms and conditions of the draft PSA, and further,
if the PSA is not approved by the State Commission and the PSA

                                                                            Page (40)
                                                           Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


consequently remains unsigned by the parties to it, the draft PSA cannot be
said to be a legally binding contract because the draft PSA has not been
converted into the legal contract giving rise to the rights and obligations of
the parties to the contract.
</p>
<p id="p_135">24.2 The    subsequent     meeting   held    on   26.3.2009     between          the
Appellant/Power Trader and the Respondent No.2/Distribution Licensee
regarding sale of power whereby the terms of the said PSA were crystallized
and reiterated and reduced to the Minutes of the Meeting (MOM) and signed
by the parties and in pursuance thereof, a Letter of Intent/acceptance,
dated 31.3.2009, was issued by the distribution licensee to the power trader
and in case both the parties acting upon the said minutes of the meeting
and the power trader started selling contracted quantum of power to the
distribution licensee on Day-Ahead Open Access basis and the distribution
licensee procuring the same on day-ahead basis and both continued to act
for about 2 years, the said PSA could be said to be converted into a legal
and enforceable contract as a result of conduct of the parties. The minutes
of the meeting and letter of intent can only be said to be the guiding factor
for both the parties.    But the said PSA cannot be said to have been
converted into an agreement legally enforceable in law. The PSA which is
not approved by the State Commission and consequently, not signed by the
parties to the PSA is of no legal consequence. The facts of the present case
clearly depict that all the outstanding dues relating to procurement of
power, as per the minutes of the meeting, have legally and correctly been
paid by the Respondent No.2/Distribution Licensee to the Appellant/Power
Trader. The claims of the power trader regarding compensation for abruptly
discontinuing the purchase of power by the distribution licensee from the
power trader cannot be said to be justified. Trading margin has legally been
paid by the Respondent No.2/Distribution Licensee to the Appellant/Power
Trader. All the claims made by the Appellant have rightly and legally been
rejected by the State Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_136">24.3 The State Commission has rightly held that the PSA between the
Appellant and the Respondent No.2, the finalization of terms and conditions

                                                                         Page (41)
                                                            Judgment in Appeal No. 329 of 2013


of the PSA, signing of the Minutes of the Meeting (MOM), dated 26.3.2009,
and subsequently, acceptance of the minutes of the meeting by the
Respondent No.2 through its Letter of Intent, dated 31.3.2009, cannot make
the said PSA as conclusive and legally binding on the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_137">24.4 The State Commission has also legally and correctly held that the
power sold by the Appellant to the Respondent No.2 under the unsigned and
unapproved PSA and in terms of the Minutes of the Meeting, dated
26.3.2009, cannot be said to be power purchase on a long term basis
because after the framing of regulations by the Central Commission, the
matter was further to be discussed between the parties and no such
occasion arose for such kind of discussion even after framing of the relevant
regulations by the Central Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_138">24.5 The State Commission has rightly concluded that the Appellant is not
entitled for any compensation allegedly said to be outstanding payments
including trading margin along with interest and water usage charges as
prayed in the petition before the State Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_139">25.   In view of the above, we do not find any merits in the Appeal and the
instant Appeal, being Appeal No. 329 of 2013, is hereby dismissed without
any order as to costs. The impugned order, dated 10.10.2013, passed by
the State Commission in Petition No. 15 of 2013, is hereby affirmed.
