<p id="p_1">I.A. 3267/2013 (under Order XXXIX Rule 1 &amp; 2, CPC)


</p><p id="p_2">1. This is a suit for commercial disparagement. The plaintiff has

     sought an interim injunction restraining the defendant from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                     Page 1 of 19</span>
     publishing advertisements or using any depiction or any other

    indica which disparages the goodwill and reputation of the

    plaintiff‟s product sold under the trade mark             DETTOL

    HEALTHY KITCHEN. A brief summary of the controversy is as

    follows.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2. The plaintiff‟s case is that it has been involved with the

    manufacture of the famous antiseptic liquid under the trademark

    DETTOL for over 70 years and is a market leader of this segment

    with approximately 85% of the market share in India. Recently, the

    plaintiff has come up with a new product DETTOL HEALTHY

    KITCHEN Dish and Slab Gel", which is purportedly the first

    kitchen cleaner with an active ingredient (Lactic Acid) which helps

    kill germs. The plaintiff claims that the product has clinically been

    proven to have germ killing capabilities and is claimed to be much

    more efficacious than ordinary kitchen cleaners.

</p><p id="p_4">3. To promote their new product, the plaintiff came out with an

    advertising campaign on television comparing the germ killing

    capabilities of its product and the defendant‟s VIM LIQUID. In


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                     Page 2 of 19</span>
     addition, the plaintiff also introduced a print advertising campaign.

    Both these advertisements purportedly contained truthful statements

    about the germ killing capabilities of the two competing products.

    Admittedly, the defendant herein filed a suit against the plaintiff for

    disparaging advertisement before the Calcutta High Court vide Suit

    No. TN 50 of 2013. However, the Court passed a consent order in

    this matter allowing the plaintiff to continue with the impugned

    television advertisement subject to small variations.

</p><p id="p_5">4. The plaintiff contends that in retaliation, the defendant came out

    with an advertisement published in the Sunday Times Edition dated

    February 24, 2013, in which the defendant has purportedly

    disparaged the plaintiff and its brand DETTOL. It is contended that

    in the advertisement, the defendant has maliciously equated its

    product to a "Harsh Antiseptic". The question asked in the initial

    portion of the advertisement is:
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">        "A Harsh Antiseptic or the power of 100 lemons - which one

        would you choose to clean your child's tiffin?"



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                       Page 3 of 19</span>
     The plaintiff alleges that this reference in the advertisement was

    clearly directed to the plaintiff‟s brand DETTOL being referred to

    as a Harsh Antiseptic. The plaintiff contends that an attempt has

    been made to misrepresent to the consumers that the plaintiff‟s

    DETTOL ANTISEPTIC LIQUID and DETTOL HEALTHY

    KITCHEN have the same ingredients. It also contends that the

    defendant has attempted to misrepresent that the plaintiff has done

    nothing but repackage its Antiseptic Liquid as DETTOL

    HEALTHY KITCHEN and the reference to "harsh antiseptic" in

    itself is denigrating of the plaintiff‟s brand DETTOL.


</p><p id="p_8">5. The plaintiff contends that to further worsen the misrepresentation,

    the defendant‟s advertisement mentions:
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">        "An Antiseptic is for cleaning wounds and floors. Would you use

        to clean the utensils your family eats from?"
</p>
<p id="p_11">
    It contends that this statement further established the target brand to

    be that of the plaintiff‟s DETTOL ANTISPETIC LIQUID which is

    extensively advertised for the use in cleaning wounds and floors,

    particularly in hospitals. The plaintiff has also sought to clarify that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                       Page 4 of 19</span>
     DETTOL ANTISEPTIC LIQUID and DETTOL HEALTHY

    KITCHEN have entirely different formulations. Though both the

    products have efficient germ killing capabilities, DETTOL

    ANTISEPTIC LIQUID contains chloroxylenol (PCMX), whereas

    DETTOL HEALTHY KITCHEN is said to contain Lactic Acid.


</p><p id="p_12">6. The plaintiff also contends that the advertisement thereafter

    mentions


        "NO ONE REMOVES GREASE BETTER*


        NO ONE REMOVES GERMS BETTER*"
</p>
<p id="p_13">
    This claim is said to contain a disclaimer in very fine print stating


        "*compared to leading brands tested under lab conditions on

        selective organisms and as per lab cleaning test/consumer test."


</p><p id="p_14">7. The plaintiff contends that this is a false statement because it is

    clinically tested that its product was more efficacious at germ

    killing than the defendant‟s product, as evidenced from the SGS

    Report filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also submits that despite

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                       Page 5 of 19</span>
     being more effective in respect of germ killing, it also has a

    toxicology        report   declaring   that   the   plaintiff‟s     DETTOL

    HEALTHY KITCHEN does not result in any human health

    concern.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8. The plaintiff contends that this advertisement campaign by the

    defendant is outside the parameters of allowed competitive

    advertising and blatantly denigrates the reputation and goodwill of

    the plaintiff‟s brand. And that the defendant being in the same

    sector as that of the plaintiff is well aware of the goodwill and

    reputation attached to the plaintiff‟s brand DETTOL and is aiming

    at illegally destroying this reputation for its own commercial

    benefits thereby causing an irreparable injury to the plaintiff. It is

    also contended that the defendants are attempting to increase the

    market share of their product VIM LIQUID by defaming and

    disparaging the worth and reputation of the plaintiff‟s product

    because, the plaintiff‟s product is a new entrant into the same

    market sector as the defendant‟s.

    vs. S. Balasubramanian, MANU/TN/1566/2001.
</p>
<p id="p_19">10.In response to these allegations, the defendant has filed a reply

    stating that the impugned advertisement made no reference to

    DETTOL HEALTHY KITCHEN Dish &amp; Slab Gel. The defendant

    submits that the ad-campaign only sought to inform the consumers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                   Page 7 of 19</span>
     that harsh antiseptics were not fit for cleaning utensils. And that the

    impugned advertisement uses the term HARSH ANTISEPTIC by

    which they mean those antiseptics which are particularly strong in

    concentration and that the plaintiff‟s product, by their own

    classification does not fall under the category of „harsh antiseptic‟

    and therefore, the complaint of the plaintiff was baseless and

    frivolous.
</p>
<p id="p_20">11.The defendant contends that merely because the plaintiff sold

    antiseptic liquid did not rationally imply that the impugned

    advertisement denigrated or disparaged the kitchen and slab gel of

    the plaintiff. And that the plaintiff has not filed any conclusive

    evidence to show that the overwhelming majority of consumers

    associate the term „harsh antiseptic‟ in reference to the plaintiff‟s

    products. Further, the defendant submits that it is entitled to puff its

    products; and that the plaintiff cannot be hypersensitive to such a

    puffery. And that the advertisement campaign was purely intended

    to promote their product to be superior to those of other competitors

    which was within their fundamental right of free speech and

    expression as guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_10">Art. 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution.

     The defendant submits that the advertisement was in line with the

    principles as postulated by Advertising Standards Council of India

    (ASCI). It is also claimed that the plaint is a retaliatory action made

    out of vengeance against the suit filed by the defendant against the

    plaintiff in the Calcutta High Court.

</p><p id="p_23"> 13.I have heard the arguments of the Ld. Counsels for both parties and

    also perused through the documents placed on record including the

    impugned newspaper advertisement. I am of the considered view

    that prima facie the impugned advertisement subtly yet certainly

    targets the plaintiff‟s brand DETTOL and its product DETTOL

    HEALTHY KITCHEN. I have arrived at this conclusion for the

    following reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_24">14.With regards to comparative advertising, the law is well settled.

    This Court in the case of Dabur India Ltd v. Colortek Meghalaya

    Pvt. Ltd and Godrej Sara-Lee, (Supra), while referring to the law

    laid down by the Supreme Court, has shaped the following guiding

    principles regarding puffery of a product:
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        (i)      An advertisement is commercial speech and is protected
                 by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_19">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        (ii)     An advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair or
                 deceptive.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (iii)    Of course, there would be some grey areas but these need
                 not necessarily be taken as serious representation of facts
                 but only as glorifying one‟s product.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                        Page 10 of 19</span>
<p id="p_26"> 15.This Court in Dabur-Colortek also considered the finding of the
    Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_20">Pepsi Co. Inc. &amp;Ors vs. Hindustan
    Coca</a> cola Ltd. &amp; Anr., 2003 (27) PTC 305 (Del) (DB), and added
    a fourth prong to this test, i.e.

</p><p id="p_27">        (iv)     While glorifying its product, an advertiser may not
                 denigrate or disparage a rival product.
</p>
<p id="p_28">16.A Ld. Single Judge of this Court, in the Marico Case (supra), while
    observing the principles laid down by the Division Bench in the
    Dabur-Colortek Case (supra), stated that the generic disparagement
    of a rival product, without specifically identifying or pin-pointing
    the rival product is objectionable. It was held that, in view of the
    law laid down Tata Press Ltd. v. MTNL (1995) 5 SCC 139, false,
    misleading, unfair and deceptive advertising is not protected under
    „commercial speech‟. It was additionally observed that earlier
    judgments, which held that a tradesman is entitled to declare his
    goods to be the best in the world even though the declaration is
    untrue and to say that his goods are better than his competitors,
    even though such statement is untrue, is no longer good law. The
    Division Bench in the Dabur-Colortek Case (supra) also held that
    while hyped-up advertising may be permissible, it cannot transgress
    the grey areas of permissible assertion, and if it does so, it must
    have some reasonable factual basis for the assertion made and that it
    is not permissible for anybody to make an off-the-cuff or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                     Page 11 of 19</span>
     unsubstantiated claim that his goods are the best in the world or that
    his goods are better than that of a rival.
</p>
<p id="p_29">17.The Ld. Single Judge in the Marico Case has also placed reliance
    on an earlier finding of a Division bench of this Court in the Pepsi
    Co. Case (supra) wherein it was held that comparative advertising
    is    permissible      as   long   as   while   comparing   own      with
    rival/competitors product, the latter‟s product is not derogated,
    discredited, disgraced, though while comparing some amount of
    „showing down‟ is implicit; however the same should be within the
    confines of De Beers Abrasive v. International General Electric
    Co., 1975 (2) All ER 599, which Courts in India have frequently
    referred to. The case sums up the law relating to false advertising
    causing injury to rival traders group pithily as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         "the law is that any trader is entitled to puff his own goods even
         though such puff as a matter of pure logic involves the
         denigration of his rival's good...Notices...reading 'the best
         tailor in the world', 'the best tailor in this town' and the 'best
         tailor in this street' do not commit an actionable offence. Where
         however, the situation is not that the trader is puffing his own
         goods but turns to denigrate the goods of his rival...then the
         situation is not so clear-cut. The statement 'my goods are better
         than X's' is only a more dramatic presentation of what is
         implicit in the statement 'my goods are the best in the world'
         and would not be actionable. However, the statement 'my goods
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                        Page 12 of 19</span>
         are better than X's because X's are absolute rubbish' would be
        actionable."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">18.Moreover, the subsequent Division Bench in Dabur-Colortek
    echoed the same view as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "In Pepsi Co. it was held that certain factors have to be kept in
        mind while deciding a question of disparagement. These factors
        are (i) intent of the commercial; (ii) manner of the commercial;
        and (iii) storyline of the commercial and the message sought to
        be conveyed. While we agree with these factors, we would like to
        amplify or restate them in the following terms:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        (1) The intent of the advertisement - this can be understood from
        its story line and the message sought to be conveyed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        (2) The overall effect of the advertisement - does it promote the
        advertiser's product or does it disparage or denigrate a rival
        product? In this context it must be kept in mind that while
        promoting its product the advertiser may, while comparing it
        with a rival or a competing product, make an unfavorable
        comparison but that might not necessarily affect the story line
        and message of the advertised product or have that as its overall
        effect.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        (3) The manner of advertising - is the comparison by and large
        truthful or does it falsely denigrate or disparage a rival
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                        Page 13 of 19</span>
         product? While truthful disparagement is permissible, untruthful
        disparagement is not permissible."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">19.At this juncture, it must be borne in mind that this Court at this
    stage should take only a prima facie opinion and not render any
    final finding on the correctness or otherwise of the claims in the
    advertisement of the defendant. While both the plaintiff and
    defendant have produced various lab reports to corroborate the
    „germ killing‟ and „germ removal‟ capabilities of their respective
    products, this is not the stage in this suit for me to determine the
    veracity of the claims made in the adverts. It is only for me to
    determine if the impugned advertisement makes a reference, either
    express or implied to the product of the plaintiff and denigrates it.
    Though the defendant has vehemently contended that its
    advertisement is not directed towards the plaintiff‟s product and is
    directed towards general awareness of the customers regarding the
    inappropriate usage of antiseptic in washing utensils, it is common
    knowledge that the plaintiff‟s brand DETTOL is synonymous with
    the term antiseptic in the FMCG market in India. The plaintiff has
    also furnished Google image results for the search term „antiseptic‟,
    wherein the plaintiff‟s products constitute the majority of the search
    results. Though I am not squarely relying on the finding of this
    Court in the case of <a href="/doc/62246857/" id="a_21">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. v. Hindustan
    Unilever Ltd</a>., 2008 (38) PTC 139 (Del.) (DETTOL Soap Case), it
    is pertinent to note that the Court has observed the existence of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">C.S. (O.S.) No. 375/2013                                      Page 14 of 19</span>
     notion that all DETTOL products are antiseptic. In the Dettol Case,
    it was observed by this Court thus -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        "It is true that the plaintiff's soap - DETTOL Original - is not an
        antiseptic soap whereas the soap shown in the advertisement has
        been referred to as "an ordinary antiseptic soap". An argument
        was advanced on the part of the defendant that because of this,
        the soap shown in the advertisement did not and could not refer
        to the plaintiff's soap. The learned counsel for the plaintiff
        submitted that the reference to an antiseptic soap in the said
        advertisement is, in fact, a further pointer to the plaintiff's
        product, although, the plaintiff's soap - DETTOL Original - is
        not an antiseptic soap. According to him, this is so because of
        the well-known fact that the plaintiff's antiseptic liquid product
        has been utilised for years in homes as well as in hospitals for
        various cuts and wounds and other antiseptic purposes. The
        public at large, therefore, carry an impression, right or wrong,
        in their minds that all DETTOL products are antiseptic. The
        defendant, being aware of this, has specifically shown an
        antiseptic soap so that the viewers of the advertisement shall
        immediately be directed towards the plaintiff's DETTOL
        products. This, along with the other features mentioned above,
        clearly establishes the link between the soap shown in the
        advertisement and the plaintiff's soap. I agree with these
        submissions." (emphasis supplied).

<p id="p_32"> 20.As observed in the DETTOL Soap Case, for reasons right or wrong,

    the public at large carry an impression in their minds that all

    DETTOL products are antiseptic. Therefore, the usage of the term

    antiseptic in the impugned advertisement directs the viewers of the

    advertisement to the plaintiff‟s brand or product. However, the

    defendant has contended that it has deliberately used the term

    „harsh antiseptic‟ to connote antiseptic which is concentrated.

</p><p id="p_33">21.I do not find any merit in the defendant‟s submissions that the term

    „harsh antiseptic‟ did not refer to the plaintiff‟s brand or product,

    but was used to connote an antiseptic which was concentrated. I am

    of the opinion that the usage of the term „harsh antiseptic‟ in fact

    refers to an antiseptic which is harsh, wherein the term „harsh‟ is

    used as an adjective. If the defendant chose to convey to the

    consumers a general warning regarding the harmful effects of

    antiseptic products which were concentrated, the term „concentrated

    antiseptic‟ would have conveyed it more aptly without any negative

    connotation as attached with the word „harsh‟. By using the

    adjective „harsh‟ along with the indicative word „antiseptic‟ with

    respect to cleaning utensils from which food is consumed, the

     defendant is trying to connote the consumers that the plaintiff‟s

    product, DETTOL HEALTHY KITCHEN, has the same effect as

    that of its other product DETTOL ANTISEPTIC LIQUID. Such a

    linkage between the two products with completely different

    formulations misleads the consumers and deters them from

    purchasing the plaintiff‟s product, thereby affecting them

    prejudicially.
</p>
<p id="p_34">22.With respect to the defendant‟s argument that the plaintiff has not

    established conclusively that the overwhelming majority of

    consumers associate the term „harsh antiseptic‟ in reference to the

    plaintiff‟s products, I have seen the media reports filed by the

    plaintiff. It is prima facie clear from the reports carried out in

    leading press agencies such as Business Standard, as well as

    internet and social media such as indiatelevision.com, firstpost.com,

    twitter.com and other blogging sites, the public is aware that the

    impugned advertisement is directed towards the plaintiff‟s

    brand/product and perceived as the response of the defendant to a

    new entrant in the kitchen cleaners market.

</p><p id="p_36"> 23.Relying upon the ratio of Dabur-Colortek, Pepsi-Co as well as Ðe

    Beers, the defendant‟s claim that "NO ONE REMOVES GREASE

    BETTER;NO ONE REMOVES GERMS BETTER" can be

    considered to fall within the purview of permissive comparative

    advertising. However, by stating that, "An Antiseptic is for cleaning

    wounds and floors. Would you use to clean the utensils your family

    eats from? An antiseptic is for cleaning wounds and floors. Would

    you use it to clean the utensils your family eats from?", the

    defendant is to that extent impliedly referring to the plaintiff‟s

    product by appealing to the consumer‟s perception that the

    plaintiff‟s product must be a „harsh antiseptic‟; and thereby

    denigrating the plaintiff‟s product.

<p id="p_37">24.I am of the considered opinion that the plaintiff has made out a

    prima facie case and demonstrated that the irreparable injury and

    balance of convenience lies with it. Therefore, I hereby pass an

    interim order restraining the defendant to the extent indicated above

    from publishing the impugned advertisement or any other similar

    advertisement or depiction aimed at disparaging the goodwill and
