ORDER:

<p id="p_1">(Per
: MR.JUSTICE D.H.WAGHELA)
 

 


 

</p><p id="p_2">1.		Upon
this appeal being listed for hearing with several such appeals,
nearly 200 other appeals were also caused to be listed in view of
common issue of maintainability of such appeals having arisen in
light of recent Division Bench decision of this Court in Gustadji
Dhanjisha Buhariwala v. Nevil Bamansha Buhariwala [2011(2) G.L.H.
147].
</p><p id="p_3"> That decision was rendered in the background of facts wherein the
order of learned Single Judge in the matter arising from suit
proceedings pending in a Civil Court was sought to be challenged
before the Division Bench under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The
Division Bench has taken the view that the petition before learned
Single Judge was substantially under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution
of India and supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court was invoked.
The group of appeals now listed for hearing before this Court arises
from decisions of learned Single Judges in the petitions wherein
awards and orders of Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals are
called into question. The difference in the factual background,
however, would pale into insignificance in view of specific ratio and
findings recorded in the erudite and elaborate judgment in Gustadji
(supra).
</p><p id="p_4">Therefore, all the advocates appearing in the appeals listed together
before this Court were permitted to argue on the preliminary issue as
to whether the appeals were required to be entertained on merits or
whether they were liable to be dismissed only on the ground of their
non-maintainability.  Learned counsel Mr.Asim Pandya, learned Senior
Advocate Mr.K.M. Patel, learned counsel Mr.Hasit Joshi, Mr.G.M.
Joshi, Ms.Vandana Bhatt, Mr.S.J. Gaekwad as well as learned
Government Pleader Mr.P.K. Jani were heard; and former learned
Advocate General and Senior Advocate Mr.S.N. Shelat, was requested to
assist the Court as an amicus
curiae.
</p><p id="p_5">In view of the opinion recorded herein, this order is made only in
the present appeal.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_6">2.		The
issue of maintainability of the appeal has arisen on account of the
following observations, inter alia, in Gustadji
(supra)
:
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_7">"56.
</p><p id="p_8">		The sum and substance of our discussion and findings recorded in
the judgment can be now summarized as under :

<p id="p_9">	Where law provides the provision of Appeal and the same is decided
by the judicial authority or where there is scope for judicial
scrutiny by the subordinate at the top, the petition challenging such
order would be covered under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article-227</a> of the Constitution.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">(6)	Where
a petition is filed, both under Articles-226 and 227 of the
Constitution, it will have to be considered whether the point raised
in the petition arose for adjudication for the first time before the
High court. If the challenge in the petition is with respect to the
point already adjudicated upon by the subordinate court, then it will
have to be held that the supervisory jurisdiction of the High court
was invoked and not the original.
</p> 


 


 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">(7)</span>
<p id="p_11">	The cause title, averments and the prayers in the petition can be
taken into account while deciding whether the petition is one under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article-226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">227</a> of the Constitution. This has to be determined on
the facts of each case having regard to -
</p> 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_12">	nature
	and the jurisdiction invoked;
</p>	  


<p id="p_13">	the
	averments contained in the petition;
</p>	  


<p id="p_14">	the
	reliefs sought; and
	  


	most
	importantly, the true nature of the principal order passed by the
	learned Single Judge. The true nature of the order passed by the
	learned Single Judge has to be determined on the basis of the
	character of the relief granted. By merely labeling the petition
	under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article-226</a> and by praying for Writ of Certiorari it cannot be
	said that the facts justify the party to invoke the extraordinary
	jurisdiction of the High court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article-226</a> of the Constitution
	of India.
</p>
 


	
 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">(8)</span>
<p id="p_15">		...		...		... 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_16">(9)	Writ
Petition is a remedy in public law which may be filed by any person
but the main respondent should be either Government, Governmental
agency or a State or instrumentalities of the State within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_7">Article-12.</a> Private individuals cannot be equated with
State or instrumentality of the State. All the respondents in a writ
petition cannot be private parties. High Court can issue Writ to any
person, but the person against whom writ will be issued must have
some statutory or public duty to perform.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_17">(10)	In
a petition for relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article-226</a> of the Constitution, the
Court/Tribunal whose order is impugned in the petition must be made a
party to the petition so that the writ sought from the Court can go
against the Court/Tribunals, but if the petition is for relief under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_9">Article-227</a> of the Constitution, it is well settled that the
Courts/Tribunals whose order is impugned in a petition, need not be a
party in the writ petition. By entertaining the petition under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_10">Article-227</a> of the Constitution, the High Court exercises its power
of superintendence, which is analogous to the revisional
jurisdiction."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_18"> 		The
above ratio has been followed in several subsequent decisions of
other Division Benches of this Court.
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_19">3.		It
was vehemently urged by learned counsel Mr.Asim Pandya, appearing for
the appellant, that the above propositions of law were inconsistent
with previous and subsequent judgments on the issue of the Apex
Court; and the decision in Gustadji
(supra)
is mainly based upon recent decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1426884/" id="a_11">Radhey
Shyam v. Chhabi Nath</a> [(2009) 5 SCC 616],
in which correctness of the ratio in <a href="/doc/1016548/" id="a_12">Surya
Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai</a> [(2003) 6 SCC 675]
was doubted and the matter was referred to the Hon'ble Chief Justice
of India for constituting a Larger Bench, whereby  the ratio in Surya
Dev Rai
(supra)
could not stand obliterated and did not cease to apply, according to
the submission. Learned Senior Advocate Mr.K.M. Patel submitted that,
as held in  <a href="/doc/460646/" id="a_13">Dilavarsinh
Khodabha v. State of Gujarat</a>

[1995 (1) G.L.R. 110],
the writ of certiorari could be issued only under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution and the petitioner as well as the Court would be
required to invoke writ jurisdiction of the High Court for calling
into question an award or order of the Labour Court or other
Tribunals. He further submitted that any limitation on the plenary
powers conferred upon the High Court by <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> has to be found
in the Constitution itself and nowhere else. He also relied upon
judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1243718/" id="a_16">Lokmat
Newspapers (P) Ltd. v. Shankarprasad</a> [(1999) 6 SCC 275]
to
emphasize that in the case directly arising from an award of the
Labour Court, the Apex Court held the Letters Patent Appeal to be
maintainable. In Surya
Dev Rai
(supra),
in paragraph 34 the Supreme Court has categorically opined that the
curtailment of revisional jurisdiction of the High Court does not
take away - and could not have taken away - the constitutional
jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of certiorari to a
Civil Court, nor is the power of superintendence conferred on the
High Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_17">Article 227</a> of the Constitution taken away or
whittled down. The power exists, untrammelled by the amendment in S.
115 of the C.P.C., and is available to be exercised subject to rules
of self-discipline and practice which are well settled. As against
that, in
Radheshyam
(supra),
it is clarified in paragraph 32 that the essential distinctions in
the exercise of power between Articles 226 and 227 are well-known and
pointed out in Surya
Dev Rai
(supra)
and with that the Court has no disagreement. But the disagreement was
only in respect of judicial orders passed by a Civil Court and
whether such orders of the Civil Court could be examined and then
corrected or reversed by the Writ Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution - in exercise of its powers to issue Writ of Certiorari,
was the issue on which there was disagreement. It was on that basis
submitted that the ratio in Surya
Dev Rai
(supra)
was still operative and applicable in respect of any petitions
arising from orders of Courts and Tribunals other than the Civil
Court. Learned counsel also relied upon recent decision of the Full
Bench of Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1957015/" id="a_19">Advani
Oerlikon Ltd. v. Machindra Govind Makasare and others</a>
[2011-III-LLJ-21 (Bom)].
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_20">3.1		It
was submitted for the appellants that there was a consistent line of
decisions of this  Court and a direct and binding decision on the
issue of Full Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/460646/" id="a_20">Dilaversinh
Khodubha v. State of Gujarat</a> [1995 (1) G.L.R. 110 (FB)],
wherein  it is held as under :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_21">"8.
</p><p id="p_22">	The view of this Court, reflected in the above four decisions is
that even if a writ petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a>, or both
under Articles 226 and 227, against an order made by the Urban Land
Tribunal under Section 33 of the said Act, such writ proceedings can
be entertained by the single Judge only under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_22">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution. This, notwithstanding the fact that the petition may
have been filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a>, praying for a writ of certiorari,
against the order of the Tribunal, and though the Tribunal exercises
functions of judicial or quasi-judicial nature in deciding appeals
under Section 33 of the Act.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_23">9.		...		...		...
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_24">10.		...		...		...
</p>

 


 


 


<p id="p_25">"11.	The
question whether a party would be justified in invoking the
jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> or against an order
made by the Tribunal, would take us to the scope of writ of
certiorari and the nature of the order of the Tribunal."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_26">"12.	..
</p><p id="p_27">.. .. in other words, the aggrieved party would be justified in
invoking the provisions of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a> of the Constitution for a writ
of certiorari against the order made by the Urban Land Tribunal
exercising  its judicial functions conferred on it by Section 33 of
the said Act. The decisions of this Court, referred to above, proceed
on an assumption that an order of the Tribunal could be challenged
only under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_26">Article 227</a>, and that the petitions even if filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a>
against such orders, should be treated as petitions under Article
</p><p id="p_28">227. For the reasons aforesaid, we are, with respect, unable to
subscribe to this view."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_29">3.2		The
appellant also relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1156516/" id="a_28">Ashok
K. Jha v. Garden Silk Mills Ltd</a>. [(2009) 10 SCC 584],
wherein it is held that :

</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_34">107.
Petitions are at times filed both under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution. The case of Hari
Vishnu Kamath v.
</p><p id="p_35">Syed
Ahmad Ishaque (AIR 1955 SC 233) before
this Court was of such a type. Rule 18 provides that where such
petitions are filed against orders of the Tribunals or authorities
specified in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules or
against decrees or orders of courts specified in that rule, they
shall be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge. The
question is whether an appeal would lie from the decision of the
Single Judge in such a case. In our opinion, where the facts justify
a party in filing an application either under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> or 227 of
the Constitution, and the party chooses to file his application under
both these articles, in fairness and justice to such party and in
order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal, the court
ought to treat the application as being made under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a>, and
if in deciding the matter, in the final order the court gives
ancillary directions which may pertain to <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_31">Article 227</a>, this ought not
to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under clause 15
of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought
to be appealed against is under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226.</a> Such was the view taken
by the Allahabad High Court in  Aidal
Singh  v.
</p><p id="p_36"> Karan
Singh (AIR 1957 ALL 414)
and
by the Punjab High Court in
Raj

Court referred to earlier decisions in the case of Umaji [1986 Supp

226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_34">Article 227</a> of the Constitution have been mentioned, the
learned single Judge is at liberty to decide, according to facts of
each particular case, whether the said application ought to be dealt
with only under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  For
determining the question of maintainability of an appeal against such
a judgment of the Single Judge the Division bench has to find out
whether in substance the judgment has been passed by the learned
Single Judge in exercise of the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_46">In the event in passing his judgment on an application which had
mentioned in its cause title both Articles 226 and 227, the Single
Judge has in fact invoked only his supervisory powers under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_37">Article
227</a>, the appeal under clause 15 would not lie. The clause 15 of the
Letters Patent expressly bars appeals against orders of Single Judges
passed under revisional or supervisory powers. Even when the learned
Single Judge's order has been passed under both the articles, for
deciding the maintainability against such an order what would be
relevant is the principal or main relief granted by the judgment
passed by learned Single Judge and not the ancillary directions given
by him. The expression `ancillary' means, in the context, incidental
or consequential to the main part of the order."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_47">"35.
</p><p id="p_48"> 	In Visan
Kumar Shiv Charan Lal,
this Court further held that the determining factor is the real
nature of principal order passed by the Single Judge which is
appealed against and neither mentioning in the cause title of the
application of both the Articles nor granting of ancillary order
thereupon by the Single Judge would be relevant and in each case  the
Division Bench must  consider
the substance of the Judgment under appeal
to ascertain
whether the Single Judge has mainly or principally exercised his
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_38">Article 226</a> or <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_39">Article 227</a> of the Constitution. In
Ramesh
Chandra Sankla, this
Court held : 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_49">"47.
</p><p id="p_50">	In our judgment, the learned Counsel for the appellant is right in
submitting that  nomenclature
of the proceeding or reference to a particular Article of the
Constitution is not final or conclusive.
He is also right in submitting that an observation by a Single Judge
as to how he had dealt with the matter is also not decisive. If it
were so, a petition strictly falling under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">Article 226</a> simpliciter
can be disposed of by a Single Judge observing that he is exercising
power of superintendence under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_41">Article 227of</a> the Constitution. Can
such statement by a Single Judge take away from the party aggrieved a
right of appeal against the judgment if otherwise the petition is
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_42">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and subject to an intra
court/Letters Patent Appeal? The reply unquestionably is in the
negative."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_51">"36.
</p><p id="p_52">If the judgment under appeal falls squarely within four corners of
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_43">Article 227</a>, it goes without saying that intra court appeal from such
judgment would not be maintainable. On the other hand, if the
petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court for
issuance of certain writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">Article 226</a>, although <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_45">Article 227</a> is
also mentioned, and principally the judgment appealed against falls
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_46">Article 226</a>, the appeal would be maintainable.  What
is important to be ascertained is the true nature of order passed by
the Single Judge and not what provision he mentions while exercising
such powers.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_53">37.		...		...		...
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_54">"38.
</p><p id="p_55">	Insofar as the present case is concerned, in the cause title of the
writ petition (Special Civil Application), Articles 226 and 227 of
the Constitution have been mentioned. A careful reading of the writ
petition shows that writ petition is not confined to supervisory
jurisdiction of the High Court. The employer has invoked jurisdiction
of the High Court by praying for a writ
of certiorari. The
prayer clause in the writ petition reads, "In view of the
aforesaid premises your Lordships may be pleased to issue a writ
of certiorari
or
any other appropriate order......". The judgment
of the Single Judge is, thus, traceable to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_47">Article 226.</a>  The
statement made by the Single Judge in his order that no case for
interference is made out under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_48">Article 227</a> of the Constitution is not
decisive."

3.3		It
was also pointed out that the following view is taken by the Full
Bench of Allahabad High Court in <a href="/doc/1410663/" id="a_49">Aidel
Singh v. Karan Singh</a> [AIR 1957 ALL 414 (FB)],
which was referred to and approved of by the Apex Court in paragraph
28 in
Ashok
K. Jha
(supra)
:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_57">"120.	
</p><p id="p_58">Prior to the Constitution, the power to issue writs could not be
considered to be a branch of the power of superintendence because the
power of superintendence possessed by the High Courts did not carry
with it the power to issue writs. Even under the Constitution, the
power of superintendence is treated as a power divorced from the
power to issue writs. This is borne out by the fact that the Supreme
Court possesses the power to issue writs, yet it does not possess the
power of superintendence... .. ..
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_59">"The
analogy of English law cannot hold good in India. In England the
power to issue writs is a part and parcel of the power of
superintendence, because the power there is exercised by the court as
a delegate of the Sovereign who is the fountain of all justice. This
is not so in India where the source or power has always been the
statute which is at present the Constitution of India. The Power
conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_50">Article 226</a> in India is also wider than the power to
issue high prerogative writs in England... .. ..
</p>

more reasonable to hold that an appeal should lie in cases where the

than 'supervisory'. The word 'superintendence' implies a controlling
hand in the direction, management and charge of the body
superintended. It is a control not only over the outer judicial
working, but also over the inner administrative machinery. This is
the power which is conferred on the High Court over all Courts and
tribunals under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_59">Art. 227.</a> On the other hand, the word 'supervisory
connotes a more lax kind of control. It is control merely over the
outer judicial working of bodies and not over their inner
administrative machinery.

<p id="p_66"> 	"It
is a power which apart from Courts, tribunals, the High Court also
exercises over the Government and other bodies over which it has no
administrative control. This is the power conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_60">Art. 226.</a>
In the above case it may also be noted that while resorting to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_61">Art.
226</a> for the issue of the writ of certiorari, in the end their
Lordships observed as follows :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_67">"Under
the circumstances, the proper order to pass to quash the decision of
the Tribunal and remove it out of the way by 'certiorari' under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_62">Art.

exercise of the powers conferred by Art. 227."
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_68">"73.
</p><p id="p_69">This sentence would indicate that their Lordships thought that the
two powers were distinct, for, whereas they resorted to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_63">Art. 226</a> for
one part of their order, they invoked <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_64">Art. 227</a> for the other. The two
Articles might be supplementary to each other in some cases, but that
does not mean that the power exercised under them is an identical one
in all cases. It is also significant to note that they characterised
the supervisory power exercised under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_65">Art. 226</a> as one which is not
appellate.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_70"> 	"This
would indirectly support the view which is expounded in the latter
part of the judgment to the effect that the power exercised under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_66">Art. 226</a> is not appellate but original."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_71">"74.
</p><p id="p_72">It is true that in certain cases the power of superintendence
exercised by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_67">Art. 227</a> may overlap the power of
the High Court to issue directions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_68">Art. 226.</a> Thus, it might be
so in some cases relating to Courts and tribunals. The fact, however,
that a similar relief can be obtained by an exercise of power under
either of the two sections does not mean that the power exercised
under the two sections is the same."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_73"> 	"Thus,
for example, there might be cases in which power of revision under S.

the Constitution as well as writ power conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_70">Art. 226</a>,
might all be applicable for getting the same relief. That would not,
however, mean that the powers under all the aforesaid sections (sic)
are the same. In this connection the following observations made by

3.4		It
was pointed out from a Nine-Judge Bench judgment of the Apex Court in
<a href="/doc/1643138/" id="a_71">Naresh
Shridhar Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra</a> [AIR 1967 SC 1],
that although the Court was considering whether a judicial order
passed by the High Court prohibiting publication in newspaper of
evidence given by a witness pending hearing of the suit, is amenable
to be corrected by
a Writ of Certiorari, it was observed :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_75">"53.
</p><p id="p_76"> 	It is well settled that the powers of this Court to issue writs of
certiorari under <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_72">Art. 32 (2)</a> as well as the powers of the High Courts
to issue similar writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_73">Art. 226</a> are very wide. In fact, the
powers of the High Courts under Art 226 are, in a sense, wider than
those of this Court, because the exercise of the powers of this Court
to issue writs of certiorari are limited to the purposes set out in
<a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_74">Art. 32 (1).</a> The nature and the extent of the writ jurisdiction
conferred on the High Courts by <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_75">Art. 226</a> was considered by this Court
as early as 1955 in <a href="/doc/1959866/" id="a_76">T. C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa</a>, 1955- 1 SCR 250 at
pp. 256-8 (AIR 1954 SC 440 at pp 443-44). It would be useful to refer
to some of the points elucidated in this judgment. The first point
which was made clear by Mukherjea, J., who spoke for the Court, was
that-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_77">"in
view of the express provisions in our Constitution, we need not now
look back to the early history or the procedural technicalities of
these writs in English law, nor feel oppressed by any difference or
change of opinion expressed in particular cases by English Judges. We
can make all order or issue a writ in the nature of certiorari in all
appropriate cases and in appropriate manner, so long as we keep to
the broad and fundamental principles that regulate the exercise of
jurisdiction in the matter of granting such writs in English law".
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_78">"One
of the essential features of the, writ, according to Mukherjea. J.,
is 

 


 


 


"that
the control which is exercised through it over judicial or
quasi-judicial Tribunals or bodies is not in appellate but
supervisory capacity. In granting a writ of certiorari, the superior
Court does not exercise the powers of an appellate Tribunal. It does
not review or reweigh the evidence upon which the determination of
the inferior Tribunal purports to be based. It demolishes the order
which it considers to be without jurisdiction or palpably erroneous
but does not substitute its own views to those of the inferior
Tribunal. The supervision of the superior Court exercised through
writs of certiorari goes on two points, one is the area of inferior
jurisdiction and the qualifications and conditions of its exercise;
the other is
the observance of law in the course of its exercise.  Certiorari
may lie and is generally granted when a Court has acted without or in
excess of its jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_79">The want of jurisdiction may arise from the nature of the
subject-matter of the proceeding or from the absence of some
preliminary proceeding or the Court itself may not be legally
constituted or suffer from certain disability by reason of extraneous
circumstances. When the jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the
existence of some collateral fact, it is well settled that the Court
cannot by a wrong decision of the fact give its (sic) jurisdiction
which it would not otherwise possess."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_80">"It
is in the light of these principles which have been consistently
followed by this Court in dealing with the problem relating to the
exercise of the writ jurisdiction by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_77">Art. 226</a> or
by this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_78">Art. 32</a>, that we must now proceed to deal with
the point before us.

	This last category of cases often arise in relation to Tribunals
which have been given jurisdiction to try certain issues under
certain conditions. It is only if the condition prescribed by the
statute is satisfied that the Tribunal derives jurisdiction to deal
with the matter. Proof of such a condition is regarded as the proof
of a collatera1 fact, and an erroneous decision of the Tribunal as to
the existence of this collateral fact is not regarded as binding on
the parties and can be challenged by a writ proceeding under Art.

3.5		Learned
counsel Mr.G.M. Joshi relied upon the following observations of the
Apex Court in <a href="/doc/317207/" id="a_79">Indian
Airlines Ltd. v. Prabha D. Kanan</a> [AIR 2007 SC 548]
:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_86">"42.

appeal, but even in a judicial review, the court may require the

Directors was bona fide or not.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_88">43.
A judicial review of such an order would be maintainable. In a case
of judicial review, where no appeal is provided for, the High Court
in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_80">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India would not confine its jurisdiction only to the known tests
laid down therefor, viz., illegality, irrationality, procedural
impropriety. It has to delve deeper into the matter. It would require
a deeper scrutiny."
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_89">			Learned
counsel also submitted that there is no legal principle or precedent
to support the legal proposition that the party concerned or the
Court has no option but to invoke <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_81">Article 227</a>, and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_82">Article 227</a> only,
in case an award or order of the Tribunal is under challenge before
the highest Court of the State. He further submitted that non-joinder
of a quasi-judicial authority or Tribunal against whose order a writ
is prayed, is at the worst a defect of pleading which is curable by
an amendment, if required, as held in <a href="/doc/1401120/" id="a_83">Udit

<p id="p_90">4.		Learned
Senior Advocate Mr.S.N. Shelat submitted that invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_84">Article
226</a> or 227 of the Constitution or joining as respondent of the Labour
Court or the Tribunal whose order was challenged before the learned
Single Judge, are not the factors which are decisive for determining
the maintainability of the Letters Patent Appeal, as those factors
could not bar the High Court from entertaining the petition or
granting appropriate relief. It was submitted that in a recent
decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1373037/" id="a_85">M/s.M.M.T.C.
Limited v. Commissioner of Commercial Tax and others</a> [AIR 2009 SC
1349],
the High Court seemed to have gone by the nomenclature i.e. the
description given in the writ petition to be one under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_86">Article 227</a> of
the Constitution. The High Court did not consider the nature of the
controversy and the prayer involved in the writ petition. The prayer
was to quash the order of assessment passed by the Assistant
Commissioner,
Commercial Tax, levying purchases (sic) as well as entry
tax. After reference to several relevant judgments, including in
<a href="/doc/184238590/" id="a_87">Umaji
Keshao Meshram v. Smt.Radhikabai</a> [AIR 1986 SC 1272]
and Lokmat
Newspapers (P) Ltd. (supra),
the Apex Court held that the High Court was not justified in holding
that the Letters Patent Appeal was not maintainable. Again in <a href="/doc/1465494/" id="a_88">State
of Madhya Pradesh and others v. Visatkumar Shivcharan</a> [AIR 2009 SC
1999],
wherein Reference under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_89">Section 10</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 was decided in favour of the employee and writ petition filed
therefrom was dismissed by the learned Single Judge, the Division
Bench had dismissed the Letters Patent Appeal as not maintainable as
the impugned order was in terms of <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_90">Article 227</a> of the Constitution.
Relying upon the aforesaid judgment in M/s.M.M.T.C.
Limited (supra),
the Apex Court held that the High Court was not justified in holding
that the appeal was not maintainable. Learned Senior Advocate
Mr.Shelat also relied upon the Full Bench decision of this Court in
<a href="/doc/727077/" id="a_91">Bhagyoday
Cooperative Bank Ltd. v. Natvarlal K. Patel and another</a> [2011 (3)
G.L.H. (FB) 89]
to submit that after reference therein to Gustadji
(supra),
its ratio stood modified in view of the following observations :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_91">"15.		From
the aforesaid decisions rendered by this Court and the Supreme Court,
as referred to above, we hold as follows :
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_92">(i)
		In a petition for relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_92">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India against any judgment or award passed by the Industrial Tribunal
or Labour Court, such Industrial Tribunal or Labour Court is a
necessary party. In absence of such necessary party, no rule and writ
can be issued under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_93">Article 226</a> against such Industrial Tribunal or
the Labour Court; 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_93">(ii)
		But if a petition for relief is filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_94">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India, the Court or the Tribunal whose order is
impugned in the petition, is not a necessary party to such petition
under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_95">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India. The High Court can
exercise the power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_96">Article 227</a> even in absence of such Court or
the Tribunal.
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_94"> 		The
Full Bench went on to observe :
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_95">"17.
</p><p id="p_96">		In the present case, we have seen that the Industrial Court,
Ahmedabad and Labour Court, Ahmedabad are party respondents.
Therefore, the petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_97">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is
maintainable in the said case. However, as in the other case, in
which the Industrial Court or the Labour Court is not a party
respondent, is analogous to the said case and has been preferred
against the same very judgment and award, it will be open to the
Court to hear the writ petitions to grant similar relief, similar
prayer having made against the common judgment."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_97">		Upon
critical reading of the above binding judgment of the Full Bench of
this Court, it was submitted that the proposition of law laid down in
Gustadji
(supra)
in paragraph 56 (5), (6), (9) and (10), stood modified and it could
no longer be argued that a petition challenging an award or order of
the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal could be entertained as one
exclusively under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_98">Article 227</a> of the Constitution. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_98">5.		After
reference to opinion of the Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in
Aidel
Singh (supra)
as well as this Court in Dilaversingh
(supra),
it would be pertinent and interesting to refer to the view taken by a
few other High Courts. The Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in
<a href="/doc/776073/" id="a_99">Dr.Jaydev
Siddha and others v. Jayprakash Siddha</a>  [AIR 2007 MP 269]
opined that it cannot be said in a hypertechnical manner that an
order passed in a writ petition, if there is assail to an order
emerging from the inferior tribunal or subordinate courts, has to be
treated all the time for all purposes to be under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_100">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution.  Whether learned single Judge has exercised his
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_101">Article 226</a> or under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_102">Article 227</a> or both would
depend upon various aspects and many a facet  as has been emphasized
in several
decisions of the Apex Court. It would not be an overemphasis to state
that an order in a writ petition can fit into the subtle contour of
Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution in a composite manner and
they can co-inside, co-exit, overlap or imbricate. There may be cases
where the learned single Judge may feel disposed or inclined to issue
a writ to do full and complete justice because it is to be borne in
mind that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_103">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is fundamentally a
repository and reservoir of justice based on equity and good
conscience. It would depend upon factual matrix of the case.
Upholding the aforesaid ratio in Dr.Jaidev
Siddha (supra),
a Special Bench of Five Hon'ble Judges in <a href="/doc/165671558/" id="a_104">Manojkumar
v. Board of Revenue and others</a> [AIR 2008 MP 22]
expressed the majority view that maintainability of a writ appeal
from an order of learned single Judge would depend upon many an
aspect and cannot be put into a straitjacket formula. It cannot be
stated with mathematical exactitude but would depend upon the
pleadings in the writ petition, nature of the order passed by the
learned single Judge, character and the contour of the order,
directions issued, nomenclature given and the jurisdictional
perspective in the constitutional context. It cannot be said in a
hyper-technical manner that an order passed in a writ petition, if
there is assail to the order emerging from the inferior tribunal or
subordinate Courts, has to be treated all the time for all purposes
to be under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_105">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India. It is to be
borne in mind that the powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_106">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution are not confined to prerogative  writs inasmuch as
it can issue directions, orders, writs and can mould the relief to
meet the peculiar requirements. It is a constitutional power
conferred on the High Court to see that no man is subject to
injustice by violation of law. In exercise of powers under this
Article, the High Court is expected to erase injustice and not to
make justice a by-product.

<p id="p_99">5.1		The
Full Bench of Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/8336067/" id="a_107">Bhowanipore
Gujrati Education Society and another v. Kolkata Municipal
Corporation and others</a> [AIR 2009 Cal 140],
was required to consider inter alia whether  a writ petition under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_108">Article 226</a> of the Constitution against an order passed by a
statutory Tribunal exercising judicial functions was maintainable.
The Full Bench opined in paragraph 32 that the judgment in Surya Dev
Rai (supra) does not lay down the proposition that a writ petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_109">Article 226</a> of the Constitution would not be maintainable
against an order passed by a Tribunal exercising judicial functions.
Rather the Supreme Court emphatically lays down that the proceedings
of judicial Courts, subordinate to the High Court can also be
subjected to certiorari. Once it is accepted that the High Court has
jurisdiction to issue writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_110">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, no
further embargo can be placed on the power of the High Court. The law
has been consistently laid down by the Supreme Court that the power
of the High Court to exercise jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_111">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_112">/ 227</a> of
the Constitution forms a part of the basic structure of the
Constitution. Therefore, it cannot be curtailed by any provision
contained in any enactment of legislature or any rule framed by the
High Court. Accordingly, it was concluded and held that writ petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_113">Article 226</a> of the Constitution against an order passed by a
statutory Tribunal exercising judicial functions is maintainable. It
is also held in paragraph 39 that the combined petition filed under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_114">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_115">/227</a> of the Constitution can always be treated by the High
Court as a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_116">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.

<p id="p_100">5.2
  		The Full Bench of the High Court of Bombay in Advani
Oerlikon Ltd. (supra)
considered nine specific points referred to it by the Division Bench,
with the factual backdrop in which an order of Labour Court and an
order of Industrial Court in appeal had been challenged by the
workman  in a petition invoking Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_101">After reference to a series of relevant judgments, the Full Bench
held :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_102">"18.	The
principles which emerge can be elucidated as follows: (i) The
fundamental principle which must be applied in determining the
maintainability of an appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent,
is whether the facts justify a party in filing an application either
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_117">Article 226</a> or <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_118">Article 227</a> of the Constitution. Where in such a
case, a party chooses to file an application under both the Articles,
it should not be deprived of a right of appeal. The Court must treat
the application as one under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_119">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. If the
single Judge in the course of the final order has issued an ancillary
direction which pertains to <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_120">Article 227</a>, this would not deprive a
party of a right of appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent;
</p><p id="p_103">(ii) Equally, it is now a settled principle that a mere nomenclature
which is used by a party is not dispositive of the nature of the
jurisdiction that is invoked and of the nature of the power that is
exercised by the single Judge; (iii) In deciding as to whether the
facts justify the invocation of the jurisdiction either under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_121">Article
226</a> or <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_122">Article 227</a> of the Constitution, due regard has to be had to
</p><p id="p_104">(a) the nature of the controversy; (b) the nature of the jurisdiction
invoked; and (c) the true nature of the principal order passed by the
single Judge; (iv) Where the contention that is raised, the grounds
taken and the reliefs sought in the petition justify the invocation
of both Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, an appeal under
Clause 15 of the Letters Patent against a judgment of the single
Judge would be maintainable; (v) The mere fact that while dismissing
such a petition, the Learned single Judge has observed that no ground
for interference under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_123">Article 227</a> has been made out, would not
deprive the aggrieved party of a right of appeal under Clause 15 of
the Letters Patent."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_105">6.		Upon
plain reading of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High
Court as applicable to this Court, it is quite clear that a Letters
Patent Appeal is not maintainable against a judgment  or order passed
or made in exercise of powers of superintendence under the provisions
of Section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915 or against an
order made in exercise of revisional jurisdiction. In the facts in
Gustadji
(supra),
the challenge before learned Single Judge was to a judicial decision
rendered by a Court in a suit proceeding at an interlocutory stage.
The Division Bench adopted the view that there cannot be any
distinction with regard to a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_124">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_125">/227</a> and
Section 115 of the C.P.C. when it relates to a proceeding arising out
of an order of the Civil Court; and, whatever might be the nature of
the petition, it remains a revisional jurisdiction. After reference
to the ratio in Gustadji
(supra),
the Full Bench of this Court has already held in
Bhagyoday
Cooperative Bank Ltd. (supra)
that where the Industrial Court and Labour Court were party
respondents, a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_126">Article 226</a> of the Constitution was
maintainable. The Full Bench went ahead to hold that the High Court
may hear the writ petitions to grant similar relief, as common
judgment was challenged, even though the Industrial Court or the
Labour Court were not party respondents. Therefore, on a facile view
of the matter, the moot question boiled down to whether the Labour
Court or the Industrial Tribunal was made a party to the petition,
which in turn would decide, whether the Letters Patent Appeal would
be maintainable or not from the decision rendered by learned Single
Judge in such petition. The Full Bench of this Court has referred to
decision in the case of Udit
Narain Singh Malpaharia (supra)
and
quoted the following observations of the Apex Court :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_106">"12.	To
summarise, in a writ of certiorari not only the tribunal or authority
whose order is sought to be quashed but also parties in whose favour
the said order is issued are necessary parties.  But
it is in the discretion of the court to add or implead proper parties
for completely settling all the questions that may be involved
in the controversy, either suo motu or on the application of a party
to the writ or an application filed at the instance of such proper
party."

		The
Full Bench has also referred to later decision of the Supreme Court
in <a href="/doc/1869954/" id="a_127">Savitri
Devi v. District Judge, Gorakhpur and others</a> [AIR 1999 SC 976],
wherein it is observed :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_108">"14.
</p><p id="p_109"> 	Before parting with this case it is necessary for us to point out
one aspect of the matter which is rather disturbing. In the writ
petition filed in the High Court as well as the Special Leave
Petition filed in this Court, the District Judge, Gorakhpur and the
4th Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division), Gorakhpur are shown as
respondents and in the Special Leave Petition they are shown as
contesting respondents. There was no necessity for impleading the
judicial officers who disposed of the matter in a civil proceeding
when the writ petition was filed in the High Court; nor is there any
justification for impleading them as parties in the Special Leave
Petition and describing them as contesting respondents. We do not
approve of the course adopted by the petitioner which would cause
unnecessary disturbance to the functions of the concerned judicial
officers. They cannot be in any way equated to the officials of the
Government.  It
is high time that the practice of impleading judicial officers
disposing of civil proceedings as parties to writ petitions under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_128">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India or Special Leave Petitions
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_129">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of India was stopped. We
are strongly deprecating such a practice."

		In
view of above binding observations and the opinions recorded in the
previous paragraphs, it would appear that not only an order of a
subordinate Court or Tribunal could be called into question before
the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_130">Article 226</a> or 227  of the Constitution, but a
petition for that purpose may or may not have the Court or the
Tribunal concerned as a party respondent. In such circumstances, in
view of the decisions of the Apex Court in Ashok
K. Jha (supra), Shahu Shikshan Prasarak Mandal (supra) and State of
Madhya Pradesh (supra),
the Letters Patent Appeal could not be summarily dismissed as not
maintainable. The ratio in Surya
Dev Rai (supra)
could also not be ignored
as if it were overruled by Radhey
Shyam (supra),
insofar as, as recently held by the Apex Court on March 14, 2012 in
Ashok
Sadarangani and another v. Union of India [ Writ Petition (Cri.)
No.26  of 2011],
the pendency of a reference to a Larger Bench does not mean that all
other proceedings involving the same issue would remain stayed till a
decision was rendered in a reference;  till
the decisions are not modified or altered in any manner, they
continue to hold the field.
</p><p id="p_111">Therefore, following the decision of the Apex Court, which directly
and fully applies in the case on hand, in Lokmat
Newspapers (P) Ltd. (supra),
the Letters Patent Appeal cannot be summarily dismissed without
scrutiny of several aspects, including the pleadings, the prayers,
the jurisdiction of the High Court which was invoked by the parties
and which was exercised or refused to be exercised by learned Single
Judge, as also the impugned decision. As held in Gustadji
(supra)
itself, in order to find out whether the petition was one under
Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution, it has to be determined on
the facts of each case, having regard to the nature and jurisdiction
invoked, the averments contained in the petition, the reliefs sought
and most importantly the true nature of the principal order passed by
the learned Single Judge. However, by merely labeling the petition as
one under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_131">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and by praying for writ of
certiorari, it cannot be said that the facts justified invocation of
extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_132">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. Accordingly, it would be improper and illegal to
dismiss a Letters Patent Appeal only on the ground that either the
original writ petition or the impugned decision of the learned Single
Judge mentioned <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_133">Article 227</a> of the Constitution or the Labour Court
or the Industrial Tribunal whose order or award was under challenge
before learned Single Judge was not a party to the proceeding.
Therefore,
the present appeal as well as the other appeals listed together for
hearing are not dismissed at this stage and  ordered to be listed for
hearing in due course.
