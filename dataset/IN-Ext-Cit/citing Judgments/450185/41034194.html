<p id="p_1">                                  The case of the petitioner is that she was working as an English

                     Teacher           in   Government     Higher    Secondary    School,     P.Gollapatti,

                     Dharmapuri District. Before joining the Government service, the

                     petitioner was already married to one A.Suresh in 2006. From the

                     said wedlock, two children were born in 2007 and 2011 respectively.

                     Subsequently, due to estrangement between them, they fell out of

                     each other and finally they were legally separated in the year 2017.

                     The two children born from the said wedlock are in the custody of the

                     petitioner&#x27;s former husband.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">                                  2.   On    12.09.2018,    the     petitioner   got    married    to   one

                     Mr.M.Rajkumar. Due to conceivement from the second wedlock, the

                     petitioner applied for grant of maternity leave to the authorities

                     concerned for the period between 17.08.2021 and 13.05.2022 (nine

                     months) towards pre-and-post-natal care. When she applied for grant

                     of maternity leave, she was under the bona fide impression that

                     earlier, when the two children were born from the first wedlock, she

                     was not in Government service and that for the first time, she was

                     availing         the   maternity   leave    benefit.   She   entered      into   the

                     Government service only in December 2012, and that too from the

                     second          marriage,   she    was     expecting   a   child,   and    in    that

                     circumstances there would not be any issue of grant of maternity

                     leave to her. Her apprehension was due to the fact that in terms of

                     the public policy adopted by the Government of India followed by the

                     State Government prescribing two child norm, the benefit being

                     sought for the third child, her request might not be favourably

                     considered. However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the

                     case, as stated above, she had submitted a request for the above

                     said period.

                     rejected the request of the petitioner, quoting Fundamental Rule

                     101(a), applicable to State Government servants stating eligibility for

                     grant of maternity leave is available only to women employees having

                     only two surviving children and there is no provision for grant of

                     maternity leave for the third child on account of her remarriage.

                     request for grant of maternity leave is before this Court.

</p><p id="p_7">                                  5. Mr.Arun Anbumani, learned counsel for the petitioner has

                     reiterated the facts briefly. The learned counsel initially contended

                     that as far as the Government service is concerned, the petitioner

                     was giving birth for the first time, as the earlier two children were

                     born from the first wedlock, prior to her entering into the Government

                     service in 2012. Therefore, the claim of the petitioner ought to have

                     been construed as a first child as far as the Government service is

                     concerned for extending the benefit of the maternity leave to her.



</p><p id="p_8">                                  6. The learned counsel alternatively would submit that the

                     reliance placed by the authority on Fundamental Rule 101(a) is

                     incorrect and cannot be countenanced in law, as the provisions of the

                     <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_2">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, 1961 (for short, the M.B. Act, 1961) which was

                     enacted in pursuance of the constitutional guarantee enshrined in

                     <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_3">Article 42</a> does not impose any such condition for availing the

                     maternity benefit. According to the learned counsel, restriction of two

                     child norm for grant of maternity benefit to women Government

                     servants came to be introduced only in 1993 vide G.O.Ms.No.237,

                     Personnel and Administrative Reforms, dated 29.06.1993, following

                     the larger public policy adopted by the Central Government towards

                     population control. However, an executive order cannot override a

                     statutory provision, that too a Central legislation, more particularly

                     when the M.B. Act, 1961 was a constitutional requirement in

                     furtherance of <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_4">Article 42</a> of the Constitution, demonstrating India&#x27;s

                     commitment            to   the   convention    of   the   International   Labour

                     Organization in the year 1952.

                     counsel would then proceed to refer to a few decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble

                     Supreme Court and High Courts on the subject-matter. According to

                     the learned counsel, the decisions that are to be referred to, clearly

                     support his contention that the Government cannot have recourse to

                     the Fundamental Rule 101(a) for the purpose of denying the

                     maternity benefit to the petitioner.

                     provisions of the M.B. Act, 1961, the Supreme Court has observed in

                                  ground, i.e.intention of the rule is only the grant of maternity
                                  leave for the second delivery and not really based upon two
                                  children norm. The petitioner had delivered during her first
                                  delivery   twins and the second delivery was a single child.
                                  Therefore, maternity leave was confined only to the second
                                  delivery and not based on the third child norm. Therefore, the
                                  petitioner should have been granted maternity leave with full
                                  pay. If it is not construed in this way it may produce ridiculous
                                  result. To cite an example, if during the first delivery a woman
                                  Government servant delivers a single child and by the second
                                  delivery if she delivers twins or triplets, then should she be

                                        the rigours of the provision and make it just and
                                        reasonable. For instance, the Rule could be suitably
                                        amended so as to terminate the services of an AH
                                        on third pregnancy provided two children are alive
                                        which would be both salutary and reasonable for
                                        two reasons. In the first place, the provision
                                        preventing third    pregnancy with two existing
                                        children would be in the larger interest of the
                                        health of the AH concerned as also for the good
                                        upbringing of the children. Secondly, as indicated
                                        above while dealing with the Rule regarding
                                        prohibition of marriage within four years, same
                                        considerations would apply to a bar of third
                                        pregnancy where two children are already there
                                        because when the entire world is faced with the
                                        problem of population explosion it will not only be
                                        desirable but absolutely essential for every country
                                        to see that the family planning programme is not
                                        only whipped up but maintained at sufficient levels
                                        so as to meet the danger of over-population which,
                                        if not controlled, may lead to serious social and

                                  provided. By intruding an explanation to FR 101 by an executive
                                  instruction cannot be treated as substantial rule to deny the
                                  constitutional right of a woman Government servant as had

                                  63 and 64 of the said judgment it was observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">                                               &quot;63. It was also submitted that the impugned
                                        disqualification   would    hit   the   women    worst,
                                        inasmuch as in the Indian society they have no
                                        independence and they almost helplessly bear a
                                        third child if their husbands want them to do so.
                                        This contention need not detain us any longer. A
                                        male who compels his wife to bear a third child
                                        would disqualify not only his wife but himself as
                                        well. We do not think that with the awareness
                                        which is arising in Indian womenfolk, they are so
                                        helpless as to be compelled to bear a third child
                                        even though they do not wish to do so. At the end,
                                        suffice it to say that if the legislature chooses to
                                        carve out an exception in favour of females it is
                                        free to do so but merely because women are not
                                        excepted from the operation of the disqualification
                                        it does not render it unconstitutional.

                                  The importance has to be seen only from the health point of the

                     the challenge, the Division Bench extensively dealt with various

                     decisions of the Supreme Court and of High Courts. In its quest for

                     comprehensive answers, the Court has first framed the following

                                  Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, were questioned before the
                                  Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court. By these provisions, persons having two
                                  living children were disqualified to hold the office of the
                                  Sarpanch or a Panch of the Gram Panchayat. Such a classification
                                  was assailed being ultra vires to the Constitution of India. It was
                                  canvassed that the provision is arbitrary and hence violative of

                                  namely (i) that the classification is founded on an intelligible
                                  differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are
                                  grouped together from others left out of the group; and, (ii)
                                  that such a differentia has a rational relation to the object
                                  sought to be achieved by the Statute in question. The basis for
                                  classification may rest on conditions which may be geographical
                                  or according to objects or occupation or the like. In Javed&#x27;s case
                                  (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court noticed population scenario of
                                  the world and observed that increase in the population of the
                                  Country is one of the major hindrances in the pace of India&#x27;s
                                  socio-economic progress. It marked the words of Bertand Russell,
                                  &quot;Population explosion is more dangerous than Hydrogen Bomb&quot;
                                  and upheld the provisions of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act,
                                  1994, saying State is competent to define its priority in enacting
                                  Policy or enacting legislation. Thus, classification between two
                                  sets of women employees having two children or more than two
                                  was held to be reasonable. In Javed&#x27;s case (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble
                                  Apex Court relied upon <a href="/doc/1903603/" id="a_40">Air India and Others v. Nergesh Meerza

                                        children would be in the larger interest of the
                                        health of the AH concerned as also for the good
                                        upbringing of the children. Secondly, as indicated

                                        prohibition of marriage within four years, same
                                        considerations would apply to a bar of third
                                        pregnancy where two children are already there
                                        because when the entire world is faced with the
                                        problem of population explosion it will not only be
                                        desirable but absolutely essential for every country
                                        to see that the family planning programme is not
                                        only whipped up but maintained at sufficient levels
                                        so as to meet the danger of over population which,
                                        if not controlled, may lead to serious social and

                                  children is justifiable, however, question No.2 is answered in
                                  favour of the petitioner as the rules framed by the Government
                                  are not in conformity with the Act. Hence, till an amendment is
                                  carried in the Act, the rules framed by the State Government
                                  will not curtail the benefit which had accrued to the petitioner
                                  in view of the Act. Answers to questions No.3 and 4 are not

                                       for Maternity Leave with benefits. As per a

                                  the benefits, as per its order dated 29.06.1993,

                                  that     clause    it   was    not     open    to   the    State

                                  that the intention of the State Government was to
                                  protect the women for her second delivery and that
                                  cannot depend upon the number of children one
                                  delivers in each delivery and it was held that

                                  protected and at the same time the population
                                  explosion is also kept under check, which will also
                                  be a measure towards protection of the health of
                                  the women labourers. At any rate, there is no
                                  prohibition with respect to the number of children
                                  an employee can have. The restriction is in granting
                                  26 weeks&#x27; Maternity Leave. The woman employee is
                                  given 12 weeks&#x27; paid leave irrespective of the
                                  number of children. By way of amendment effected
                                  in 2015, the 12 weeks&#x27; Maternity Leave has been
                                  enhanced to 26 weeks&#x27; leave. It cannot be also said
                                  that there is no purpose in limiting the number of
                                  surviving children irrespective of the number of
                                  deliveries to make one eligible for grant of
                                  Maternity    Leave. The Government have           been
                                  granting incentives to those, who did not have more
                                  than   two   children.   Maternity   Leave   is    not
                                  admissible at all for the third child for a mother

                     of the earlier three child ceiling. As a matter of fact, in the GO, it was

                     stated that necessary amendment to the fundamental rules will be

                     issued separately. But what is shown before the Court is issuance of

                                  whether the two children norm discovered and adumberated by
                                  the   Government        in   G.O.Ms.No.237,       School    Education
                                  Department, dated 29.06.1993, is valid.
</p><p id="p_124">                                        17.1. Executive instructions cannot replace the substantive
                                  law. If the concern of the State Government is to afford
                                  protection to the women during/at or after delivery, then the
                                  rule cannot be based upon the number of children delivered in
                                  each delivery and it should be based on the delivery itself.
</p><p id="p_125">                                        17.2. The interpretation of law cannot defeat the very
                                  purpose for which the law was enacted. Therefore, the orders
                                  passed by the respondents, declining maternity leave and
                                  ordering recovery of salary paid for the eligible maternity
                                  period, have to be set-aside.
</p><p id="p_126">                                          18. Unless there is a law prohibiting / restricting the
                                  number of delivery in order to have indirect control over
                                  population, then the Government cannot decline maternity
                                  leave, fixing the number of children delivered in each delivery as
                                  the basis.”
</p><p id="p_127">                                  30. From the above observations of the learned Judges, it is

                     clear that two child norm introduced vide G.O.Ms.No.173 dated 27th

                     June 1997, is a mere executive instruction, which obviously cannot

                     supplant           any     further   restriction    in   the   rule,    without   proper

                     amendment to the rule. Therefore, the Court has to come to an

                     inexorable conclusion            that the basis of the rejection of the

                     petitioner&#x27;s request cannot be countenanced, as the same is without

                     any authority of law. This Court, however, is also conscious of the

                     fact that public policy towards achieving small family norm is to

                     benefit the country at large, as over-population is eating into the

                     dwindling vitals of the country. But at the same time, when a

                     restriction is imposed on the constitutional and fundamental rights of

                     women, no matter how valid such restriction may be, it should go

                     through proper legal channel before it attains sanctity for its

                     universal application. In this case, as rightly observed by the learned

                     Judges in the above extracted paragraphs in their decisions, the

                     rejection of the petitioner&#x27;s request on the basis of the executive

                     order does not pass the test of judicial scrutiny.

                     Court is that, subjects relating to population control, family planning

                     and maternity benefits fall within the Concurrent List (List III)

                     (Entries 20-A and 24) to Schedule VII of the Constitution. While so,

                     benefit does not impose per se, two child norm. It only differentiates

                     the period of maternity benefit available to women employee with

                     two surviving children and women having two or more than two

                     has been brought about by inserting a proviso under sub-clause (3)

                     as to the entitlement of the period of maternity leave. A woman

                     employee having less than two surviving children is entitled to the

                     maximum period of benefit i.e. twenty six weeks and for a woman

                     employee having two or more than two surviving children, the benefit

                     is restricted to twelve weeks. However, no ceiling on the number of

                     children has been imposed towards entitlement of the maternity leave

                     precisely         and   pointedly    has     condensed    the   legal   position

                     aphoristically in paragraph 14 extracted supra. The learned Judge of

                     this Court has rightly held that there is no provision in the M.B. Act,

                     1961 fixing any ceiling on the number of deliveries. The learned

                     Judge further held that so long as <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_100">Article 42</a> of the Constitution read

                     with the provisions of the M.B. Act, 1961, is available, every female

                     worker covered by the Act is entitled to claim maternity benefit

                     without any ceiling on the number of deliveries made by them.

                     position. The Division Bench was primarily dealing with the question

                     as to whether a woman employee can avail of the maternity leave

                     when she already has two surviving children before joining the

                     Government service. The present facts of the case are exactly

                     identical as that of the said case. The Division Bench after adverting

                     to various decisions which has been referred supra, has finally held

                     that the M.B. Act, 1961 nowhere restricts the benefit of maternity

                     benefits only to two children. The Division Bench held that the note,

                     introduced to the rule of Punjab Civil Services, was in conflict with

                     the provisions of the M.B. Act, 1961 and ultimately held that the Act

                     would have overriding effect. Although the High Court has held that

                     the family planning is a part of the national public policy and the

                     State has the right to place restrictions upon the benefits, yet in the

                     absence of any amendment to the Act, such restriction is without the

                     authority of law.

                     enhancing the maternity leave from 90 days to 180 days, reiterating

                     the policy of the Government that the benefit is applicable to

                     Government women employees with less than two surviving children.

                     The second G.O.Ms.No.105 dated 07.11.2016 further enhanced the

                     repugnant to the Central enactment (M.B. Act, 1961) and therefore

                     the same is void. Second, two surviving children must mean a

                     children in lawful custody of the mother on a purposive and

                     harmonious reading of the provision.

                     framework of the Fundamental Rule 101(a) read with the provisions

                     that the petitioner is not having the custody of children born from the

                     first wedlock, as on date. When the provisions of both the M.B. Act,

                     1961 and the Fundamental Rules speak about not more than two or

                     three surviving children, as the case may be, the rule of construction

                     ought to be oriented towards advancing the object, spirit and purpose

                     of the Act/Rules. More particularly, with reference to the expression

                     used in the provision of Section 5(3) of the M.B. Act, 1961 that

                     maximum period of entitlement of maternity leave benefit for a

                     woman having two or more than two surviving children must mean

                     and restrict such benefit to a woman Government servant with two

                     surviving children only, such stipulation must receive meaningful,

                     maternity benefit and the M.B. Act, 1961, must be harmoniously read

                     conjunctively together to extend the benefit as far as possible and not

                     to deny the same by obscure and hazy understanding of the spirit of

                     the Act and the Rules. The semantic construct of the expression

                     “having surviving children” must be taken to mean that the woman

                     Government servant seeking the benefit must have custody of the

                     children. The thrust therefore must be towards grant of the benefit by

                     liberal interpretation than to withhold the benefit on the pedantic

                     construct of the provisions.

                     been extended to second delivery, even if a woman Government

                     this is one of the peculiar cases wherein as a fallout of divorce from

                     authorities, considering the peculiar and singular facts and the

                     circumstances of the case. The Court therefore holds that the

                     inviting disqualification for claiming the maternity benefit.

                     cited, the relevant portions have already been extracted supra. As

                     relating to application of Central Civil Services Leave Rules. The

                     Division Bench adverting to the rule position therein, has held that

                     the Government servant therein was not entitled for the grant of

                     maternity benefit in respect of the third child. The Division Bench

                     decision and the ruling ought to be confined only to the rules that

                     governed the service conditions of the employee therein. Such ruling

                     rendered on the framework of the Central Government rules cannot

                     be stated to be applicable or binding on the claim of the petitioner

                     was a decision rendered on a different factual matrix and the

                     consideration was also not germane to the present examination of

                     this Court. As could be seen in paragraph 20 of the said judgment,

                     which has been extracted in the earlier part of the order, the

                     consideration therein was, whether the woman employee concerned

                     was entitled to 12 weeks or the maximum benefit of 26 weeks of

                     maternity leave, in terms of Section 5(3) of the M.B. Act, 1961. The

                     fact in that case was the employee had given birth to twins in her

                     first delivery and for the next delivery, she sought maximum

                     maternity benefit (26 weeks). In that context, the Court held that

                     there was nothing wrong in placing restrictions on the benefits

                     applicable to those having more than two children. The Court has

                     eventually ruled that instead of the full period of 26 weeks of

                     maternity leave, paid leave granted to the employee for a period of

                     12 weeks was in order. In the said circumstances, the decision of the

                     Kerala High Court cannot be said to have any application on the

                     controversy herein.

                     country being a signatory to the convention relating to women

                     empowerment and implementation of benefits relating to labour laws,

                     is constitutionally bound to give effect to the commitments made to

                     international conventions. The M.B. Act, 1961, was the result of the

                     above commitment and it was also a constitutional imperative in tune

                     with the Directive Principles of the State Policy as embedded in

                     Articles 39 and 42 of the Constitution. When the Central Act (M.B.

                     Act, 1961) is stated to be in furtherance of the Directive Principles of

                     the State Policy as contained in the Constitution of India, any

                     executive orders, circulars or subordinate legislation or even the

                     State law which is not in consonance with the Central enactment will

                     have to be read down to give a constitutional thrust and purpose in

                     terms of the Central enactment. As long as the Central enactment has

                     not placed any restrictions on the number of children for the purpose

                     of availing maternity benefits, no other rule or regulations can put

                     any fetters on such claim.
