                                                      JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">                                  The plaintiff filed the suit in respect of alleged trade mark

                infringement and passing off, and claimed several reliefs in respect thereto.



</p><p id="p_2">                                  2. The plaintiff stated that it is engaged in the manufacture of

                dairy products. In relation thereto, it stated that the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKYA&#x27;&#x27;

                was adopted more than two decades ago and that an application for

                registration was filed in June 1995 after using the said mark for a

                considerable period of time. Pursuant thereto, it is stated that registrations

                were granted in Class 29 and Class 32 between 14.06.1995 and 13.02.2008.

                The plaintiff further asserted that the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKYA&#x27;&#x27; has acquired a

                secondary meaning through long, open, honest and continuous use. The

                plaintiff referred to the substantial growth in its annual turnover from the

                sale of products marketed under the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKYA&#x27;&#x27;. In specific, it

                stated that the annual turnover increased            from Rs.45.33 lakhs in the

                financial year 1998 - 1999 to Rs.1,452.38 lakhs in the financial year 2013-

                2014. Similarly, the over all sales turnover and advertising expenditure was

                set out in paragraph 13 of the plaint to establish the reputation and goodwill

                of the plaintiff. The plaintiff further stated that the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKYA&#x27;&#x27;

                has attained the status of a well known trademark within the meaning of

                <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_5">Section 2(zg)</a> read with <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_6">Section 29(4)</a> of the Trade Marks Act,1999 (the

                <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">Trade Marks Act</a>). The plaintiff also stated that it came to know that the

                defendant was using the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in relation to its idly and dosa

                batter in July 2009.          Immediately, the plaintiff issued a cease and desist

                notice to the defendant. On receipt thereof, by reply dated 04.08.2009, the

                defendant attempted to justify use of the trade mark by contending that the

                defendant had not violated any rights of the plaintiff because the defendant

                is the registered proprietor of the trademark in Class 30.               In these

                circumstances, the plaintiff filed the suit.

<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">                                  3. The defendant refuted these contentions by filing a written

                statement. In the written statement, the defendant stated that it has used the

                trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; since the year 2001. The defendant also stated that

                it is the registered proprietor of the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27;. The defendant

                stated that the nature of goods manufactured and marketed by the defendant

                are fundamentally different from the plaintiff&#x27;s goods. The defendant also

                referred to the notice issued by the plaintiff in the year 2009 and the reply

                thereto from the defendant. Consequently, it was asserted that the present

                suit is an abuse of process. The defendant stated that all the products in

                respect of which its mark is applied fall under Class 30. With a view to

                protect its intellectual property, the defendant applied for and obtained

                registration. The defendant categorically denied the assertion that its colour

                scheme and get up are deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff by

                explaining the reasons for choosing the combination of white, red and green

                for its label.         The defendant also pleaded that the suit is liable to be

                dismissed on the ground of delay, laches and acquiescence in view of the

                use of the impugned mark by the defendant for more than 18 years.



</p><p id="p_5">                                  4. Upon considering the pleadings of the parties, by order dated

                26.09.2019, the following issues were framed:

<p id="p_8">                                         3. Whether the suit for infringement of

                dissimilarity of goods, the claim under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_8">Section 29(4)</a> and the consequent

                entitlement to relief, and an additional issue relating to laches and

                documents were exhibited as Exs.D1 to D13.                     Two documents were

                exhibited in course of the cross examination of D.W.1 by the plaintiff.

</blockquote><p id="p_13">                These documents were marked as Exs.D14 and D15.

</p><p id="p_14">                                  7.   Oral arguments on behalf of the plaintiff were made by

                Mr.Surya Senthil, learned counsel, assisted by Mr.Prashant Alai, learned

                counsel for M/s.Surana and Surana; and by Mr.R.Sathishkumar, learned

                counsel, assisted by Mr.A.K.Rajaraman, learned counsel, for the defendant.

                Both parties also submitted written arguments.

</p><p id="p_15">                                  8. The first contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff was that

                the plaintiff adopted and applied the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKYA&#x27;&#x27; in relation to dairy

                products for a considerable period of time. By drawing reference to the

                Trademark certificate No.2791520 in Class 29, learned counsel pointed out

                that this registration was obtained several years after the plaintiff

                commenced use of the mark. Therefore, it was submitted that the mark had

                acquired distinctiveness by use in the pre-registration period.                Learned

                counsel further submitted that the defendant initially used the mark

                &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; written in Tamil along with the device of a rose(Ex.D1).

                Subsequently, the defendant modified the mark substantially by writing

                &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in English and removing the rose. According to learned

                counsel, the changed mark is an unregistered mark. Since the unregistered

                mark used by the defendant in relation to its products is deceptively similar

                to the plaintiff&#x27;s mark, the plaintiff is entitled to relief both in respect of

                infringement and passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                                  9. Learned counsel for the plaintiff next contended that the goods

                of the plaintiff and the defendant are similar. By way of substantiation, he

                pointed out the following common characteristics: the goods are food

                products used in the kitchen; they are perishable; and are stored in a

                refrigerator. Therefore, it was pointed out that a prospective consumer is

                likely to be deceived into thinking the defendant&#x27;s product originates from

                the plaintiff.         Without prejudice, he submitted that the plaintiff&#x27;s mark

                satisfies the requirements of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_9">Section 29(4)</a> of the Trade Marks Act and is

                entitled to protection in terms thereof even if the goods are construed as

                dissimilar. The fifth contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff was that

                the plaintiff&#x27;s products have acquired high reputation and good will. In this

                regard, he referred to the annual turnover from the sale of products bearing

                the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKYA&#x27;&#x27;. He also referred to the substantial promotional

                expenses incurred in this regard. Paragraphs 10 and 13 of the plaint were

                referred to in this connection and Ex.P13 was also relied upon.

</p><p id="p_17">                                  10. With regard to the defendant&#x27;s claim that the plaintiff

                acquiesced in the use of the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; by the defendant, learned

                counsel submitted that <a href="/doc/66616/" id="a_10">Section 33</a> of the Trade Marks Act is relevant only

                for purposes of registration of a mark and not otherwise.            He further

                submitted that the defendant changed the mark substantially and that the

                plaintiff did not acquiesce in the use of the changed mark by the defendant.

</p><p id="p_18">                                  11.   In support of these contentions, learned counsel for the

                plaintiff relied upon two compilations of judgments. From and out of this,

                emphasis was placed on the following judgments:

                is an unregistered mark in the eye of law.

</p><p id="p_22">                                  12. These contentions were refuted by learned counsel for the

                defendant. The first contention of learned counsel for the defendant was

                that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief on the ground of acquiescence. By

                drawing reference to paragraph 25 of the plaint, learned counsel pointed out

                that the defendant admitted that it noticed the use of the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27;

                by the defendant for its idly and dosa batter in July 2009. He also pointed

                out that the plaintiff referred to the defendant&#x27;s reply of 04.08.2009 in

                response to the cease and desist notice. Thus, learned counsel contended

                that the plaintiff was fully aware about the defendant&#x27;s use of the mark

                &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in relation to idly and dosa batter in July 2009. Upon receiving

                the cease and desist notice, the defendant issued the reply dated 04.08.2009,

                which was exhibited as Ex.P41. By this reply, he pointed out that the

                defendant stated that he is the registered proprietor of the trademark

                &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in Class 30 in respect of instant dosa and idly flour. He also

                pointed out that the plaintiff was informed that the goods manufactured and

                sold by the defendant are different from the ice cream and milk made by the

                plaintiff. After receiving this reply in August 2009, learned counsel pointed

                out that the defendant did not initiate any further action until the suit was

                instituted in the year 2015.          On this issue, the oral evidence was also

                referred to. In particular, learned counsel referred to Questions 10 to 16 and

                17 to 20 and the answers thereto in the cross examination of P.W.1.                 By

                referring to question 16, learned counsel pointed out that P.W.1 was asked to

                explain whether there were any developments, as between the plaintiff and

                defendant, between 04.08.2009 and 05.01.2015 (when the suit was filed).

                In response, P.W.1 stated that nothing happened in between.                He also

                pointed out that P.W.1 admitted that no communication had been filed by

                the plaintiff to substantiate the statement in paragraph 24 of the proof

                affidavit that the plaintiff had been persuading the defendant to desist from

                using the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27;.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                                  13. The next contention of learned counsel for the defendant was

                that the plaintiff did not plead in the plaint that the trademark was

                substantially changed.            In fact, learned counsel submitted that such

                statement was not made even in the proof affidavit. Learned counsel also

                referred to the cross examination of D.W.1 at pages 111 to 130 of the typed

                set of pleadings and submitted, on that basis, that the defendant

                categorically stated that the goods are sold as per the label shown in Ex.D1

                except for the removal of the rose. In these circumstances, he submitted that

                acquiescence is proved beyond doubt and that <a href="/doc/642181/" id="a_14">Section 33(1)(b)</a> of the Trade

                Marks Act applies. By virtue thereof, once acquiescence is established, if

                the mark had been used for a continuous period of five years after the

                proprietor of the earlier trademark became aware of such use, the proprietor

                of the earlier mark cannot object to the use of the later mark. Learned

                counsel for the defendant reiterated that the knowledge of the plaintiff is

                clear from the cease and desist notice dated 28.07.2009 and paragraph 25 of

                the plaint. More importantly,                as a result of the reply dated

                04.08.2019(Ex.P41), the plaintiff was put on notice that the defendant is

                asserting its right to use the mark as the registered proprietor thereof, albeit

                in relation to idly and dosa batter. In support of the plea of acquiescence,

                the judgment of the Supreme Court in Power Control Appliances v. Sumeet

                Machines Private Limited (Power Control Appliances) (1994) 2 SCC 448

                was relied on.

                that the goods are not similar. Learned counsel conceded that <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_15">Section 29(2)</a>

                of the Trade Marks Act applies with regard to goods which are not in the

                same class but its application is restricted to similar goods. He further

                submitted that the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_16">Trade Marks Act</a> does not contain a definition of similar

                goods. In order to determine whether goods are similar, he submitted that

                more than one test is applicable. A widely used test is whether the goods are

                capable of being substituted. By that standard, he submitted that milk or

                milk products like ghee or butter cannot be substituted for idly and dosa

                batter. The second test is whether the goods are derived from a common

                source.           Once again, he submitted that idly and dosa batter and dairy

                products do not originate from a common source. By drawing reference to

                the cross examination of P.W.1 and, in particular, questions 23 and 24 and

                the answers thereto, he pointed out that P.W.1 admitted that the plaintiff

                manufactures and markets products under 7 or 8 trademarks such as Hatsun,

                Arokya, Arun, Ibaco, Oyalo Ready to Eat, Arun Unlimited, etc. By drawing

                reference to the cross examination of P.W.1 on 27.07.2020(page 90 of the

                typed set of pleadings), he pointed out that the ready to cook and ready to

                eat food products of the plaintiff are pizzas and samosas.           Thus, he

                submitted that the products of the plaintiff and defendant are substantially

                different and that <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_17">Section 29(2)</a> is not attracted. In order to buttress the

                contention that relief should not be granted as regards dissimilar goods, he

                relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Vishnudas Trading Co. v.

</p>
<p id="p_25">                                  15.   Learned counsel denied the assertion that the plaintiff&#x27;s

                trademark is a well known trademark in terms of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_18">Section 29(4)</a> of the Trade

                Marks Act. On this issue, he submitted that the reputation of the plaintiff

                should be tested with reference to the first date of use by the defendant and

                not with reference to the plaintiff&#x27;s reputation as on date. In support of this

                proposition, he relied on the judgment in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v.

                Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd. (Cadbury Schweppes)[1981] 1 ALL ER 213.

                Therefore, he stated that the reputation of the plaintiff should be tested as of

                2001.         With reference to <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_19">Section 29(4)</a>, he also pointed out that the

                requirements under clauses (a) to (c) thereof are cumulative conditions. In

                this case, he stated that even the primary requirement under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_20">Section 29(4)</a>,

                namely, use by a person who is not a registered proprietor is not satisfied

                because the defendant is the registered proprietor of the mark “Arokiya”.

                By referring to the defendant&#x27;s invoices from the year 2001(Ex.D9), he

                submitted that this establishes use by the defendant from the year 2001.

                &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in relation to products such as chappathi, parota, etc., he

                stated that the said application was abandoned. Consequently, he stated that

                the said application is irrelevant for purposes of the present suit.

</p><p id="p_26">                                  16. By way of rejoinder, learned counsel for the plaintiff

                submitted that the change in the defendant&#x27;s trademark was adverted to in

                paragraph 27 of the plaint. Therefore, he submitted that it cannot be said

                that there was no pleading with regard to the changed mark. In fact, he

                contended that the suit was filed because the defendant substantially

                changed the mark after obtaining registration. Learned counsel for the

                plaintiff relied upon paragraphs 15 to 17 of the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/170697/" id="a_21">Bachhaj Nahar v. Nilima Mandal and another</a> (2008) 17

                SCC 491 (Bachhaj Nahar) to contend that an issue may be raised if

                indirectly touched upon in pleadings provided issues were framed in respect

                thereof and evidence was recorded in relation thereto. He also relied upon

                the judgment in <a href="/doc/1472809/" id="a_22">Sardul Singh v. Pritam Singh and another</a> (1999) 3 SCC

                522 and, in particular, paragraph 12 thereof. By referring to the plaintiff&#x27;s

                reply to the examination report of the trademark registry, he contended that

                the defendant had obtained registration by asserting that the label mark

                written in the Tamil script with a rose in the top left corner is distinctive. By

                drawing reference to the judgment of the Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/315836/" id="a_23">Hindustan

                Pencils Private Limited v. India Stationary Products Co. &amp; another ILR</a>

                submitted that delay and acquiescence are distinguishable. He also

                submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that acquiescence is to

                permit somebody to not only invade your rights but spend money on it. In

                this case, he stated that the defendant did not take any steps to promote its

                brand or build its reputation. In this connection, he referred to the cross

                examination of D.W.1 on 27.04.2021 (Page 120 of the typed set of

                pleadings) and pointed out that the defendant admitted that they do not sell

                their products in the city of Chennai, and that the products are sold only

                within the distance of 50 to 100 Kms. from the place of business. On the

                question of similarity of goods, learned counsel contended that the Nice

                classification under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_24">Trade Marks Act</a> is only for registration purposes.

                For this proposition, he referred to the judgment in FDC Ltd.              On the

                similarity of goods, he submitted that both parties are engaged in the

                production of food products, which are perishable, and are stored in a

                refrigerator. The last contention was that the plaintiff is entitled to relief in

                made to the mark. He also pointed out that all the five requirements laid

                issues. Issue No.4 relates to whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain

                the suit. Since this is a preliminary issue, this is addressed first.            The

                plaintiff filed the suit before this court on the ground that it carries on

                business within the jurisdiction of this Court. The said assertion was made

                on the basis that the plaintiff has a branch office within the jurisdiction of

                this Court. Under <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_26">Section 134</a> of the Trade Marks Act, a suit may be filed

                where the plaintiff carries on business. Although the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

                Court concluded in <a href="/doc/51545606/" id="a_27">Indian Performing Right Society Limited v. Sanjay

                Dalia</a> (2015) 10 SCC 161 that <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_28">Section 134</a> should not be abused by filing a

                suit in a place with which the plaintiff does not have a genuine connection,

                in this case, the plaintiff has a branch office at Anna Nagar in Chennai

                where business is carried on. Besides, that judgment also turned on the

                explanation to Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, which does

</p><p id="p_31">                                  19. While the plaintiff contended that it had not acquiesced in the

                use of the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; by the defendant, the defendant contended

                that acquiescence was established both in terms of <a href="/doc/642181/" id="a_29">Section 33(1)(b)</a> of the

                Trade Marks Act and the common law. In order to substantiate this

                contention, the defendant referred to and relied upon paragraph 25 of the

                plaint. Paragraph 25 of the plaint is set out below:

                                  submits that during July 2009, the marketing section
                                  of the plaintiff came to know that the defendant has
                                  commenced using &#x27;AROKIYA&#x27; as trade              name and
                                  marketing Idly and Dosa batter under the trademark
                                  &#x27;AROKIYA&#x27; in Tamil in a similar fashion written in red
                                  with white background in respect of Idly Dosa Batter.
                                  Immediately, the plaintiff sent a communication
                                  asking the defendant herein to desist from using the
                                  plaintiff&#x27;s trademark.     The defendant received the

                                   Registered Proprietor of their trademark in Class 30.
                                   However, the plaintiff has been persuading the
                                   defendant to desist from using the offending
                                   trademark through their marketing officials. But, the
                                   defendant continues to use the offending trademark
                                   and as a result all their efforts to persuade the
                                   Defendant from using the offending trademark failed.
                                   Hence the plaintiff is now filing this suit.&#x27;&#x27;

                was issued on 28.07.2009.                By this notice, the plaintiff informed the

                defendant that it came to know that the defendant is trading under the name

                &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA FOODS” and selling idly and dosai flour. The defendant was

                also put on notice that this amounts to a violation of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_30">Trade Marks Act</a>

                and that legal proceedings would be taken unless the defendant desisted

                from the conduct complained of. The reply to the notice (Ex.P41) was

                issued on 04.08.2009. Since the reply is of considerable significance, the

                reply is set out in entirety:

</p><p id="p_35">                                  21. From the above pleadings and evidence, it is clear that the

                defendant informed the plaintiff that they are manufacturing and marketing

                instant idly and dosai flour for the past eight years. The defendant also put

                the plaintiff on notice of the following: that it adopted the trademark

                &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in relation to the products in the year 2001; that the defendant

                is the registered proprietor of the trademark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in Class 30 and

                such registration is in force; and that the defendant uses the mark only in

                relation to instant idly/dosa flour mix and that these products are different

                from the plaintiff&#x27;s products such as ice creams and milk. After stating the

                above, the defendant asserted that it had not violated any rules and that the

                threat of legal action is baseless. The plaintiff admits receipt of this reply

                and, in fact, exhibited this reply as Ex.P41 through P.W.1. In light of this

                reply, the plaintiff should have initiated legal proceedings within a

                reasonable time of such reply. Instead, the present suit was presented on

                05.01.2015. Undoubtedly, more than five years elapsed between the date of

                receipt of Ex.P41 and the date of presentation of the plaint.

</p><p id="p_36">                                  22. In this regard, the defendant relied upon <a href="/doc/66616/" id="a_31">Section 33</a> of the

                Trade Marks Act. <a href="/doc/66616/" id="a_32">Section 33</a> is set out below:

                                                 (1)Where the proprietor of an earlier trade mark has
                                  acquiesced for a continuous period of five years in the use of a
                                  registered trade mark, being aware of that use, he shall no
                                  longer be entitled on the basis of that earlier trade mark—

                                        mark in relation to the goods or services in relation
                                        to which it has been so used, unless the registration
                                        of the later trade mark was not applied in good
                                        faith.
</p><p id="p_40">                                                 (2)Where sub-section (1) applies, the proprietor of
                                  the later trade mark is not entitled to oppose the use of the
                                  earlier trade mark, or as the case may be, the exploitation of the
                                  earlier right, notwithstanding that the earlier trade mark may no
                                  longer be invoked against his later trade mark.&#x27;&#x27;



                Although learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that <a href="/doc/66616/" id="a_33">Section 33</a> is

                relevant only in respect of proceedings before the registry, the text of

                <a href="/doc/66616/" id="a_34">Section 33</a>, particularly clause (b) of sub-section (1), belies this contention.

                As per clause (b), in spite of knowledge of use of a registered trade mark, if

                there is acquiescence by the proprietor of the earlier mark for a continuous

                period of five years, the use of the later trade mark cannot be objected to

</p><p id="p_42">                                  23. As discussed above, paragraph 25 of the plaint, read with

                Exs.P40 and P41, establishes conclusively that the plaintiff became aware of

                the defendant&#x27;s use of the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in July 2009.                   When the

                defendant was put on notice that the use constitutes violation of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_36">Trade

                Marks Act</a>, the defendant replied in August 2009 and informed the plaintiff

                that the mark is being used in relation to idly and dosa batter from 2001 and

                that the defendant had registered the trademark in Class 30. The suit was

                filed more than five years after receipt of this reply and P.W.1 admitted in

                course of cross-examination that the plaintiff did not do anything in this

                regard in the interregnum.           In Power Control Appliances, the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court dealt extensively with acquiescence in the context of

                trademark law. Paragraph 26 thereof is set out below:

                                        money on it.      It is a course of conduct

                                        inconsistent with the claim for exclusive rights

                                   White Sr. John Romilly said: &#x27;&#x27;It is important to

                                   distinguish mere negligence and acquiescence&#x27;&#x27;.

                                   Therefore, acquiescence is one facet of delay.</blockquote><p id="p_43">

</p><p id="p_44">                                   If the plaintiff stood by knowingly and let the

                                   defendants build up an important trade until

                                   had become necessary to crush it, then the

                                   plaintiffs   would   be    stopped    by    their

                                   acquiescence.    If the acquiescence in the

                                   infringement amounts to consent, it will be a

                                   complete defence as was laid down in Mouson

                                   (J.G) &amp; Co. v. Boehm. The Acquiescence must

                                   be such as to lead to the inference of a licence

                                   sufficient to create a new right in the defendant

                                   as was laid down in Rodgers v. Nowill.&#x27;&#x27;

</p><p id="p_45">                                  24. The evidence on record indicates conclusively that the

                plaintiff was fully aware of the use of the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; in relation to

                idly dosa batter. In spite of being aware of such use, the plaintiff did not

                take action to restrain such use after receiving the reply notice in August

                2009. Thus, the plaintiff clearly sat by while its rights were allegedly

                invaded. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that such inaction

                while its rights are invaded is per se insufficient and that the defendant

                should have spent money in building its reputation and goodwill to rely on

                acquiescence. The defendant adduced evidence of use of the mark from the

                year 2001 by filing invoices, which were collectively exhibited as Ex.D9.

                The defendant also produced advertisements as Exs.D10, D11 and D12.

                Although the defendant did not adduce evidence of substantial turnover or

                promotional expenditure, in my view, such evidence is not necessary for

                purposes of establishing acquiescence. Indeed, this is a text book case of

                acquiescence. In view of the conclusion on acquiescence, it is unnecessary

                to consider if the plaintiff is guilty of laches or to examine the implications

                thereof. The additional issue is therefore decided in favour of the defendant

                and against the plaintiff.

</p>
<p id="p_47">                                  25. Recast Issue No.2 pertains to whether the goods are similar

                and, if not, whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs claimed. At the

                outset, it should be noticed that <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_37">Section 29(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act cannot

                be applied against the registered proprietor of a trade mark. Therefore, for

                purposes of this issue, I proceed on the assumption that the defendant&#x27;s mark

                is unregistered although the factual position is that the goods of the plaintiff

                are registered in Class 29 and those of the defendant in Class 30. The legal

                position is that <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_38">Section 29(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act would apply

                notwithstanding the fact that the goods fall under different classes provided

                the goods are considered similar.            Since the goods are admittedly not

                identical, clause (b) of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_39">Section 29</a> is relevant and, arguably, clause (a) and

                Therefore, the question that arises for consideration is whether the dairy

                products of the plaintiff are similar to the idly and dosa batter of the

                defendant and whether such similarity is likely to cause confusion or be

                associated with the registered trade mark. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_40">Because the Trade Marks Act</a>

                does not define the expression &#x27;&#x27;similarity of the goods or services&#x27;&#x27;, the

                services should be referred to. While learned counsel for the plaintiff relied

                on the tests prescribed in FDC Ltd., learned counsel for the defendant

                submitted that one of the tests is whether the goods may be substituted for

                one another. With reference to the products in question, he submitted that

                milk, ghee, curd, etc., which are the plaintiff&#x27;s products,             are all dairy

                products which originate from the cow and cannot be substituted by the

                plaintiff&#x27;s products. He also submitted that the defendant&#x27;s products have a

                completely different origin. In response and to the contrary, learned counsel

                for the plaintiff submitted that both the products of the plaintiff and

                defendant are food products that are used in the kitchen, and being

                perishable are stored in a refrigerator. In order to test similarity, it was

                contended that the matter should be examined from the perspective of a

                potential or actual consumer. If such consumer walks into a shop selling the

                two products and looks into the refrigerator, learned counsel for the plaintiff

                contended that it is likely that the consumer would find both products

                therein and be confused with regard to the origin thereof.



</p><p id="p_50">                                  26. The paramount consideration under trademark law is whether

                a mark is used or proposed to be used in relation to particular goods or

                services as a source identifier. Even without registration, rights are created

                by use but registration confers the statutory right to exclusive use coupled

                with the right to sue for infringement of the registered mark. An applicant is

                not entitled to registration unless such applicant establishes use or declares

                that the applicant proposes to use the mark in relation to specific goods.

                Trade Mark law also permits registration under multiple classes by filing

                separate or           multi-class applications. Given the object and purpose,

                protection is restricted to the goods or services in relation to which the mark

                is either used or proposed to be used and goods or services similar thereto.

                Indeed, in Vazir Sultan, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Trade

                Marks Registry in rectifying the register by restricting protection to

                cigarettes because the mark was used by the proprietor only in relation to

                cigarettes. The use of the expression “similarity in goods or services” under

                <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_41">Section 29(2)</a> should be viewed from the above perspective.



</p><p id="p_51">                                  27. When so viewed, it certainly cannot be concluded that all

                products used in the kitchen are similar. If so, the registered proprietor of a

                trademark in relation to milk and dairy products would be in a position to

                claim relief if an identical or deceptively similar mark is used             by a

                manufacturer of hobs or chimneys or refrigerators. Likewise, it cannot be

                extended to all food products because the expression food products is wide

                ranging and covers fruits, vegetables, cereals, meat and fish products,

                sweets, savouries, beverages, biscuits, dairy products, etc. Thus, all food

                products certainly cannot be considered similar for purposes of <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_42">Section

                29(2)</a>. In order to determine whether products or services are similar for

                purposes of <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_43">Section 29(2)</a>, multiple factors may have to be taken into

                consideration. In Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d

                492 (2nd Cir.1961), the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

                formulated the following criteria: the strength of the prior mark; the degree

                of similarity between the two marks; the proximity of the products; the

                likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap; actual confusion; the

                defendant&#x27;s good faith in adopting its own mark; the quality of the

                defendant&#x27;s product; and the sophistication of the buyers. In my view, while

                some of the above criteria such as the strength of the prior mark or the

                degree of similarity between the two marks or the defendant&#x27;s good faith in

                adopting its mark have a bearing either on the likelihood of confusion or the

                defendant&#x27;s intentions and, therefore, impact the grant or refusal of

                discretionary relief, they are not criteria for determining whether products or

                services are similar. In British Sugar Plc. v. James Robertson &amp; Sons Ltd.

                marks, the segment or class of consumers or potential consumers; retail

                environment, circumstances in which the later mark was adopted, etc. would

                have a bearing on likelihood of confusion, if the goods or services are

                similar, and on the grant of discretionary relief. It would be evident when

                these criteria are tested in concrete contexts that they are not cumulative. As

                between the criteria, it is also not advisable to establish a cast-in-iron

                hierarchy but criteria such as the nature, intended purpose and the

                competing or complementary nature of the products/services are more

                central to a determination of similarity; whereas, other factors like retail

                environment or addressable market become crucial while considering

                likelihood of confusion. Hence, after taking into consideration some or all

                of the above criteria in the specific factual context, the determination should

                be made largely objectively although subjectivity cannot be eliminated.

                While undertaking this exercise, as held In re Australian Wine Importers, it

                should be borne in mind that the classification is not determinative and that

                goods or services in the same class under the Nice Classification may be

                held to be dissimilar, whereas goods or services in different classes may be

                held to be similar.

                testing the criteria for similarity on pairs of goods or services may throw

                light on this issue. By way of caveat, it should be recognised that a full-scale

                examination of all relevant criteria can only be undertaken in a concrete

                factual context and this analysis, which is divorced from concrete context,

                may only serve as guidance. For test case 1, I draw from the pool of

                beverages by assuming that there is a prior mark in relation to coffee and an

                identical or deceptively similar subsequent mark used by a producer of tea.

                Would these products be considered similar? Both the products would

                qualify as beverages that fulfil the same or substantially the same purpose.

                Taste permitting, they can be used as substitutes. Both are commonly though

                not necessarily mixed in milk. They are likely to be sold in the same retail

                environment. On an overall basis, it is probable that they would be

                construed as similar goods. For test case 2, I turn to the automobile industry

                by assuming a prior mark used in relation to a motor car and a deceptively

                similar later mark used on a motorcycle. Both products are used as personal

                modes of transport. They may, albeit not in all circumstances, be used as

                substitutes. They are sold through similar trade channels but the class of

                customers is typically different. This pair of goods is also likely to be

                construed as similar but factors such as the strength of the prior mark and

                evidence on whether the proprietor of the senior mark intends to enter the

                motorcycle market may tilt the balance. Moving back to the kitchen but not

                to food products for test case 3: a prior mark applied to a hob and a

                subsequent deceptively similar mark applied to a chimney. They fulfil

                different immediate purposes and therefore certainly cannot be used as

                substitutes. However, they are complementary and are typically sold in the

                same retail environment. In spite of serving different purposes and not being

                capable of being used as substitutes, they are likely to be construed as

                similar because the chimney is important for the use of the hob and

                therefore there is a close and direct connection. Staying with appliances for

                test case 4, washing machines and dryers would probably be judged as

                similar since they are similarly complementary but not washing machines

                and refrigerators (test case 5).

                case 7) are in the financial services space, they may not qualify as similar

                because they do not serve the same purpose, cannot be substituted and are

                not sufficiently complementary. However, given that service marks typically

                tie-in with the corporate/trade name, the later mark may not pass muster

                with regulators such as the Registrar of Companies or the Insurance

                Regulatory and Development Authority of India. Even otherwise, it should

                be recognised that the strength of the prior mark, the circumstances in which

                the later mark was adopted and the like could impact the determination.

                Drawing on another example from services, restaurants and food delivery

                services (test case 8) are likely to meet the criteria for similarity. Circling

                back to food products for test case 9, if the prior mark is applied to rice and

                the deceptively similar subsequent mark to wheat, would they be considered

                similar? In my view, yes. They are cereals; taste and preference permitting,

                they may be used as substitutes; and trace their origin from plants. For test

                case 10, I stay with food products and assume a prior mark for biscuits and a

                subsequent mark for chicken. The first product is ready-to-eat while the

                latter is not. The former is eaten as a snack and the latter as part of a meal.

                They are not substitutes or complementary products and may not be

                considered similar.

</p><p id="p_61">                                  31. From the above analysis, the conclusions I draw are that

                products/services that are used for substantially the same purpose and are,

                therefore, capable of being used as substitutes are likely to be construed as

                similar (tea and coffee; rice and wheat). Likewise, products/services that

                are complementary and help achieve a larger common purpose are also

                likely to be construed as similar (washing machine and dryer; hob and

                chimney) provided the complementarity is such that the use of one product

                is necessary or important for the use of the other, such as in the two sets of

                products in parenthesis. For this proposition, I draw inspiration from the

                judgment of the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European

                Union in IQ Group Holdings Bhd. v. European Union Intellectual Property

                Office, Judgment dated 19.03.2019. Unless direct complementarity is made

                the yardstick, all products used in the kitchen or all food products could be

                construed as complementary because it could be contended with a measure

                of justification that all such products provide for and enhance the food

                consumption or dietary experience. Hence, broad commonalities such as use

                as food products or use in the kitchen will not suffice. Against this

                backdrop, the similarity or dissimilarity of the goods in question in this case

                is examined next.

</p><p id="p_63">                                  32. The plaintiff&#x27;s product, namely, milk and dairy products

                originate from the cow, whereas the defendant&#x27;s products originate from

                plant sources. These products clearly cannot be used as substitutes for one

                another. The object and purpose for which milk and dairy products are used

                is completely different from the object and purpose for which idly/ dosa

                batter is used.          Without doubt, they are both food products and are

                perishable. Therefore, they are typically stored in a refrigerator. However,

                those similarities are insufficient for the said products to be construed as

                similar products for purposes of <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_44">Section 29(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act. The

                manner of adoption of the later mark and the fact that “AROGYA” and its

                variants mean health and well-being add muscle to this conclusion. This

                leads to the consequential question whether the plaintiff&#x27;s mark is entitled to

                protection under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_45">Section 29(4)</a> of the Trade Marks Act.

                impugned mark. Even if we proceed on the assumption that the defendant

                should be treated as the proprietor of an unregistered mark because of

                unilateral alteration, the requirements of clauses (a) to (c) of sub-<a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_47">section

                29(4)</a> should be cumulatively satisfied on account of use of the conjunction

                “and” between the clauses. By taking note of the conclusion on Issue No.2

                and the phonetic and visual similarity of the marks, clauses (a) and (b) are

                satisfied. Turning to clause (c), the defendant asserted and adduced evidence

                of use from 2001 and by relying on Cadbury Schweppes contended that the

                plaintiff&#x27;s reputation should be tested as of 2001. I concur with the

                contention that the reputation of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark should be tested as of

                2001. If so tested, the evidence on record does not prove reputation for

                purposes of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_48">Section 29(4)</a>. More importantly, it certainly cannot be inferred

                that the use of the mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; by the defendant in relation to idly and

                dosa batter from the year 2001 is without due cause or takes unfair

                advantage of the distinctive character and reputation of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark.

                For all these reasons, the plaintiff&#x27;s claim to protection under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_49">Section 29(4)</a>

                of the Trade Marks Act cannot be accepted. Therefore, recast Issue No.2 is

                also decided in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff. In light of

                the findings on re-cast Issue No. 2, which was recorded after assuming that

                the defendant&#x27;s mark is unregistered, and the additional issue on

                acquiescence, it has become immaterial and unnecessary to examine in

                detail the implications of the defendant&#x27;s unilateral alteration of their

                registered mark.

</p><p id="p_66">                                  34.   Issue No.3 pertains to the maintainability of the suit as

                regards the relief of infringement, and is dealt with first before dealing with

                Issue No.1. As stated earlier, the re-cast Issue No.2 was decided by

                assuming that the defendant&#x27;s mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; is unregistered and, on

                such assumption, a conclusion was reached that the products in relation to

                which the two marks are applied are not similar. <a href="/doc/463218/" id="a_50">Section 59</a> of the Trade

                Marks Act enables the registered proprietor of a trade mark to apply to the

                Registrar for permission to alter the trade mark in any manner not

                substantially affecting the identity thereof.         In this case, the defendant

                admittedly did not apply for permission under <a href="/doc/463218/" id="a_51">Section 59</a>. The statute does

                not, however, prohibit the use of an unregistered mark or the use of an

                unilaterally altered registered mark. The defendant admitted the alteration of

                the registered trade mark (Ex.D1) to the extent of removing the pictorial

                device of the rose but contended that the change is not substantial. The

                defendant also contended that the plaintiff did not plead substantial change

                and this contention was responded to by relying on Bachhaj Nahar for the

                proposition that if an issue was framed and evidence adduced, the matter

                may be raised. In light of the findings on other issues, it is unnecessary to

                grapple with these nuances. Even if the suit for infringement were to be

                held to be maintainable because the alteration of the mark was unilateral,

                such conclusion becomes immaterial in view of the findings on

                acquiescence and on re-cast Issue No.2. As regards Issue No.1, the

                defendant&#x27;s mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKIYA&#x27;&#x27; is undoubtedly phonetically and visually

                similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s mark &#x27;&#x27;AROKYA&#x27;&#x27;. However, once again, in view of

                the conclusion on acquiescence and dissimilarity of the goods, the

                conclusion on the similarity of the marks is largely academic. Issue Nos.1

                and 3 are disposed of in the above terms.

                acquiescence have a bearing on passing off also, it is necessary to briefly

                discuss passing off because <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_52">Section 29</a> only pertains to infringement. The

                defendant&#x27;s use of the mark is from the year 2001 and the registration is in

                force from the year 2004. The plaintiff became aware of the defendant&#x27;s use

                of the mark, including the circumstances thereof, in the year 2009 and did

                not institute legal proceedings until January 2015. The defendant&#x27;s use is

                restricted to idly and dosa batter and these products are not made by the

                plaintiff. Indeed, the evidence on record shows that the plaintiff uses

                different trade marks for its products, and even dairy products such as

                paneer and ice creams are sold under the brands “HATSUN” and “ARUN”

                or “IBACO”, respectively. As stated earlier, the word “AROGYA” and its

                variants mean “health” or “well being” in many Indian languages, and

                neither deceit not misrepresentation may be attributed to the defendant in

                its adoption of the mark “AROKIYA” for idly dosa batter. Therefore, no

                case is made out to accept the allegation of passing off. Hence, primarily on

                the ground of acquiescence and secondarily on the ground that the goods are

                dissimilar, the plaintiff is not entitled to succeed. Since costs follow the
