</blockquote><p id="p_9">3.1   The present controversy arose when both the
parties had staked claim over possession of a certain
land, and that in the heat of the moment, a physical
tussle broke out between the parties in respect of the
land in question, and F.I.R.s were lodged and cross
cases were filed, subsequent to said incident. Thus, as
per the pleaded facts, the present criminal appeals
pertain to the said cross cases between the parties.
3.2   The   present       appeals        preferred          against     the
judgments of conviction in question were admitted and
the sentences so awarded to the appellants were
suspended.      However,        upon       an    application          being
preferred by the applicant/appellant-Shiv Puri @ Babu
Puri under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_14">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. seeking suspension of
his conviction (in S.B. Criminal Appeal No.894/2005),
the same was allowed by this Hon&#x27;ble Court on
14.12.2016. Thereafter, while the criminal appeals
were pending consideration before this Hon&#x27;ble Court,
a compromise was entered into between the parties
(in criminal appeal No.894/2005), which upon being
presented before this Hon&#x27;ble Court on 22.01.2020,
was ordered to be verified by the Registrar (Judicial);
the same was accordingly verified on the same day.

4.1     As regards accused-appellant Gopal Ram (in

submits that though his name is not appearing in the

have settled the dispute between them coupled with
the fact that the said accused/appellant was held guilty
for the offence under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_16">Section 323</a> IPC only, therefore,
the indulgence of acquittal may also be granted in his
case.

reliance on the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court
rendered in Ramgopal &amp; Anr. Vs. The State of
Madhya Pradesh 2021 (4) Crimes 17 (SC) wherein
the Hon&#x27;ble Court observed as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">              &quot;It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of
        an express provision akin to <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_17">Section 482</a> Code of
        Criminal Procedure conferring powers on the Supreme
        Court to abrogate and set aside criminal proceedings,
        the jurisdiction exercisable Under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_18">Article 142</a> of the
        Constitution embraces this Court with scopious powers
        to quash criminal proceedings also, so as to secure
        complete justice. In doing so, due regard must be
        given to the overarching objective of sentencing in the
        criminal justice system, which is grounded on the sub-
        lime philosophy of maintenance of peace of the
        collective and that the rationale of placing an individual
        behind bars is aimed at his reformation.</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">        We thus sum-up and hold that as opposed to <a href="/doc/91933/" id="a_19">Section

context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in
mind: (i) Nature and effect of the offence on the
conscious of the society; (ii) Seriousness of the injury,
if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise between
the Accused and the victim; &amp; (iv) Conduct of the
Accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of
the    purported         offence       and/or           other   relevant
considerations.
</p><p id="p_14">Having appraised the afore-stated para-meters and
weighing upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of
the two appeals before us, we are inclined to invoke
powers Under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_23">Article 142</a> and quash the criminal
proceedings and consequently set aside the conviction
in both the appeals. We say so for the reasons that:
Firstly, the occurrence(s) involved in these appeals
can be categorized as purely personal or having
overtones of criminal proceedings of private nature;
Secondly, the nature of injuries incurred, for
which the Appellants have been convicted, do
not appear to exhibit their mental depravity or
commission of an offence of such a serious
nature that quashing of which would override
public interest;
</p><p id="p_15">Thirdly, given the nature of the offence and injuries,
it is immaterial that the trial against the Appellants
had been concluded or their appeal(s) against
conviction stand dismissed;
</p><p id="p_16">Fourthly,     the    parties on their              own volition,
without any coercion or compulsion, willingly
and voluntarily have buried their differences
and    wish         to   accord       a     quietus        to   their
dispute(s);
</p><p id="p_17">Fifthly, the occurrence(s) in both the cases took
place way back in the years 2000 and 1995,
respectively. There is nothing on record to evince
that   either       before      or    after      the      purported
compromise, any untoward incident transpired
between the parties;</p><pre id="pre_2">
Sixthly,      since       the        Appellants           and     the

</pre><p id="p_18">      village(s) and/or work in close vicinity, the
      quashing of criminal proceedings will advance
      peace, harmony, and fellowship amongst the
      parties who have decided to forget and forgive
      any ill-will and have no vengeance against each
      other; and
      Seventhly,      the     cause       of     administration        of
      criminal     justice      system         would         remain   un-

      settlement         between          the        parties     and/or
      resultant acquittal of the Appellants; more so
      looking at their present age.&quot;
</p><p id="p_19">6.    On the other hand, learned counsel for the
respondents, however, oppose the submissions so
made on behalf of the appellants, and submit that the
offences in question are that of a serious nature,
<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_24">Section 307</a> I.P.C. being amongst the offences, and
that a compromise between the concerned parties, in
a criminal case wherein the intention of the accused
person(s) in inflicting injuries, the success of which is
immaterial,      is that of causing grave injury on vital
parts of the body, as may be ascertained from the
facts and circumstances of the case, as also from the
record of the case.

     discharge the Accused.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     ii. The Trial Judge is not a mere Post Office to frame
     the charge at the instance of the prosecution.
     iii. The Judge has merely to sift the evidence in order
     to find out whether or not there is sufficient ground
     for   proceeding.         Evidence       would      consist   of   the
     statements recorded by the Police or the documents

     show that the Accused committed offence, then,

     the trial&quot;.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     v. It is open to the Accused to explain away the
     materials giving rise to the grave suspicion.

     the total effect of the evidence and the documents
     produced before the court, any basic infirmities
     appearing in the case and so on. This, however,
     would not entitle the court to make a roving inquiry
     into the pros and cons.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     vii. At the time of framing of the charges, the
     probative value of the material on record cannot be
     gone into, and the material brought on record by the
     prosecution, has to be accepted as true.
     viii. There must exist some materials for entertaining
     the strong suspicion which can form the basis for
     drawing up a charge and refusing to discharge the
     Accused.

</p><p id="p_23">      &quot;Several judgments of this Court have interpreted
<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_30">Section 307</a> of the Penal Code. <a href="/doc/384160/" id="a_31">In State of Maharashtra v.
Balram Bama Patil</a> (1983) 2 SCC 28, this Court held that it is
not necessary that a bodily injury sufficient under normal
circumstances to cause death should have been inflicted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      9. ...To justify a conviction under this Section it is not
      essential that bodily injury capable of causing death
      should have been inflicted. Although the nature of
      injury actually caused may often give considerable
      assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention
      of the Accused, such intention may also be deduced
      from other circumstances, and may even, in some
      cases, be ascertained without any reference at all to
      actual wounds. The Section makes a distinction
      between an act of the Accused and its result, if any.
      Such an act may not be attended by any result
      so far as the person assaulted is concerned, but
      still there may be cases in which the culprit
      would be liable under this section. It is not
      necessary that the injury actually caused to the
      victim of the assault should be sufficient under
      ordinary circumstances to cause the death of the
      person assaulted. What the Court has to see is
      whether the act, irrespective of its result, was
      done with the intention or knowledge and
      under circumstances mentioned in this section.
      An attempt in order to be criminal need not be the
      penultimate act. It is sufficient in law, if there is
      present an intent coupled with some overt act in
      execution thereof.

This position in law was followed by subsequent benches of
this Court. <a href="/doc/440197/" id="a_32">In State of M.P. v. Saleem</a> (2005) 5 SCC 554, this

with regard to the exercise of a High Court&#x27;s inherent

      inferior court, as the case may be. Though the section
      does not specifically use the expression &#x27;prevent abuse
      of process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends
      of justice&#x27;, the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_58">Section 397</a> is a very
      limited one. The legality, proprietary or correctness of

      error, non-compliance with the provisions of law, the
      decision is completely erroneous or where the judicial
      discretion is exercised arbitrarily. On the other hand,
      <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_60">Section 482</a> is based upon the maxim quando lex liquid

ensure that the process of the Court is not permitted to
be abused.
</blockquote><p id="p_32">It may be somewhat necessary to have a comparative
examination of the powers exercisable by the Court
under these two provisions. There may be some
overlapping between these two powers because both
are aimed at securing the ends of justice and both have
an element of discretion. But, at the same time,
inherent power under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_61">Section 482</a> of the Code being an
extraordinary and residuary power, it is inapplicable in
regard to matters which are specifically provided for
under other provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62"> of the Code</a>. To put it simply,
normally the court may not invoke its power under
<a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_63">Section 482</a> of the Code              where a party could have
availed of the remedy available under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_64">Section 397</a> of
the Code itself. The inherent powers under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_65">Section 482</a>
of the Code are of a wide magnitude and are not as
limited as the power under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_66">Section 397</a>. <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_67">Section 482</a>
can be invoked where the order in question is
neither an interlocutory order within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_68">Section 397(2)</a> nor a final order in the strict
sense. Reference in this regard can be made to
Raj Kapoor and Ors. v. State of Punjab and Ors.
</p><p id="p_33">MANU/SC/0210/1979                :   AIR     1980    SC   258   :
</p><p id="p_34">(1980) 1 SCC 43]}. In this very case, this Court
has observed that inherent power under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_69">Section
482</a> may not be exercised if the bar under
<a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_70">Sections 397(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_71">397(3)</a> applies, except in
extraordinary situations, to prevent abuse of the
process of the Court. This itself shows the fine
distinction between the powers exercisable by the
Court under these two provisions. In this very case, the
Court also considered as to whether the inherent
powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_72">Section 482</a> stand
repelled when the revisional power under <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_73">Section 397</a>
overlaps. Rejecting the argument, the Court said
that the opening words of <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_74">Section 482</a> contradict
this contention because nothing in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_75"> the Code</a>, not
even <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_76">Section 397</a>, can affect the amplitude of the
inherent powers preserved in so many terms by

      the language of <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_77">Section 482</a>. There is no total ban
      on the exercise of inherent powers where abuse
      of    the   process        of      the      Court       or    any     other
      extraordinary           situation           invites          the     court&#x27;s
      jurisdiction.        The      limitation        is       self-restraint,
      nothing more. The distinction between a final and
      interlocutory order is well known in law. The orders
      which will be free from the bar of <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_78">Section 397(2)</a> would
      be the orders which are not purely interlocutory but, at
      the same time, are less than a final disposal. They
      should be the orders which do determine some right
      and still are not finally rendering the Court functus
      officio of the lis. The provisions of <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_79">Section 482</a> are
      pervasive. It should not subvert legal interdicts written
      into the same Code but, however, inherent powers of
      the    Court    unquestionably           have      to    be        read   and
      construed as free of restriction.&quot;

                                                Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, previous
                                                conviction against a person shall include any previous

                                        13.2    This Court, in light of the aforesaid observations,
                                        deems the present case to be a fit case for granting of

                                        appellant   has   no     prior    criminal antecedents          and was
                                        convicted under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_104">Section 323</a> IPC by the learned court below,
                                        wherein     the   maximum         sentence       of    imprisonment    as
                                        aforementioned, is one year; and this Court, being conscious
                                        of the fact that the appellant&#x27;s sentence was suspended by
                                        this Court in its order dated 16.12.2005, hereby directs that
                                        the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.910/2005 be released
                                        under <a href="/doc/1311361/" id="a_105">Section 3</a> of the Act of 1958 after due admonition.
                                        13.3 Criminal Appeal No.910/2005 is thus partly
                                        allowed.
