                                       are phonetically different and even from a visual perspective
                                       the actual label/mark MINDAUTO is nowhere close to the
                                       device mark of the Plaintiffs. The rival trademarks are
                                       registered for goods falling in different classes and the nature of
                                       goods is also different and thus, there can be no confusion or
                                       association in the minds of the public and no case of
                                       infringement is made out. Reliance was placed on the judgment
                                       of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_3">Nandhini Deluxe v. Karnataka

                                       made by the Supreme Court that where not only the visual
                                       appearance of the two marks is different but if they relate to
                                       different products, it is difficult to imagine that an average man
                                       of ordinary intelligence would associate the goods of the
                                       Appellant with the Respondent. By way of an illustration, it
                                       was contended that the trademark &#x27;Jaguar&#x27; is a trademark of
                                       two companies, where one deals in automobiles and the other in

                                       2021-22. Defendants have spent considerable amount of money
                                       in advertising their products.
</p><p id="p_23">                                    g. Present suit is not maintainable as the trade name MINDA is a
                                       common name and also the name of a village in District Nagaur
                                       in Rajasthan and the forefathers of the Defendants belong to the
                                       said village. Being a common name, no entity can be given a
                                       monopoly or an exclusive right to use the same.
                                    h. Nature of the businesses of the Plaintiffs and Defendants is
                                       totally different inasmuch as Plaintiffs are in the business of
                                       making and selling automobile spare parts while Defendants are
                                       into sale of lubricants, industrial oils and grease.
                                    i. Purpose of a trademark is to identify the source and avoid
                                       confusion in the minds of the buyers. In the present case, since

                                       the fact that Plaintiffs have not produced any material to show

                                       Del 6379, wherein it was held that if it is found that the suit

                                       the word MINDA, there is a high degree of visual and
                                       conceptual similarity, owing to use of similar colour
                                       combinations, font size, style of writing, etc. The colour
                                       scheme in the competing marks is a combination of blue and

                                       boxes and UNO in a white colour on a blue background in the

                                    It is necessary to apply both the visual and phonetic tests. <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_20">In

                                       &#x27;The answer to the question whether the sound of one word
                                      resembles too nearly the sound of another so as to bring
                                      the former within the limits of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_21">Section 12</a> of the Trade
                                      Marks Act, 1938, must nearly always depend on first
                                      impression, for obviously a person who is familiar with
                                      both words will neither be deceived nor confused. It is the
                                      person who only knows the one word and has perhaps an
                                      imperfect recollection of it who is likely to be deceived or
                                      confused. Little assistance, therefore, is to be obtained
                                      from a meticulous comparison of the two words, letter by
                                      letter and syllable by syllable, pronounced with the clarity
                                      to be expected from a teacher of elocution. The Court must
                                      be careful to make allowance for imperfect recollection
                                      and the effect of careless pronunciation and speech on the
                                      part not only of the person seeking to buy under the trade
                                      description, but also of the shop assistant ministering to
                                      that person&#x27;s wants.&#x27;
                                  It is also important that the marks must be compared as
                                  wholes. It is not right to take a portion of the word and say
                                  that because that portion of the word differs from the
                                  corresponding portion of the word in the other case there is no
                                  sufficient similarity to cause confusion. The true test is
                                  whether the totality of the proposed trade mark is such that it
                                  is likely to cause deception or confusion or mistake in the
                                  minds of persons accustomed to the existing trade mark. Thus
                                  in Lavroma case [<a href="/doc/144350656/" id="a_22">Tokalon Ltd. v. Davidson &amp; Co</a>., 32 RPC

                                      microscopic inspection, but to be taken from the general

                          phonetic similarity cannot be jettisoned, even when the manner in which the
                          competing words are written, is different. In Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya
                          Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC            449, the test of phonetic similarity was
                          applied by the Supreme Court in judging the two competing marks
                          &#x27;AMRITDHARA&#x27; and &#x27;LAKSHMANDHARA&#x27;. It would be useful to allude
                          to paras 6 and 7 of the judgment, which are extracted hereunder:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                  &quot;6. It will be noticed that the words used in the sections and
                                  relevant for our purpose are &#x27;likely to deceive or cause
                                  confusion&#x27;. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_23">The Act</a> does not lay down any criteria for
                                  determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion.
                                  Therefore, every case must depend on its own particular facts,
                                  and the value of authorities lies not so much in the actual
                                  decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to
                                  deceive or cause confusion. On an application to register, the
                                  Registrar or an opponent may object that the trade mark is not
                                  registrable by reason of clause (a) of <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_24">Section 8</a>, or sub-section
                                  (1) of <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_25">Section 10</a>, as in this case. In such a case the onus is on
                                  the applicant to satisfy the Registrar that the trade mark
                                  applied for is not likely to deceive or cause confusion. In cases
                                  in which the tribunal considers that there is doubt as to
                                  whether deception is likely, the application should be refused.
                                  A trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion by its
                                  resemblance to another already on the register if it is likely to
                                  do so in the course of its legitimate use in a market where the
                                  two marks are assumed to be in use by traders in that market.
                                  In considering the matter, all the circumstances of the case
                                  must be considered. As was observed by Parker, J. in Pianotist
                                  Co.&#x27;s Application, Re [(1906) 23 RPC 774] which was also a

                                       circumstances; and you must further consider what is
                                      likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a
                                      normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective
                                      owners of the marks.&#x27; (p. 777)

                                  For deceptive resemblance two important questions are: (1)
                                  who are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to
                                  deceive or confuse, and (2) what rules of comparison are to be
                                  adopted in judging whether such resemblance exists. As to
                                  confusion, it is perhaps an appropriate description of the state
                                  of mind of a customer who, on seeing a mark thinks that it
                                  differs from the mark on goods which he has previously
                                  bought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not due to
                                  imperfect recollection.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                  7. Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our
                                  consideration. It is not disputed before us that the two names
                                  &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshman-dhara&quot; are in use in respect of
                                  the same description of goods, namely a medicinal preparation
                                  for the alleviation of various ailments. Such medicinal
                                  preparation will be purchased mostly by people who instead of
                                  going to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for the quick
                                  alleviation of their suffering, both villagers and townsfolk,
                                  literate as well as illiterate. As we said in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_26">Corn Products
                                  Refining Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd</a>. [(1960) (1) SCR
                                  968] the question has to be approached from the point of view
                                  of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To
                                  such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity-of
                                  the two names &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; is, in our
                                  opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must
                                  consider the overall similarity of the two composite words
                                  &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. We do not think that
                                  the learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that
                                  no Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary
                                  purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection
                                  would not, as the High Court supposed, split the name into its
                                  component parts and consider the etymological meaning
                                  thereof or even consider the meaning of the composite words
                                  as &quot;current of nectar&quot; or &quot;current of Lakshman&quot;. He would

                                  been told about, or about which has otherwise learnt and
                                  which he wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to goods
                                  largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no
                                  answer to say that a person educated in the Hindi language
                                  would go by the etymological or ideological meaning and see
                                  the difference between &quot;current of nectar&quot; and &quot;current of
                                  Lakshman&quot;. &quot;Current of Lakshman&quot; in a literal sense has no
                                  meaning; to give it meaning one must further make the
                                  inference that the &quot;current or stream&quot; is as pure and strong as
                                  Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or
                                  townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the
                                  Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he would
                                  etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called ideological
                                  difference between &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. He
                                  would go more by the similarity of the two names in the
                                  context of the widely known medicinal preparation which he

                                  imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the
                                  plaintiff&#x27;s rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the
                                  essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
                                  adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and
                                  other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which
                                  he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or
                                  indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the
                                  registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial;
                                  whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape
                                  liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to
                                  distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_44">                                   29. When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is
                                  claimed to infringe the plaintiff&#x27;s mark is shown to be &quot;in the
                                  course of trade&quot;, the question whether there has been an
                                  infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two marks.
                                  Where the two marks are identical no further questions arise;
                                  for then the infringement is made out. When the two marks are
                                  not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the
                                  mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff&#x27;s
                                  registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion
                                  and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered
                                  (Vide <a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_28">Section 21</a>). A point has sometimes been raised as to
                                  whether the words &quot;or cause confusion&quot; introduce any
                                  element which is not already covered by the words &quot;likely to
                                  deceive&quot; and it has sometimes been answered by saying that it
                                  is merely an extension of the earlier test and does not add very
                                  materially to the concept indicated by the earlier words &quot;likely
                                  to deceive&quot;. But this apart, as the question arises in an action
                                  for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish
                                  that the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of
                                  trade in the goods in respect of which his mark is registered, is
                                  deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be ascertained by a
                                  comparison of the two marks -- the degree of resemblance
                                  which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being
                                  capable of definition by laying down objective standards. The
                                  persons who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers
                                  of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that
                                  is the subject of consideration. The resemblance may be
                                  phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the
                                  plaintiff&#x27;s mark. The purpose of the comparison is for
                                  determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                                  trade mark are to be found in that used by the defendant. The
                                  identification of the essential features of the mark is in essence
                                  a question of fact and depends on the judgment of the Court
                                  based on the evidence led before it as regards the usage of the
                                  trade. It should, however, be borne in mind that the object of
                                  the enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by
                                  the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the
                                  registered mark of the plaintiff.&quot;

                          the test of similarity of goods is to be looked at from a business and
                          commercial point of view and the nature and composition of goods,
                          respective uses and the trade channels through which they are bought and
                          sold would go into consideration in this context. In Kerly 15th Ed.,
                          para 9-065, it is stated that the element of distinctive character of a
                          trademark and its reputation is also viewed when determining similarity
                          between the goods and services and whether such similarity is enough to
                          give rise to a likelihood of confusion.

                          sector i.e. automobiles. Lubricants, industrial oils and grease, which are the
                          goods of the Defendants and the automobile parts, which are the goods of
                          the Plaintiffs are used in vehicles and are invariable sold in the same shops.
                          Therefore, the consumer base is the same and the trade channels are
                          identical and there is likelihood of confusion and/or association that the

                          1539, culling out the principles that emerged from the various judicial
                          precedents on the common law rights in passing off, the Court observed that
                          in order to claim passing off, Plaintiff is required to establish
                          misrepresentation by the Defendant, likelihood of confusion in the minds of
                          the public that the goods of the Defendant are those of the Plaintiff, applying
                          the test of a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection,
                          reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff and likelihood of loss. While
                          examining the likelihood of confusion, the Court would take into
                          consideration factors such as nature of the market, class of customers, extent
                          of reputation of the Plaintiff, trade channels, trade connection, in
                          conjunction. It is indisputable that passing off is an action predicated on the
                          goodwill, unlike infringement, which is based on a proprietary right
                          conferred by registration of the trademark. It is an action of deceit by the
                          Defendant and gives the common law right to the Plaintiff to protect its
                          goodwill in business against misrepresentation caused in the trade by the
                          Defendant and is based on the principle that no person can be permitted to
                          carry on his or her business on the pretext that it is the business of another.

                          v. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd</a>., (2002) 2 SCC 147, the primordial
                          submission of the Appellant was that in the absence of any similarity of
                          goods manufactured or sold by the parties the question of deception or
                          confusion amongst the consumers did not arise. The Supreme Court,
                          rejecting the said contention held that the Plaintiff had acquired immense
                          reputation and the name had become distinctive of the Plaintiff and thus any
                          attempt by any other person to use the name in business and trade circles is
                          likely to create an impression or a connection with the Plaintiff&#x27;s Group of

                          of the Plaintiff. In Kamal Trading Co. Bombay and Ors. v. Gillettee U.K.

                                  for grant of interim relief. It was submitted that the goods
                                  manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are different
                                  nature; the plaintiffs manufacture blades, while the defendants
                                  manufacture &quot;tooth brushes&quot;. The goods of the plaintiffs and
                                  the defendants are available in the same shop and the
                                  customers of these goods are different. The goods sold by the
                                  plaintiffs are blades and fall in Class 8, while those of the
                                  defendants are tooth brushes which fall in class 21. Relying on
                                  these circumstances, it is contended that there was no
                                  likelihood of any deception. We are unable to see any merit in
                                  this submission. In the first instance, the assumption of the
                                  learned counsel that the class of customers for purchase of
                                  safety blades and tooth brushes are different and these goods
                                  are not available in the same shops is wholly misconceived.</blockquote>

                          Be it noted that the Plaintiffs were manufacturing electrical goods and

                                  submitted that in the present case, there is a specific evidence
                                  on record that the word &quot;Bajaj&quot; was used by the defendants
                                  dishonestly and deliberately with a view to take advantage of
                                  the reputation earned by the plaintiffs. The learned counsel
                                  referred to us to a passage at p. 408 in Kerly&#x27;s Law of Trade
                                  Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth Edition, and submitted that
                                  once intent to deceive is established, then the defendants could
                                  not claim that they were entitled to use word &quot;Bajaj&quot; as a
                                  trading sign. In support of the submission, the learned counsel
                                  invited our attention to the brochure (Ex. &#x27;G&#x27; annexed to the
                                  plaint) wherein the defendants have claimed that Bajaj quality
                                  is well accepted and appreciated internationally. Mr.
                                  Tulzapurkar points out and it is not in dispute that the
                                  defendants have never marketed their goods abroad, nor have

                                   they even claimed that their goods are sold all over the
                                  country. Mr. Tulzapurkar is right and we agree with the
                                  learned trial Judge that the brochure published in the year
                                  1987 is issued with a view to cause deception or confusion in
                                  the mind of the customers. The word &#x27;Bajaj&#x27; has quite a great
                                  reputation in the country and abroad and the publication of
                                  the brochure in year 1987 clearly indicates that the defendants
                                  were not honest in the use of the word &quot;Bajaj&quot; and an attempt
                                  was made to pass off their goods with the mark &quot;Bajaj&quot; with
                                  the intention to secure advantage of the reputation earned by
                                  the plaintiffs.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">                                        The submission of Mr. Tulzapurkar was controverted by
                                  Mr. Cooper by urging that the goods manufactured by the
                                  plaintiffs and the defendants are totally different and,
                                  therefore, there is no cause or apprehension that the use of the
                                  word &quot;Bajaj&quot; is likely to cause deception or confusion in the
                                  mind of the public. Mr. Cooper submitted that the articles
                                  manufactured by the defendants are utensils and those
                                  marketed by the plaintiffs are electrical goods or appliances
                                  and, therefore, it is unlikely that the purchasers of utensils
                                  would be confused by the use of the word &quot;Bajaj&quot; on the
                                  articles of the defendants. The learned counsel submitted that
                                  the plaintiffs&#x27; goods are sold under registered mark under
                                  Class 11, while the goods manufactured by the defendants fall
                                  under Class 21. Class 11 refers to installations for lighting,
                                  heating, steam generating, cooking, refrigerating, drying,
                                  ventilating, and other purposes, while Class 21 refers to small
                                  domestic utensils and containers (not of precious metal nor
                                  coated therewith). The submission of Mr. Cooper is that as the
                                  articles manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are
                                  different, the question of deception would not arise. It is not
                                  possible to accept the submission. The articles manufactured
                                  by the plaintiffs and the defendants are kitchen wares and
                                  are commonly used in almost every kitchen in this country.</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">                                  The mere fact that the articles manufactured by the
                                  contesting parties are different in nature is no answer to the
                                  claim that the defendants are guilty of passing off. We
                                  entirely agree with the conclusion recorded by the learned
                                  trial Judge that there is identity of the goods, the mark and

                                   the consumer and the goods manufactures by both the
                                  plaintiffs and the defendants are sold under one shop. Mr.
                                  Cooper complained that the electric goods manufactured by
                                  the plaintiffs and the stainless steel utensils manufactured by
                                  the defendants are not sold in one shop. The submission is
                                  not accurate because it is common experience that kitchen
                                  ware or kitchen appliances like mixers, grinders, pressure
                                  cookers, and stainless steel utensils are sold in the same
                                  shop. At this interim stage, we are not prepared to accept the
                                  submission of Mr. Cooper on this count and we see no
                                  reason to take different view from that of the learned single
                                  Judge on this aspect. In our judgment, prima facie, it is clear
                                  that the defendants have intentionally and dishonestly tried
                                  to pass off their goods by use of name &quot;Bajaj&quot;.&quot;
</p><p id="p_70">                                                                              (Emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_71">                          37.   From a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it is clear that an action
                          for passing off can lie even with respect to dissimilar goods, the other
                          parameters being met. In any event, this defence is even otherwise not
                          available to the Defendants, as their goods are not dissimilar, but are allied
                          and cognate, i.e., similar and thus, the position adopted by the Defendants
                          that passing off action is not maintainable, cannot be accepted. In this
                          context, it would be useful to allude to a judgment of the Bombay High
                          Court in <a href="/doc/1140217/" id="a_42">H.M. Saraiya and Ors. v. Ajanta India Ltd. and Ors</a>., 2006 SCC
                          OnLine Bom 1394, where the Court held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">                                  &quot;72. Insofar as the question of totally distinct goods and
                                  biscuits are concerned, it appears that there is a much
                                  expansion of law so as to hold that there is no requirement of
                                  common field of activity in a passing off action. The judgments
                                  which have been relied upon by the learned counsel for the
                                  plaintiffs being <a href="/doc/1319506/" id="a_43">Kirloskar Diesel Recon Pvt. Ltd. v. Kirloskar

                                  opinion, it is not doubt true that for the purposes of passing off

                                  plaintiffs have acquired such a reputation in a particular name
                                  or a brand that the user by the other person even in respect of
                                  distinct product would amount to passing off his business and
                                  his good will as that of the other person. So as to be entitled to
                                  such reliefs the reputation of the brand should have acquired a
                                  Global status or super brand status and the business of the
                                  plaintiffs must be trans border or trans products. However,
                                  that does not mean that in relation of cognate or allied product
                                  the plaintiff is not entitled to interim injunction as contended
                                  by the learned counsel for the defendants. It is equally not a
                                  correct proposition of law advanced by the learned counsel for
                                  the defendants that in respect of the allied product or cognate
                                  product or supplementary product the plaintiffs must actually
                                  prove confusion and/or produce evidence that in market there
                                  is an actual confusion and merely likelihood of confusion is
                                  not counsel for the plaintiffs indicate that even if there is a

                                  are so closely similar and/or are allied products or
                                  supplementary that there is a likelihood of confusion in the

                                  name merely to pass off his goods as that of the plaintiffs is
                                  itself sufficient for the purpose of grant of interim order and

<p id="p_72">                                  73. Even in my judgment in the case of Indiacom

                                  that in light of series of judgments of this Court a proposition
                                  of law is now well settled that the plaintiff is entitled to an
                                  injunction on the basis of cognate product and/or allied
                                  product and/or complemantary products if the goods are so
                                  closely similar to that of the goods of the plaintiffs so as to
                                  lead to a likelihood of confusion in market that the goods sold
                                  by the defendants in fact belong to the plaintiffs. The learned
                                  counsel for the plaintiffs has relied upon two judgments of the

                                   product the use of each other is together and in my opinion
                                  dependent on each other. In such a situation it is easily likely
                                  to create confusion in the minds of the public that the goods
                                  belonging to one party in fact belongs to the other party. I am
                                  inclined to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the
                                  plaintiffs that they are selling tooth brushes in the market since
                                  1950 would obviously make the people believe that &#x27;Ajanta&#x27;
                                  tooth paste which has been introduced by the defendants is the
                                  product belonging to the plaintiffs and thus there is a
                                  likelihood of confusion in the market. I am, therefore, of the
                                  opinion that the contention of the learned counsel for the
                                  defendants that the said goods even if they are complementary
                                  or cognate should not be itself be sufficient enough to grant
                                  interim injunction in respect of passing off action on the
                                  ground that the plaintiffs have not established actual confusion
                                  in the market in respect of the said product is liable to be
                                  rejected. I am also of the view that the judgment of the Apex
                                  Court in the case of Corn Products (supra) supports the
                                  aforesaid view I have taken that the goods being cognate or
                                  allied products by virtue of trade connection or trade relation
                                  would be sufficient enough to create a confusion in the mind of
                                  the people in the market and, therefore, it is necessary that the
                                  injunction should be granted to the plaintiffs insofar as the
                                  said product of the defendants being tooth paste is concerned
                                  under the brand name &#x27;Ajanta&#x27;. In my opinion, once the law is
                                  well settled that in respect of the allied product or cognate
                                  product the injunction can be granted and further in my
                                  opinion that tooth paste and tooth brush being allied and/or
                                  cognate products, it is not necessary to make any further
                                  enquiry in the matter and the necessary interim order ought to
                                  be granted to the plaintiffs herein. However, the learned
                                  counsel for the defendants has contended that there is a
                                  distinct get up of the box and has tried to bring a distinction in
                                  the packet of two products which are sold in the market under
                                  the same brand &#x27;Ajanta&#x27; and has, therefore, contended that the
                                  &#x27;get up&#x27; being different, there is no likelihood of any confusion
                                  and, therefore, this Court should not grant any interim
                                  injunction. I have also compared both the said packets and its
                                  get ups. Firstly, &#x27;word mark&#x27; is identical.

                                   Secondly phonetically also both the marks are the same. The
                                  colour scheme of both the packets is almost identical. Merely
                                  because on the defendants tooth paste there is an emblem
                                  &#x27;Dento Fresh&#x27; and on the tooth brush packet of the plaintiffs
                                  there is a photograph of mother and son would not be
                                  sufficient enough to create a distinctiveness between the two
                                  products so as to hold that there is no likelihood of any
                                  confusion in the market. In my opinion, there is no much
                                  distinction between &#x27;get up&#x27; of the plaintiffs packets and that of
                                  the defendants packet look is substantially identical, the word
                                  characters are also identical and, therefore, in my opinion the
                                  plaintiffs are entitled to injunction of &#x27;passing off&#x27; on the
                                  ground that the defendants are seeking to pass off their goods
                                  as that belonging to the plaintiffs.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_74">                          38.   Nonetheless, in order to succeed in an action for passing off at this
                          stage, Plaintiffs have to make out a prima facie case of goodwill and
                          reputation, which the Defendants are allegedly encashing and deceiving the
                          consumers into buying their goods believing the same to be originating from
                          the Plaintiffs. It is the case of the Plaintiffs, as averred and argued, that they
                          are a part of the MINDA Group of Companies which is a conglomerate
                          comprising several companies, manufacturing diverse auto components for
                          Indian and International Original Equipment Manufacturers. Founded in the
                          year 1958 by late Shri Shadi Lal Minda, Plaintiffs&#x27; businesses under the
                          flagship name MINDA have grown multi-fold over the years and it has
                          emerged as one of the largest automotive components&#x27; conglomerate. As
                          of 31.03.2021, the annual turnover of the Plaintiffs&#x27; group of companies is
                          Rs. 8,741 crores with the goods and services spread over more than seven
                          countries apart from India. It has more than 104 plants globally and 25 R&amp;D
                          centres across India with 40 group companies and 15 global technology
                          partners. It has expended huge sums of money on its promotional activities

                          turnover for the year 2021 as certified by the Chartered Accountant is
                          Rs.5989.44 crores. Plaintiffs have a number of honours and accolades to
                          their credit, the recent ones being ICSI&#x27;s prestigious 6th Annual National
                          CSR Award in 2021 and &#x27;Golden Peacock Award for Excellence in
                          Corporate Governance&#x27; for the year 2020, besides 26 other awards and
                          honours, details of which are furnished in the plaint. MINDA Group of
                          Companies, is globally known for its quality of products and on account of
                          its formidable goodwill and reputation. Group has several reputed clients,
                          both in India as well as internationally, such as BMW, Ford, Honda, Toyota,
                          Ashok Leyland, Escorts, Bajaj, Hero, Mahindra, TATA etc. None of these
                          facts were traversed by the learned counsel for the Defendants during the
                          course of arguments and even in the written statement there is only a vague
                          and bold denial of the averments and nothing is pleaded to the contrary.
</p><p id="p_75">                          39.   From the averments as aforementioned, which are duly supported by
                          documents filed along with the plaint, I am of the prima facie view that the
                          Plaintiffs enjoy immense reputation and goodwill in India and in fact, this
                          explains the reason why the Defendants chose to dishonestly adopt the

                          trademark                   , which is phonetically identical and visually
                          deceptively similar to that of the Plaintiffs. It is clear that the Defendants
                          intended to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiffs by
                          misrepresenting to the members of the public that the goods of the
                          Defendants have an association with that of the Plaintiffs and/or emanate
                          from the house of the MINDA Group of Companies. Therefore, Plaintiffs
                          have made out a prima facie case of passing off against the Defendants in

                          respect of the goods sold under the impugned mark                           and

                           have been able to establish that the nature of marks, nature of goods and
                          class of purchasers are similar and that on account of the high degree of
                          resemblance between the marks there exists a likelihood of confusion.
</p><p id="p_76">                          40.   I may now examine the claim of the Plaintiffs with respect to
                          infringement by the Defendants of their registered trademarks MINDA

                          (word/device) and                   . Defendants have contested the claim on
                          the ground that Defendants are registered proprietors of the trademark
                          MINDA UTO which is registered since 03.07.2018 in class 04, for
                          lubricants, industrial oils and grease, with a user claim from 01.06.2018 and
                          therefore, no action can lie for infringement. The defence is predicated on
                          the provisions of <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_46">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act. It is also the contention of the
                          Defendants that the Plaintiffs are not registered for the said goods in class 04
                          and have a registration in separate classes for separate class of goods and
                          registration cannot travel across classes and in any case, in these
                          circumstances, there cannot be any association or confusion, which is one of
                          the pre-requisites for infringement under <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_47">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_77">                          41.   It is indisputable that Plaintiffs and Defendants hold valid and
                          subsisting registrations in their respective trademarks, registered in different
                          Classes. The issue with regard to the rights of one registered proprietor of a
                          trademark against another registered proprietor of an identical with or nearly
                          resembling each other, is no longer res integra. Interpreting <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_48">Section 28(3)</a> of

                                   postulates a situation where same or similar trade mark can
                                  be registered in favour of more than one person. On a plain
                                  stand-alone reading of this Section, it is clear that the
                                  exclusive right to use of any of those trade marks shall not be
                                  deemed to have been acquired by one registrant as against
                                  other registered owner of the trade mark (though at the same
                                  time they have the same rights as against third person). Thus,
                                  between the two persons who are the registered owners of the
                                  trade marks, there is no exclusive right to use the said trade
                                  mark against each other, which means this provision gives
                                  concurrent right to both the persons to use the registered trade
                                  mark in their favour. Otherwise also, it is a matter of common
                                  sense that the plaintiff cannot say that its registered trade
                                  mark is infringed when the defendant is also enjoying
                                  registration in the trade mark and such registration gives the
                                  defendant as well right to use the same, as provided in <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_51">Section

                          infringement was elaborately dealt with and explained by this Court in

                                      which two or more identical or similar (nearly resemble)
                                      marks are registered, are different then <a href="/doc/1215460/" id="a_57">Section 30(2)(e)</a>
                                      does not come into play. The question of infringement
                                      would, itself, not arise as the registered marks would be
                                      used in respect of different classes of goods or services by
                                      their respective proprietors. A couple of examples would
                                      further clarify the position:

                          the Plaintiff was seeking to protect its own trademark SHRIDHAR
                          registered in class 29 from infringement, by restraining Defendants from
                          using SHREEDHAR for goods in class 29 and not for goods for which
                          Defendants hold registration, i.e., class 30 goods. In Rana Steels (Supra)
                          Plaintiff had registration of the trademark RANA registered in respect of
                          goods falling under class 06, i.e., steel rolled products, angles, channels,
                          guarders, etc. and Defendant was a registered proprietor of the mark RANA
                          TOR in respect to building material (steels) falling under Class 19. On the
                          strength of <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_63">Section 28(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1215460/" id="a_64">30(2)(e)</a> of the Act, Defendant claimed that it
                          had not infringed Plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark. The Court in this context
                          observed as under:-

                                  <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_66">29</a> of the said Act, therefore, reveals that the registration of a
                                  trade mark is linked to the goods or services in respect of
                                  which the trade mark is registered. If a person uses a
                                  registered trade mark in relation to goods and services which
                                  are different and distinct from the goods or services in respect
                                  of which the trade mark is registered, then he would not be
                                  infringing the registered trade mark except in the case covered

                                  use of the mark without due cause would be amounting to
                                  taking unfair advantage of or would be detrimental to the
                                  distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark.

                                   22 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 provides that for the
                                  purposes of registration of trade marks, goods and services
                                  shall be classified in the manner specified in the Fourth
                                  Schedule. Clearly, registration of trademarks is in relation to
                                  specified goods or services. Goods and services have been
                                  classified. It is obvious that, prima facie, goods falling under
                                  one class would be different from goods falling under another
                                  class. Ordinarily, when registration of a trade mark is granted
                                  under one class of goods, it does not cover goods of another
                                  class.

<blockquote id="blockquote_43">                                  25. The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the mark
                                  RANA w.e.f. 14.12.1994 in relation to &quot;steel rolled products,
                                  CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and girders&quot; falling
                                  under class 61 of the Fourth Schedule to the Trade Marks
                                  Rules, 2002. The defendant does not have a registered trade
                                  mark in respect of goods falling under class 6 of the said
                                  schedule. However, as things stand today2, the defendant is
                                  the registetred proprietor of the mark &quot;RANATOR&quot; w.e.f.
                                  26.04.2001 in respect of &quot;Buliding materials (steels)&quot; falling
                                  under class 193. Whether the registration is liable to be
                                  cancelled, as alleged by the plaintiff, or not, as contended by
                                  the defendant, is not a matter for consideration before this
                                  court. For the present, in view of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_69">section 31</a> of the said Act, the
                                  registration of the trade mark is prima facie evidence of its
                                  validity. So, considering the defendant&#x27;s registration to be
                                  valid, for the time being, it must be kept in mind that the mark
                                  RANATOR is registered in class 19 and not class 6. The
                                  plaintiff has brought this suit claiming its exclusive right to the
                                  use of the trade mark RANA in relation to &quot;steel rolled
                                  products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and
                                  girders&quot; falling under class 6 of the Fourth Schedule to the
                                  Trade Marks Rules, 2002. The defendant, admittedly, does not
                                  have any registration in class 6 (its registration being under
                                  class 19). Therefore, the situation which presents itself in the
                                  case at hand is similar to the situation explained in Example 2
                                  above. Consequently, neither is <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_70">section 28(3)</a> attracted nor can
                                  the defendant take refuge under <a href="/doc/1215460/" id="a_71">section 30(2)(e)</a>.

                                  channels and girders falling under class 6. The defendant has

                                  granting an interim injunction restraining the defendant from
                                  further infringing the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trade mark would
                                  result in causing irreparable injury to the plaintiff.&quot;

<p id="p_82">                          45.   Returning to the facts of the present case and examining them in the
                          light of the aforesaid judgments, this Court comes to a prima facie
                          conclusion that Plaintiffs cannot seek a restraint against the Defendants from
                          using their registered trademark MINDA UTO in respect of the goods for
                          which they are registered under class 04, i.e., lubricants, industrial oils and
                          grease, for the reason that Plaintiffs do not have registration for the said
                          goods under class 04, while Defendants are registered for these goods.

                           class 04 an action of infringement, in my prima facie view will not lie and
                          the Defendants have a complete defence to infringement and the Plaintiffs
                          cannot take refuge under their registration.
</p><p id="p_83">                          46.   Having so held with respect to the claim for infringement, the next
                          conundrum that needs to be resolved is with respect to the allegation of the
                          Plaintiffs that the Defendants are passing off their goods under the impugned
                          mark MINDA UTO. Before resolving the conundrum, it would be useful to
                          refer to the judgment in S. Syed Mohideen (Supra), a reading of which
                          shows the settled position of law that a suit for passing off would lie against
                          the Defendants, despite the registration of their trademark, the essential
                          ingredients of passing off being made out. Relevant paras are as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">                                  &quot;28. However, what is stated above is the reflection of
                                  <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_73">Section 28</a> of the Act when that provision is seen and examined
                                  without reference to the other provisions of the Act. It is stated
                                  at the cost of repetition that as per this Section owner of
                                  registered trade mark cannot sue for infringement of his
                                  registered trade mark if the appellant also has the trade mark
                                  which is registered. Having said so, a very important question
                                  arises for consideration at this stage, namely, whether such a
                                  respondent can bring an action against the appellant for
                                  passing off invoking the provisions of <a href="/doc/1664136/" id="a_74">Section 27(2)</a> of the Act.</blockquote>
<p id="p_84">                                  In other words, what would be the interplay of <a href="/doc/1664136/" id="a_75">Section 27(2)</a>

                                  consideration in the instant case. As already noticed above,
                                  the trial court as well as the High Court have granted the
                                  injunction in favour of the respondent on the basis of prior
                                  user as well as on the ground that the trade mark of the
                                  appellant, even if it is registered, would cause deception in the
                                  mind of the public at large and the appellant is trying to
                                  encash upon, exploit and ride upon on the goodwill of the
                                  respondent herein. Therefore, the issue to be determined is as

</p><p id="p_86">                                  30. Firstly, the answer to this proposition can be seen by
                                  carefully looking at the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_77">Trade Marks Act</a>,
                                  1999 (the Act). Collective reading of the provisions especially
                                  <a href="/doc/1580823/" id="a_78">Sections 27</a>, <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_79">28</a>, <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_80">29</a> and <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_81">34</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999
                                  would show that the rights conferred by registration are
                                  subject to the rights of the prior user of the trade mark.
                                  We have already reproduced <a href="/doc/1580823/" id="a_82">Section 27</a> and <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_83">Section 29</a> of the
                                  Act.
</p><p id="p_87">                                  30.1. From the reading of <a href="/doc/1664136/" id="a_84">Section 27(2)</a> of the Act, it is clear
                                  that the right of action of any person for passing off the
                                  goods/services of another person and remedies thereof are not
                                  affected by the provisions of the Act. Thus, the rights in
                                  passing off are emanating from the common law and not from
                                  the provisions of the Act and they are independent from the
                                  rights conferred by the Act. This is evident from the reading of
                                  the opening words of <a href="/doc/1664136/" id="a_85">Section 27(2)</a> which are &quot;Nothing in this
                                  Act shall be deemed to affect rights....&quot;
</p><p id="p_88">                                  30.2. Likewise, the registration of the mark shall give exclusive
                                  rights to the use of the trade mark subject to the other
                                  provisions of this Act. Thus, the rights granted by the
                                  registration in the form of exclusivity are not absolute but are
                                  subject to the provisions of the Act.
</p><p id="p_89">                                  30.3. <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_86">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act provides that the rights of two
                                  registered proprietors of identical or nearly resembling trade
                                  marks shall not be enforced against each other. However, they
                                  shall be same against the third parties. <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_87">Section 28(3)</a> merely
                                  provides that there shall be no rights of one registered
                                  proprietor vis-à-vis another but only for the purpose of
                                  registration. The said provision 28(3) nowhere comments
                                  about the rights of passing off which shall remain unaffected
                                  due to overriding effect of <a href="/doc/1664136/" id="a_88">Section 27(2)</a> of the Act and thus the
                                  rights emanating from the common law shall remain

                                   states that the rights of one registered proprietor shall not be
                                  enforced against the another person.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_90">                          47.   The Supreme Court gave an additional reason as to why passing off
                          rights are superior to the registration rights and relevant would it be to refer
                          to the following paragraphs in this regard:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">                                  &quot;31. Secondly, there are other additional reasonings as to
                                  why the passing off rights are considered to be superior than
                                  that of registration rights.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">                                  31.1. Traditionally, passing off in common law is considered to
                                  be a right for protection of goodwill in the business against
                                  misrepresentation caused in the course of trade and for
                                  prevention of resultant damage on account of the said
                                  misrepresentation. The three ingredients of passing off are
                                  goodwill, misrepresentation and damage. These ingredients
                                  are considered to be classical trinity under the law of passing
                                  off as per the speech of Lord Oliver laid down in Reckitt &amp;
                                  Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc. [Reckitt &amp; Colman
                                  Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc., (1990) 1 WLR 491 : (1990) 1 All
                                  ER 873 (HL)] which is more popularly known as &quot;Jif Lemon&quot;
                                  case wherein Lord Oliver reduced the five guidelines laid out
                                  by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap
                                  v. J. Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd. [Erven Warnink Besloten
                                  Vennootschap v. J. Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd., 1979 AC 731
                                  at p. 742 : (1979) 3 WLR 68 : (1979) 2 All ER 927 (HL)] (&quot;the
                                  Advocaat case&quot;) to three elements : (1) goodwill owned by a
                                  trader, (2) misrepresentation, and (3) damage to goodwill.
                                  Thus, the passing off action is essentially an action in deceit
                                  where the common law rule is that no person is entitled to
                                  carry on his or her business on pretext that the said business is
                                  of that of another. This Court has given its imprimatur to the
                                  above principle in <a href="/doc/125822018/" id="a_90">Laxmikant V. Patel</a> v. Chetanbhai

                                   on business under the name confers the rights in favour of the
                                  person and generates goodwill in the market. Accordingly, the
                                  latter user of the mark/name or in the business cannot
                                  misrepresent his business as that of business of the prior right
                                  holder. That is the reason why essentially the prior user is
                                  considered to be superior than that of any other rights.
                                  Consequently, the examination of rights in common law which
                                  are based on goodwill, misrepresentation and damage are
                                  independent to that of registered rights. The mere fact that
                                  both prior user and subsequent user are registered proprietors
                                  are irrelevant for the purposes of examining who generated
                                  the goodwill first in the market and whether the latter user is
                                  causing misrepresentation in the course of trade and
                                  damaging the goodwill and reputation of the prior right
                                  holder/former user. That is the additional reasoning that the
                                  statutory rights must pave the way for common law rights of
                                  passing off.
</p><p id="p_92">                                  32. Thirdly, it is also recognised principle in common law
                                  jurisdiction that passing off right is broader remedy than that
                                  of infringement. This is due to the reason that the passing off
                                  doctrine operates on the general principle that no person is
                                  entitled to represent his or her business as business of other
                                  person. The said action in deceit is maintainable for diverse
                                  reasons other than that of registered rights which are
                                  allocated rights under the Act. The authorities of other
                                  common law jurisdictions like England more specifically
                                  Kerly&#x27;s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 14th Edn.,
                                  Thomson, Sweet &amp; Maxwell South Asian Edition recognises
                                  the principle that where trade mark action fails, passing off
                                  action may still succeed on the same evidence. This has been
                                  explained by the learned author by observing the following:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">                                      &quot;15-033. A claimant may fail to make out a case of
                                      infringement of a trade mark for various reasons and may
                                      yet show that by imitating the mark claimed as a trade
                                      mark, or otherwise, the defendant has done what is

<p id="p_93">                          48.   The above legal position was reiterated by the Supreme Court in
                          <a href="/doc/4821321/" id="a_91">Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha v. Prius Auto Industries Limited and

                          despite <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_92">Section 28(3)</a> of the Act against use of a registered trademark, the
                          raison d&#x27;être being that the use of a mark confers rights in the person on
                          account of generation of goodwill in the market and a third party cannot
                          misrepresent its business and encash upon the said goodwill and reputation.
</p><p id="p_94">                          49.   What remains to be examined is whether the Plaintiffs have made out
                          a prima facie case to demonstrate that the action of the Defendants
                          tantamounts to passing off. The ingredients of an action of passing off, as
                          held in various judgments, have been brought out in the earlier part of the
                          judgment and are not being repeated for the sake of brevity. Applying the
                          principles for determination whether passing off is made out, it is an
                          indisputable position that Plaintiffs are the prior user of the trademarks
                          MINDA and UNO MINDA, since the use of the trademark MINDA (word
                          per se) commenced in the year 1962 and for the device mark from the year
                          2001. User date of the label UNO MINDA is 01.12.2011. Per contra, as per
                          the case set up by the Defendants, user of the impugned mark commenced
                          from the year 2018 for goods registered under class 04. As averred in the
                          plaint, the UNO MINDA Group is one of the India&#x27;s leading manufacturers
                          of automotive components and some of the products manufactured are
                          alternate fuel systems, air filtration systems, brake and fuel hoses, alloy

                          Plaintiff&#x27;s Group of Companies, the goods and services provided in over 7
                          countries, the manufacturing plants, promotional expenses, etc. have been
                          referred to above. Compared and contrasted with this is the admitted
                          position, going by the averments in the written statement that Defendants
                          have commenced use of their trademark only in 2018 and the total sales of
                          Defendant No. 3 has increased to Rs. 4,84,02,415/- in the year 2021-22 out
                          of which sale of products under the trademark MINDA UTO has increased
                          to Rs.72,60,362/- in the year 2021-22. From the said narrative, it is manifest
                          that Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of substantial goodwill and
                          reputation in the market and are prior users of the trademarks MINDA and
                          UNO MINDA.

                          Plaintiffs would require to show that the two competing marks are either
                          identical or deceptively similar. It cannot be disputed that Plaintiffs&#x27;
                          trademarks and the impugned mark of the Defendants are not identical. In
                          order to determine whether they are deceptively similar, this Court would
                          rely on the principles formulated by the Supreme Court in Cadila Health
                          Care Ltd. (Supra), as aforementioned. In order to avoid prolixity and burden
                          this judgment with several judgments on the aspect of &#x27;deceptive similarity&#x27;,

                          from the mark on the goods which he had previously bought, but is doubtful
                          whether that impression is not due to imperfect recollection and the question
                          is thus one of first impression; (d) the test is from the point of a person of
                          average intelligence and imperfect recollection to see how a purchaser
                          would react to the trademark, the association which he would form and how
                          he would connect the trademarks with goods he is likely to purchase; (e) the
                          resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in idea; (f) the whole word/mark is
                          to be considered as an ordinary man would not split a word or name into its
                          components and would go by overall structural and phonetic similarity of
                          the mark; and (g) the Court is required to examine whether the essential
                          features of the Plaintiff&#x27;s mark are to be found in the Defendant&#x27;s mark.

                          In this regard it would be useful to refer to the case of <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_94">Ruston &amp; Hornsby

</p><p id="p_98">                           52.   Two cases which in my view are closest in facts to the present case
                          are <a href="/doc/1401908/" id="a_96">Greaves Cotton Limited v. Mr. Mohammad Rafi &amp; Ors</a>., 2011 SCC
                          OnLine Del 2596 and <a href="/doc/129547608/" id="a_97">Prem Ratan Rathi &amp; Ors. v. Ashish Iron Trading
                          Co. &amp; Anr</a>., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 3649. In Greaves Cotton (Supra) the
                          mark &#x27;GREAVES&#x27; was the essential and prominent feature of Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          trade name, corporate name and business style and the trademark
                          GREAVES was the surname of the founder of Plaintiff&#x27;s predecessor. The
                          Supreme Court observed that by using the words &#x27;GREAVES INDIA&#x27;
                          Defendant No. 1 had lifted and adopted and whole of the registered
                          trademark of the Plaintiff and mere use of the word &#x27;INDIA&#x27; would make no
                          difference, since the word GREAVES was the essential and main
                          component of the trademark &#x27;GREAVES INDIA&#x27;. Use of the word INDIA
                          as a suffix and not as a prefix is also strong indicator that the Defendant
                          wanted to encash upon the popularity, goodwill and reputation of the word
                          GREAVES though even if it was used as prefix, it would be infringing. It
                          was also observed that GREAVES is not a dictionary word and comes from
                          the surname of the founder of the Plaintiff and neither deletion of a part of a
                          registered trademark nor addition of a prefix or suffix to it would validate
                          the use by an unlicensed user. On this basis, not only infringement but the
                          issue of passing off was decided in favour of the Plaintiff. In Prem Ratan
                          Rathi (supra), Plaintiff was using the trademark &#x27;RATHI&#x27; and the
                          Defendants had adopted an identical trademark by adding a prefix
                          GOLDEN. Plaintiff succeeded in its action for infringement and passing off,
                          despite the Defendants&#x27; defence that word RATHI is a common word
                          derived from the name of a village and that the mark is distinguishable by
                          the prefix &#x27;GOLDEN&#x27;. Reference may also be made to a judgment in B.K.

                          210, where this Court faced with rival trademarks B.K. and B.K.-81,
                          observed that the Defendants&#x27; addition of &#x27;81&#x27; to Plaintiff&#x27;s mark was a
                          mere garnishing, though even the altered name is likely to mislead. The
                          Defendants&#x27; product will deceive people into thinking that their goods are
                          those of the Plaintiffs. Essence of the law of passing off is competition
                          between traders and if Defendants are not injuncted there will a real risk of
                          injury to the reputation of the Plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_100">                          53.   I may usefully allude to para 33 of the judgment in Prem Ratan Rathi
                          (supra), as the same analogy would apply to the present case. In the present
                          case Plaintiffs are selling their products under the trademark MINDA with
                          various prefixes such as SPARK MINDA and UNO MINDA. The word
                          MINDA forms an essential part of Plaintiffs&#x27; trademarks and Defendants
                          prima facie cannot claim any right to use the said mark with or without
                          suffixes or prefixes, as that is likely to cause confusion amongst the
                          purchasers. Para 33 is as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">                                  &quot;33. The defendant no. 2 in its written statement claims that
                                  the word RATHI is a common word and that the name was
                                  adopted by them because the great grandfather of the
                                  promoter/director of the defendant no. 2 was a resident of
                                  Rathi Vas village in Haryana. However no evidence has been
                                  placed on record to prove the said contention. Further,
                                  applying the ratio in the Greaves Cotton Case (supra), the
                                  defendants&#x27; use of the word &#x27;GOLDEN&#x27; before the mark of the
                                  plaintiff &#x27;RATHI&#x27; does not entitle them to use the impugned
                                  mark. The plaintiff&#x27;s mark &#x27;RATHI&#x27; is the essential part of
                                  their registered trademark and has been in use since the year
                                  1980 as proved in Issues No. 1 and 2. Further, it is also seen
                                  from the newspaper clippings of the advertisements of the
                                  plaintiff&#x27;s products placed on record, that they sell the
                                  products under the trademark &#x27;RATHI&#x27; along with suffixes like

                                  TOR&#x27; and &#x27;RATHI THERMEX&#x27;. Furthermore, it is stated by
                                  defendant no. 2 in its written statement that the plaintiffs are
                                  also selling their products under the names &#x27;RATHI
                                  EUROTEM&#x27; and &#x27;RATHI PRAGATI&#x27;. Therefore it is clear to
                                  me that the word &#x27;RATHI&#x27; forms an essential part of the
                                  plaintiff&#x27;s trademark and thus, the defendants do not have the
                                  right to use the said word with any suffixes or prefixes. Issue
                                  No. 7 is decided in favour of the plaintiff.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_101">                          54.   Another crucial question arises in the present case as to why the
                          Defendants chose the word MINDA as a part of their trademark albeit with a
                          suffix UTO. The subtle explanation rendered by the Defendants is that
                          MINDA is a common surname in the country and UNO and SPARK are
                          common English words and that MINDA is the name of a village in

                          lived. Suffice would it be to state that there is no material on record to
                          substantiate the said plea, contrasted to the stand of the Plaintiffs and prima
                          facie shown to be correct, as to the origin of their trademark. The
                          explanation of the Defendants, in my view, in choosing the impugned
                          trademark is implausible, farfetched and wholly unconvincing and is
                          designed to encash upon the pronounced and prominent reputation of the
                          Plaintiffs. In view of this, in my prima facie view there is deceptive
                          similarity in the rival trademarks as well as dishonest adoption by the
                          Defendants. It is interesting to note the contention of the Plaintiffs that while
                          the registration of the Defendants in class 04 with respect to the trademark
                          MINDA UTO is &#x27;MINDAUTO&#x27;, i.e., as a single word, Defendants have
                          been using the same as two words &#x27;MINDA UTO&#x27;. The intent behind
                          separating the two words is perhaps with a view to lay more emphasis on the
                          word MINDA, so as to encash on the formidable reputation and enormous

                                  restrain the defendants in such a case would be justified. After

                                  that the plaintiff was not producing any goods like foam or
                                  analogous product. Consequently, there was no question of

                                  important feature viz., how would a lay customer know in the

                                  producing foam? It is well known that the name represented
                                  makers of shoes and analogous products, but a question would
                                  also arise in the mind of the lay customers whether Bata were
                                  also producing foam. Who is going to answer this question?
                                  Does an ordinary customer ask the seller as to whose product
                                  it is? The answer generally is in the negative. He buys a thing
                                  on the basis of his own impression.&quot;

                          seeks to confuse his own&#x27;. As Lord Greene M.R. said:- &#x27;passing off may

                          oils and grease which are allied and cognate to the goods of the Plaintiffs

                          that Plaintiffs have accrued no reputation in their brand &#x27;Ajanta&#x27; in respect
                          of their goods, i.e., toothpaste still once the reputation is established in the

                          (1960) 1 SCR 968 the Bombay High Court observed as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">                                  &quot;58. In the present case we are not concerned with the super
                                  brand status or universal status of any brand because it is not

                                  any such super status so as to entitle the plaintiffs to protect
                                  their transborder and trans product reputation. The case of the
                                  plaintiffs is that the goods relating to the same field and/or in
                                  any event a cognate and allied products aforesaid are so
                                  similar products that it is likely to result in confusion in the
                                  minds of public. In my opinion, the principle of cognate and
                                  allied product is very much in existence and has been well
                                  recognised both by the learned author Kerly in the aforesaid
                                  paras as well as various judgments which are cited before me
                                  by the plaintiffs. In the case of Corn Products Refining Co.
                                  (supra), the Apex Court was dealing with the brand name
                                  &#x27;Glucovita&#x27; glucouse vita in respect of glucose powder mixed
                                  with vitamin and other product being glucose biscuits. The
                                  Apex Court as far back as in 1960 held that even though the
                                  goods are different but by virtue of fact that glucose powder is
                                  used in manufacture of biscuits and, therefore, the person is
                                  entitled to injunction though the goods are not identical.&quot;
