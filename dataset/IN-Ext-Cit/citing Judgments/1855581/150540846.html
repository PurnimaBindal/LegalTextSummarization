<p id="p_1">        This is a suit for a decree for Rs. 3,73,75,000/- with interest upon judgment @

carries on business of producing and selling Single Super Phosphate a chemical fertilizer

and sulphuric acid an intermediate product from its factory at Rishra in the State of West

Bengal. Bright Yellow NIGC Sulphur Crude in bulk (hereinafter referred to as the "said

used in production of Single Super Phosphate.

&amp; Fertilizers a unit of Jay Shree Tea &amp; Industries Ltd. and used to purchase the said

commodity for their manufacturing requirements and the plaintiff used to co-ordinate

with each other for import of the said commodity.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">        By a letter/communication dated 27th September, 2007 addressed to the

defendant, the said M/s. Kesoram Rayon for itself as well as on behalf of the said Jay

Shree Chemicals &amp; Fertilizers and the plaintiff expressed intention to purchase 10,000

MTs. of the said commodity of the specifications contained in the said letter for shipment

in end October/early November, 2007 with discharge rate of 1,500 MTs. per day, the

<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">        In response to the said letter dated 27th September, 2007 of M/s. Kesoram Rayon,

the defendant by a FAX message dated 16th October, 2007 submitted its firm offer for

supply of the said 10,000 MTs of the said material plus minus 10% on the terms and

conditions and at the rate as mentioned in the said message.
</p><p id="p_9">        By a FAX message dated 20th October, 2007 (Exbt.- E) the said M/s. Kesoram

Rayon for itself, M/s. Phosphate &amp; Co. Ltd. (plaintiff) and M/s. Jayshree Tea &amp; Co. Ltd.

gave a counter offer to purchase such specified quantity of the said commodity at a price

of US$ 271 per Metric Ton, C &amp; F Haldia/Calcutta at buyers option, the other terms

being as per the offer of the defendant as contained in its FAX message dated 16th

October, 2007. (Exbt.- B)


       In the said FAX message dated 20th October, 2007, M/s. Kesoram Rayon sent to

the defendant giving written confirmation to purchase 4750 Mts. of the said commodity

for itself; 1250 MTs. for the plaintiff and 4000 MTs. for Jayshree Tea &amp; Co. Ltd. with

written confirmation by the respective companies to follow and requested the defendant

to send a formal offer for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">       Pursuant thereto, the defendant by a FAX message dated 21st October, 2007

(Exbt.- F) sent to the plaintiff confirmed to sell and supply to the plaintiff 1250 MTs.

plus minus 10% of the said commodity having the specification mentioned therein @ US

$ 271.00 PMT (US Dollar two hundred and seventy one only) CNF free out Haldia, India

with payment on CAD (Cash Against Documents) or against irrevocable L/C payable at

sight basis and on other terms and conditions as contained in the said message including

the discharge rate to be 1500 MTs. per day and the defendant expressed its intention to

have a formal order confirmation from the plaintiff. According to plaintiff, the said

discharge rate was contrary to the rate of discharge of 1000 MTs. per day as provided in

the earlier correspondence and the plaintiff corrected the discharge rate from 1500 MTs.

per day to 1000 MTs. per day and re-faxed the same to the defendant by signifying the
 acceptance of the same by endorsing the acceptance and contended that there is a

concluded contract by and between the parties for purchase and sale of the said 1250

MTs. of the said commodity which would be evident from the subsequent conduct of the

parties.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">           It is further contended that under the said contract with the plaintiff, the defendant

was obliged to effect shipment of the agreed quantity of 1250 MTs. of the said

commodity during 1st half of November, 2007 from Bandar Abbas Iran for Haldia India.

The said delivery period was the essence of the contract having regard to the

requirements of the said commodity by the plaintiff as basic raw material for its

production/manufacturing activity.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">           Suddenly, on 5th November, 2007 the defendant by its E-mail sent, inter alia, to

the plaintiff forwarded a purported message received by it from its supplier stating that

due to embargo on Iranian trade/financial transaction it was unable to supply the sulphur

and the defendant by its said E-mail sought to allege the existence of "Force Majeure"

condition expressing its inability to supply the said commodity.


</p><p id="p_16">           Plaintiff contended that under the said contract between the plaintiff and the

defendant no financial transaction was involved in Iran nor any letter of credit or any

other commitment was required from any bank in Iran. There is no term under the said

contract that the supply of the said commodity by the defendant to the plaintiff would

depend upon procurement of the same by the defendant from any third party.
</p><p id="p_17">         Specific case of the plaintiff is that on a true and correct reading of the said US

sanction dated October 25, 2007 it would be evident that the said sanction has no

relevance to the transaction under the said contract. This fact has also been confirmed by

the Office of the Foreign Assets Control, USA by their E-mail dated October 6, 2007 and

Iran Petrochemical Company, Iran has also by their E-mail dated November 5, 2007

confirmed that there was no difficulty in shipment of sulphur from Iran.


</p><p id="p_18">        The defendant has contested the suit by filing a written statement denying all

material particulars made in the plaint and contended inter alia, that there is no concluded

contract between the plaintiff and the defendant in respect of the subject matter of the suit

and therefore the plaintiff is not entitled to any reliefs as prayed for in the suit.


</p><p id="p_19">        On the above pleadings the following issues were framed--


</p><p id="p_20">        1. Was there any contract between the parties in respect of the subject matter of
            the suit alleged to have been entered into on 21st October, 2007?

</p><p id="p_21">        2. If there was a contract, was the same frustrated by supervening impossibility
            of procuring cargo from NIGC, Iran due to sanctions imposed on Iranian
            Banks by US Government as alleged in paragraph 23 of the written statement?

</p><p id="p_22">        3. Is the plaintiff entitled to the relief sought for?
</p>
<p id="p_23">        4. To what other reliefs, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to?

Issue Nos. 1 &amp; 2:

brevity.
</p><p id="p_26">        Mr. Ajoy Krishna Chatterjee learned counsel for the plaintiff invited my attention

to paragraph 8 of the plaint wherein it is averred that pursuant to FAX message dated 20th

October, 2007 (Exbt.-E) sent by M/s. Kesoram Rayon to the defendant, the defendant

sent to the plaintiff a FAX message dated 21st October, 2007 and confirmed to sell or

defendant to send the best offer indicating C &amp; F Haldia Port rates at the earlier as the

receipt of their offer for 10000 MT +/- 10% NIGC, Iran sulphur for shipment during 22nd

October, 2007 vide Exbt.-C but the said offer of the defendant was not confirmed by

that the offer vide Exbt.-B was not acted upon as it lapsed on 19th October, 2007.

for Jayshree Tea &amp; Co. Ltd. with written confirmation by the respective companies to

follow and requested the defendant to send a formal offer for the same. Therefore, there

has been claimed.

<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">       It is revealed from the aforesaid documents that the first offer by the defendant for

supply of Iran Sulphur was to be concluded by 19th October, 2007 but that was not given

effect by any of the parties, however, in continuation of the same as per the telephonic

discussion concerning the offer dated 19.10.2007 M/s. Kesoram Rayon proposed a

counter offer but the same was not accepted by defendant rather the defendant proposed

to reduce price @ US$ 271 PMT but gave a condition for Discharge rate at 1500 Mt and

requested M/s. Kesoram Rayon to give formal order of confirmation of their term. It is no

doubt curious to note that the Discharge rate has been altered unilaterally by the plaintiff
 The Phosphate Company Ltd. by putting 1000 instead of 1500 and the plaintiff claimed

that the altered term by the plaintiff was sent to the defendant but maintained silence.



</p><p id="p_38">       Mr. K. K. Thaker, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the Discharge

rate has been interpolated by altering it from 1500 MT to 1000 MT unilaterally and the

        There is categorical statement of the defendant that shipment of cargo was not

possible due to "Force Majeure" as the defendant's supplier M/s. Havi was unable to

supply the sulphur from Bandar Abbas, Iran for Haldia, India. E-mail from M/s. Havi to

Ajay Mathur of defendant co. Exbt.- G reflects that M/s. Havi regretted to inform the

defendant concern that due to embargo on Iranian trade/ financial transaction, they were

unable to supply the sulphur in connection with contract no. Sul/631/MT dated

the said contract when the defendant requested Havi to revert urgently with Haldia vessel

the defendant to make the shipment of sulphur at the earliest and in any event before 15th

contract since the plaintiff have limited stock at their disposal as sulphur is their raw

Exbt.- Q corroborates that there is a concluded and existing contract for supply of Iran

sulphur by the defendant to the plaintiff and a case of concluded contract is inferred and

further relied on the authority in the case of <a href="/doc/318186/" id="a_1">Seth Thawardas Pherumal vs The Union

Of India (UOI</a>) (AIR 1955 SC 468, wherein it has been observed thus--

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "It is well settled that governments can only be bound by contracts that are entered into in

             a particular way and which are signed by the proper authority. A reference to the

             agreement, Ex. A(1), will show that it was accepted on behalf of the Dominion Government

             by the Additional Chief Engineer and not by an Executive Engineer. A letter written to the

             Executive Engineer would therefore have no effect and even if it be assumed that the letter

             was forwarded to the Additional Chief Engineer for consideration, what does it amount to?

             A tender embodying certain terms is submitted and is accepted on 1-11-45. Both sides are

             agreed on all matters contained in it and their conduct shows that both sides indicated that

             the contract should be reduced to writing. Be-fore the agreement is signed, one party wants

             to include a further condition in the contract. We will assume that the request was made to

             the other contracting party. But without waiting for the assent of the other side, both sides

             accept and sign the contract as it existed before the fresh suggestion was made. It is an

             error in law to deduce from this that there was acceptance of the fresh proposal. On the

             contrary, the legal conclusion is that the new suggestion was dropped and that the

             contractor was content to accept the contract as it was without' this condition. In any case,

             a person cannot be bound by a one-sided offer which is never accepted, particularly when

             the parties intend that the contract should be reduced to writing. That is the whole point of

             insisting on a document. It excludes speculation as to what was and what was not agreed to
              however much the matter might have been raised by one of the parties during the stage of

             negotiation."</blockquote><p id="p_58">

</p><p id="p_66">       Per contra, Mr. Thaker learned counsel for the defendant submitted that taking

into consideration the factual aspects of case reported in Seth Thawardas Pherumal

(supra), a person cannot be bound by one-sided offer which is never accepted and

reiterated that in Exbt.-F the proposal for Discharge rate being 1500 MT was

unilaterally interpolated by putting 1000 MT and the payment term was also not

complied with as per Exbt.-F which would be evident from answer to the question nos.

41, 42 and 43 put to the witness namely, Suresh Bangur, the Chief Executive Director of

the plaintiff company. On behalf of the defendant E-mail Exbt.-3 dated 22.10.2007 has

been pressed in service contending that the offer was of discharge rate being 1500 MT by

the defendant. It reflects that the plaintiff offered through Kesoram Rayon with discharge

rate 1000 mt PWWDSHEXEIU and requested the defendant to forward the contract for

confirmation and further on the same day at 1:20 P.M. Kesoram Rayon addressed to Ajay

Mathur of defendant that confirmation made on 20.10.2007 mentioned the discharge rate

as 1000 mt and requested the defendant to amend the contract and send to the plaintiff for
 signature and approval. This E-mail Exbt.-3 clearly shows that defendant concerned was

informed about the alteration made to 1000 mt from 1500 mt and the defendant was

silent over the matter without giving any confirmation in that regard.


</p><p id="p_67">       Mr. Thaker adverted to answers given by the witness Suresh Bangur to question

nos. 153, 155, 156 &amp; 158 and submitted that the said counter offer by the plaintiff was

not accepted by the defendant for not having agreed on the discharge rate of 1000 mt

which is the essential term of contract. Therefore, the parties were not ad idem as there

was no concluded contract binding on the defendant. Questions and answers are

</p><p id="p_77">       I understand on conjoint reading of the above provisions of the Act to the

proposition of law that the basis of enforcement of contract is consensus theory of

contract and there has to be an acceptance of an offer on the same terms of the offer and

such acceptance must be unconditional unequivocal and absolute and that there is no

place for negotiation in any unilateral contract in which only one party is bound.

However, at any stage of the contract, most crucial question to be decided that whether

the parties intended to be bound by the terms conclusively agreed upon.
</p><p id="p_78">        Appraising the evidence on record, and on bare reading of the aforesaid

communications by and between the parties through E-mails being the Exbt.-G series and

having perused the E-mail being the part of Exbt.-K sent by Office of Foreign Asset

Control to M/s. Kesoram Rayon in respect of shipment of sulphur from Iran, I find that

U.S. sanctions apply to U.S. persons only. However, some International financial

Institution may, nevertheless, adhere to U.S. sanctions regulations. Thus, in clear crystal

term it proves that there was no "Force Majeure" binding on the defendant. E-mail Exbt.-

F reflects that term of payment was payable at sight basis, against negotiation of the

documents and the correspondence of the plaintiff. E-mail Exbt.-G3 reveals that Kesoram

Rayon completed all formalities in respect of the aforesaid contract which the defendant

had received and urged upon the defendant to make the shipment at the earliest in any

event before 15th November, 2007. The correspondences between the parties show that

shipment was made ready for the cargo to sail but the defendant wriggled out of the

contract on account of alleged "Force Majeure". It would be pertinent to take note of the

fact that the FMB Sales Review dated 29th November, 2007 Exbt.- Q unequivocally

reflects that a contract for supply of the said commodity @ 271 cfr in November, 2007

was concluded between them.
</p>
<p id="p_79">
</p><p id="p_80">       In this context, Mr. Thaker urged that the FMB report cannot be taken into

account as the Journal report is not conclusive, without author being examined. I do not

agree with such contention of Mr. Thaker inasmuch as the said FMB Sales Review was

admitted on evidence as an exhibit without any ire from the defendant and in absence of

any evidence to the contrary, I accept the said report as collateral documentary evidence.
</p><p id="p_81">        Therefore, taking a cue from the observation in case of M/s. Rickmers

Verwaltung GMB H (supra) and the general principle of law decided in Bharat

Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. (supra), that although an offer is not accepted by mere silence on

the part of the offeree, nevertheless, it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be

given in so many words and therefore, I hold that there was a concluded contract

inasmuch as the contract vide Exbt.-F was accepted by both the parties by putting their

company's seal.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">       Thus, I decide the issue no. 1 in the affirmative in favour of the plaintiff as

'Force Majeure' forbidding the defendant from shipment of the cargo.
</p><p id="p_89">        Mr. Chatterjee submitted that the defendant company committed a breach of

contract by taking a false plea of "Force Majeure" by US Government inasmuch as the

communication of OFAC in actual term reflects that there was no "Force Majeure"

applicable in case of the Indian concern and that too is well reflected from the

International bulletin which clearly goes to show on the material point of time Havi had

supplied and was supplying through the defendant to different other Indian co.. Such a

plea was taken by the defendant only to avoid supply of the commodities as there was a

hike in price of the commodities at the relevant point of time as a result the plaintiff

claimed to have suffered damage to the tune of Rs. 3,73,75,000/- as per the particulars in

the plaintiff deposited an amount as advance price, but the defendant failed to make the

         Reliance made to a decision of the Privy Council in Sally Wertheim v.

intention of the law in giving damages for breach of contract is that the plaintiff should

be placed in the same position as he would have been if the contract had been performed.



</p><p id="p_99">         Thus, it has been held that the difference in the market price is the measure of

observed that illustration (k) to <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_13">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act is apt for the purpose of

the case. According to that illustration, the person committing breach of contract has to

pay to the other party the difference between the contract price of the articles agreed to be

sold and the sum paid by the other party for purchasing another article on account of the

default of the first party, but the first party has not to pay the compensation which the

second party had to pay to third parties as he had not been told at the time of the contract

that the second party was making the purchase of the article for delivery to such third

parties and accordingly, the Supreme Court was pleased to dismiss the appeal upholding

the decision of the High Court that the appellant suffered no such damage which he could

recover from the respondent.

                    the date of breach. The market price on the date of breach is accepted as the basis

                    because the buyer can go into the market and buy the goods at that rate and that is

Barrow v. Arnaud (1846) 8 Q. B. 595 that the common law principle of the English law

on the point was stated in the following language:

<p id="p_105">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                    "Where a contract to deliver goods at a certain pries is broken, the proper

                    measure of damage in general is the difference between the contract price and the

                    market price of such goods at the time when the contract is broken, because the

                    purchaser, having the money in his hands, may go into the market and buy".</blockquote><p id="p_106">



</p><p id="p_107">       The Indian law is declaratory of the above common law principle, as was held in

the case of A.K.A.S. Jamal v. Moola Dawood, Sons and Co, 43 Ind App 6: (AIR 1915 PC

</p><p id="p_108">48) Lord Wrenbury, in delivering the judgment of the Board observed:
   "The question therefore is the general question and may be stated thus: In a contract for
sale of negotiable securities, is the measure of damages for breach the difference between
the contract price and the market price at the date of the breach"



</p><p id="p_109">         with an obligation on the part of the seller to mitigate the damages by getting the
best price he can at the date of the breach -- or is the seller bound to reduce the damages,
if he can, by subsequent sales at better price? If he is, and if the purchaser is entitled to the
benefit of subsequent sales, it must also be true that he must bear the burden of subsequent
losses. The latter proposition is in their Lordships' opinion impossible, and the former is
equally unsound. If the seller retains the shares after the breach, the speculation as to the
way the market will subsequently go is the speculation of the seller, not of the buyer; the
seller cannot recover from the buyer the loss below the market price at the date of the
breach if the market falls, nor is he liable to the purchaser for the profit if the market price
rises.
</p>
<p id="p_110">

</p><p id="p_111">         It is undoubted law that a plaintiff who sues for damages owes the duty of taking all
reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent upon the breach and cannot claim as
damages any sum which is due to his own neglect. But the loss to be ascertained is the loss
at the date of the breach. If at that date the plaintiff could do something or did something
which mitigated the damage, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of it. Staniforth v. Lyall,
(1830) 7 Bing. 169 is an illustration of this. But the fact that by reason of the loss of the
contract which the defendant has failed to perform the plaintiff obtains the benefit of
another contract which is of value to him does not entitle the defendant to the benefit of the
latter contract: Yates v. Whyte, (1838) 4 Bing. (N. S.) 272; Bradbum v. Great Western
Railway, (1874) 10 Ex. 1; Jebson v. East and West India Dock Co. (1875) 10 C. P. 300.

</p><p id="p_117">       It is profitable to reproduce the observation which reads thus:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">           "The fact that damages are difficult to estimate and cannot be assessed with
           certainty or precision does not relieve the wrong-doer of the necessity of
           paying damages for his breach of duty, and is no ground for awarding only
           nominal damages. A distinction must be drawn, however, between cases
           where the difficulties are due to uncertainty as to the causation of damage,
           where questions of remoteness arise, and cases where they are due to the fact
           that assessment of damages cannot be made with any mathematical accuracy.
           Lack of relevant evidence may make it impossible to assess damages at all, as
           where the extent of the loss is dependent upon too many contingencies, and in
           such cases, where the liability is established, nominal damages only may be
           awarded. Where it is established, however, that damage has been incurred
           for which a defendant should be held liable the plaintiff may be accorded the
           benefit of every reasonable presumption as to the loss suffered. Thus the
           Court doing the best that can be done with insufficient material may have to
           form conclusions on matters on which there is no evidence, and to make
           allowance for contingencies even to the extent of making a pure guess."

MP 101, it was held that if the seller breaks the contract to deliver any goods in a

contract for sale of future goods, one or more of the following remedies may be open to

the buyer namely :--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">           (i) he may sue for damages for non-delivery under Section 57 of the Act;

</p><p id="p_120">          It is further held that in a suit for damages for non-delivery, the loss to be

ascertained is the loss at the date of the breach .The measure of damages would,

therefore, be the difference between the contract price and the market price on the date of

the breach.

<p id="p_123">

on the date of the breach to permit a calculation of the damage suffered by the plaintiff.

the relevant date, unless there is proof, there cannot be a decree for damages against the

defendant as prayed by the plaintiff as per particulars stated above.

damages in such a case has to be determined under <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_22">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act, 1872 and

</p><p id="p_129">        To prove the case for damage, Mr. Chatterjee invites my attention to paragraph 21 of

the plaint wherein it is averred that the defendant is bound and obliged to compensate the

plaintiff for the damages so suffered by the plaintiff being the difference between the

international price of US dollar 571 per M.T. of the said commodity on the date of breach

that is in the middle of November, 2007 and the contract price of US dollar 271 per M.T.

which comes to US dollar 375000/- on account of non-supply of the commodities for which

the plaintiff was compelled to suspend the production activities at the said factory for a long

time and the plaintiff also suffer loss and notional damages of Rs. 2 crores.


</p><p id="p_130">        Mr. A. P. Agarwalla, Advocate on behalf of the plaintiff issued notice dated

05.2.2008 to the Emirates Trading Agency LLC Trading &amp; Shipping Division, Dubai,

UAE, calling upon the defendant to make good the loss suffered by the plaintiff to the

tune of USD 3,75,000/-, vide Exbt.- I. The said letter was replied by the defendant

contending that plaintiff was not entitled to any damage as prayed in the plaint, vide

Exbt.- J.
</p><p id="p_131">        Mr. Thaker has submitted that price of the said commodity in the middle of the

November, 2007 was not at the rate of USD 571 per metric ton and there was no

suspension of production at the plaintiff's factory for non-supply of the said commodity.

The nominal loss as claimed by the plaintiff has no basis for its calculation.


</p><p id="p_132">       It is further pointed out that the plaintiff went in the open market and procured the

goods from the difference sources so question of damage on account of loss as alleged is

not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_133">
</p><p id="p_134">       Mr. Thaker also adverted to the evidence in cross-examination of Mr. Bangur and

answer given to question no. 239 shows that the plaintiff procured 100 mt. sulphur from

Indian Oil Corporation during the said period to run their plant. Answer to question no.

232 reveals that the plaintiff obtained NOC and T/L for transportation of sulphur from

Haldia refinery to the factory of the plaintiff and this fact also finds corroboration by the

letter of plaintiff dated 1st November, 2007 Exbt.-1.
</p>
<p id="p_135">
</p><p id="p_136">       Consent letter dated 02.11.2007 of Indian Oil Corporation addressed to the

plaintiff Exbt.-2 reflects that IOC may release 1000 Mt. sulphur Ex-Haldia installation

subject to availability of product provided NOC, T/L and CST from the competent

authority are submitted in advance.
</p>
<p id="p_137">
</p><p id="p_138">       It would also reflect from the Invoices of the Indian Oil Corporation Exhibit-4

and Exhibit-S collectively that supplies of sulphur was made to the plaintiff by Indian Oil

Corporation vide Invoices dated 08.12.2007, 10.12.2007, 13.12.2007 and 15.12.2007 and

Invoices dated 07.01.2008, 16.01.2008 and 17.01.2008.
</p><p id="p_139">        Thus, the aforementioned documents on evidence clearly goes to show that as on

the date of alleged breach of contract the supplies of sulphur from Indian Oil Corporation

was obtained by the plaintiff, ergo, question of ascertaining the damage did not arise. As

I have discussed above that catena of decision postulates a clenched position of law that

it is for the plaintiff to prove the market price of the commodity on the date of breach.


</p><p id="p_140">       Mr. Chatterjee relied on the month-wise production statement for sulphuric acid

plant from November, 2007 to February, 2008 vide Exhibit-N proved by Mr. Suresh

Bangur of plaintiff company who has deposed that the said summary report has been

prepared based on the documents provided by the Works Manager at the factory which

has been duly verified by the company's accountant. It would appear therefrom that as

per the report Exhibit-N lower production from 1st November, 2007 to 28th December,

2007, lower production was due to plant stoppage for maintenance. Therefore, as on the

alleged breach of contract it cannot be said that the plaintiff suffered loss as damages due

to non-supply of the commodities by the defendant. The production was restricted for

want of sulphur on and from 29th December, 2007 till 13th February, 2008 as per the said

report but they cannot be said to be as on the date of the breach of contract in the mid of

November as alleged by the plaintiff.

<p id="p_141">
</p><p id="p_142">       It reflects from the letter dated 09.01.2008 of KPL International Ltd. vide Exhibit-

O collectively that price quoted is Euro 390/MT CIF, Haldia, value of which is USD

575/MT approximately. Plaintiff used to procure Iranian sulphur from United Organics

Private Limited indirectly through other suppliers depending on their demand till

February, 2008 vide Exhibit-P which reflects that expected freight from Iran to Haldia is
 approximately USD $ 40-42 per ton. Plaintiff also relied on International bulletin report

vide Exhibit-Q collectively in respect of FMB Sales Review 29th November, 2007 that

the Iranian sulphur were shipped to Indian through other sources at the rate of 242 CFR

in November, if the aforesaid documents being Exhibit-O, Exhibit-P and Exhibit-Q

collectively are taken into consideration in the context of market price on the date of

breach being on the middle of November, 2007 then it can be held that price quoted vide

Exhibit-O collectively by KPL International Limited to the plaintiff and Exhibit-P

collectively by United Organics Private Limited dated January 25, 2008 cannot be

considered as a standard objective for calculation of the damages as on the date of breach

allegedly committed by the defendant company. FMB sulphur report 3 January, 2008

vide Exhibit-R can also not be taken into consideration for the calculation of such

damages as prayed by the plaintiff because in view of no binding or enforceable contract

question of a breach by the defendant does not arise and damages so claimed cannot

survive.

<p id="p_143">
</p><p id="p_144">       Mr. A. P. Agarwalla, Advocate wrote letter to the defendant dated 03.3.2008 vide

commitment on the pretext of "force majeure".
</p>
<p id="p_145">
</p><p id="p_146">       As submitted by Mr. Chatterjee I am not in agreement with his contention for

awarding nominal damages. The general damages may also not be awarded as I am of the

view that the measures by which the damages are to be assessed have not been well

proved by the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_147">        If at all the IOC Invoices are considered though not admitted by the defendant,

the difference of price comes to Rs. 12010-Rs.11625= Rs. 384/- per MT. but that may

also not be calculated as there is no Invoice of the Indian Oil Corporation submitted in

evidence as on the date of communication by the defendant about "Force Majeure" dated

5th November, 2007 and/ or on the date of breach of contract alleged by the plaintiff in

the plaint as on the 15th November, 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_148">
</p><p id="p_149">       In the context of the above discussion, this Court hold that despite the issues

being 1 and 2 decided in favour of the plaintiff, nonetheless, the plaintiff is not entitled to

damages as claimed on the allegation of breach of contract for non-supply of the

commodities. Thus, the issue nos. 3 and 4 are answered in the negative. Ergo, the suit is

dismissed, however, without any order as to costs.
