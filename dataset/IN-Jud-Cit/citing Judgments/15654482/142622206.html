<p id="p_1">    1. This suit seeks permanent injunction against infringement of the
        trademarks 'ZANTAC' and 'ZINETAC' and their passing-off by
        the defendants. Plaintiff No.1 is a company incorporated under
        the laws of the United Kingdom while plaintiff No.2 was
        incorporated in India in 1924 under the name of H.J. Foster &amp; Co.
        It became a wholly owned subsidiary of Joseph Nathan &amp; Co. in
        1926.       In October 2001, plaintiff No.2 was renamed as
        GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd, following the merger with
        SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (India) with Glaxo India
        Limited.
</p><p id="p_2">    2. Plaintiff No.1 is the owner of the trademarks 'ZINETAC' and
        'ZANTAC', which were registered in the year 1985 and 1981
        respectively. The trademarks are associated with medicinal

         preparation, and it contains 'Ranitidine Hydrochloride' which is
        used in the treatment of gastric ailments. It is stated that
        'ZANTAC' is administered in the form of tablets, suspension and
        injection. It is the case of the plaintiffs that these two trademarks
        have been used in India consistently and extensively to the extent
        that a common man might associate these names for the treatment
        of gastric ailments, akin to how one would associate popular
        branded Paracetamol tablets for the treatment of fever. It is stated
        that the plaintiffs' pharmaceutical products bearing the marks
        'ZINETAC' is extensively sold in India; whereas the medicinal
        products bearing the trademark 'ZANTAC' is available in many
        parts of the world. As a result of their extensive recognition and
        goodwill, the two trademarks have come to be associated
        exclusively with the medicinal products manufactured and traded
        by the plaintiffs.       It is further submitted that the defendants'
        action of reproduction of the plaintiffs' medicinal products under
        a deceptively similar mark 'GENTAC' amounts to infringement
        of their registered trademarks and also to passing-off.
</p><p id="p_3">    3. Mr. Manav Kumar, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs submits
        that while the plaintiffs medicinal product are predominantly sold
        in the form of tablets as opposed to the defendants' selling their
        medicinal product in the form of injection vials, the method of
        administration of the medicines would not affect the plaintiffs'
        suit against infringement. The learned counsel further submits that
        in a suit for infringement what requires determination is, whether
        the infringing products are likely to create confusion in the mind
        of a purchaser. In support of this contention, the learned counsel

        Ltd &amp; Anr</a> 2. The learned counsel submits that 'ZANTAC' is an
        invented word having no specific dictionary meaning thereby
        containing       a   high     degree      of     distinctiveness.         In    such
        circumstances, the defendants' action to use the mark 'GENTAC'
        would amount to passing off and infringement of the plaintiffs'
        trademarks. Apart from the packaging of GENTAC being similar
        to that of the plaintiffs' medicinal products, the learned counsel
        submits that 'GENTAC' is phonetically similar to that of the
        plaintiffs' medicinal products. There is hardly a discernible
        difference between the two classes of medicinal products.The
        difference between ZANTAC and GENTAC is rather difficult to
        be differentiated by a man with average intelligence. Furthermore,
        keeping in view of the literacy rate of the population in the
        country, it is likely that a purchaser would buy GENTAC instead
        of the plaintiff's products.In support of this contention, the
        learned counsel relies on <a href="/doc/280042/" id="a_3">K. Krishna Chettiar v.Ambal &amp; Co</a>. 3

                comparison of the competing marks as a whole and their
                distinctive and essential features. We have no doubt in our
                mind that if the proposed mark is used in an normal and
                fair manner the mark would come to be known by its
                distinguishing feature "Andal". There is a striking
                similarity and affinity of sound between the words "
                Andal" and " Ambal". Giving due weight to the judgment
                of the Registrar and bearing in mind the conclusions of the
                learned Single Judge and the Divisional Bench, we are
                satisfied that there is a real danger of confusion between
                the two marks.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                10. There is no evidence of actual confusion, but that might
                be due to the fact that the appellant‟s trade is not of long
                standing. There is no visual resemblance between the two
                marks, but ocular comparison is not always the decisive
                test. The resemblance between the two marks must be
                considered with reference to the ear as well as the eye.
                There is a close affinity of sound between Ambal and

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                11. In the case of Coca-Cola Co. of Canada v. Pepsi Cola
                Co. of Canada Ltd., 1942-59 RPC 127, it was found that
                cola was in common use in Canada for naming the
                beverages. The distinguishing feature of the mark cocacola
                was coca and not cola. For the same reason the
                distinguishing feature of the mark Pepsi Cola was Pepsi
                and cola. It was not likely that any one would confuse the
                word Pepsi with coca. In the present case the word "Sri"
                may be regarded as in common use. The distinguishing
                feature of the respondent‟s mark is Ambal while that of the

</p><p id="p_5">     4. The learned counsel further submits that since both parties are
        involved in the manufacture and trade of identical products, it is
        possible that the buyers would confuse the defendants' product to
        be that of the plaintiffs'. It is submitted that the past actions of the
        defendant reflect their intention to infringe the plaintiffs'
        registered trademarks. It is stated that the plaintiffs had initiated a
        suit for infringement of trademarks and copyrights, being suit No.
        326 of 2004, against the defendant when the latter started to
        manufacture a medicine under the trade name 'BECNATE' with a
        packaging        similar to      that    of the plaintiffs' product             '
        BETNOVATE'. However, by order dated 06.04.2005, this Court
        restrained the defendants from manufacturing or dealing in
        products that were similar to the product of the plaintiffs.

        submits that the trademark 'ZANTAC' is not associated with any
        medicinal product and that the trademark is a dummy registration.
        Furthermore, the plaintiffs have failed to lead evidence apropos
        'ZINETAC'. Under such circumstances, the plaintiffs cannot
        claim any protection of their trademarks. It is submitted that
        while 'GENTAC' has commercial goodwill, the plaintiffs have
        failed to show the existence of the same for their products. It is
        submitted that there can be no possible cause for confusion
        between the two classes of the medicines as the defendants'
        product is exclusively sold in the form of injections as opposed
        the plaintiffs' products being sold in the form of tablets. In

         a buyer cannot procure the medicines without producing a
        medical prescription to the chemist. Accordingly, it is submitted,
        that there is no possibility of any confusion being created in the
        mind of the buyer.
</p><p id="p_8">     6. The learned counsel further contends that the plaintiffs cannot
        claim an infringement of a trademark when they have failed to
        prove that the said registration subsists; that the plaintiffs have not
        produced any document to show that they have applied for
        renewal of the registration of trademarks and that non-use of a
        trademark for a long period of time would bar the applicant from
        such seeking registration or renewal thereof. It is submitted that
        the object of a registered trademark is to enable proprietorship
        over the same when it is put to use and not to monopolize the
        trademark indefinitely. On this point, the learned counsel relies
        upon <a href="/doc/1945028/" id="a_4">Veerumal Praveen Kumar v. Needle Industries (India) Ltd.

<p id="p_9">    7. The learned counsel for the defendants submits that GENTAC has
        been approved by the Drug Licensing Authority to be sold to the
        public. Accordingly, once the approval of the Drug Licensing
        Authority is obtained, the plaintiffs cannot restrain the defendants
        from manufacturing the injections.In such circumstances,                        the
        plaintiffs have failed to make out a case for infringement and
        passing off and the suit ought to be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_10">    8. The Court, while adjudicating a suit for infringement of
        trademark, is required to consider the trademark in its entirety.
        The primary claim of the plaintiffs is that the defendants'
        medicinal product 'GENTAC' is deceptively similar to the
        plaintiffs' medicinal products ' ZANTAC' and 'ZINETAC' in
        terms of the packaging, trade style and the phonetic similarity.
        Under such circumstance, the plaintiffs are required to show that
        the defendants' products are deceptively similar to the plaintiffs'
        registered medicinal products. In pursuance of establishing the
        similarity between the two classes of medicinal products,
        ZANTAC, ZINETAC marked as Ex Pw1/ 5 and GENTAC
        marked as Ex Pw 1/8 respectively are placed on record. On a
        perusal of the exhibits, this Court finds that, insofar as similarity

         of the trade style is concerned, the two classes of the medicinal
        products contain different packaging and trade style. On this facet
        alone, this Court is of the view that the two categories of
        medicinal products are visually distinct. However, this Court is
        concerned with the phonetic similarities between the two classes
        of medicines. It is to be noted that the product in question is to be
        assessed in its entirety and not based on one of the characters
        alone. The need to distinguish between the products is greater
        when the trademark in question pertains to medicinal products
        preparations. In Cadila (supra) the Supreme Court has laid down
        the considerations the Court would have to bear when the
        products in question relate to pharmaceutical products.                         The

                products. drugs are poisons, not sweets. Confusion between
                medicinal products may, therefore, be life threatening, not

                patients may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may not

        of gastric ailments. From the exhibits, it is apparent that
        GENTAC is manufactured and sold in the form of injection vials
        while the plaintiffs' ZANTAC and ZINETAC are sold in the form
        of tablets they are Schedule H drugs. The Court notes that the
        two classes of medicinal products are Schedule 'H' drugs. The
        Court is unpersuaded by the contention of the defendants that
        since the medicinal products can be procured only through valid
        prescription, there wasn't any likelihood of confusion in the mind

                confusion in the case of non- medicinal products may only

                medicinal products may have disastrous effects on health
                and in some cases life itself. Stringent measures should be
                adopted specially where medicines are the medicines of last

                could have disastrous effects. The confusion as to the
