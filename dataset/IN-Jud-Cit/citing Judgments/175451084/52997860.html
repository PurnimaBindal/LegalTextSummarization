stated that plaintiff company owned the statutory and

CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                        Page No.3/21
 combination of BIG and SHOWS put together in the context of
event management industry has acquired secondary meaning
and is completely protectable in law. The BIG SHOWS mark
and log written in a distinctive manner is an original creation
of   the    plaintiff   company      and    has   acquired      distinctive
character by virtue of extensive use since 1995. It has
acquired the status of a well known mark within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> (zg), 11 (6), 11 (7), 11 (8) and 11 (9) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_5">Trade

services includes complete show production like light &amp; sound
on rental, high-end video production, multi camera set ups,
stage constructions, artist co-ordination, lazer shows, set
designs &amp; constructions, backdrop, artist management etc.
However, exact constitution of the defendant is not known to
the plaintiff company at this stage. The plaintiff was shocked
to see that the defendant company has slavishly copies the
plaintiff company's registered mark           BIG SHOWS along with
identical    services,   which       are   provided     by   the    plaintiff
company. The defendant company in an identical manner for
identical    services    illegally    adopted     and    used      plaintiff's
trademark/ logo/ name BIG SHOWS, which constitute act of
infringement, passing off misrepresentation, dilution etc.

CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                                 Page No.4/21
</p><p id="p_8"> 7.           The defendant company illegally adopted the
identical   mark/logo    without      permission/license   from   the
plaintiff company with malafide intention in order to capitalize
on the enormous goodwill of the plaintiff company. It is further
stated that the defendants have not only occupied plaintiff's
registered and well known trade name BIG SHOWS but also
got a domain name registered containing the plaintiff's
registered trade mark/ logo/ name BIG SHOWS and also also
operating    a    website      from    the   said    domain    name
www.bigshowsentertainers.in           The defendant company has
adopted the identical mark/logo/name for identical services
with sole motive to unfairly encash upon the reputation and
goodwill of the plaintiff's mark/logo/name in relation to
identical services, is bound to create confusion in the mind of
the   consumers.        Moreover,      the   defendant's   infringing
activities in relation to plaintiff's coveted trade mark will lead
to diluting the plaintiff's well known trade mark.                The
defendant company is trying to ride piggy back on the
impeccable reputation and popularity of the plaintiff's trade
mark/ logo/ name BIG SHOWS.
</p>

<p id="p_9">8.           It is further stated that the confusion/deception is
inevitable as the identical trade marks             BIG SHOWS; the
business/services is identical - Even management &amp; related
services i.e. Class 41; the trade channels are common; the
class of consumers are common; the names of the companies
are identical/deceptively similar. Further the use of the
trademark     BIG SHOWS as part of the domain names i.e.
www.bigshowsentertainers.in ; the defendants have opened
their office near to the office of the plaintiff and the

CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                           Page No.5/21
 defendants' website www.bigshowsentertainers.in deliberately
shows the address of the plaintiff's office. It is further stated
that with a sole view to misrepresent/ confuse the public at
large to create an impression that the defendant's event
management services are either a branch/outlet/extension of
the plaintiff or is associated with the plaintiff company. This
would lead to complete dilution. The illegal adoption and use
by the defendants deserved to be immediately curbed.
</p>

<p id="p_10">9.            It is stated that in December, 2015, the plaintiff's
representatives came across the website of of defendant
company i.e. www.bigshowsentertainers.in From the perusal
of the website, the plaintiff came to know that the defendants
are not only using the plaintiff's trademark BIG SHOWS but
also in the same business of event management. Therefore,
defendant company committed violation of the statutory and
common law rights of the plaintiff including infringement of a
registered trade mark; bad faith registrations and acts of
passing     off,   unfair   competition,   misrepresentation   and
dilution.
</p>

<p id="p_11">10.           It is stated that use of plaintiff's trade mark/ logo
BIG SHOWS in the impugned domain name is illegal and
unauthorized. The plaintiff seeks the ad-interim injunction
thereby restraining the defendant company from infringing
the trade mark/ logo/name BIG SHOWS, acts of passing off
unfair competition, misrepresentation and dilution thereby
restraining the defendants, their principal officers, family
members, servants, agents, dealers, distributors, directors,
licensees and anyone acting for and on their behalf including

CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                         Page No.6/21

www.bigshowsentertainers.in and using trade name                  BIG
SHOWS in any of the impugned material including posters,
pamphlets, publicity material, labels, invoices, brochures,
stationery, etc.


</p><p id="p_12">11.          The defendant company filed detailed written
statement and reply and taken the preliminary objection that
as per <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_6">Section 2</a> (xvii) of Commercial Courts, commercial
Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts
Act, 2015, this court has no jurisdiction. The present suit is
glaring and striking instance of abuse of process of law. It is
stated that published logo         BIG SHOWS is not a registered
trade mark of plaintiff        As per certificate of registration of
trade   mark    dated    22.01.2007,      which   was    issued    on
08.12.2004 shows that trade mark is being used since
31.03.2004 and in the name of Sh. Manmeet Singh and not in
the name of plaintiff company. The suit is bad for mis-joinder
of necessary parties. The suit is barred by limitation. The
defendants are in the process of filing objections before the
Registrar Trade Mark to oppose the registration of trade mark
BIG SHOWS in favour of plaintiff. The plaintiff has concealed
deliberately the fact regarding the winding up of the earlier
company. Now it is clear that it has not been used mark BIG
SHOWS since 1995.

</p><p id="p_19"> 17.          I have heard Sh. Sumit Nagpal, Counsel for the
plaintiff and Sh. Amish Aggarwal, proxy Counsel for Sh. Satish
Aggarwal, Counsel for the defendant and also gone through
the written arguments filed by defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_20">18.          Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff contended that in the
year 1995, Sh. Manmeet Singh Rattan, Managing Director of
the   plaintiff   company      coined   and   adopted     the   trade
mark/logo/ trade name BIG SHOWS but late on the company
BIG SHOWS India Pvt. Ltd. was winded up and new company
BIG SHOWS Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. Was incorporated in the
year 2006. However, the trade mark/logo/name remains BIG
SHOWS. My attention has been drawn on the documents filed
on record in respect of certificate of incorporation of
20.03.1995 and Memorandum of Association. However, the
copy of PAN Card and other record shown by Counsel for the
plaintiff. It is contended that the use of the trade mark BIG
SHOWS has been started in 1995 and it continued till today.
There are several reputed big clients, such as Coca-Cola,
BHEL, TATA, Government Organization, NDMC, Chandigarh
Tourism etc. and plaintiff company enjoys great reputation in
providing the services for event management. During these
20 years, the plaintiff company has hold several big events.
He further contended that the trademark/logo/ name BIG
SHOWS has been got registered w.e.f. 31.03.2004. My
attention has been drawn to the registration certificate
granted by Registrar of Trade Mark. He contended that
another application is pending for trade mark BIG SHOWS
claim since 30.07.1995.

<p id="p_21">CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                            Page No.10/21
</p><p id="p_22"> 19.          Ld. Counsel further contended that the plaintiff
company has invested huge amount in publicity in various
leading newspapers and newspapers being published since
1995. The news regarding the events organized by plaintiff
company and the photocopies of such newspaper reportings
are filed on record. Ld. Counsel has drawn my attention to the
annual turnover since 1995 to 2013-14 and in the year 2013-
14, it is more than Rs.2 Crores.      He contended that the
plaintiff company is the prior user of the trade mark/
logo/name BIG SHOWS and got the registration in Clause 41
by the Registrar Trade Mark, therefore, a statutory right has
been created in favour of the plaintiff company.
</p>

<p id="p_23">20.          Ld. Counsel Sh. Sumit Nagpal further contended
that the defendant company has also illegally adopted and
started using the registered trade mark/logo/name BIG
SHOWS and this factum came to the knowledge in December,
2015. The defendant company is in an identical manner
providing identical services whereby infringing the trade
mark/logo/name of the plaintiff's statutory rights.         The
defendant company also deals in the identical services and
created great disturbance and confusion among the public at
large by using illegally the trade mark BIG SHOWS. He pointed
out that the defendant company is also operating website
www.bigshowsentertainers.in unfairly and with sole motive to
encash goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff. He referred to
the various paras of plaint and replication. He further pointed
out from the documents filed by defendant that the deception
and confusion is so much that defendant company itself relied
the doucments of plaintiff company bearing the name and

CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                       Page No.11/21
 logo. He contended that application may be allowed. Ld.
Counsel for the plaintiff relied on judgments of (i) <a href="/doc/1224592/" id="a_7">Chandra
Shashi vs. Anil Kumar Verma</a>, 1995 SCC (1) 421; (ii) <a href="/doc/610677/" id="a_8">Essel

on 09.11.2012 in RFA (OS) No. 90/2010.
</p>

<p id="p_24">21.          Ld. Counsel for the defendant Sh. Amish Aggarwal
referred to the principle that a prior user of trade mark has
rights even over a later registered user and no action lies
against a prior user of the trade mark in a passing off action.
He referred to Section 34 of the Trade Mark Act. He contended
that it is the admitted fact of the plaintiff that from period
2005 to 2008 there was no use of Trade Mark BIG SHOWS or
in its variant, therefore, plaintiff is not entitled for injunction.
Ref. Milmet Oftho Industries and Ors. Vs. Allergan Inc.
(2004) 12 SCC 624. He further contended that as per
plaintiff's own contentions, the plaintiff discovered the alleged
contravention of the defendants only in December, 2015. It is
well settled law that even the slight amount of delay in
seeking relief is fatal and attention was invited to the
judgment of <a href="/doc/1531686/" id="a_11">Gillette Company and others vs. A.K.

03.08.2001 in IAs 12520/99 and 3572/2000 in Suit No. 2732
of 1999.     He further contended that plaintiff has to lead
evidence to show that there was no uninterrupted use of
trade mark BIG SHOWS, whereas there is an interruption in
the use by the plaintiff. He further relied on judgment (India

He    further   contended      that    the    allegations   regarding
fabrication of documents by the defendant is vehemently
denied. Therefore, application is liable to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_25">22.          I have considered the submissions of both the Ld.
Counsels and perused the record and judgments relied by the
parties.   I would like to refer to the judgment of Himalaya
Drug Company (Supra). The relevant paras have been
reproduced as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "17. In order to establish infringement, the main
             ingredients of Section 29 are that the plaintiff's
             mark must be registered under the Trade and
             <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_13">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958, the defendant's
             mark is identical with or deceptively similar to
             the registered trade, the defendant's use of the
             mark is in the course of trade in respect of the
             goods covered by the registered trade mark. The
             rival marks are to be compared as a whole.</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">             Where two rival marks are identical, it is not
             necessary for the plaintiff to prove further that
             the use of defendant's trade mark is likely to
             deceive and cause confusion as the registration
             shows the title of the registered proprietor and
             the   things      speak    for   themselves.     In   an
             infringement action, once a mark is used as
             indicating commercial origin by the defendant,
             no amount of added matter intended to show
             the true origin of the goods can effect the
             question. If court finds that the defendant's


CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                            Page No.13/21
              mark is closely, visually and phonetically similar,
             even then no further proof is necessary. It is not
             necessary for the plaintiff to adduce evidence of
             actual deception in order to prove the case of
             infringement. If packing of two products is
             different in an action of infringement, the same
             is immaterial. Its validity cannot be challenged
             in the infringement proceedings under the Trade
             and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_14">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958 (<a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_15">See Corn

             Essential Features


</p><p id="p_29">             19.    The courts have propounded the doctrine
             of prominent and essential feature of the trade
             mark for the purposes of adjudication of the
             disputes relating to infringement of trade mark.
             While deciding the question of infringement, the
             court has to see the prominent or the dominant
             feature of the trade mark. Even the learned
             single judge agrees to this proposition when the
             learned judge quotes McCarthy on Trade Marks
             that all composite marks are to be compared as
             whole. However, it is dependent on case to case
             to basis as a matter of jury question as to what
             can be the possible broad and essential feature
             of the trade mark in question.
</p>

<p id="p_30">             20.    It is settled law that where the defendant's
             mark      contains   the   essential   feature   of   the
             plaintiff's mark combined with other matter, the
             correct approach for the court is to identify an
             essential feature depending particularly on the
             court's    own    judgment     and     burden    of   the
             evidence that is placed before the Court. In
             order to come to the conclusion whether one
             mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad
             and essential features of the two are to be
             considered. They should not be placed side by
             side to find out if there are difference, rather
             overall similarity has to be judged while judging



CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                           Page No.15/21
              the question as to whether the defendant has
             infringed the rate mark or not, the court has to
             consider the overall impression of the mark in
             the minds of general public and not by merely
             comparing the dissimilarities in the two marks.
</p>

<p id="p_31">             21.    The ascertainment of an essential feature
             is not to be by ocular test alone but if a word
             forming part of the mark has come in trade to be
             used to identify the goods of the owner of the
             trade mark, it is an infringement of the mark
             itself to use that word as the mark or part of the
             mark of another trader for which confusion is
             likely to result.    The likelihood of confusion or
             deception in such cases is not disproved by
             placing      the   two   marks    side    by    side    and
             demonstrating how small is the chance of error
             in any customer who places his order for goods
             with both the marks clearly before him, for
             orders are not placed, or are often not placed,
             under such conditions.           It is more useful to
             observe that in most persons the eye is not an
             accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks
             are remembered rather by general impressions
             or    by   some    significant   detail   than    by    any
             photographic recollection of the whole. In the
             decision reported as (1951) 68 RPC 103 at page
             105, De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co., the
             plaintiffs    were   the   proprietors     of    a     label
             containing the words Vick's VapoRub as the
             essential feature, registered in Jamaica, and the
             defendants used a similar label with the words



CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                            Page No.16/21
              Karsote Vapour Rub as the essential feature,
             and it was shown that the expression VapoRub
             had become distinctive of the plaintiff's goods in
             Jamaica,    an    action    for       infringement     was
             successful. (See De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co.
             (supra), (1941) 58 RPC 147, Saville Perfumery

             Defendant's mark is deceptively similar to the

                   which they are to be applied. You must

<p id="p_33">23.          Now applying the principles cited in the judgment
of Himalaya Drug Company (Supra) in the present facts and
circumstances, the documents filed on record by the plaintiff
company prima-facie establishes that M/s. BIG SHOWS India
Private Limited came into existence in 1995 and started using
trade mark/logo/name BIG SHOWS for event management.
This trade mark has been coined and adopted by Sh.Manmeet
Singth Rattan. Sh.Manmeet Singh Rattan continued the same
business by launching M/s. BIG SHOWS Entertainment Private
Limited, the trade mark/logo/name remains BIG SHOWS. The
documents regarding the registration of domain on the
website further corroborate this fact. As per record, it is not
disputed that the trade mark/logo/name has been registered
by the Registrar Trade Mark in Class 41 in favour of plaintiff
company. Hence, petitioner has statutory rights as per Trade
Mark Act in respect of the registered trade mark/logo/name.
The documents on record further prima-facie establish that
the plaintiff company has been engaged in the Event
Management business and having reputed clients. The
turnover further shows it cross Rs.2 Crores annually in the
year 2013-14. The other bunch of documents establish that
plaintiff   company    has     been   providing   services   for   a


CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                         Page No.18/21
 continuous period of about 20 years and earned great
reputation and name among the customers and traders.
</p>

<p id="p_34">24.          I have also gone through the documents filed by
the defendant company.               As per the Memorandum and
Certificate of Incorporation of the defendant company, it
came into existence in the year 2011 &amp; 2012. However, the
documents filed on record are pertaining to year have of
1994. I have gone through at internal page 70, it is a bill of
one Sound Waves. It has number +911140125293.                      It is
surprising how this eight digit number was in existence in the
year 1994. This document does not inspire confidence.
Similarly, other bills also of 1994, 1995, 1997 are filed on
record, which do not relate to the existence of defendant
company at the alleged date of 1994. It is astonishing that as
per the documents filed by Director of defendant company
Sh.Gautam Kapoor at internal page 160 i.e. the Income Tax
Return, which shows that his date of birth is 23.08.1977, then
how in the year 1994, he starts the business of defendant
company when he was only 14 years old. Therefore, I do not
find any substance and merit in the contentions of Ld.
Counsel for the defendant regarding prior use and the delay
in approaching the court by the plaintiff. In my considered
opinion,    the   plaintiff    has   prima-facie   case   having    the
registered trade mark of BIG SHOWS and especially when
defendant is dealing in some identical services, it is bound to
cause deception and confusion to the customers and in trade
at large.     The use of trade mark and adoption by the
defendant has infringed the statutory rights of the plaintiff
company as both deal in the identical business as per Class

CS - 6/16 (New No. 11106/16)                              Page No.19/21
 41 of the Trade Mark Rules.     The plaintiff has gained huge
reputation in the trade and earning annually more than Rs.2
Crores. Therefore, balance of convenience also lies in favour
of plaintiff. The plaintiff is bound to suffer irreparable loss,
which cannot be compensated in any manner.

<p id="p_35">25.          On the basis of above observation and discussion,
application under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 CPC of the plaintiff is
allowed. Accordingly, defendants, their principal officers,
family members, servants, agents, dealers, distributors,
directors, licensees and anyone acting for and/or on their

mark and amounts infringement of the said trade mark under
