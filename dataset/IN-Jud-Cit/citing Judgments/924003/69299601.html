premiere product in the market on account of its cleaning and maintaining
hygiene capabilities. It is claimed that it kills 99.99% germs, kills Sars-CoV-
2 virus, removes toilet stains, kills odour causing germs and provides
complete hygiene to the toilet bowl.
</p><p id="p_4">3.     It is stated that the defendant has a toilet cleaning product sold under
the brand name of &#x27;DOMEX&#x27; which enjoys a market share of 5.3%. To
illegally promote the sale of this &#x27;DOMEX&#x27; branded product, it is stated that
the defendant has compared it in its advertisement with the HARPIC
branded toilet cleaner of the plaintiff, which product enjoys 77.2% market
share. It is stated that while making comparisons, the defendant has not only
disparaged and degenerated the plaintiff&#x27;s HARPIC product but has also
blatantly made false statements and half-truths. It is stated that this
campaign has been launched on 23rd July, 2021. Campaign has been
extensively used by flooding it on Youtube, leading newspapers and TV
Channels and other media.

</p><p id="p_16">10.    I may look at the two judgments of the Division Bench of this court.
In the case of <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_8">Dabur India Ltd. v. M/s Colortek Meghalaya Pvt.
Ltd</a>.(supra), the Division Bench held has follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       &quot;3. The question that arises before us is this: Does the
       commercial telecast by the Respondents disparage the product
       of the Appellant and if so, whether the Appellant is entitled to
       an injunction against the telecast. In our opinion, the answer to
       the first question is in the negative. Consequently, the second
       question does not arise. To this extent, we confirm the view
       taken by a learned Single Judge in the impugned order.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       10. In Tata Press Ltd. v. MTNL, (1995) 5 SCC 139 (paragraph
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       25) the Supreme Court held that &quot;commercial speech&quot; is a part
       of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_9">Article
       19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. However, what is &quot;commercial
       speech&quot; was not defined or explained. In fact, it does not appear
       to be possible to clearly define or explain &quot;commercial speech&quot;
       and, in any event, for the purposes of this case it is not
       necessary for us to do so. The reason for this is that the
       Supreme Court has said in Tata Press Ltd. (paragraph 23 of the
       Report) that advertising as a &quot;commercial speech&quot; has two
       facets thereby postulating that an advertisement is a species of
       commercial speech. The Supreme Court further said as
       follows:--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           &quot;23. .... Advertising which is no more than a commercial
           transaction is nonetheless dissemination of information
           regarding the product advertised. Public at large is benefited
           by the information made available through the
           advertisement. In a democratic economy free flow of

            commercial information is indispensable. There cannot be
           honest and economical marketing by the public at large
           without being educated by the information disseminated
           through advertisements. The economic system in a
           democracy would be handicapped without there being
           freedom of &quot;commercial speech&quot;....&quot;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       14. On the basis of the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the
       guiding principles for us should be the following:--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       (i) An advertisement is commercial speech and is protected by
            <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_10">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       (ii) An advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair or
            deceptive.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       (iii)Of course, there would be some grey areas but these need
            not necessarily be taken as serious representations of fact
            but only as glorifying one&#x27;s product.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       To this extent, in our opinion, the protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_11">Article 19(1)(a)</a>
       of the Constitution is available. However, if an advertisement
       extends beyond the grey areas and becomes a false, misleading,
       unfair or deceptive advertisement, it would certainly not have
       the benefit of any protection.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">       15. There is one other decision that we think would give some
       guidance and that is <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_12">Pepsi Co. Inc. v. Hindustan Coca Cola
       Ltd</a>., 2003 (27) PTC 305 (Del.) (DB). In this decision, a
       Division Bench of this Court held that while boasting about
       one&#x27;s product is permissible, disparaging a rival product is not.
       The fourth guiding principle for us, therefore, is: (iv) While
       glorifying its product, an advertiser may not denigrate or
       disparage a rival product. Similarly, in Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of
       England (Fourth Edition Reissue, Volume 28) it is stated in
       paragraph 278 that &quot;[It] is actionable when the words go beyond
       a mere puff and constitute untrue statements of fact about a
       rival&#x27;s product.&quot; This view was followed, amongst others,
       in <a href="/doc/1357815/" id="a_13">Dabur India Ltd. v. Wipro Limited, Bangalore</a>, 2006 (32)
       PTC 677 (Del). &quot;[It] is one thing to say that the defendant&#x27;s
       product is better than that of the plaintiff and it is another thing

        to say that the plaintiff&#x27;s product is inferior to that of the
       defendant.&quot;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">       23. Finally, we may mention that <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_14">Reckitt &amp; Colman of India
       Ltd. v. M.P. Ramchandran</a>, 1999 (19) PTC 741 was referred to
       for the following propositions relating to comparative
       advertising:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       (a) A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in the
           world, even though the declaration is untrue.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       (b) He can also say that his goods are better than his
           competitors&#x27;, even though such statement is untrue.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">       (c) For the purpose of saying that his goods are the best in the
           world or his goods are better than his competitors&#x27; he can
           even compare the advantages of his goods over the goods of
           others.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">       (d) He however, cannot, while saying that his goods are better
           than his competitors&#x27;, say that his competitors&#x27; goods are
           bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods of his
           competitors. In other words, he defames his competitors and
           their goods, which is not permissible.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">       (e) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the manufacturer
           of such goods no action lies, but if there is such defamation
           an action lies and if an action lies for recovery of damages
           for defamation, then the Court is also competent to grant an
           order of injunction restraining repetition of such defamation.
       These propositions have been accepted by learned Single
       Judges of this Court in several cases, but in view of the law laid
       down by the Supreme Court in Tata Press that false, misleading,
       unfair or deceptive advertising is not protected commercial
       speech, we are of the opinion that propositions (a) and (b) above
       and the first part of proposition (c) are not good law. While
       hyped-up advertising may be permissible, it cannot transgress
       the grey areas of permissible assertion, and if does so, the
       advertiser must have some reasonable factual basis for the
       assertion made. It is not possible, therefore, for anybody to
       make an off-the-cuff or unsubstantiated claim that his goods are




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                              Page 8 of 13</span>
        the best in the world or falsely state that his goods are better
       than that of a rival.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_17">11.    Similarly, the Division Bench of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/134483884/" id="a_15">Colgate
Palmolive Company &amp; Another v. Hindustan Uniliver Ltd</a>. (supra), held as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">       &quot;27. The law relating to disparaging advertisements is now well
       settled. While, it is open for a person to exaggerate the claims
       relating to his goods and indulge in puffery, it is not open for a
       person to denigrate or disparage the goods of another person. In
       case of comparative advertisement, a certain amount of
       disparagement is implicit. If a person compares its goods and
       claims that the same are better than that of its competitors, it is
       implicit that the goods of his competitor&#x27;s are inferior in
       comparison. To this limited extent, puffery in the context of
       comparative advertisement does involve showing the
       competitor&#x27;s goods in a bad light. However, as long as the
       advertisement is limited only to puffing, there can be no
       actionable claim against the same. In the case
       of White v. Mellin: (1895) A.C. 154, the House of Lords while
       rejecting the contention of disparagement observed as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">           &quot;The allegation of a tradesman that his goods are better than
           his neighbour&#x27;s very often involves only the consideration
           whether they possess one or two qualities superior to the
           other. Of course &quot;better&quot; means better as regards the
           purpose for which they are intended, and the question of
           better or worse in many cases depends simply upon one or
           two or three issues of fact. If an action will not lie because a
           man says that his goods are better than his neighbour&#x27;s, it
           seems to me impossible to say that it will lie because he
           says that they are better in this or that or the other respect.
           Just consider what a door would be opened if this were
           permitted. That this sort of puffing advertisement is in use is
           notorious; and we see rival cures advertised for particular
           ailments. The Court would then be bound to inquire, in an
           action brought, whether this ointment or this pill better




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                Page 9 of 13</span>
            cured the disease which it was alleged to cure - whether a
           particular article of food was in this respect or that better
           than another. Indeed, the Courts of law would be turned into
           a machinery for advertising rival productions by obtaining a
           judicial determination which of the two was the better.&quot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">                                        xxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">       29. Thus, as long as claims made in an advertisement are
       considered only as puffery, no interference with the same by the
       courts would be warranted. This is for a simple reason that
       puffing involves expressing opinions and are not considered as
       statements of fact which can be taken seriously. As puffery is
       neither intended to make a representation as to facts nor is
       considered as such by the target audience. The advertisement
       involving puffery, thus, cannot be stated to be misrepresenting
       facts. It is common for advertisements to make extravagant and
       exaggerated claims in relation to goods and services. It is
       expected that an advertiser would embellish the goods and
       services that are advertised and such puffery is neither expected
       to be nor is taken seriously by any average person. This was
       also observed by the Chancery Division in De Beers Abrasive
       Products Ltd. (supra) as under: -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">           &quot;In other words, in the kind of situation where one expects,
           as a matter of ordinary common experience, a person to use
           a certain amount of hyperbole in the description of goods,
           property or services, the courts will do what any ordinary
           reasonable man would do, namely, take it with a large pinch
           of salt.&quot;&quot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">       30. Having stated the above, it is equally well settled that a
       trader is not entitled to denigrate or defame the goods of his
       competitor&#x27;s, while comparing his goods with that of the other
       traders. In comparative advertising, the comparing of one&#x27;s
       goods with that of others and establishing the superiority of
       one&#x27;s goods over that of others is permissible, however, while
       doing so, one is not allowed to make a statement that the goods
       of others are bad, inferior or undesirable as that would amount
       to defaming or denigrating the goods of other&#x27;s, which is
       actionable. In the case of <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_16">Dabur India Ltd. v. Colortek

           the world, even though the declaration is untrue.

           competitors&#x27;, even though such statement is untrue.

           the world or his goods are better than his competitors&#x27; he
           can even compare the advantages of his goods over the
           goods of others.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">           (d) He however, cannot, while saying that his goods are
           better than his competitors&#x27;, say that his competitors&#x27; goods
           are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods of his
           competitors. In other words, he defames his competitors and
           their goods, which is not permissible.

           manufacturer of such goods no action lies, but if there is
           such defamation an action lies and if an action lies for
           recovery of damages for defamation, then the Court is also
           competent to grant an order of injunction restraining
           repetition of such defamation.

       Judges of this Court in several cases, but in view of the law laid
       down by the Supreme Court in Tata Press, that false,

       commercial speech, we are of the opinion that propositions (a)
       and (b) above and the first part of proposition (c) are not good
       law. While hyped-up advertising may be permissible, it cannot
       transgress the grey areas of permissible assertion, and if does
       so, the advertiser must have some reasonable factual basis for
       the assertion made. It is not possible, therefore, for anybody to
       make an off-the-cuff or unsubstantiated claim that his goods are

advertisements disparage the product of the plaintiff or the advertisements

<p id="p_21">14.    The above advertisement certifies the product of the defendant as
superior to that of the plaintiff. It further tends to denigrate the product of
the plaintiff. In my opinion, the said advertisement, prima facie, at this
stage, based on the averments appears to disparage the product of the
plaintiff. Balance of convenience would also be in favour of the plaintiff. I
accordingly restrain the defendant from publishing the aforenoted
advertisement in any forum till they remove all references to the product of
the plaintiff &#x27;HARPIC&#x27;.
