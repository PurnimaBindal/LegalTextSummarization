</p><p id="p_36">Point No:  I
</p><p id="p_37">        9.  According to prosecution injured Khadhar Sha, shop keeper  of  the
deceased Anwar  has  sustained injuries in the said incident.  Originally, the
charge sheet has been filed against twelve persons in S.C.No.  27 of  1996  on
the file of District and Sessions Judge, Udhagamandalam.  Since the appellants
/ accused was absconding for a long time, this case has been split up from the
orginal S.C.No.   27  of  1996  and  tried  separately  in S.C.No.  4 of 1997.
Therefore, the case in S.C.No.  27 of 1996 was tried against  11  accused  and
disposed of  on  merit.   In Sessions Case 27 of 1996, the injured Khadhar Sha
was examined as P.  W.1.  
</p><p id="p_38">        10.  In the meantime, the appellant/accused was apprehended and  tried
in the  present S.C.No.4 of 1997 and disposed of on merit.  During the time of
trial, the injured Khadhar Sha died.  So his evidence in S.C.No.  27  of  1996
has been  marked  as Ex.P.36.  The learned counsel for the appellant submitted
that the deposition of the injured Khadhar Sha in S.C.No.  27 of  1996  cannot
be relied on in this Sessions Case 04 of 1997 as the same was not subjected to
cross  examination  by the appellant/accused in the light of <a href="/doc/800773/" id="a_8">Section 33</a> of the
Indian Evidence  Act.    He  has  also  relied  on  the  decisions  <a href="/doc/1540789/" id="a_9">V.M.MATHEW
v.V.S.SHARMA</a> ( 1995 (6) SCC 122) to substantiate this contention. 
</p>
<p id="p_39">        11.   So  we  have  to  find out whether there is any substance in the
contention of the learned counsel for the appellant / accused.  <a href="/doc/800773/" id="a_10">Section 33</a>  of
the Indian Evidence Act explains certain situation in which, the deposition of
witnesses  in  the  earlier  proceedings  cannot  be  relied  on in subsequent
proceedings if both the proceedings are not one and the same.  <a href="/doc/800773/" id="a_11">Section  33</a>  of
the Indian Evidence Act reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_40">        " Relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding,
the truth  of  facts  therein  stated.    -  Evidence  given by a witness in a
judicial proceeding, or before any person authorised by law  to  take  it,  is
relevant  for  the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or
in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which
it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found,  or  is  incapable  of
giving  evidence,  or  is  kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his
presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under 
the circumstances of the case, the Court considers unreasonable:
Provided-
</p><p id="p_41">that the proceeding was between the same parties or their  representatives  in

the  contention  of  the learned counsel for the appellant in the light of the
decision cited above and submitted that Ex.P.36 cannot be relied on.  In  view
of  the  legal  submission  of  both  sides, we are satisfied that the Ex.P.36
cannot be relied on against the interest of the appellant and accordingly  the
same is rejected.
</p><p id="p_48">Point No:  II
</p><p id="p_49">        13.   It  is  true  that on 14.4.1995 at Coonoor, there was a communal
clash between the Muslims and Vishwa  Hindu  Parishat  (V.H.P),  while  Vishwa
Hindu  Parishat  (V.H.P)  organised  the public meeting and procession on that
date, in which several Hindus have sustained injuries.  P.W.6,  P.W.8,  P.W.9,
P.W.10  and  P.W.13  have  stated that on the fateful day, when Hindu Munnani,
viz., R.S.S., organised public meeting and procession at Coonoor, residents of
Muslims in that area assaulted Hindus resulting to injuries sustained  by  the
Hindus.   In  fact  P.W.13  Harihara Krishnan is the Secretary of Vishwa Hindu
Parishat from 1996 onwards.  Now, he is only a sympathizer of  Hindu  Munnani.
In fact, P.W.9 Varadharajan gave a complaint regarding that occurrence and the
same was registered in Crime No.  287/95 and Ex.P.15 is the copy of the F.I.R.
The complaint given by P.W.10 has been registered in Crime No.  288/95.  There
is no  dispute  regarding  these facts.  The learned counsel for the appellant
has also not disputed this aspect.  From the narration of events,  we  are  of
the opinion that the motive for occurrence is proved.
</p>
<p id="p_50">Point No.III:
</p><p id="p_51">        14.   It  is  true  that the deceased Anwar, resident of Moors Garden,
Coonoor, on 14.4.1995 at  about  9.45  a.m.    sustained  injuries  and  later
succumbed to  injuries.   Immediately after occurrence, the deceased Anwar was
taken to hospital for treatment in the jeep of witness Banalal and admitted in
the hospital and later he was, succumbed to injuries.  The  body  of  deceased
Anwar  was  examined  by  the  Postmortem Doctor, who opined that the deceased  
would appear to have died of Haemorrhage, shock and injury to  vital  organ  
Heart.  Postmortem  Doctor  was examined as P.W.16.  Ex.P.19 is the Postmortem   
Report.  P.W.21 has also conducted inquest on the body of the  deceased  Anwar 
on  15.4.1995  between  8.30 and 11.15 a.m in the presence of Panchayatdar and 
prepared Inquest Report.  Ex.P.31 is the Inquest Report in which it  is  found
that the deceased Anwar died due to injuries sustained by him in the incident.
There is  no  dispute  regarding  this  aspect.    There  was no confrontation
regarding this aspect on the defence side.  From the narration of  events,  we
have no hesitation to hold that the deceased Anwar died due to homicide.
</p>
<p id="p_52">Point No.IV:
</p><p id="p_53">        15.   Both  of them have sustained injuries in the occurrence and they
were admitted in the Government Hospital for treatment.  They were treated  by
P.W.15,  who  examined  them,  and  found  that they sustained injuries in the
manner alleged by them.  P.W.15 Doctor opined that the first injury  sustained
by  P.W.5  Sundar  is  grievous  in  nature and the second injury is simple in
nature.  He has further opined that the injuries sustained by Khadhar sha  are
simple in  nature.   The injured have specifically informed P.W.15 doctor that
they have sustained injury at the relevant point of time, date  and  place  in
the manner  as alleged by them.  P.W.5 Sundar, has specifically stated that he
has sustained injury at the relevant point of time in the said  assault.    He
further  admitted  that  he  took  treatment  in the Government Hospital after
occurrence.  The blood stained clothes of P.W.5  Sundar  has  been  marked  as
M.Os.  11 and 12.  He further stated that the shop of the deceased was damaged
in the  said incident.  The injuries sustained by Khadhar Sha was supported by
evidence of witnesses,  namely,  Maimoon  Bagum  and  Minor  Azaruddin.    The
injuries sustained by the said victims in the manner as alleged by them at the
relevant  point of time, date and place were not confronted on the side of the
appellant/accused.  From the narration of events, we  have  no  hesitation  to
hold that the said persons sustained injuries at the relevant point of time as
stated by prosecution.
</p><p id="p_54">Point No.V 
</p><p id="p_55">        16.   It is also the case of the prosecution that the accused Rajesh @
Anantharaman has also caused  injury  to  Khadhar  Sha,  shop  keeper  of  the
deceased Anwar.    Though  the  said  witness  is  not  alive  ,  the oral and
documentary evidence available on record would prove that the accused Rajesh @ 
Anantharaman has assaulted Khadhar Sha and caused simple injury.   Ex.P.17  is  
the wound  certificate.  P.W.15, doctor who examined Khadhar Sha has spoken to 
in detail about the injuries sustained by the said victim Khadhar Sha.  He has
also identified M.O.1 and stated that the injuries  sustained  by  the  victim
could have  been  caused  in the manner alleged by him.  From the narration of
events, we are of the opinion that the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman assaulted 
the victim Khadhar Sha and caused injury by M.O.1.
</p><p id="p_56">Point No:  VI
</p><p id="p_57">        17.  It is the specific case of the prosecution that the  accused  (1)
Rajesh  @  Anantharaman (appellant herein) (2) Balan and Varadharajan used the 
weapon of offence  namely  (1)  M.O.1  (2)  M.O.6  (3)  M.O.4  and  (4)  M.O.5
respectively  assaulted  the  deceased  Anwar  causing profuse bleeding injury
resulting to his death.  The prosecution relied on the  eye  witnesses  namely
Tmt.   Maimoon  Bagum, wife of the deceased Anwar and Azaruddin, brother's son 
of the deceased Khadhar Sha, shop boy of the deceased coupled with  postmortem  
report,  Serological  report, blood stained cloths and blood stained weapon of
offence to substantiate the guilty act of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_58">        18.  The point for consideration is whether the alleged eye  witnesses
can be  relied  on in this case.  All the three eye witnesses have stated that
they have seen the accused assaulting  the  deceased  Anwar  causing  bleeding
injuries  and  that the injured was taken to hospital wherein, he was declared
dead.  The blood stained cloth of the deceased namely lunghi, White  Polyester
full  shirt  were  marked  as  M.0.8 and M.O.7 and the same were subjected for
Serological test.  The blood stained cloth of the deceased contains "A"  group
origin.   The  blood  stained  cloth  of  the  accused  Rajesh  @ Anantharaman
(appellant herein) and Balan (accused No.  1 in S.C.No.  27 of 1996)  contains
"A" group origin.  Moreso, the blood stained cloth of the accused Varadharajan
( accused No.    2  S.C.No.  27 of 1996) contains human blood but the grouping
test could not be done.  Similarly, weapon of offence used by the said accused
were also subjected for Serological test.   Weapon  of  offence  used  by  the
accused Varadharajan  contains  human blood.  P.W.17 spoke in detail about the
Serological test.  According to the prosecution, blood stained  cloth  of  the
accused  and  also  material  objects  used for the commission of offence were
seized only in pursuance of their confession statement.    It  is  evident  on
record that the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman has assaulted the deceased Anwar    
with M.O.1,  on  his  chest causing severe damage to the heart.  Similarly the
accused Balan and Varadharajan assaulted the deceased Anwar with M.O.6 , M.O.4   
and M.O.5 respectively causing severe bleeding injuries.   Ex.P.19  postmortem
report contains   these   particulars.      Postmortem  doctor  namely  P.W.16
corroborates this part of evidence.  So much so, on 18.11.1995 at about  11.00
p.m., the accused Balan and Varadharajan were arrested at Barliar and recorded
their  statement in the presence of P.W.7 Gani and witness Sulaiman by P.W.21. 
They were apprehended by P.W.21, while they were riding  in  the  Motor  cycle
bearing Registration No.TN.37 F 2855 which is marked as M.O.20.  Key bunch and  
RC book of the said vehicle were also seized along with motorcycle.  They were
marked as  M.O.21  and  M.O.22.   They have also given confession statement in
presence of P.W.7 Gani and witness Sulaiman.  Exs.P.7 and 8 are the admissible 
portion of the confession statement of the  accused  Balan  and  Varadharajan.
Thereafter, the  accused  Balan and Varadharajan took P.  W.21 to the house of
the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman and identified him.  He was  apprehended  by   
P.W.21 and  recorded his statement.  Ex.P.1 1 is the admissible portion of the
confession statement of the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman (appellant herein). 
</p>
<p id="p_59">        19.  Thereafter, the  accused  have  taken  P.W.21  along  with  other
witness to stone quarry near Brindhavan School Road, and Ooty Road Junction at 
Coonoor  identified  the  places  and  took out their respective blood stained
cloths and weapon of offence and handed over the same  to  P.W.21  who  inturn
seized  the  same  in  the  presence  of P.W.7 Gani and witness Sulaiman under
Mahazar P.12, P.13 and P.14. 
</p>
<p id="p_60">        20.  Moreover, On  the  requisition  given  by  P.W.21,  P.W.14  after
following  all  formalities, conducted identification parade in respect of the
accused namely (1)Rajesh @  Anantharaman  (appellant  herein)  (2)  Balan  and
Varadharajan (accused No.    1   and  2  in  S.C.    No.    27  of  1996)  for
identification by the eye witnesses namely (1) P.W.1, Maimoon  Begam  wife  of
the deceased, (2) P.W.2 Azaruddin, brother's son of the deceased.  (3) Khadhar
Sha, shop boy of the deceased and (4) P.W.5 neighbour of the deceased.  Except 
P.W.5 Sundar, other witnesses have identified the accused and stated that they
are  responsible  for  assaulting  the deceased Anwar at the relevant point of
time, date and place in the manner as alleged by the prosecution.   Report  of
Identification parade  has  been  marked  as  Ex.P.26.   From the narration of
events, it is apparent that the accused  have  assaulted  the  deceased  Anwar
resulting, to his death.
</p>
<p id="p_61">        21.   The  learned  counsel  for the appellant by referring to various
discrepancies and contradiction in the deposition of prosecution witnesses and
contended that the alleged eye witness could not have been present at the time
of occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_62">        22.  Now, we have to find out  whether  there  is  any  truth  in  the
contention of  the  learned counsel for the appellant.  It is to be noted that
though the accused are strangers to the eye witnesses,  they  have  identified
the accused  at  the  time  of  identification  parade  except P.  W.5 Sundar.
Moreover,  the  vehicle  used  for  the  commission  of  offence  were  infact
identified by the witnesses since , they have noted the vehicle Number.
</p>
<p id="p_63">        23.   In  fact, the witness Azaruddin (Juvenile witness at the time of
occurrence  age 9) has taken note of the number of the  motor  cycle  on  the
sand wherein,  he  was  playing  at the time of occurrence.  The fact that the
said witness was playing in front of  the  shop  of  the  deceased  Anwar  was
supported  by the evidence of P.W.1 Maimoon Begum, wife of the deceased Anwar.  
This part of evidence has been elicited at the time of  cross  examination  of
P.W.2.  His evidence reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_64">"..  ..  ..   ,uz;L igf;Ffspd; ek;gh;fis ehd; kzypy; vGjp itj;njd;/ ..  ..  ..
"
</p>
<p id="p_65">Moreover, the accused namely Balan and  Varadharajan  were  apprehended  while  
they were riding motor cycle bearing No.  TN.37 F 2855, which was used for the
commission of offence.  The vehicle No.  TN37 F 2855 has been clearly referred
in the  complaint  Ex.P.1.    The  presence  of  witness Azaruddin and playing
infront of the shop of the deceased Anwar at the time of occurrence  has  been
referred in Ex.P1.  which reads as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_66">(Vernacular portion deleted)

</p><p id="p_67">        24.The specific submission of the learned counsel  for  the  appellant
that  since the accused are strangers to the witnesses and that the assailants
physical features have not been described properly in  the  First  Information
Report,  how  could  itbe possible for P.W.21 Inspector of Police to apprehend
the assailants concerned in this case.  It is to be  noted  that  the  vehicle
used  for  the commission of offence has been described in detail in the First


Information Report.  Moreover, the accused Balan and Varadharajan while riding
the said vehicle were apprehended by P.W.21 on identification of  the  vehicle
in presence of P.W.7 Gani and witness Sulaiman. 
</p>
<p id="p_68">        25.   Moreso, the accused Balan and Varadharajan took P.W.21 Inspector
to the house of the accused Rajesh  @  Anantharaman  and  identified  him  and
thereafter the  said  accused  was also apprehended by P.W.21.  From the above
discussion, we are of the view that the submission of the learned counsel  for
the appellant has to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_69">        26.  It is worthy to mention that the witnesses namely Maimoon Begum ,
Azaruddin  and  Khadhar  Sha  have  identified  the  accused  at  the  time of
identification parade.  Whereas, the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  /
accused  submitted  that  these witnesses were taken to the police station and
identified the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman, Balan and  Varadharajan  and  in 
consequent   of  that  they  have  identified  the  accused  at  the  time  of
identification parade and as such the report of identification parade  has  to
be rejected.    Such  submission  of  the  learned counsel for the appellant /
accused has no force, in view of the fact that the  accused  at  the  time  of
remand  have not stated anything about the presence of witnesses in the police
station to note down their physical feature, to facilitate to identify them at
the time of identification parade.  The accused  were  remanded  on  19.4.1995
till 03.5 .1996 by coonoor magistrate and the same reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_70">        "Accused produced at  1.00 p.m.  No complaints.  Remanded up to 3.5.19
96"
</p>
<p id="p_71">        27.  Moreso, the suggestive case of the  accused  that  the  witnesses
were  taken  to  police  station  wherein,  they  have  taken note of physical
features of the accused was infact denied by them.
</p>
<p id="p_72">        28.  The learned counsel for the appellant further contended that  the
blood  group  of  the accused was not identified and as such it is not safe to
rely on the serological report to tag  the  accused  with  the  commission  of
offence and  render  finding  against  them.  In this case, the witnesses have
identified the assailants.  Moreso, the vehicle used  for  the  commission  of
offence was  also  identified  by the witnesses.  Apart from that, the accused
Balan and Varadharajan were apprehended by P.W.21 in  the  presence  of  P.W.7  
Gani  and witness Sulaiman while they were riding on M.O.20 which was used for
the commission of offence.  Apart from that, the weapon of  offence  used  for
the commission  of  offence  contains  human blood.  Moreso, the blood stained
cloth of the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman and the accused Balan also  contain  
blood of  "A"  origin.    Because  of  the  overwhel ming evidence against the
accused for having participated in the commission of offence, we  are  of  the
view  that  the  contention of the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be
accepted. 
</p>
<p id="p_73">        29.  It is worthy to note that P.W.7, being the eye witness for arrest
of the accused and seizure of weapon of offence along with their blood stained
cloth has spoken in detail in support of  the  prosecution  theory.    Nothing
worthy elicited at the time of cross examination to discredit this witness.
</p>
<p id="p_74">        30.   It  is  also elicited at the time of cross examination of P.W.21
that except P.W.7 Gani and one Sulaiman, no one present at the time of  arrest
of the  accused  namely Balan and Varadharajan.  The evidence of P.W.21 at the
time of cross examination reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_75">(Vernacular portion deleted)

</p><p id="p_76">        31.   In  such  circumstances, no one can attribute any motive against
the P.W.21 for taking P.W.7 as eye witness for the arrest of the  accused  and
seizure of M.Os.  The lower court has also accepted the prosecution theory and
rightly convicted the accused for the offence referred in the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_77">        32.   Moreso,  the defence theory is that the accused were apprehended
on 14.4.1995 at about 10.30 p.m.  by the Deputy Superintendent of  Police  and
that they were identified by the witnesses at the police station to facilitate
the  witnesses  to  identify  them at the time of identification parade and as
such, the report of the identification parade has no legal value.  It is to be
noted that the alleged offence took place at  about  9.30  p.m  on  14.4.1995.
Complaint  was  lodged  at about 10.45 pm and investigating officer commen ced
investigating at 00.01 hours on 15.4.1995.    In  such  circumstances,  it  is
highly  doubtful whether the appellant/ accused were really apprehended by the
police on 14 .4.1995 at about 10.30 p.m.  itself  as  alleged  by  them.    It
cannot  be  believed  and  therefore, the defence theory has to be rejected in
this context.
</p>
<p id="p_78">        33.  The learned counsel for the appellant/accused submitted that  the
deceased ought to have sustained injuries at the time of communal clash, which
took  place on 14.4.1995 between Muslims on one side and Vishwa Hindu Parishat  
on the other side and that the accused were apprehended in  mistaken  identity
and as such the prosecution theory has to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_79">34.   It is to be noted that the communal clash between the Muslims and Hindus
took place on 14.4.1995 at Coonoor.  Prosecution examined P.W.6  Anbazhagan  ,  
P.W.8  A.K.S  Babu,  P.W.9  Varadharajan,  P.W.10  Ramesh and P.W.13 Hari Hara    
Kirshnan to prove the earlier incident of communal clash  between  Hindus  and
Muslims in the public place at Coonoor.
</p><p id="p_80">        35.   The  case  on hand happened at about 9.30 p.m at the shop of the
deceased Anwar.  It is not the suggestive case of the  accused/  appellant  to
any  one  of  the  eye  witnesses  that  the  deceased  and other injured have
sustained injuries during the time of communal clash between  the  Hindus  and
Muslims which  took place on 14.4.1995 at Coonoor.  The alleged communal clash  
not happened in the shop of the  deceased.    Both  incidents  took  place  at
different point of time, at different places.  The first occurrence took place
in the public place.  The persons sustained injury in the communal clash which
took  place  on the same day at Coonoor, have given complaint to the concerned
police station.  and FIR was also registered against the assailant.  The  case
on hand  is  happened  much later at 9.30 p.m.  in the shop of the deceased on
the very same day.
</p>
<p id="p_81">        36.  So, we are unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel
for the appellant / accused that the  deceased  and  other  injured  sustained
injuries only at the time of communal clash between Hindus and Muslims.
</p>
<p id="p_82">        37.   It  is  borne  out by record that the appellants namely Rajesh @
Anantharaman (appellant herein) Balan and Varadharajan (appellants in  S.C.No.
27  of  1996)  were  in possession of deadly weapon namely Aruval and Iron rod
causing injuries on the deceased.  In fact, the  weapon  of  offence  used  by
Balan and Varadharajan were kept in the motorcycle of the first accused Rajesh
@ Anantharaman.   So much so, the accused Balan and Varadharajan took the said   
weapon of offence from the vehicle of the first accused and entered in to  the
house of  the  deceased and attacked him.  The manner of attack by the accused
at the shop of the deceased exposes their pre-planned attack.  In this context
also, we are of the view that the act of the accused  Rajesh  @  Anantharaman,
Balan  and  Varadharajan  amply  prove  the  motive  aspect  submitted  by the
prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_83">        38.  The learned counsel for the appellant / accused further submitted
that the injured person namely Khadhar Sha who set the law  in  to  motion  by
giving  complaint,  Ex.P1  was  not  examined  to prove the genuineness of the
Ex.P.1 since, he is dead and as such there is no  legal  bearing  for  Ex.P.1.
The  learned  counsel for the appellant / accused referred the principles laid
down in the following cases in support of his contention.
</p><p id="p_84">1.  EMPEROR v.  PERIA CHELLIAH NADAR (1942 M W N CR.  59)

Otherwise it cannot be said to be a substantive evidence.  The mere marking of
Ex.P.1  though P.W.2 Village Administrative Officer who recorded the statement
cannot have any probative value in as much as the said Uruma Naicker who  gave
the statement Ex.P1.    has not been examined.  As such Ex.P1 and the evidence 
of P.W.2 are not useful to the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_86">        39.  We have carefully gone through the principles laid  down  in  the
said ruling.    Material  aspect referred in Ex.P.1 have been corroborated not
only by the oral evidence of other eye witnesses but also by  the  documentary
evidence  coupled  with  the  report  of identification parade and serological
report.  In such circumstances, we are of the view that the said  rulings  are
not in any way affect the prosecution case in relying on Ex.P.1.
</p>
<p id="p_87">        40.   The  learned counsel for the appellant/accused further submitted
that since the alleged eye witnesses have taken note of the physical  features
of the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman (appellant herein) Balan and Varadharajan  
(appellants  in S.C.No.27 of 2006) at the police station before taking part in
the identification parade conducted by P.W.14 , Magistrate, the identification
report looses its credibility.  He also relied on certain  passages  contained
in the following rulings in support of his contention.

unacceptable nor wholly impeccable.  There were certain features in this  case
which  should put the Court on its guard not to rely on his bare word, without
some assurance from independent sources.  As there was no independent evidence   
on the record to confirm the oral testimony of the witness in  regard  to  the
identity  and connection of the appellant with the murder, the Court would, as
a matter of abundant  caution,  refrain  from  accepting  the  uncorroborated,
infirm testimony of the witness, and accord the appellant the benefit of doubt
and acquit him.  ..  ..  .."
</p>
<p id="p_90">        41.   In  this case, the accused Rajesh @ Ananatharaman was identified
by the other accused resulting to his arrest by P.W.21  Inspector  of  Police.
The  vehicle  used  for  the  commission  of  offence with registration number
referred in the complaint itself leads to  the  apprehension  of  the  accused
Balan and  Varadharajan by P.W.21 Inspector of Police.  Moreover, the juvenile
witnesses Azaruddin has seen the assailant coming to the scene  of  occurrence
with  the  vehicle concerned in this case and had make a note of the number of
the vehicle over the sand in which he was playing.  P.Ws 1, Maimoon Begum  and 
P.W.2,  Azaruddin  are  none  other  than  the  wife  and brother's son of the
deceased.  They were very much present at the time of occurrence.  Apart  from
that,  weapon of offence used in the commission of offence were recovered only
in pursuance of the statement made by the appellant/ accused.  So  we  are  of
the  view  that  the  decision  relied  on  by  the  learned  counsel  for the
appellant/accused in support of this contention is not applicable to the facts
on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_91">        42.  The learned counsel for the appellant / accused further contended
that it is not safe to rely  on  the  testimony  of  juvenile  witness  namely
Azaruddin,  as his statement is inconsistent to the other part of the evidence
of the prosecution.  He also relied  on  certain  passages  in  the  following
ruling in support of this contention.
</p><p id="p_92">1.<a href="/doc/225119/" id="a_18">PANCHHI v.  STATE OF U.P</a>.1998 (7) SCC 177

        "..  ..  ..    4O.    From  the evidence available on recordk it is no
doubt true that the preliminary questions were not put to this witness P.   W.
</p><p id="p_94">2.   But  it  is pertinent to note that on the date of examination his age was
shown as 16 years.  The credibility of this witness cannot be  discredited  on
the  ground  on  non putting preliminary questions to test whether the witness
was capable of giving rational answers or not?  In the considered  opinion  of
this  Court,  this  will  not alter the situation in any way especially in the
light of the age of this witness.  It is needless to say that it is not a case
of a child witness of a tender age  but  a  grown  up  boy  having  sufficient
understanding.   The  hostility towards the prosecution version shown by P.W.1
definitely may have to be viewed in the light of the background  of  the  case
also.
</p>
<p id="p_95">        43.  It is to be noted that the juvenile witness was examined as P.W.2
in this case.    His presence has been referred in EX.P1.  The fact that P.W.2
was playing at the time of occurrence has been referred in Ex.P.1.    Further,
the  presence of P.W.2, at the time of occurrence was also spoken to by P.W.1.
More so, P.W.2 having  seen  the  arrival  of  motorcycles,  at  the  seen  of
occurrence, immediately, he made a note of the vehicle Number over the sand on
which he  was  playing.  The credibility of this witness was not shaken at the
time of cross examination.  The narration of events by P.W.2  is  corroborated
by the  other  witnesses.   In such circumstances, we are of the view that the
contention of the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_96">        44.  The learned counsel for the appellant/ accused further  contended
that  the  blood  group of the accused was not tested to bring home the guilty
act of the accused and as such serological report filed in this case cannot be
relied on .  The learned counsel for the appellant / accused further relied on
the certain passages in the following rulings in support of this contention.
</p>
<p id="p_97">1.<a href="/doc/1577363/" id="a_20">V.VIJAYAKUMAR v.  STATE OF KERALA</a> (2000 (2) L.W.  Crl.  485)

that of his guilt  Presence of human blood in the guard room and presence  of

found to  be  a  potent  and  capable  person.    Presence  of  semen stain or

is no evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question.  So also the
discovery  of  Group  B  bloodstain  on  the underwear cannot be treated as an
incriminating piece of evidence against the accused connecting  him  with  the
crime  because there is no evidence that the underwear belonged to the accused
and further the possibility of the underwear bein stained with  the  blood  of
the  person  to  whom it belonged, or the accused if he was wearing it has not
been ruled out.  ..  ..  .."
</p>
<p id="p_99">        44.  It is to be noted that the accused were  identified  by  the  eye
witnesses.   The  material  objects  used  for  the commission of offence were
recovered, in pursuance of the confession statement of the accused  by  P.W.21
Inspector of Police.  Moreover, blood stained cloth of the appellant / accused
Rajesh  @ Anantharaman(appellant herein) Balan and Varadharajan (appellants in 
S.C.No.27 of 2006) were also seized and marked in this case.  So much  so  the
accused  Balan  and  Varadharajan were apprehended by P.W.21 while riding M.O.  
20, in pursuance of the identity of the vehicle referred in Ex.P.1.  Rajesh  @
Anantharaman  was apprehended by P.W.21 Inspector on the information furnished  
by the accused /Appellants Balan and Varadharajan ( appellants in S.C.No.   27
of 2006).       <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_22">Section   27</a>  of  the  Indian  Evidence  Act  relates  to  the
information received from the accused facilitating the  investigating  officer
discovering some  fact  concerned  in the commission of offence.  That means a
fact discovered in an information supplied by the accused  in  his  disclosure
statement  is  a  relevant  fact  and  that  is only admissible in evidence if
something new is discovered or recovered from the accused which was not within
the knowledge of the police before recording the disclosure statement  of  the
accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_100">        45.   The  above  proposition  is  laid  down in the decision in <a href="/doc/44098773/" id="a_23">KAMAL
KISHORE v.  STATE (DELHI ADMINISTRATION</a>) (1997) 2 CRIMES 169 (Del).   In  this     
case,  the  identity  of the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman ( appellant herein)
was within the knowledge of other accused and on information supplied  by  the
accused namely Balan and Varadharajan lead to the identification and arrest of
the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman.  This part of evidence is admissible as per
<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_24">Section 27</a>  of  the  Indian  Evidence  Act.    There cannot be any contra view
regarding this aspect.  Information furnished by  the  said  accused  for  the

27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.
</p><p id="p_101">        46.  In such circumstances, we are of the view that the submission  of
the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant / accused coupled with the decision
cited by him are not applicable to the facts on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_102">        47.  The learned counsel for the appellant/accused further  relied  on
the principles enunciated in the decision <a href="/doc/1296255/" id="a_26">VIRSA SINGH v.  STATE OF PUNJAB</a> (AIR   
1958  SC 465) and submitted that the prosecution failed to prove the intention
of the accused to murder of the deceased Anwar at the relevant point of  time.
The  fact  that  all  the accused came together at the relevant point of time,
date and place with the possession of deadly weapon  namely  Aruval  and  Iron
rod, entering the shop of the deceased after identification assaulting him and
thereafter  assaulting the shop boy who came there to prevent further assault,
would prove that the accused have assaulted the deceased only with a  view  to
murder him.    The principles laid down in the said ruling which squarely meet
the requirement to bring home the guilty act of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_103">        48.  The learned counsel for the accused further submitted that motive
and  recovery  of  the  blood  stained  cloths  of  the  accused  were  wholly
insufficient to sustain the charge of murder.  He also relied on the following
rulings in support of this contention.
</p>
<p id="p_104"><a href="/doc/1866055/" id="a_27">NARSINBHAI v.  CHHATRASINH</a> (AIR 1977 SC 1753)       
        "..  ..   ..  2.We are prepared to assume in favour of the prosecution
that the evidence in regard to the incident of the 23rd near the pond and  the
evidence  in  regard  to the incident which took place near the Ota of the Pir
shows that the respondents had some motive for committing the crime.   We  may 
also  accept that blood-stained shirt and dhoti were seized from the person of
respondent 1 and dharias were seized from the houses of respondents 1  and  3.
But  these circumstances are in our opinion wholly insufficient for sustaining
the charge of murder of which the respondents are accused.  ..  ..  ..  "
</p>
<p id="p_105">        49.  The said case is based on the circumstantial evidence only.   But
the case on hand is totally different.  Eye witnesses examined to identify the
assailant.  Apart from the material objects used for the commission of offence
were  also  seized  in  pursuance  of the confession statement of the accused.
Moreso, the vehicle used for the commission of offence  were  also  seized  in
this case.    In  fact  the  vehicle  used  for  the commission of offence was
mentioned in the F.I.R.  itself.  In this context, we are of the view that the
said ruling is not applicable to the facts on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_106">        50.  The learned counsel for the appellant / accused further contended
that there is conflict between the oral testimony and  medical  evidence  with
regard  to  the dimension and shape of the injuries found on the victim, while
comparing the size of the weapon used for the commission of offence, it is not
safe to convict the accused/appellant.    He  also  relied  on  the  following
decisions in support of this contention.
</p><p id="p_107"><a href="/doc/1529839/" id="a_28">THAMAN KUMAR v.  STATE OF UNIION TERRITORY OF CHANDIGARH</a> (2003 (7) SBR 175)               
        "...   The conflict between oral testimony and medical evidence can be
of varied dimensions and shapes.  There may be a case  where  there  is  total
absence of  injuries  which are normally caused by a particular weapon.  There
is another category where though the injuries found on the victim are  of  the
type  which  are possible by the weapon of assault, but the size and dimension
of the injuries do not exactly tally  with  the  size  and  dimension  of  the
weapon.   The third category can be where the injuries found on the victim are
such which are normally caused by the weapon of assault but they are not found
on that portion of the body where they are deposed to have been caused by  the
eyewitnesses.   The  same  kind  of  inference  cannot  be  drawn in the three
categories of apparent conflict in oral and medical evidence enumerated above.
In the first category it may legitimately be inferred that the  oral  evidence
regarding  assault  having been made from a particular weapon is not truthful.
However, in the second and third category no such inference can straightway be
drawn.  The manner and method of assault, the  position  of  the  victim,  the
resistance  offered  by him, the opportunity available to the witnesses to see
the occurrence like their distance, presence of light and many  other  similar
factors will have to be taken into consideration in judging the reliability of
ocular testimony.  .."
</p>
<p id="p_108">        51.   The  deceased  Anwar sustained 21 injuries and the same has been
clearly mentioned in the postmortem  report.    P.W.16  being  the  postmortem
doctor has  given  evidence  in  support  of  his report Ex.P.19.  He has also
explained in details about the measurements of the  injuries.    He  has  also
identified  the weapon of offence and stated that the injuries would have been
caused by them.  He further opined that the deceased would appear to have died
of Haemorrhage, shock and injury to vital  organ    Heart.    Nothing  worthy
elicited at the time of cross examination to discredit the evidence of P.W.16.
Moreover,  the  eye  witness  have  also  stated that the assailants have used
deadly weapons and caused injures.  So we are of the view that the  contention
of the learned counsel for the appellant/accused cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_109">        52.   The  learned counsel for the appellant/accused further submitted
that even according  to  the  prosecution,  all  the  accused  have  inflicted
injuries on  the  deceased  causing  bleed  injury resulting to his death.  He
further contended that the the appellants namely Balan and Varadharajan though
as per the prosecution inflicted injuries by  the  deadly  weapon,  the  trial
Court  acquitted  them  under  <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_29">Section  302</a>  IPC and convicted them only under
<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_30">Section 324</a> IPC and as such, the conviction of the appellant under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_31">Section 302</a>
IPC cannot be sustained.
</p><p id="p_110">        53.  The learned counsel for the appellant  relied  on  the  following
rulings in support of this contention.
</p><p id="p_111">1997 (2) L.W.  (Crl.) 618
        " ...The  sole  convict  can  be convicted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_32">Section 302</a> I.P.C.  (
simpliciter) only on proof of the fact that  his  individual  act  caused  the
death of  the  victim.   To put it differently, he would be liable for his own
act only.  In the instant case, the evidence of the record does not prove that
the injuries inflicted by  the  appellant  alone  caused  the  death;  on  the
contrary  the evidence of the eye witnesses and the evidence of the doctor who
held the postmortem examination indicate that the deceased sustained  injuries
by other  weapons also and his death was the outcome of all the injuries.  The
appellant, therefore, would be guilty of the offence under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_33">Section 326</a>  I.P.c.
as  he  caused  grievous  injury  to the deceased with the aid jambia (a sharp
cutting instrument)..."
</p><p id="p_112">AIR 1998 SC 2883  
        " ...We have also gone through the evidence of P.Ws 3  and  4.    From
their  evidence  it  is  not  possible to say which fatal injury was caused by
which accused.  The two witnesses have specifically referred to only  about  8
to  10  injuries  whereas  on the person of Ram Bharose as many as 51 injuries
were found.  As it was not possible to hold who had caused the fatal injury to
the deceased, the High Court rightly convicted them under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_34">Section  326</a>  I.P.C.
.."
</p>

<p id="p_113">        54.   It is proved by the oral and medical evidence that the appellant
herein has caused fatal injury on the vital organ namely heart of the deceased
resulting to his death.  Medical report  would  show  that  the  deceased  has
sustained injury  to  his heart.  Eye witnesses have stated that the appellant
alone inflicted injury on the chest of the deceased.
</p><p id="p_114">        55.  More so, the motive aspect  has  been  proved  beyond  reasonable
doubt in  this  case.   The conduct of the accused in identifying the house of
the deceased reaching the scene of occurrence by vehicles and  assaulting  the
deceased  with  deadly  weapons  would also prove their pre-planned act on the
deceased.  In fact, the trial Court in S.C.  No.27/96  has  not  rendered  any
specific  findings,  for  acquitting  the accused Balan and Varadharajan under
<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_35">Section 302</a> IPC after diluting the offence into one under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_36">Section 324</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_115">        56.  The plain reading of the finding  rendered  at  para  44  in  the
Judgment  would  reveal  that  the  trial  Court  has  not  applied  its  mind
independently while coming to  the  conclusion  that  the  accused  Balan  and
Varadharajan  have  really  committed the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_37">Section 324</a>
only.  Further principle of transfer malice has also  taken  note  of  by  the
trial court.  There is overwhelming evidence to show that all the accused came
to the  scene  of occurrence with a plan to murder the deceased Anwar.  So, we
are of the view that,  after  accepting  the  prosecution  case  totally,  the
finding  of  the  lower court in convicting the accused Balan and Varadharajan
under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_38">Section 324</a> IPC alone is based on the extraneous circumstances only.  In
this context, we are of the view that the submission of the  counsel  for  the
appellants based on the said rulings is not applicable to the facts on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_116">                57.   While  summing  up  the case, we are anguish to find out
that though the trial Court in S.C.  No.27 of 1996 have accepted the  case  of
the  prosecution in toto, diluted the offence of <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_39">Section 302</a> IPC and convicted
the accused Balan and Varadharajan  of  <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_40">Section  324</a>  IPC  only,  without  the
support  of the medical evidence inspite of knowing the fact of causing injury
by the deadly weapon M.Os 4,5 and 6, on the basis of  the  submission  of  the
learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  that  the  fact  as  such would attract
punishment under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_41">section  324</a>  only,  resulting  to  miscarriage  of  justice,
detrimental  to  public  interest  as  the  case  on  hand is one arose out of
communal clash between Hindus and Muslims.  Since there is no  appeal  against 
such  finding,  we  do not want to probe further after a lapse of 10 years and
leave the matter as it is.
</p>
<p id="p_117">                58.  In view of the detailed discussion , we are of  the  view
that  the  finding of the lower Court in convicting and sentencing the accused
under  the  various  offences  referred  in  judgment  does  not  require  any
interference and the same is hereby confirmed.
