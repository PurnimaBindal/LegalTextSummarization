CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ADITYA KUMAR TRIVEDI
CAV JUDGMENT
Date: 10-01-2014

                       Petitioner/informant has challenged the judgment

   dated 28.01.2003 passed by Additional Sessions Judge, FTC-1,

   Samastipur in Sessions Trial No. 347/1997/190/2000 whereby and

   whereunder the O.Ps No. 2 to 8 have been acquitted.

</p><p id="p_12">                       2. It has been submitted on behalf of petitioner that

   the judgment of acquittal recorded by the learned lower court happens

   to be based upon wrong and flimsy grounds. It has also been

   submitted that altogether eight PWs have been examined out of whom

   PW-7 is the doctor who had conducted postmortem over the dead

   body of Sunil (deceased). From his evidence as well as from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            2</span>




postmortem report, it is evident that deceased Sunil had sustained

ante-mortem fire arm injury and that was found the cause of death.

Therefore, the version of the prosecution with regard to murder of

Sunil by means of fire-arm is fully proved. However, the learned

lower court wrongly and illegally took the aforesaid evidence contrary

to the prosecution case in the background of presence of semi digested

food in the stomach of deceased as well as having the location of fire-

arm injury towards downward direction which the doctor had deposed

on cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_13">          3.   PW-8 is the another doctor who had examined the

informant Dev Narain Mahto on 21.03.1996 at about 8.30 a.m. and

found injuries over his person caused by hard and blunt substance

which sufficiently proved the nature of assault made by one of the

O.P.s Shiv Shankar Mahto by butt of rifle over head of informant.

There happens to be no adverse evidence brought through by way of

cross-examination. However, did not find consideration by the learned

lower court. Now coming to the evidence of material witnesses, two

fold arguments have been made. The first one that from the FIR itself,

it is evident that Nawal Kishore Mahto, PW-2, Thakur Prasad Singh,

PW-4 and Anil Kumar son of informant examined as PW-1 are the

FIR named witnesses. They have supported the prosecution case in its

entirety. Therefore, taking into account their status being FIR named
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>




witnesses as well as on account of having absence of contradiction,

development, embellishment in their evidence is suggestive of the fact

that they are truthful, creditworthy witnesses and on account thereof,

their evidence should not have been brushed aside on superficial

grounds. It has also been submitted that even discarding their

evidence for a moment PW-5, Dev Narain Mahto (informant) had

deposed and supported the prosecution case in toto without having

any sort of exaggeration. Therefore, the prosecution case is found

fully supported thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             4.   The learned lower court while dealing with the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses failed to consider that they were

consistent with regard to genesis as well as manner of occurrence and

they have also shown themselves conclusively being an eyewitness to

the occurrence. The defence during cross-examination of each and

every individual witness had failed to demolish their evidence and as

such, the learned lower court should have accepted their evidence in

their entirety. Being interested witness is not a ground to discredit

their evidence. Whatever caution has been prescribed is to the extent

of minute observation of the evidence. Apart from this "falsus in uno

falsus in omnibus" is not at all a sound principle so recognized and as

such even discarding the irrelevant portion of the evidence of each of

the PWs, the learned lower court should have held that prosecution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             4</span>




witnesses remained firm and intact over genesis as well as manner of

occurrence. From the judgment of the learned lower court, it is

apparent that evidence of all the witnesses have not been considered

and dealt with under the garb of aforesaid settled principle. It has

further been submitted that the case of the prosecution has been

disbelieved mainly on the ground that there is over-writing on the

relevant parts in the Fardbeyan which suggests that there is

interpolation in the timing of recording of Fardbeyan as well as timing

of occurrence. In this connection, it has been submitted that when the

evidence is taken together with the evidence of PW-7, it is apparent

that there is no discrepancy. Moreover, the witnesses are consistent

over the time. While examining PW-6, the I.O. he has also disowned

the same. Therefore, there was no cogent and sufficient reason before

the learned trial court which could have discredited the evidence of

the PWs on that very score. In sum and substance, it has been

submitted that the judgment of acquittal rendered by the learned lower

court is contrary to the evidence available on the record as well as

learned lower court had committed grave error during course of

consideration of the evidence. As such, the same is fit to be set aside.

</p><p id="p_15">              5.   Counter meeting with the submissions raised on

behalf of the petitioner, it has been submitted on behalf of O.P. No.2

to 8 that there is presumption of innocence of accused as per criminal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            5</span>




jurisprudence till he is convicted by the competent court. Also, it is

further found fortified when there is judgment of acquittal. Therefore,

unless and until there is perversity while deciding the issue, the

judgment of acquittal should not be interfered with during course of

revisional jurisdiction moreso, at the instance of private party. It has

also been submitted that when two views are possible one leaning in

favour of accused then that view is to be honoured. The learned lower

court had accepted and honoured the view leaning in favour of

O.P.No.2 to 8 by way of acquitting them, as such, the aforesaid

finding under the score of revisional jurisdiction should not be

interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_16">          6.   It has further been submitted that the exercise of

revisional jurisdiction at the instance of an individual/private party

against the judgment of acquittal has been deprecated, moreover,

when the State had not chosen to challenge the judgment of acquittal

by way of filing an appeal. The caution so prescribed while

considering the revision petition at the instance of private party has

been led by the Hon'ble Apex Court times without number and the

basic feature of the aforesaid conclusive finding happens to be that in

normal phenomena, in routine manner such exercise should not be

taken up. Certain criteria have been prescribed whereunder

interference is found to be permissible. The aforesaid criteria are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            6</span>




found centralized with basic point that in case there is gross error,

procedural lapses at the part of learned lower court while recording

judgment of acquittal, then only such adventure is permissible.

</p><p id="p_17">          7.   Now coming to the facts of the case, it has been

submitted that presence of over-writing in the Fardbeyan at all

relevant places has got a bearing. The prosecution has come up with a

definite case that occurrence had taken place at 6.30 a.m. so that the

prosecution    witnesses   including   the   informant   would    claim

themselves as an eyewitness to occurrence but that is not the fact. The

informant as well as the deceased might have been assaulted in the

preceding night itself at some difference place in different manner for

which there was no eyewitness nor the informant was able to identify

the assailant. The informant had already put his presence at the police

station at early hour. From the Fardbeyan, it is evident that the

occurrence so alleged happens to be of 2.30 a.m. and then thereafter

interpolation has been made by way of over-writing to suggest that it

had taken place at 6.30 a.m. In likewise manner, there is over-writing

at the timing at which hour the Fardbeyan was recorded. That means

to say the timing of occurrence as well as timing of recording of

Fardbeyan both have been shifted and changed with an ulterior motive

to implicate the O.P. No.2 to 8 in the background of the fact that both

the parties are on constrained relationship in the background of land
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7</span>




dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_18">           8. It has also been submitted that the Doctor, PW-7 had

conducted postmortem over the dead body of Sunil on 22.03.1996 at

about 11:00 a.m and had opined the time elapsed since death as 36

hours which covers the original timing of 2.30 a.m. so disclosed by

the informant himself.
</p>
<p id="p_19">           9. Then it has been submitted that PW-6, the I.O. had not

found a drop of blood at the place where dead body of deceased was

found. After going through the evidence of PWs, more particularly,

PW-1 it is evident that after sustaining gun shot injury, the deceased

fell down and copious blood came out from the injury which must

have been found by the I.O. while inspecting place of occurrence had

there been the place of occurrence same as suggested by prosecution.

Non presence of blood is another circumstance which falsifies the

case of the prosecution as suggested during course of trial.

</p><p id="p_20">           10.   It has also been submitted that presence of semi

digested food is of no consequence in ordinary course of nature but it

has got relevancy so far present case is concerned. Although neither

the prosecution has deposed the time of meal nor the O.P. Nos. 2 to 8

extracted during course of cross-examination, the time of meal, kind

of food taken by deceased but the fact remains that had the deceased

died at 6.30 a.m., semi digested food would not have found its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             8</span>




presence instead thereof complete digested food would have been

found. Therefore, presence of semi digested food is suggestive of the

fact that the deceased might have been murdered near about 2.30 a.m.

which happens to be earlier prosecution version and so happens to be

the cause for disbelieving the prosecution version by the learned

lower court.
</p>
<p id="p_21">          11. It has also been submitted that from the evidence of the

PWs it is crystal clear that they have got bondage of relationship so

much so that they are also involved in a murder case jointly. Not only

this, from the evidence of PW-5, the informant, apart from visualizing

dubious character, being an accused in so many kinds of heinous

offences are also admitted. That means to say, the criminal

background of the family of prosecution party is another circumstance

which suggest as well as probabilizes the manner of death of deceased

at different place in different manner.
</p>
<p id="p_22">          12.     The aforesaid factual aspect is found further

strengthened after considering the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses that at the time of death the deceased was fully dressed

which usually the persons in the countryside are not often. Therefore,

the cumulative effect of the aforesaid event does suggest that the

prosecution has not come with the clean hand relating to the genesis

as well as manner of occurrence rather taking an advantageous
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                            9</span>




position got the O.P. No.2 to 8 involved in this case after having

murder of the deceased at some different location in some different

manner. It has further been submitted that when the evidence of PWs

are taken up conjointly, each of them are found inconsistent with each

other and on account thereof, demolishes the veracity of the evidence

of the PWs. Therefore, the judgment impugned does not require

interference.
</p>
<p id="p_23">          13.   The learned APP fairly submitted that having the

judgment of acquittal, virtually, blurred the interest of the prosecution

even having revision at the instance of private party.

</p><p id="p_24">          14. On several occasion, the court faced with issue and

illuminated it by laying down definite proposition of law. <a href="/doc/113075316/" id="a_1">In

Venkatesan v. Rani and others</a> reported in AIR 2013 SC 3320, the

Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down guidelines for adjudicating upon

revision against acquittal. The relevant para is quoted below :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                        "6. To answer the questions that have arisen in
                 the present case, as noticed at the very outset, the
                 extent and ambit of the revisional jurisdiction of the
                 High Court, particularly in the context of exercise
                 thereof in respect of a judgment of acquittal, may be
                 briefly noticed. The law in this regard is well settled
                 by a catena of decisions of this Court. Illustratively,
                 as also chronologically, the decisions rendered in

                 referred to. Specifically and for the purpose of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">           10</span>




detailed illumination on the subject the contents of
paras 8 and 10 of the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/512594/" id="a_6">Akalu
Ahir v. Ramdeo Ram</a> (supra) may be usefully
extracted below.
</p><p id="p_27">         "8. This Court, however, by way of
illustration, indicated the following categories of
cases which would justify the High Court in
interfering with a finding of acquittal in revision:
</p><p id="p_28">        (i) Where the trial court has no jurisdiction to
try the case, but has still acquitted the accused;
</p><p id="p_29">        (ii) Where the trial court has wrongly shut out
evidence which the prosecution wished to produce;
</p><p id="p_30">        (iii) Where the appellate court has wrongly
held the evidence which was admitted by the trial
court to be inadmissible;
</p><p id="p_31">        (iv) Where the material evidence has been
overlooked only (either) by the trial court or by the
appellate court; and
</p><p id="p_32">        (v) Where the acquittal is based on the
compounding of the offence which is invalid under
the law.
</p><p id="p_33">        These categories were, however, merely
illustrative and it was clarified that other cases of
similar nature can also be properly held to be of
exceptional nature where the High Court can
justifiably interfere with the order of acquittal."
</p><p id="p_34">        "10. No doubt, the appraisal of evidence by the
trial Judge in the case in hand is not perfect or free
from flaw and a Court of appeal may well have felt
justified in disagreeing with its conclusion, but from
this it does not follow that on revision by a private
complainant, the High Court is entitled to re-appraise
the evidence for itself as if it is acting as a Court of
appeal and then order a re-trial. It is unfortunate that
a serious offence inspired by rivalry and jealousy in
the matter of election to the office of village Mukhia,
should go unpunished. But that can scarcely be a
valid ground for ignoring or for not strictly following
the law as enunciated by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      The observations in para 9 in the case of <a href="/doc/1012887/" id="a_7">Vimal
Singh v. Khuman Singh</a>[6] would also be apt for
recapitulation and, therefore, are being extracted
below.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">           11</span><p id="p_36">




</p><p id="p_37">       "9. Coming to the ambit of power of the High
Court under Section 401 of the Code, the High Court
in its revisional power does not ordinarily interfere
with judgments of acquittal passed by the trial court
unless there has been manifest error of law or
procedure. The interference with the order of
acquittal passed by the trial court is limited only to
exceptional cases when it is found that the order
under revision suffers from glaring illegality or has
caused miscarriage of justice or when it is found that
the trial court has no jurisdiction to try the case or
where the trial court has illegally shut out the
evidence which otherwise ought to have been
considered or where the material evidence which
clinches the issue has been overlooked. These are the
instances where the High Court would be justified in
interfering with the order of acquittal. Sub-section (3)
of Section 401 mandates that the High Court shall not
convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.
Thus, the High Court would not be justified in
substituting an order of acquittal into one of
conviction even if it is convinced that the accused
deserves conviction. No doubt, the High Court in
exercise of its revisional power can set aside an order
of acquittal if it comes within the ambit of
exceptional cases enumerated above, but it cannot
convert an order of acquittal into an order of
conviction. The only course left to the High Court in
such exceptional cases is to order retrial."
</p><p id="p_38">        7. The above consideration would go to show
that the revisional jurisdiction of the High Courts
while examining an order of acquittal is extremely
narrow and ought to be exercised only in cases where
the Trial Court had committed a manifest error of law
or procedure or had overlooked and ignored relevant
and material evidence thereby causing miscarriage of
justice. Re-appreciation of evidence is an exercise
that the High Court must refrain from while
examining an order of acquittal in the exercise of its
revisional jurisdiction under the Code. Needless to
say, if within the limited parameters, interference of
the High Court is justified the only course of action
that can be adopted is to order a re-trial after setting
aside the acquittal. As the language of Section 401 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                           12</span>




                the Code makes it amply clear there is no power
                vested in the High Court to convert a finding of
                acquittal into one of conviction."
</p>
<p id="p_39">          15. That means to say, unless and until the court below had

committed a manifest error of law or procedure or had overlooked and

ignored the relevant, crucial evidence already available on the records

leading to miscarriage of justice, in casual and routine manner

exercise of revisional jurisdiction has been forbidden. That means to

say, there should be proper scrutiny on that very score whether serious

lapses did exist in consonance with the materials available on the

record. Then and then only, the interference is found permissible

otherwise the opportunity is found completely shunned.

</p><p id="p_40">          16. As per Ext-3, Fardbeyan of PW-5 Deo Narain Mahto

recorded on 21.03.1996 at about 8.15 hours (over-writing) at Bithan

P.S. by PW-6 alleging inter alia that on the same day at about 6.30

a.m. (over-writing) he along with is son Sunil Kumar were at his

Darwaza. At that very time, Raj Kishore @ Mantun, Shiv Shankar

Mahto, Dilip Kumar Mahto, Rajiv Mahto, Bindeshwari Mahto,

Ramchandar Mahto, Uchit Mahto armed with country made pistol,

rifle respectively came at his Darwaza. Out of whom Bindeshwari

Mahto, Ramchandar Mahto, Uchit Mahto caught hold his son Sunil

and directed to assault as he was not ready to relinquish the land. On

the instigation of Uchit Mahto, Raj Kishore Mahto shot at by his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                            13</span>




country made pistol on the left chest of Sunil on account thereof, he

sustained injury and fell down. Thereafter, Dilip Mahto pounced upon

his chest and pressed causing instantaneous death. During intervening

period, he tried to save his son during course of which Shiv Shankar

Mahto gave a butt blow on his head causing severe injury. After

hearing sound of firing the villagers began to assemble seeing whom

all the accused persons escaped towards western direction who were

chased but gone out of grip. Nawal Kishore, Thakur Prasad and Anil

Kumar along with others were named who witnessed the occurrence.

He had further disclosed that there is cases pending in between them

relating to land dispute and so he had alleged commission of murder

in the aforesaid background.
</p>
<p id="p_41">          17. From Bithan outpost, the Fardbeyan was forwared to

Hasanpur P.S. for registration of the case on the basis thereof,

Hasanpur (Bithan) P.S. Case No. 39/1996 was registered although, till

then the investigation was already taken up by the PW-6 who had

recorded the Fardbeyan. After completing the investigation charge-

sheet was submitted whereupon trial commenced. During course of

trial altogether eight PWs were examined along with exhibit of so

many documents. After analyzing the same by the judgment

impugned the accused were acquitted, hence this revision at the

instance of informant/petitioner.

</p><p id="p_43">          18.   After going through the judgment impugned, it is

evident that the learned lower court have not disbelieved the place of

occurrence as is evident from para-29 of the judgment, also explained

the event whereunder blood was not found by the I/O at P.O. with

certain finding in the background of observation of the court order

from para-28 thereof, with regard to discrepancy over timing of

recording of Fardbeyan as well as timing of occurrence inconsonance

with the evidence of PW-6 has been taken note of. It is also evident

from para-32 thereof, that the learned lower court had not considered

the status of other witnesses to be an eyewitness to occurrence in the

background of disclosure made in the Fardbeyan thought admitted the

status of PW-5 as sole eyewitness to occurrence. It is also evident

from para-30 thereof, that the learned lower court had taken into

account the apparel having worn by the deceased and the cumulative

effect ultimately debilitated the prosecution version as is evident from

para-34 of the judgment.

<p id="p_44">          19. In the case of <a href="/doc/151465151/" id="a_8">Gangabhavani v. Rayapati Venkat

Reddy</a> as reported in 2013 (4) PLJR (SC) 345 the Hon'ble Apex

Court has an occasion to deal with the situation whereunder the

witnesses have not been cross-examined on particular point. For

better appreciation the relevant paragraphs are quoted below:-

    dispute with respect to the settled legal proposition,
    that if a party wishes to raise any doubt as regards the
    correctness of the statement of a witness, the said
    witness must be given an opportunity to explain
    his statement by drawing his attention to that part
    of it, which has been objected to by the other
    party, as being untrue. Without this, it is not
    possible to impeach his credibility. Such a law has
    been advanced in view of the statutory provisions
    enshrined in <a href="/doc/937129/" id="a_10">Section 138</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872,
    which enable the opposite party to cross-examine a
    witness as regards information tendered in evidence
    by him during his initial examination in chief, and the
    scope of this provision stands enlarged by <a href="/doc/130551/" id="a_11">Section
    146</a> of the Evidence Act, which permits a witness to
    be questioned, inter-alia, in order to test his veracity.
    Thereafter, the unchallenged part of his evidence is
    to be relied upon, for the reason that it is
    impossible for the witness to explain or elaborate
    upon any doubts as regards the same, in the absence of
    questions put to him with respect to the circumstances

maker of the document (Fardbeyan) while PW-6 being the person

who had recorded the Fardbeyan (scribe) as well as who happens to

be the I.O. From Ext-2, Fardbeyan itself, it is evident that apart from

having the signature of informant, PW-5 exhibited as Ext-1, the

signature of FIR attesting witness happens to be Ext-1/A as well as

Ext-1/B. The FIR attesting witnesses have been examined as PW-2 as

well as PW-4. After going through the evidence of PW-2, PW-4 and

PW-5 it is apparent that defence had not cross-examined these three

PWs on the score of timing/interpolation when there is consistent

version of the witnesses, PW-1 in examination-in-chief "then Ramdas

Mahto and Thakur Prasad carried his father to police station on

bicycle". PW-2 in examination-in-chief "then thereafter he along with

Thakur Prasad and Shibu Mahto carried Dev Narain Mahto to police

station." PW-4 had not deposed on that very score while PW-5 had

stated that he had given his Fardbeyan at Bithan police station

whereupon he had put his signature. Ramdas Mahto and Thakur

Prasad had also put their signature. In that background at least the

FIR attesting witnesses by their presence have shown that the

Farbeyan was given by PW-5 in their presence at Bithani police

station in continuity, therefore, they should have been cross-examined

on that very score coupled with the evidence of informant (PW-5)

who had also reiterated the earlier version. Had there been a cross-

explain whether there was interpolation at their behest or at the behest

of Investigating Authority oral the end of accused to get the

prosecution case completely smashed. Moreover, it is evident that the

learned lower court had wrongly interpreted the evidence of PW-6

during cross-examination so recorded under para-9 in Para-28 of the

judgment and which has been taken as sheet anchor to disbelieve the

case of the prosecution. For better appreciation, the aforesaid

paragraph (PW-6, para-9) is quoted below in its verbatim:-

is evident that deceased had sustained single fire-arm injury over his

least the distance from which firing was made.

been explained under para-29 of the judgment and on account thereof

account in the case of <a href="/doc/115564649/" id="a_12">Ganga Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> as

reported in (2013) 7 SCC 278 under paras-12, 13 and 14 which are

as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                  "12. According to Mr. Mehrotra, however, PW-5 is
          not a reliable witness as she has made a significant omission
          in her evidence by not stating anything about the seizure of
          the blouse, dhoti and broken bangles which were made in
          her presence. But we find that no question has been put
          to PW-5 in cross-examination with regard to seizure of the
          blouse, dhoti and broken bangles in her presence. If the
          appellant's case was that PW-5 cannot be believed
          because she made this significant omission in her
          evidence, a question in this regard should have been put
          to her during her cross- examination. To quote Lord
          Herschell, LC in Browne vs. Dunn [(1894) 6 R 67 (HL)
                     "......it seems to me to be absolutely essential
          to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to
          suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a
          particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some
          questions put in cross examination showing that the

          evidence and pass it by as a matter               altogether
          unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to
          explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such
          questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it
          is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to
          be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of
          credit."

          provides that when a witness is cross-examined, he may be
          asked any question which tend to test his veracity. Yet
          no question was put to PW-5 in cross-examination on
          the articles seized in her presence. In the absence of any
          question with regard to the seizure of the blouse, dhoti and
          broken bangles in presence of PW-5, omission of this fact
          from her evidence is no ground to doubt the veracity of her
          evidence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                  14. The evidence of PW-5, in this case, is also
          corroborated by other evidence. <a href="/doc/1002421/" id="a_14">Section 157</a> of the Indian
          Evidence Act provides that in order to corroborate the
          testimony of a witness, any former statement made by
          such witness relating to the same fact at or about the time
          when the fact took place, or before any authority legally
          competent to investigate the fact may be proved. The
          evidence of PW-5 is corroborated by the evidence of her
          mother-in-law (PW-2) before whom she stated about the
          commission of the rape by the appellant soon after the
          incident the very same evening. The evidence of PW-5 is
          also corroborated by the FIR (Ex.9) before the
          Investigating Officer, PW-10, before whom she lodged the
          complaint one day after the incident."</blockquote><p id="p_55">

namely, PWs-1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 have supported the prosecution case in

its entirety but during cross-examination also it is found that they have

not made any embellishment, material development. Furthermore, it is

for rejection of their evidence save and except having caution during

meticulously. The aforesaid issue has been taken into consideration in

deceased Purshottam and the prosecution has chosen
not to examine any independent witness despite
number of houses situate in the close vicinity of the
house of Purshottam and that itself creates a dent in
the version of the prosecution. When relatives, who
are alleged to be interested witnesses, are cited by the
prosecution, it is the obligation of the court to
scrutinize their evidence with care, caution and
circumspection. In the case at hand, the entire
occurrence took place in and around the house of
Purshottam. Five people had been done to death. In
such a circumstance, it is totally      unexpected that
other villagers would come forward to give their
statements and depose in the court. It is to be borne
in mind that Ram Narayan, Sarpanch of the
village, solely on the basis of suspicion, had seen
to it that five persons meet their end.           Such a
situation compels one not to get oneself involved
and common sense give consent to such an attitude.

evidence can never form the basis of conviction
unless corroborated to a material extent in
material particulars by independent evidence. All
that is necessary is that the evidence of the
interested witnesses should be subjected to careful
scrutiny and accepted with caution. If on such

similar view was taken in <a href="/doc/1946408/" id="a_29">Jarnail Singh v. State
of Punjab</a>, [(2009) 9 SCC 719 where this Court
reiterated the special evidentiary status accorded to
the testimony of an injured accused and relying
on its earlier judgments held as under: (SCC
pp. 726-27, paras 28-29)
            "28. Darshan Singh (PW 4) was an
injured witness. He had been examined by the
doctor. His testimony could not be brushed aside
lightly. He had given full details of the incident
as he was present at         the   time    when     the
assailants reached the tubewell. <a href="/doc/651601/" id="a_30">In Shivalingappa
Kallayanappa v. State of Karnataka</a> [1994 supp
(3)SCC 235] this Court has held that the deposition
of the injured witness should be relied upon
unless there are strong grounds for rejection
of his evidence on the basis of major
contradictions and discrepancies, for the reason
that     his     presence     on    the scene    stands
established in case it is proved that he suffered
the injury during the said incident.
</p><p id="p_67">                     29. <a href="/doc/333507/" id="a_31">In State of U.P. v. Kishan
Chand</a> [(2004) 7 SCC 629 a similar view has been
reiterated observing that the testimony of a
stamped witness has its own relevance and
efficacy. The fact that the witness sustained injuries
at the time and place of occurrence, lends
support to his testimony that he was present
during the occurrence. In case the injured
witness       is     subjected    to lengthy     cross-

                              his testimony, it should be relied upon (vide
                              <a href="/doc/304052/" id="a_32">Krishan v. State of Haryana</a>). Thus, we are of
                              the considered opinion that evidence of Darshan
                              Singh (PW 4) has rightly been relied upon by
                              the courts below."
</p><p id="p_69">                                             30. The law on the point can be
                              summarized to the effect that the testimony of
                              the injured witness is accorded a special status
                              in law. This is as a consequence of the fact
                              that the injury to the witness is an inbuilt guarantee of
                              his presence at the scene of the crime and
                              because the witness will not want to let his
                              actual assailant go unpunished merely to
                              falsely implicate a third party for the
                              commission        of    the    offence.      Thus,    the
                              deposition of the injured witness should be
                              relied upon unless there are strong grounds
                              for rejection of his evidence on the basis of
                              major contradictions and discrepancies therein."
