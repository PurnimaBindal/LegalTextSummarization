namely, Suryakant Sharma is residing on 2 nd Floor of the
building. He is offending his dignity and reputation in order to
grab her flat. When she occupied her flat, the building had one
guard. However, the petitioner, namely, Suryakant Sharma
removed him. He started collecting parking charges from
outsiders for parking their vehicles in the parking space of the
building. He also charged amount for allowing the parking
space of the building for performing religious functions. The
complainant raised objection and stopped the said activities.
For that reason, the petitioner, namely, Suryakant Sharma
knocked at her door in the night and threatened her that the
complainant does not deserve to reside in the colony and she
must sell her flat or follow his command and otherwise, it would
be harmful for her. At that time, the complainant and the
petitioner, namely, Suryakant Sharma were the only persons
who had purchased flats and residing in the building.

to steal her TATA Sky Set Top Box Umbrella while he vacated
his flats after 11.00 p.m. on 22.11.2017 in order to instill fear in
the complainant and her family.

CONTENTIONS OF THE PETITIONERS:
</p><p id="p_37">19.                Ld. Counsel for the petitioners contended that the

passed a reasoned order while directing framing of charge.

</p><p id="p_39"> 20.                Ld. Counsel for the petitioners contended that the
complainant has not made any specific allegation or ascribed
specific role of any of the petitioners. He contended that the
charge does not mention the time and place of commission of
offences under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_20">Section 506</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_21">34</a> IPC and 427/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22">IPC</a>. He
contended that the impugned charge is against the mandatory
provision of <a href="/doc/797651/" id="a_23">Section 212</a> of the Cr.P.C. He relied upon the
judgement in <a href="/doc/1601209/" id="a_24">Main Pal vs. State of Haryana</a>, AIR 2010 SC
3292. He contended that the trial Court has not considered the
material on its file while framing charges against the petitioners.
He contended that the impugned charge is against basic
principles of criminal jurisprudence that charge must give clear,
precise and unambiguous notice of the accusations against the
petitioners. He contended that in the absence of such notice of
the accusations, the petitioners will not be able to prepare their
defence. He contended that the impugned charge is vague. He
contended that the complainant herself is committing nuisance
and taking law and order in her hand. He contended that on
careful reading of the complaint and statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_25">Section
161</a> of the Cr.P.C., it is evident that the complainant was not
under threat, alarm or pressure. He contended that there is no

the petitioners had given any threat to the complainant. He
contended that Investigation Officer did not record statement of
the neighbours despite making observation in the charge-sheet
that the neighbours stated that the complainant made false
allegation against the petitioner, namely, Suryakant Sharma and
his neighbours. He contended that there is no police complaint
either on the date of incident or immediately thereafter. He

by inordinate delay. He contended that there is no sketch of the
place of incident. He contended that there is no independent
witness. He contended that there is no photograph of damaged
pipe or scratched vehicle. He contended that there is no
particular of any vehicle which was allegedly scratched by the

disclose commission of any offence. He contended that IO,

contended that the impugned order does not suffer from any
illegality, infirmity or any error of law justifying interference by
this Court in exercise of its revisional power. He contended that
the trial Court is not required to pass a reasoned order while
framing the charge. He contended that the contents of the
charge are the reasons impelling the Court to frame the charge
against the petitioners. He contended that if the trial Court has
not mentioned the time and place of incident in the charge, such
defect can be rectified by the trial Court. He contended that the
revision petition deserves to be dismissed.

           why he opts to do so. Framing of charge itself is

           ground for presuming that the accused has committed

<p id="p_52">28.                It is, therefore, evident that the trial Court

existence of a prima facie case against the petitioners. There is
no legal requirement that the trial Court should specify the
reasons as to why it opts to do so. Framing of charge itself is a
prima facie order that the trial Court has formed opinion, on
considering the charge-sheet and other documents and after
hearing both sides, that there is ground for presuming that the
petitioners have committed the said offences. In such a
situation, the trial Court is only required to frame a charge in

meticulous examination of the material on record as it is

can only be exercised if there is any legal bar to the

           have been framed for a particular offence. This Court,
           while quashing and setting aside the order passed by

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">               &quot;After considering the material on record,

               High Court against the respondents by
               accepting      the   contention    raised    and
               considering the details of the material produced
               on record. The same is challenged by filing
               these appeals.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">               In our view, it is apparent that the entire
               approach of the High Court is illegal and
               erroneous. From the reasons recorded by the
               High Court, it appears that instead of
               considering the prima facie case, the High
               Court has appreciated and weighed the
               materials on record for coming to the
               conclusion that charge against the respondents
               could not have been framed. It is settled law
               that at the stage of framing the charge, the
               court has to prima facie consider whether there
               is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
               accused. The court is not required to appreciate
               the evidence and arrive at the conclusion that
               the materials produced are sufficient or not for
               convicting the accused. If the court is satisfied
               that a prima facie case is made out for
               proceeding further then a charge has to be
               framed. The charge can be quashed if the
               evidence which the prosecutor proposes to
               adduce to prove the guilt of the accused, even
               if fully accepted before it is challenged by
               cross-examination or rebutted by defence
               evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused
               committed the particular offence. In such case,
               there would be no sufficient ground for
               proceeding with the trial.&quot;

</p><p id="p_90"> 40.                From the aforesaid narration of the allegations
against the petitioners, it is evident that primarily, the petitioner,
namely, Suryakant Sharma has threatened the complainant and
her family members since the day she occupied flat in the
building. The allegations made in the complaint would reveal
that the said threats were sufficient to create alarm in the mind
of the complainant and her family members to their safety and
security. Prima facie, an offence under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_47">Section 506</a> IPC is made
out against the petitioner, namely, Suryakant Sharma .
</p><p id="p_91">41.                The   petitioner,     namely,     Suryakant    Sharma
damaged water pipe and electric meter wire on 23.09.2017 and
therefore, offence under <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_48">Section 427</a> IPC is made out against
him.
</p><p id="p_92">42.                Besides   the       petitioner,   namely,     Suryakant
Sharma, the other petitioners had abused daughters of the
complainant and threatened to kill them on 20.12.2017. When
the complainant came down stairs, the petitioners threatened to
kill her and her family members. On 27.12.2017, the petitioner,
namely, Suryakant Sharma and his wife, namely, Smt. Anita
Sharma knocked door of the complainant and threatened her.
Therefore, offence under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_49">Section 506</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_50">34</a> IPC is made out
against the petitioners, namely, Smt. Anita Sharma, Manjeet
Singh and Amarjeet Kaur.
</p><p id="p_93">43.                Ld. Counsel for the petitioners contended that the
charge does not specify the time and place of incident and
therefore, the impugned charge is vague and unspecific.

</p><p id="p_95"> 44.                Ld. Counsel for the petitioners rightly relied on
the judgement of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/1601209/" id="a_51">Main
Pal vs. State of Haryana</a>, AIR 2010 SC 3292 that
           &quot;9. The following principles relating to <a href="/doc/66955/" id="a_52">Sections 212</a>,
           <a href="/doc/1839996/" id="a_53">215</a> and <a href="/doc/1745798/" id="a_54">464</a> of the Code, relevant to this case,
           become evident from the said enunciations:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">               (i) The object of framing a charge is to enable
               an accused to have a clear idea of what he is
               being tried for and of the essential facts that he
               has to meet. The charge must also contain the
               particulars of date, time, place and person
               against whom the offence was committed, as
               are reasonably sufficient to give the accused
               notice of the matter with which he is charged.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">               (ii) The accused is entitled to know with
               certainty and accuracy, the exact nature of the
               charge against him, and unless he has such
               knowledge, his defence will be prejudiced.
               Where an accused is charged with having
               committed offence against one person but on
               the evidence led, he is convicted for committing
               offence against another person, without a
               charge being framed in respect of it, the
               accused will be prejudiced, resulting in a failure
               of justice. But there will be no prejudice or
               failure of justice where there was an error in the
               charge and the accused was aware of the error.
               Such knowledge can be inferred from the
               defence, that is, if the defence of the accused
               showed that he was defending himself against
               the real and actual charge and not the
               erroneous charge.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">               (iii) In judging a question of prejudice, as of
               guilt, the courts must act with a broad vision
               and look to the substance and not to the
               technicalities, and their main concern should be
               to see whether the accused had a fair trial,
               whether he knew what he was being tried for,
               whether the main facts sought to be
               established against him were explained to him
               fairly and clearly, and whether he was given a
               full and fair chance to defend himself.&quot;

</p><p id="p_97"> 45.                The principle underlying framing of charge is to
provide      clear,      precise   and     specific     information   of    the
accusations to the accused to put him on notice about the case
regarding which he is being tried and the basic facts that he has
to defend. Any infirmity in the frame of charge would cause
serious prejudice to the accused in defending the case
effectively and efficiently. The accused cannot defend the
charge unless he does not have notice of exact nature of
charge against him.
</p><p id="p_98">46.                However, the error in framing of charge would not
ipso facto result in discharge of the petitioners. The Court has
power to alter or add to any charge at any time before
judgement is pronounced under <a href="/doc/1172704/" id="a_55">Section 216</a> of the Cr.P.C. For
every distinct offence, the accused must be charged separately.
</p><p id="p_99">47.                In the present case, there is an error in the
charge as an omnibus charge, without specifying the date, time
and place of offence and particulars of the allegations against
each of the petitioners, was framed. The incident dated
27.12.2017 does not find mention in the charge. In the present
case, the petitioner, namely, Suryakant Sharma should have
been charged separately for committing offences under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_56">Section
506</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_57">34</a> IPC and 427 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_58">IPC</a>. The other petitioners, namely, Smt.
Anita Sharma, Manjeet Singh and Smt. Amarjeet Kaur should
have been charged for offence under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_59">Section 506</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_60">34</a> IPC. The
case is at initial stage. No witness has been examined. The trial
Court has power to frame appropriate charges.

Kishen Sharma vs. State and Anr., Crl. M.C. 692/2014
decided by the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court on 24.09.2018, there
was no evidence regarding the particulars of the utterances
made by the petitioner against the prosecutrix whereas in the
present case, the complainant has not only attributed specific
role to each of the petitioners, she has stated the exact words
spoken by them. In the said case, the prosecutrix had not stated
the date, time and place of the criminal intimidation whereas in
the present case, the complainant has specifically mentioned
the date of incident as 23.09.2017, 20.12.2017 and 27.12.2017
as well as the place of incident. The allegations made in the
said case did not cause alarm to the petitioner whereas in the
present case, the complainant has not only narrated the entire
ordeal to which she was subjected to but she has alleged
essential facts from which inference that the petitioners had
threatened her and her family members with the intent to cause
alarm can be reasonably inferred. The allegations made in the
present case are specific and cannot be said to be vague
allegations.
</p><p id="p_102">49.                Accordingly, this Court is of the considered
opinion that there is no merit in the petitions of the petitioners
and there is no legal infirmity, material irregularity or
jurisdictional error in the order directing framing of charge.
