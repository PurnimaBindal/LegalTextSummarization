              CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANANDAN SINGH
              CAV ORDER
              Date:     18-09-2012

Jayanandan Singh,J:              Mr. V. Giri, learned senior counsel, appearing on

                      behalf of the petitioners, on a query from the Court, at the very

                      threshold of his arguments, fairly accepted that in matters, like

                      the present one, scope of interference by a High Court, in

                      exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, is

                      very limited. He accepted that in this matter no question of any

                      statutory infraction or question of any violation of mandate of the

                      Constitution was involved and no question of infringement of any

                      statutory or constitutional right of the petitioners was involved.
 3   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          3 / 100




            He submitted that petitioner no.1 is the Association and other

            petitioners are member calcination units, long established in the

            periphery of Refineries, (Barauni in the present case), of the

            respondent Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as

            „the IOC‟). Since about two decades these units were being

            allotted Raw Petroleum Coke (in short „R.P.C.‟), a by-product of

            the refining process of the Refinery, by the IOC at a price fixed

            by it, on pro-rata basis as well as taking into account their

            installed capacity and their average offtake of the last three years.

            From the R.P.C. thus purchased, these units produced Calcined

            Petroleum Coke (in short „C.P.C.‟), which, in turn, was required

            by the aluminium industries, like HINDALCO, etc. for use in

            their process of manufacturing of aluminium. He accepted that

            there was no written agreement between the IOC and these units

            assuring such supply. But this allotment of R.P.C. to the units,

            since almost last two decades, gave rise to a legitimate

            expectation with them that they will continue to get assured

            supply of R.P.C. from the IOC in future also. Hence, he

            submitted that the Principles of legitimate expectation, as also of

            promissory estoppel, by conduct, also became applicable, due to

            this long standing practice. He submitted that, problem arose

            when new C.P.C. producing units came into existence and started

            claiming share in the stock of R.P.C. produced by the Refineries,
 4   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          4 / 100




            which was scarce, and not sufficient to meet the demand of the

            even existing units. When these new units put up their demand

            before the IOC, they received a curt reply that the IOC could not

            guarantee any supply to them. At one point of time, the IOC also

            fixed a cut off date for allotment of R.P.C. to the units

            commissioned before 1.4.2010 only, declining any assurance of

            allotment to the new units commissioned thereafter. He submitted

            that the IOC had been working on this methodology of allotment

            of R.P.C. to the existing C.P.C. producing units on equitable

            basis since long with the knowledge and consent of the Ministry

            of Petroleum and Natural Gas, (hereinafter referred to as „P &amp; G‟

            or „the Ministry‟) Government of India. Grievance arose among

            the petitioners when the impugned letter dated 7.5.2012

            (Annexure-1) was issued by the Ministry to the Public Sector Oil

            Producing Companies, including the IOC, advising them to prefer

            auction as mode for sale of R.P.C. to C.P.C. producing units. He

            submitted that the long standing practice of sale of R.P.C. by

            allotment to the C.P.C. producing units, based on the average

            offtake of past three years or the installed capacity, whichever

            was lower, prorated to actual availability, was changed to sale by

            an open auction, which wiped out the legitimate expectations of

            the existing units of assured supply, of R.P.C. as there was/is

            wide mismatch in production and demand. He submitted that this
 5   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          5 / 100




            change of methodology of putting the stock of R.P.C. of the

            Refineries for sale through an open auction is under challenge in

            this writ application. He accepted that the entire transaction, from

            the very beginning, was/is based on commercial considerations

            for all parties and no case of statutory or constitutional violation

            is involved in the matter. Hence, he accepted that, the petitioners

            challenge, to the impugned letter of the Ministry dated 7.5.2012

            (Annexure-1), has to be considered by this Court only under the

            powers of judicial review of an administrative action and within

            the parameters laid down by judicial pronouncements in this

            regard. He fairly accepted that under the powers of judicial

            review, this Court cannot sit in appeal and examine the merits of

            the decision. He also accepted that, in matters of policy decisions,

            scrutiny of the Court is required to be confined only to decision

            making process and it can interfere only if the decision is found

            to be arbitrary, unreasonable, capricious etc. He submitted that, as

            laid down by the judicial pronouncements, Courts cannot weigh

            the pros and cons of the policy or comparative merits and cannot

            hold it bad on consideration of its possible abrasion and

            consequences. He submitted that in matters of fiscal policies, like

            private entrepreneurs, State and its instrumentalities have also

            right to keep profit motive one of the considerations, but, he

            submitted that, profit cannot be the only consideration for taking
 6   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          6 / 100




            a policy decision without consideration of fairness, rationality

            and equality in the matter. He submitted that State and its

            instrumentalities cannot indulge into profiteering only, de hors

            other considerations relevant for a welfare State, and totally

            oblivious to its cause and effect. However, he submitted that,

            before proceeding with his submissions on the scope of judicial

            review in the matter, it would be appropriate for him to place

            certain background facts of the case, leading to the issue of

            impugned letter by the Ministry.
</p>
<p id="p_29">            2.          Coming to the facts of the case, Mr.Giri, first of all,

            placed an old letter of the IOC dated 27.8.2001, addressed to the

            Working President of Laghu Udyog Bharti at Begusarai, an

            Association of SSI units of the State, annexed with the writ

            application as Annexure-7 (Page 47). This letter, he placed to

            emphasize that the IOC had extended the assurance of its

            endeavour to protect the interest of SSI units of Barauni. He also

            pointed out that the IOC, through this letter, had also assured that,

            in spite of restricted availability of the product, i.e. R.P.C., it

            intended      to    meet     the        requirements   of   the   SSI   units

            proportionately, in the line with their past offtakes. He submitted

            that this letter showed that there was some promise by the IOC to

            ensure supply to the units on proportionate basis in future also.

</p><p id="p_30">            3.          He next referred to another letter of the IOC dated
 7   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          7 / 100




            10.8.2006, again addressed to the said Working President,

            annexed as Annexure-8 with the writ application (Page 49), only

            to show that the pricing of the R.P.C. was a unilateral act of the

            Empowered Pricing Committee of the IOC which the units were

            required to accept for allotment of R.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_31">            4.          Next letter in chronology, he placed, was also a letter of

            the IOC dated 8.5.2008 addressed to the Ministry, annexed as

            Annexure-R/1 with the counter affidavit filed on behalf of

            respondent nos.4 to 6 on 24.7.2012 (Page 328), to show that, in

            view of the letter of the Ministry dated 25.7.2001, IOC had made

            endeavours to supply R.P.C. ex-Barauni to the local SSI units on

            priority, but it had faced some problems during October 2006 to

            January 2007 when the local SSI units did not come forward to

            lift the available R.P.C. stock, which forced the IOC to sell the

            available stock, with heavy trade discount to other customers. It

            referred to a request of the petitioner Association, made on the

            basis of a letter of the Ministry dated 28.6.2002, for release of

            R.P.C. from Barauni, only to local calcination units, and also

            requests from other customers also, like units from Kota, Wizag

            and Kolkata, for supply of some quantity to them also out of the

            total production. Hence, by this letter the IOC proposed

            streamlining the release of R.P.C. ex-Barauni Refinery with a

            proposed changed methodology. On the basis of this letter of the
 8   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          8 / 100




            IOC, he submitted that in this changed methodology also IOC

            had proposed to ensure equitable distribution of R.P.C. ex-

            Barauni Refinery to the local units, with some allocation to

            outside units also.
</p>
<p id="p_32">            5.          Mr. Giri then referred to another letter of the IOC dated

            19.11.2008, addressed to a firm of Kolkata, annexed with the writ

            application as Annexure-3 (Page 41), by which IOC had declined

            its request to release R.P.C. to new calcination units due to the

            reason that production of R.P.C. ex-Barauni was far less than the

            installed capacity of units at Barauni, indicating that options of

            importing R.P.C. was always open to the customers to meet their

            requirements. He submitted that, thus, this letter also showed that

            a clear policy was being practiced by the IOC to provide R.P.C.

            ex-Barauni only to existing units at Barauni.

</p><p id="p_33">            6.          He next referred to the notings of a discussion held at

            the headquarter of the IOC on 18.2.2010, in respect of release of

            R.P.C. from Barauni and North East Refineries, a copy whereof

            is annexed as Annexure-10 with the reply of the petitioners to the

            interveners‟ petition by way of affidavit (Page 162), which shows

            that average monthly R.P.C. production during the year 2010-11

            was noticed and, in view of the expected production of the

            quantity, it was observed that, the units based in North East

            would be supplied upto 50% of their installed capacity and
 9   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          9 / 100




            Barauni based units would be supplied upto 70%. In the

            proceeding, prevalent methodology was noticed and it was also

            noticed that three new units at Bongaigaon and two at Barauni

            were coming up and there was a demand and representations for

            release of R.P.C. to other units also confined to the State.

            Considering the entire facts, in the meeting, a modified

            methodology was proposed to be adopted which also proposed

            action in case any unit did not lift its allotted quota of R.P.C. in

            time. In the meeting it was also proposed that the demand from

            the new customers could be considered in future only after

            meeting the demand of existing local customers. On the basis of

            this, Mr. Giri submitted that, time to time, the IOC had taken into

            account the working of the methodology of allotment of R.P.C. to

            the existing units and, as and when it felt necessity of any

            modification or improvement in the methodology, it promptly

            introduced the same. He referred to another letter of the IOC

            dated 22.7.2010 addressed to the same Kolkata Firm, annexed

            with the writ application as Annexure-2 (Page 40), declining any

            assurance of supply of R.P.C. to its new unit at Bongaigaon, in

            view of the demand of existing customers far exceeding the

            production of R.P.C. from the Refineries.

<p id="p_34">            7.          Next letter in chronology, Mr.Giri referred, was again a

            letter of the IOC dated 4.11.2010, addressed to the Deputy
 10   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          10 / 100




             Secretary of the Ministry, annexed as Annexure-R/2 with the said

             counter affidavit on behalf of respondent nos.4 to 6 (Page 330),

             appearing to have been sent in reference to Ministry‟s letter dated

             5.10.2010, and some discussions held with him on 18.10.2010,

             giving in detail, current supply demand scenario of R.P.C. and

             the present system of allotment and future proposition. He

             pointed out that, in the present system, allotment from Barauni

             Refinery was based on average offtake of past three years on

             rolling basis or the installed capacity of units, whichever was

             lower, prorated to the actual production capacity. He submitted

             that this shows that, a careful methodology was being adopted by

             the IOC for an equitable distribution of the R.P.C. produced from

             its Refineries, as it was in far less quantity than the demand. He

             submitted that in the future proposition also, contained in this

             letter, the IOC did not propose any assured allocation of R.P.C. to

             the new units commissioned after 1.4.2010.

<p id="p_35">             8.         Thereafter, Mr. Giri referred to one letter of the Minister

             of the Department of P &amp; NG dated 20.9.2011, addressed to one

             Dr. Manas Bhunia, Minister-in-charge of Micro and Small Scale

             Enterprises, Textiles, Irrigation and Waterways Department,

             Government of West Bengal, annexed as Annexure- 4 (Page 42),

             sent in response to his letter dated 5.1.2011, in respect of

             allocation of R.P.C. ex-Bongaigaon Refinery to M/s Brahmputra

             carbon Ltd. In the said letter, he made it clear that the matter was

             examined, in consultation with the IOC, and he was informed that

             the R.P.C. produced by the three Refineries in the North East

             were supplied to five calcination units in the vicinity, including

             Brahmputra Carbon Ltd., based on demand put by them and

             depending upon monthly projected availability from the

             Refineries prorated to availability and limited to the assessed

             capacity of the units.
</p>
<p id="p_36">              9.         Next document, referred by Mr. Giri, was a letter dated

             10.1.2012 of the Director (Marketing) of the IOC, addressed to

             Joint Secretary of the Ministry, annexed as Annexure- R/3 with

             the said counter affidavit of respondent nos.4 to 6 (Page 333),

             with which, it appears that, in response to Ministry‟s letter dated

             4.1.2012, enclosing a letter of M/s Carbon Resources Pvt. Ltd.

             (Respondent no.7) dated 15.10.2011, a new revisited and

             rationalized pricing and allocation methodology was enclosed. It

             was mentioned in the letter that, for meeting the requirement of

             local calcination units and others, decisions in respect of changes

             had been taken in consultation with the officials of the Ministry

             in the meeting held on 18.10.2010 and 1.11.2010.

             Annexure-5 (Page 43), was the next document referred by Mr.

             Giri, which shows the practice adopted by the IOC, so far, in

             respect of allocation of R.P.C. to the calcination units was

             allotment prorated to actual availability, on the basis of average

             offtake of past three years on rolling basis or the installed

             capacity, whichever was lower. It mentions that the guidelines

             were affected from November 2010 and the calcination units

             commissioned after 1.4.2010 were not being presently considered

             for regular allocation. He submitted that this shows that till this

             date the methodology of allotment of R.P.C. was on equitable

             basis, dependent on its availability, with preference to the local

             calcination units.
</p>
<p id="p_38">              11.       He, therefore, submitted that, from the above documents

             it was clear that, till this date, there was nothing to indicate that

             any change in the methodology, in vogue since more than two

             decades       and     adoption          of     a   new   methodology   for

             allocation/distribution/sale of R.P.C. by auction or in any manner,

             was under contemplation even. Hence, he submitted that the

             change of methodology by the impugned communication of the

             Ministry dated 7.5.2012, suggesting for sale of R.P.C. through

             open auction was sudden, abrupt, without any deliberation at any

             level with any party and without any application of mind by any

             authority with regard to its propriety or advantages, or otherwise,
 13   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          13 / 100




             over the methodology being practiced by the IOC since so long.

             He submitted that, this sudden and abrupt change of methodology

             negatived the very policy of the IOC of equitable distribution of

             R.P.C. with preference to local calcination units, which was being

             practiced by the IOC due to the fact that the availability of R.P.C.

             was much less than the over all requirement of the existing

             calcination units. He submitted that this mismatch of supply and

             demand was the reason for the IOC to have adopted the

             methodology of prorated distribution, as per the availability,

             which was a sound and equitable methodology with a purpose to

             enable the small SSI C.P.C. producing units, set up in the

             periphery of the concerned Refineries, to survive. He submitted

             that it was not at all considered by any authority, before this

             change of methodology, that this introduction of auction will

             expose the smaller units to the danger of some party, with deep

             pockets, lifting the entire stock, with a clear game plan to force

             the other rival units to run out of business and pull down their

             shutters. He pointed out that, in the circumstances, petitioner

             no.1, the Association, sent a representation to the Secretary of the

             Ministry on 12.5.2012, annexed as Annexure-10 with the writ

             application (Page 51), requesting him to review the said decision,

             communicated through the impugned letter. He submitted that, as

             it appears from the communication of the Ministry to the Director
 14   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          14 / 100




             (Marketing) of the IOC dated 7.6.2012, annexed as Annexure-A

             with the rejoinder of the petitioners to the reply filed by

             respondent nos.1 to 3 (Page 508), the IOC had also sent some

             letter to the Ministry on 14.5.2012 on the subject which, in this

             letter of the Ministry was claimed, was considered and it was

             decided that the IOC should follow the instructions contained in

             impugned letter dated 7.5.2012. He also referred to some

             communications between some of the petitioners and the IOC,

             annexed as Annexure-15 series (Pages 172-184), in respect of the

             changed methodology of sale of R.P.C. through auction.

             However, since nothing transpired in spite of filing of the

             representations by the Association, and on their request to the

             IOC also, petitioners filed this writ application with a prayer for

             quashing of the said communication of the Ministry dated

             7.5.2012 (Annexure-1) and for issue of mandamus to the

             respondents to continue the existing procedure, mechanism and

             scheme for allocation of R.P.C. and for prohibiting respondent

             nos.4 to 6 i.e. the IOC officials, from implementing the said

             impugned decision of the Ministry.
</p>
<p id="p_39">             12.          Mr. Giri also placed several paragraphs of the counter

             affidavit of the IOC (Page 320) and, in particular, on paragraphs

             5, 6, 12, 13, 17 and 19, and submitted that the counter affidavit

             did not spell out any difficulty, whatsoever, in the methodology
 15   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             being applied by the IOC earlier. He submitted that the pleadings

             made in paragraph 17 of the counter affidavit did not disclose any

             deliberation in the matter and supported the apprehension of the

             petitioners that, in the process of auction, some of the units may

             not get any allotment at all and may be either forced to go for

             100% import, which was not a viable option, or to close their

             units. He submitted that the possible result of this could also be

             that some of the larger units, with stronger financial base, may lift

             the entire quantity of R.P.C. from the Refineries of the IOC,

             which was much better in quality than the imported R.P.C., thus,

             intentionally indulging into negative trade practice, only to

             eliminate their rivals. He submitted that the R.P.C. being a scarce

             commodity, the Ministry and the IOC were not expected to be

             guided only by commercial considerations and take a decision

             only with a view to get more profit out of it. They being public

             authorities, it was their constitutional duty to see to it that a

             scarce free trade commodity, available at their disposal, is

             distributed amongst its consumers (calcination units) on equitable

             basis while safeguarding their financial interest also. He

             submitted that the counter affidavit of the IOC shows that the

             decision of auction was guided by the judgment of the Apex

             Court in the case, popularly known as „2G Spectrum Case‟,

             holding auction as the best method for distributing or alienating
 16   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          16 / 100




             natural resources through wide publicity for making it possible

             for all eligible to participate. He submitted that this may be true

             in case of 2G Spectrums, not suffering from availability

             constraints. But in the present case said principle may not be

             most appropriate, as, by throwing a scarce commodity open to all

             through auction, dangers of negative trade practice looms large.

             Hence, he submitted that, in principle, sale of a free-trade

             commodity, in control of a public authority, through auction, may

             be good, but, in implementation, it may create many

             complications and may prove to be inequitable, unjust and

             counter productive.
</p>
<p id="p_40">             13.          However, as pointed out earlier, Mr. Giri did accept

             that the entire transaction, either under the old methodology, or

             on the basis of new methodology proposed by impugned

             Annexure-1 are basically commercial activity of the petitioners

             and other calcination units at the one hand and the IOC and the

             Ministry on the other. He submitted that R.P.C., a by-product of

             the refining process of the Refineries of the IOC, which otherwise

             was a waste material for them, was being sold by the IOC only to

             make profit out of it and add to their financial resources. The

             calcination units, in turn, were using the R.P.C. to convert the

             same into C.P.C. and sell it to the aluminium producing

             industries, like HINDALCO and others, on profit, which they
 17   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          17 / 100




             used in the process of their production of finished products. Thus,

             only a profit motive was involved in the entire transaction

             throughout. He submitted that, though the Government and its

             instrumentalities were free to act in their commercial interest, like

             any other private entrepreneur, and normally no interference

             could be made in the same, but, since they were public authorities

             also, they, even in their commercial activities, were required to

             act fairly and reasonably, taking into consideration the effect of

             their action on the parties likely to be involved. He submitted

             that, since earlier methodology was in vogue for more than two

             decades, it was, in normal circumstances, expected from the

             Ministry to take into account the interest of stakeholders, who

             were likely to be adversely affected by such sudden change of

             methodology and take them into confidence by consulting them

             before the abrupt change. In this connection, he placed reliance

             on a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Mahabir Auto

             Stores Vs, I.O.C. &amp; Ors. [(1990)3 SCC 752] and in particular, on

             paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20 and 21 thereof. He submitted

             that even if public authorities were free to enter into a contract or

             take commercial decisions, like private parties, being public

             authorities, their action was amenable to judicial review by this

             Court in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the

             Constitution of India. He submitted that, being public authorities,
 18   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          18 / 100




             to sustain judicial scrutiny of their action, they must establish that

             their decision was rational, logical and sequential and was not

             arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or mala fide. He submitted that

             these parameters have been laid down by the Apex Court through

             a number of judicial pronouncements, some of which he relied

             upon, were cases of Kumari Srilekha Vidyarthi Vs. State of U.P.

             &amp; Ors. [(1991)1 SCC 212], and in particular, on paragraphs 18,

             19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 30 and 32 thereof and Sterling

             Computers Limited Vs. M &amp; N Publications [(1993)1 SCC 445],

             and in particular, on paragraphs 14 and 15 thereof.

</p><p id="p_41">             14.        Mr. Giri next submitted that due to long practice of more

             than two decades of allotment of R.P.C. on equitable and pro-rata

             basis, legitimate expectations arose with the petitioners of its

             continuance in future also. Hence, on this basis a right had

             accrued to them to get the supply of R.P.C. on the basis of old

             methodology, unless an overwhelming public interest was

             involved to compel the respondents to deviate from the old

             practice. In this connection, he placed reliance on judgments of

             the Apex Court in the cases of Union of India Vs. Hindustan

             Development Corporation [(1993)3 SCC 499], and in particular,

             on paragraphs 19, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 33 thereof; and

             then of <a href="/doc/1890994/" id="a_7">Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer</a>,

             [(2005) 1 SCC 625], and in particular, on paragraphs 8 and 9
 19   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             thereof. He submitted that the IOC being an instrumentality of the

             State, it is not open to it to be guided only by profit motives in its

             actions just to maximize its revenue. Even if it is assumed that by

             this change of methodology it was going to generate more

             income, being a public authority, it was also obligatory on its part

             to see to it that, while protecting its fiscal interest, distribution of

             R.P.C. should also be on equitable basis, protecting the interest of

             the units dependent upon it since more than two decades. In this

             connection, he placed reliance on the judgments of the Apex

             Court in the case of KSEP Vs. Govind Prabhu [(1986)4 SCC

             498], followed in Ashoka Smokeless Coke India Pvt. Ltd. Vs.

             Union of India [(2007)2 SCC 640], and in particular, on

             paragraphs 85, 86, 90, 91, 92, 113, 114, 144 and 193 thereof.

</p><p id="p_42">             15.        In the circumstances, concluding his arguments, Mr. Giri

             submitted that, the decision of the respondents to abruptly change

             the mode of sale of R.P.C. by auction is completely arbitrary and

             hence violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. He

             further submitted that the reasons given by the respondents to

             justify their decision are unsustainable and misconceived. No

             material has been placed before the Court to convince it that the

             impugned communication dated 7.5.2012 (Annexure-1) was

             issued after deliberation at the instance of the Government with

             the IOC or in consultation with the stakeholders. Hence, the

                                          20 / 100




             prayer of the petitioners is fit to be allowed and the said

             impugned communication dated 7.5.2012 is fit to be quashed

             with consequential reliefs as prayed for.
</p>
<p id="p_43">             16.          Challenge to the reliefs prayed for by the petitioners in

             the writ application was led by Mr.Vinod Kanth, learned senior

             counsel appearing for respondent no.10 and assisted by

             Mr.Abhinav Srivastava, Advocate. However, leaving the factual

             aspects of the case to be presented by other learned counsels

             appearing for the other respondents, he confined himself to pure

             questions of law arising in the case. He submitted that there

             cannot be two opinion that the impugned letter of the Ministry, as

             contained in Annexure-1 with this writ application, reflected

             policy decision taken by the Ministry to go for open auction for

             sale of R.P.C. being produced by the Refineries of the IOC. He

             submitted that it has been categorically held by the Apex Court,

             repeatedly, that a policy decision of the State cannot be

             questioned in a court of law, unless the same affects somebody‟s

             legal rights. He submitted that, merits of a policy of the

             Government, or a public authority, cannot be judged by this

             Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, even though or only

             because, it may result into some adverse effect upon some vested

             interests, nor can it be struck down only on representation of

             some parties urging that a different policy would have been fairer

             or more scientific or more logical. In this connection, he placed

             reliance on a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Union of

             India Vs. Manu Deo Arya [(2004)5 SCC 232] and in particular

             on paragraph 9 thereof. He further placed reliance on a celebrated

             judgments of the Apex Court in the case of BALCO Employees

             Union (Regd.) Vs. Union of India [(2002)2 SCC 333] and in

             particular, on paragraphs 46, 92 and 93 thereof, and also in the

             case of Tata Cellular Vs. Union of India [(1994)6 SCC 651], and

             in particular, on paragraphs 72, 73, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81 and 94

             thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_44">             17.            Mr.Kanth also submitted that, a right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_10">Article

             19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, is a right available to all the citizens

             of the Country. In the garb of this right, nobody can claim

             monopoly to do business. He submitted that new calcination units

             have established their manufacturing units with due permission

             from the concerned authorities of the State. Hence, they have also

             a right to get an opportunity to purchase R.P.C. from the

             Refineries of the IOC. He submitted that, only because some of

             the petitioners and the like had established their units earlier, does

             not give them the right to monopolize in purchase of R.P.C. in

             exclusion of others. In support of this proposition, he relied upon

             a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Hansraj Kehar Vs.

             State of U.P. [(1975) 1 SCC 40], and in particular, on paragraph 8

             thereof.

<p id="p_45">             18.          On the question of legitimate expectation, Mr. Kanth

             submitted that legitimate expectation of a party itself cannot be a

             ground to interfere with a policy decision of the State. To

             interfere with a policy decision under powers of judicial review,

             much more is required than mere legitimate expectation of the

             parties expecting a contrary action and decision by the State. In

             this context, he placed reliance on a judgment of the Apex Court

             in the case of Sethi Auto Service Station Vs. D.D.A. [(2009)1

             SCC 180]. He accepted that the Apex Court has laid down some

             parameters for the Courts to interfere in policy decision also, but,

             he submitted that, the petitioners have completely failed to bring

             their case within any of the parameters laid down by the Apex

             Court and have not at all made out a case for interference by this

             Court.

<p id="p_46">             19.          Mr. Abhinav Srivastava, learned counsel appearing for

             respondent no.9 independently, adopted the submissions of Mr.

             Kanth. In addition, he submitted that R.P.C. was not being

             exclusively produced by the IOC Refineries and it was easily

             available through import also. He submitted that the calcination

             units do not totally depend upon supply from the IOC as

             admittedly quantity of R.P.C. supplied by the IOC is only 25% of

             the total demand by the units set up before 1.4.2010 also. He
 23   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             submitted that there was no implied contract between the

             calcination units and the IOC and only as a practice, same was

             being allotted to them by sale. He submitted that, by making an

             effort to get more revenue from sale of R.P.C., the IOC was only

             making an attempt to cover up some loss being faced by it in its

             operations and thus the IOC, being an authority under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_11">Article 12</a>,

             was only adding some profit to the public exchequer.

</p><p id="p_47">             20.          Mr. S.D.Sanjay, learned counsel for Respondent no.7,

             appeared thereafter and advanced elaborate submissions on facts

             as well as on questions of law. He submitted that materials are on

             record to show that not all the calcination units commissioned

             prior to 1.4.2010 were opposed to this policy. He submitted that

             petitioners have not come to this Court with clean hands and for

             legitimate purpose. He submitted that in fact the entire game plan

             of the petitioners is to get R.P.C. from the Refineries of the IOC

             at lower price. He submitted that, in fact, they had been

             manipulating things in their favour, forcing the IOC to scale

             down the price due to urgency of evacuation of R.P.C. from their

             premises to ensure uninterrupted continuance of refining process.

             He submitted that thus it were the petitioners, who were

             indulging into profiteering by forcing the IOC to sell R.P.C. to

             them at a lower price and selling their finished product i.e. C.P.C.

             to the aluminium manufacturing giants at a higher price and in
 24   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             this process making heavy profit. He referred to the pleadings of

             his counter affidavit containing details of the units in Bihar and

             Assam and pointed out that, out of 10 units, which were opposed

             to auction system, 5 were of one group alone i.e. Maniyar Group.

             He pointed out that it was one unit i.e. Brahmputra Carbon

             Limited which has increased its installed capacity from 40,000

             M.T. to 1,20,000 M.T. per annum and therefore was desperate in

             getting assured supply of R.P.C. He pointed out that this

             Brahmputra Carbon Ltd. had filed writ application in Guwahati

             High Court for implementation of the deliberations of the said

             meeting at IOC Headquarters, in which counter affidavit was

             filed on behalf of the IOC, a copy whereof is Annexure-R/3 with

             his counter affidavit (Page 289). In the counter affidavit IOC

             disclosed to the Court that the said Brahmputra Carbon Ltd.

             enjoyed near monopoly in this sector and, from the records it was

             apparent that, from time to time it had stopped uplifting R.P.C.

             from the Refineries, resulting into piling of R.P.C. and forcing

             the IOC to sell it on discounted price to avoid shutting down of

             refining process. He referred to other documents, annexed with

             his counter affidavit, giving details of calcinine units and their

             installed capacities and upliftment in the last three years. He also

             referred to list of litigation entered into by the old units, prepared

             and annexed with his counter affidavit as Annexure-R/10 (Page
 25   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

</p><p id="p_48">             312). He also placed his additional counter affidavit and two

             documents of the respondent IOC, annexed with it as Annexure-

             R/11 and R/11A (Pages 649-650), to show that, at times, the IOC

             had to reduce the price due to market condition and competitive

             prices and in the wake of delay in lifting of allotted R.P.C. by the

             existing units.
</p>
<p id="p_49">             21.          On the question of law, Mr. Sanjay also submitted that

             the Courts cannot strike down policy decision merely because it

             feels that another decision would have been better or fairer. He

             submitted that the wisdom and advisability of a policy are

             normally not amenable to judicial review unless they are found to

             be contrary to statutory or constitutional provisions or arbitrary or

             irrational and an abuse of power. In support of this submission,

             he placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in the case

             of State of M.P. Vs. Narmada Bachao Andolan [(2011)7 SCC

             639], and in particular, on paragraph 6 thereof.

</p><p id="p_50">             22.          He submitted that sale of goods by the State or its

             instrumentalities on fiscal considerations and the manner to be

             adopted for the same is a matter of policy and the Court cannot

             examine the correctness or otherwise of the same except in

             exceptional circumstances. In this respect, he placed reliance on a

             judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Ram Singh Vijay Pal

             Singh Vs. State of U.P. [(2007)6 SCC 44] and in particular, on
 26   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             paragraph 11 thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_51">             23.            He further submitted that a legislative decision, or a

             policy decision in the                  line   of legislative   decision,   is

             distinguishable from judicial decision or quasi judicial decision.

             Judicial or quasi judicial decision or administrative decision

             affecting rights of individual may require compliance of a

             Principles of Natural Justice. But a legislative decision, or a

             policy decision taking colour of a legislative decision, does not

             call for any compliance of Principles of Natural Justice and no

             right accrues to any affected party to be noticed and heard in the

             matter, unless the Statute itself so requires. In support of this

             submission, he placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex

             Court in the case of M/s Sri Sitaram Sugar Company Ltd. Vs.

             Union of India [AIR 1990 SC 1277] and in particular, on

             paragraphs 32 and 37 thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_52">             24.         Mr. Sanjay also placed reliance on paragraphs 35 and 36

             of a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Srilekha Vidyarthi

             (Supra) to submit that though it is true that, to survive the test of

             <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a>, an action of the State must appear to be reasonable

             and not arbitrary, but, he submitted that, the question whether any

             act of the State was arbitrary or not is ultimately to be answered

             on the facts and in the circumstances of the given case and not in

             abstract.

</p><p id="p_54">             25.             He next placed reliance on a judgment of the Apex

             Court in the case of M/s Meerut Development Authority Vs.

             Association of Management Studies [(2009)6 SCC 171] and its

             various paragraphs to submit that efforts by the State or any of its

             instrumentalities to augment financial resources as revenue, itself

             cannot be said to be an unreasonable decision. State has a right to

             get full value of its resources through sale of natural assets in

             private sector. He submitted that mere use of word arbitrary and

             capricious does not carry any special significance. Question,

             which in every case of judicial review of a policy decision

             requires to be considered, is whether decision measures legal

             standard of reasonableness or not. He submitted that the facts of

             this case are somewhat similar to the facts of the present case and

             therefore, law laid down therein is squarely applicable in the

             present case.

<p id="p_55">             26.            He submitted that in matters of change of policy,

             Principle of Promissory Estoppel also does not apply and no

             party gets a right to be noticed and heard in the matter likely to be

             affected by the said change. In support of this submission, he

             relied upon a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Bannari

             Amman Sugar Ltd. Vs. C.T.O. [(2005)1 SCC 625], and in

             particular, on paragraphs 19 and 20 thereof.

</p><p id="p_56">             27.       He next placed reliance on a well known Judgment of the
 28   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          28 / 100




             Apex Court in the case of M/s Kasturilal Vs. State of J &amp; K [AIR

             1980 SC 1992], and in particular, on paragraphs 11, 14 and 15

             thereof, to submit that the Government cannot discriminate and

             adopt an unfair procedure and cannot, like a private individual,

             choose persons to deal with, leaving others aside, without any

             intelligible differentia or reasonable classification. He submitted

             that in case of sale of commodities in its possession, it must do so

             by auction giving opportunity to all the eligible to participate.

</p><p id="p_57">              28.         He lastly placed reliance on paragraphs 74, 75, 76 and

             95 of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Centre for

             Public Interest Litigation Vs. Union of India (popularly known as

             2G Spectrum case) [(2012)3 SCC 1], to submit that natural

             resources or Government property must be distributed or sold by

             transparent and fair method so that all eligible persons get a fair

             opportunity of competition. He submitted that the State and its

             instrumentalities must always adopt a rational method for

             disposal of public property and no attempt should be made to

             scuttle the claim of others. He submitted that the Court has held

             that where a question of alienation of scarce natural resource

             comes      for    consideration,        State   must   ensure   that   non-

             discriminatory method is adopted for its distribution and

             alienation which would necessarily result into protection of

             national/public interest. He submitted that after enunciation of
 29   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          29 / 100




             law, the Apex Court in the said judgment has held that publicized

             auction, conducted fairly and impartially, is the best method of

             discharging its burden, which the respondents have decided to

             adopt in the present case and, therefore, their action is perfectly

             legal and valid and no interference is called for by this Court in

             the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_58">             29.        Mr. Jitendra Singh, learned senior counsel, on behalf of

             respondent no.8 appeared next. He submitted that the action of

             the Ministry was a policy decision as per the fiscal necessity of

             the IOC, an instrumentality of the State. He also submitted that,

             in the circumstances, no judicial review was called for in the

             matter. He submitted that the IOC met only about 25% of the

             total demand of the units and the rest of the demand of the units

             was met through import, which was not a complex process as

             R.P.C. is a free import commodity. He also referred to Annexure-

             R/10 of his counter affidavit and submitted that in all the earlier

             litigations Union of India was a party and entire matter was in its

             knowledge. Hence, to settle the dispute once for all, between the

             rival calcination units, it thought it proper to make changes in the

             policy. By that time, judgment of Apex Court in 2G Spectrum

             case had come, which laid down that the auction of natural

             resource was the best mode for distribution among the eligible

             citizens. As such on the lines of law laid down by the Apex
 30   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          30 / 100




             Court, it was decided to change the modality of sale of R.P.C.

             from the Refineries of the IOC by allotment to sale through an

             open auction. He submitted that it was not permissible to judge

             the comparative merit of the policy decision in exercise of

             powers under judicial review and this Court could not undertake

             an exercise in the matter as an appellate court. In support of this

             submission, he relied upon judgment of the Apex Court in the

             case of K. Nagraj Vs. State of A.P. [(1985)1 SCC 523], and in

             particular, on paragraphs 7 and 13 thereof. He submitted that this

             policy was not only desirable but expedient also as it gave equal

             opportunity to all the units to apply for purchase of R.P.C. He

             submitted that, at the time of taking decision in respect of change

             in policy, all facts were there before the Ministry and, hence,

             decision was taken on relevant materials. He submitted that the

             bid price for auction has to be fixed in consideration with the

             market price of the imported R.P.C. as on the site. Hence, nobody

             would be in a position to bid so high that he would incur loss, in

             purchasing R.P.C. at a very high price which may completely

             wipe out his profit from the sale of finished product i.e. C.P.C.

             He also relied upon judgment of BALCO (Supra) and in

             particular, on paragraph 47 and 48 thereof and submitted that

             Principles of Natural Justice had no role to play in a policy

             decision. In this context, he also relied upon judgments of the
 31   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          31 / 100




             Apex Court in the cases of Indian Airlines Officers‟ Association

             Vs. Indian Airlines Ltd., [(2007)10 SCC 684] and in particular,

             on paragraph 9 thereof; in the case of Hardev Singh Vs. Union of

             India [(2011)10 SCC 121], and in particular, on paragraphs 25

             and 26 thereof; Ram Chandra Murarilal Bhattad Vs. State of

             and in particular, on paragraphs 52, 55, 258 and 261 thereof. He

             submitted that in effect petitioners were calling upon this Court to

             decide     comparative        merit     and    desirability   of   the   two

             methodology for being adopted by the IOC in future, which

             cannot be done by this Court under the powers of judicial review.

</p><p id="p_59">             30.          Mr. K. D. Chatterjee, learned senior counsel, appeared

             for the IOC. He adopted the arguments on behalf of other private

             respondents and submitted that, in the wake of change of policy

             by the Ministry to be adopted by the IOC in the matter, detailed

             Guidelines were drawn by the IOC in consultation with Metals

             Scrap Trading Corporation (in short „MSTC‟), a Government of

             India Undertaking, specialized in holding auctions for public

             sector undertakings, which has been engaged by the IOC for the

             scheduled auction. This Guideline has been put on the web site of

             MSTC and is available to all interested parties. He also produced

             a downloaded copy of the Guidelines for perusal by this Court
 32   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          32 / 100




             and to be kept on the records of this case. He submitted that a

             training session was held recently by the IOC in which

             representatives of all petitioners and all respondents participated.

             No party complained, in the meeting or in the session or

             thereafter, with regard to any of the clauses of the said

             Guidelines. In fact, nothing has been said by the petitioners

             before this Court also in respect of any infirmity or short fall in

             the Guidelines. He pointed out that, instead of pointing out any

             infirmity in the said Guidelines, petitioners have merely raised

             bogy of a possibility of some party, with deep pockets, lifting the

             entire stock, which was not logically possible. He submitted that

             the intention of the Ministry or the IOC was not profiteering, as,

             under the new methodology, the price of R.P.C. has to be fixed at

             rational basis and restrictions are imposed on re-sale, trade etc. of

             the R.P.C. and it has been decided to restrict the auction for local

             units to safeguard their interest. He submitted that, had the

             Ministry or the IOC been interested in profiteering, first step the

             Ministry would have taken was to get the import duty on

             imported R.P.C. increased, so as to get the price of R.P.C.

             produced by the IOC fixed at a higher rate in auction and it would

             have thrown the commodity open for sale to one and all from the

             Country and also from abroad on highest price without any

             preference to local buyers and would have allowed its resale or
 33   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          33 / 100




             trade etc. Auction was proposed only to get more revenue from

             the sale of R.P.C. on the basis of market based price. He

             submitted that the auction is yet to be held first time, which is to

             be held strictly on the basis of Guidelines prepared for the same

             by the IOC in consultation with MSTC. He submitted that

             Petitioners have moved this Court only on apprehension that they

             may suffer adversely if the auction is held. He submitted that

             even if, without assuming, there may be some justification in the

             apprehension of the petitioners, mere apprehension or possibility

             of misuse or abuse of a policy, or apprehension of its defective

             implementation in future, cannot be a ground to hold the policy

             bad calling upon this Court in exercise of powers of judicial

             review to set it aside. Dealing with the cases relied upon by

             learned senior counsel for the petitioners, he submitted that the

             case of Mahabir Auto (Supra) is clearly distinguishable on facts.

             He submitted that in the peculiar facts of that case the Apex

             Court had held that a contractual relationship was existing from

             long between the IOC and the appellant and the IOC in effect was

             treating and projecting it as its authorized distributor. He

             submitted that, so far as present case is concerned, relationship of

             the IOC with the petitioners was only of seller and buyer,

             transacting as per their own requirements and necessity, without

             any express or implied promise to any one of them of assured
 34   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          34 / 100




             supply under the earlier methodology. He submitted that earlier

             R.P.C. was being made available to only few units, but now,

             under the changed policy, it is being made available to one and

             all, with equal opportunity to them to compete. In respect of the

             judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Ashoka Smokeless

             (Supra), he submitted that the Court was dealing with coal which

             was an essential commodity in terms of 2000 Order. It held that

             since the product i.e. smokeless coal and briquettes were directly

             being consumed by the rural people, its price could not be

             allowed to shoot up, creating uncertainty and hardship for the

             masses. The Court also took into account that under <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_13">section 2(i)</a>

             &amp; (ii) and <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_14">section 3(1)(2)(c)</a> of the Essential Commodities Act, it

             was incumbent upon the Central Government to fulfill object

             thereof, namely, making a scarce commodity available to the

             people at an affordable price. He submitted that there was no

             such consideration before the Ministry or the IOC in the present

             case. R.P.C. is a by-product of refining process which is useful

             for the calcination units for converting it into C.P.C. and selling it

             at a higher price to the aluminium manufacturing giants. It was

             purely a profit making venture of the petitioners which had

             nothing to do with the people at large. It was also profit making

             for the IOC to sell the by-product, which otherwise was a waste

             material for it, at a price, to augment its revenue. Hence, the
 35   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          35 / 100




             principles laid down in Ashoka Smokeless (Supra) was not at all

             applicable in the present case.

<p id="p_60">             31.          Mr. Raghib Hasan, learned senior counsel, appeared for

             respondent nos.1 to 3 i.e. the Union of India and its functionaries.

             He broadly adopted the submission of Mr. Jitendra Singh, learned

             senior counsel for respondent no.8, and also submitted that a

             policy decision of the Ministry has been questioned by the

             petitioners, which calls for no interference. He submitted that

             Annexure-1 was issued by the Ministry after much deliberation,

             for grant of equal opportunity to new units also, along with the

             existing units, who had also a right to enter into business in terms

             of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_15">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. He submitted that the said

             Guidelines for auction of R.P.C. provided sufficient safeguards

             and the policy decision was arrived at after examining the matter

             in detail on receipt of an application from petitioner no.8.

</p><p id="p_61">             32.          This Court had earlier requested Mr. Hassan to produce

             the original file of the Ministry in which the matter had been

             dealt with as it had found that there was broad consensus between

             the parties that the issues raised in this matter had to be decided

             in the background of facts and circumstances of this case. Hence,

             he produced the entire original records of the Ministry and also

             filed a short note reflecting the developments in the file and

             placed reliance on judgment of 2G Spectrum case (Supra) and in

             particular, on paragraphs 94, 95 and 96 thereof in support of the

             decision taken by the Ministry, suggesting the IOC to hold

             auction for sale of R.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_62">             33.          In reply to the submissions of learned counsels for the

             respondents, Mr. Giri, learned senior counsel for the petitioners,

             submitted that, in his opening arguments on behalf of the

             petitioners, he had already covered the objection of the

             respondents to the petitioners‟ prayer in the writ application. He

             submitted that it was not the case of the petitioners that the Court

             should examine the correctness of the policy decision of the

             Ministry on merits. He submitted that he accepted the settled

             proposition of law that wisdom of decision making authority

             cannot be substituted by a Court with its own wisdom. Hence, he

             had confined and was confining his challenge to the decision of

             change of methodology of sale of R.P.C. only on the basis of

             gross error in the process adopted by the Ministry in coming to

             the decision. He submitted that, since notes of arguments,

             reflecting materials available in the file of the Ministry, was

             placed before this Court only during the arguments of learned

             counsel for the Union of India, and copies of the same were made

             available to him then, he would like to deal with it only, treating

             the same as reflecting the materials available in the original file.

             He placed the notes at pages 9 and 10 and submitted that it
 37   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          37 / 100




             showed that on the representation of a unit, Director (Marketing)

             was asked to examine the methodology of distribution of R.P.C.

             and to suggest any improvement in the same. The Director

             (Marketing) accordingly examined the matter and submitted his

             report suggesting improvements. Comparative table at page 10 of

             the notes, showing existing methodology of allocation and the

             proposed changes, showed that the proposed changes by the

             Director (Marketing) in the methodology was fool proof, on the

             basis of equity and to the benefit of even the new units. He

             submitted that this suggested change was a perfect solution to the

             problem in distribution of R.P.C. as it covered all the existing

             units, including the new ones commissioned after 1.4.2010,

             without any discrimination or undue favour to any one and in the

             best interest of the IOC. He submitted that this proposal of the

             Director (Marketing) could not be found fault with from any

             angle. Therefore, there was no compelling circumstance before

             the Ministry to ignore the same and propose sale of R.P.C.

             through auction. He pointed out from the notes that it did not

             show that in the discussion between the Hon‟ble Minister of the

             Department and the Joint Secretary, held on 31.3.2012 the IOC

             was at all involved and the views of the stakeholders, i.e. existing

             units were at all obtained. Hence, apparently decision for change

             of methodology was arrived at thereafter suddenly and abruptly.

                                          38 / 100




             He submitted that the letter of the Ministry dated 7.6.2012,

             annexed as Annexure-A with the rejoinder of the petitioners filed

             on 6.8.2012 (Page 508), showed that the IOC had sent some letter

             to the Ministry on 14.5.2012 in respect of the new policy, in

             response to which, Ministry had clarified, through this letter, that

             the instructions issued by the Ministry in the impugned letter had

             to be followed. He submitted that the said letter of the IOC dated

             14.5.2012 is not on record, but, from the tenor of this reply of the

             Ministry, it appears that the IOC had taken objections to the

             change of methodology in allocation of R.P.C. through auction.

             He submitted that the notes do not disclose that there was any

             deliberation at the Ministry level with the officials of the IOC or

             stakeholders prior to issue of the impugned letter dated 7.5.2012

             or subsequent to the receipt of the said letter of the IOC dated

             14.5.2012 and till the said letter of the Ministry dated 7.6.2012

             was issued. He submitted that, thus, it was clear that, in the facts

             and circumstances of the case, process leading to the decision of

             change of methodology was vitiated on account of lack of due

             deliberation, lack of application of mind, without calling for and

             considering the views of the stakeholders and taking them in

             confidence, without consulting the IOC and without at all

             considering the pros and cons of the proposed new methodology.

             He placed paragraphs of the counter affidavit of respondent nos.1
 39   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          39 / 100




             to 3 and submitted that there was no pleading that the suggestions

             of the Director (Marketing) was ever considered by the Ministry.

             He submitted that the pleadings and averments made in the

             counter affidavit did not match with the materials available in the

             file of the Ministry, as reflecting from the notes filed by learned

             Assistant Solicitor General of India. He submitted that the IOC,

             being an instrumentality of the State, maximization of its revenue

             should not be a dominant factor in the decision of the Ministry.

             He submitted that this submission he had already advanced

             before this Court relying upon judgment of Govinda Prabhu

             (Supra) and Ashoka Smokeless (Supra). He submitted that the

             claim of the respondents, that open auction for sale of R.P.C.

             would ensure equitable distribution, is misconceived. He

             submitted that maximization of revenue cannot go with equitable

             distribution and both are antithetical to each other as maximizing

             revenue only targets highest return and sale of commodity to the

             highest bidder, irrespective of more pressing demands and need

             of others. He submitted that, though aiming for maximizing

             revenue, both Ministry and the IOC have claimed that new

             arrangement is for equitable distribution, which is apparently

             ridiculous, as production of R.P.C. by the Refineries of the IOC

             are much less than conjoined requirement of all the existing units,

             making it possible for any one unit with big pockets, or a group

                                          40 / 100




             of units, lifting the entire stock of the scarce commodity, forcing

             other units to pack up and leave the arena. He submitted that the

             contents of the counter affidavit filed in the Guwahati High

             Court, referred by learned counsel for respondent no.7, cannot be

             taken into account, as the party, in whose case the same was filed

             has left the fray, and it is not known as to how the same was

             replied in the case and what was the Court‟s finding on it in the

             matter. He, therefore, submitted that this extraneous material has

             been placed on the records of this case by the respondents only to

             prejudice this Court. He submitted that, in any case, stand of the

             respondents in the counter affidavit is not reflected in any

             subsequent correspondence between the IOC and other party.

             Commenting on the case of Manu Deo Arya (Supra) relied upon

             by the respondents, he submitted that in the present case, on

             account of long standing practice, petitioners had acquired a right

             to get assured allotment of R.P.C. In connection with K. Nagraj

             case (Supra), he submitted that the facts of the case show that

             there was much deliberation and consideration at the Government

             level, before the policy decision was taken, whereas in the

             present case, facts are otherwise.

<p id="p_63">             34.           From the submissions of Mr. Giri, learned senior

             counsel appearing for the petitioners, it was apparent that he did

             not challenge the merits of the decision of the Ministry, reflected
 41   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          41 / 100




             by the impugned letter. He did not challenge that the

             methodology of open auction itself was bad and violative of any

             statutory or constitutional provisions or in infringement of any

             right of the petitioners. He did not challenge that the decision of

             sale of R.P.C. through open auction was, on merits, in any way

             violative of Principles of Equality enshrined in the Constitution

             and against the spirit of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_16">Article 14.</a> He also did not submit, during

             his arguments, that the decision of the Ministry, as reflected by

             the impugned letter, was not a policy decision and was only an

             executive fiat. In fact, at one point, during his arguments, he

             accepted that the observations of the Ministry in the impugned

             letter was a communication of a policy decision of the Ministry,

             which may be available in the files. In his main notes of

             arguments also, it has not been disputed that the decision of the

             Ministry, reflected by the impugned letter dated 7.5.2012, was

             not a policy decision and only an executive or administrative

             decision opening more scope for this Court to interfere in the

             matter, apart from the scope of interference in exercise of its

             powers of judicial review. It is only in his subsequent notes, on

             the decisions relied upon by the respondents, that a vague

             statement         is     made           to     the   effect   that   the

             communication/instructions of the Government to the IOC was

             not in fact a change of policy. This stand was never taken by Mr.

             Giri earlier at any point of time nor any submissions were made

             by him in this regard. His entire challenge to the decision of the

             Ministry was confined to the process involved in coming to the

             decision, in respect of which, his particular stand was that the

             same was taken suddenly and abruptly and without any

             deliberation with the IOC and without taking into confidence the

             stakeholders i.e. petitioners and without hearing them in the

             matter. His next submissions were in respect of applicability of

             principles of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectations of

             the petitioners. One more challenge to the decision of the

             Ministry was on the ground that the Ministry and the IOC, being

             public authorities, could not act solely with profit motive and

             indulge into profiteering, completely overlooking the Principles

             of equity and fairness in action.

             plank of arguments of learned counsels of the parties. Learned

             counsel for the petitioners, on the one hand, made elaborate

             arguments on the scope of this power, whereas, on the other

             hand, learned counsels for the respondents advanced their

             arguments on the limitation of this power. Judgments relied upon

             by learned counsels on the issue, and the specific paragraphs

             thereof, referred to by either of the side, were only for this

             purpose, from which it was clear that, the established golden rule,
 43   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          43 / 100




             in the matter of interference with executive/administrative

             decisions or policies, in exercise of powers of judicial review, is

             of restraint, unless the decision/policy was clearly in breach of a

             statute, violative of any constitutional provisions or arbitrary,

             unreasonable and capricious etc., which are essential tests for

             upholding the validity, or otherwise, of the decision on the

             touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. In the long

             line of judgments cited by the respective counsels, this Court did

             not find much noticeable deviation from this approach. However,

             since counsels have referred to and relied upon specific

             judgments in this regard, in all fairness, this Court considers it

             appropriate to notice them individually, but in chronological

             order, rather than in order of appearance of the learned counsels

             before the Court.

<p id="p_65">             36.         But one judgment, which requires to be noticed at the

             very beginning, is the judgment of Court of Appeals (Civil

             Division) of England and Wales in the case of Associated

             Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. Vs. Wednesbury Corporation

             [(1947) 2 AllER 680]. This judgment deserves notice first,

             because of the fact that this is, perhaps, one of the most often

             referred judgment of the Court of England by the Courts of India

             with approval, till today, on the parameters of test of

             reasonableness of an executive action. In this judgment their

             Lordships upheld the judgment of Mr. Justice Henn Collins,

             dismissing the action of the plaintiff-appellant for a declaration of

             a condition, imposed by the respondent-Corporation on the grant

             of a licence for Sunday performance of cinema in its cinema

             theatre, as ultra vires. Before the Court, a great deal was argued,

             in challenge to the said condition, on the ground of it being

             „unreasonable‟. Lord Greene, M.R. enumerated the powers of the

             courts in this respect and made a fine analysis of the phraseology

             „unreasonable‟, finding the same very commonly used in a

             comprehensive sense in relation to exercise of statutory

             discretions. At the end, while dismissing the appeal, he

             summarized the principles applicable in such matter in the

             following manner:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                 "In the result, this appeal must be dismissed. I
                                 do not wish to repeat myself but I will
                                 summarize once again the principle applicable.</blockquote><p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">                                 The court is entitled to investigate the action of
                                 the local authority with a view to seeing
                                 whether they have taken into account matters
                                 which they ought not to take into account, or,
                                 conversely, have refused to take into account
                                 or neglected to take into account matters which
                                 they ought to take into account. Once that
                                 question is answered in favour of the local
                                 authority, it may be still possible to say that,
                                 although the local authority have kept within
                                 the four corners of the matters which they
                                 ought to consider, they have nevertheless come
                                 to a conclusion so unreasonable that no
                                 reasonable authority could ever have come to
                                 it. In such a case, again, I think the court can
                                 interfere. The power of the court to interfere in
                                 each case is not as an appellate authority to

                                 override a decision of the local authority, but as
                                 a judicial authority which is concerned and
                                 concerned only, to see whether the local
                                 authority have contravened the law by acting in
                                 excess of the powers which Parliament has
                                 confided in them."
</p>
<p id="p_68">             37.         While granting that ground of „unreasonableness‟ could

             be an independent ground for attacking the decision of the

             authority, the Court differed with the proposition that „ultimate

             arbiter of what is and is not reasonable is the court and not the

             local authority.‟ Thereafter the Court laid down the correct test of

             unreasonableness, for which the judgment is famous for and is

             being relied on by all courts of the Country, in the following

             words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                "It is clear that the local authority are entrusted
                                by Parliament with the decision on a matter
                                which the knowledge and experience of that
                                authority can best be trusted to deal with. The
                                subject-matter with which the condition deals is
                                one relevant for its consideration. They have
                                considered it and come to a decision upon it. It
                                is true to say that, if a decision on a competent
                                matter is so unreasonable that no reasonable
                                authority could ever have come to it, then the
                                courts can interfere. That, I think, is quite right;</blockquote><p id="p_69">
</p><p id="p_70">                                but to prove a case of that kind would require
                                something overwhelming, and, in this case, the
                                facts do not come anywhere near anything of
                                that kind. I think Mr. Gallop in the end agreed
                                that his proposition that the decision of the local
                                authority can be upset if it is proved to be
                                unreasonable, really meant that it must be
                                proved to be unreasonable in the sense that the
                                court considers it to be a decision that no
                                reasonable body could have come to. It is not
                                what the court considers unreasonable, a
                                different thing altogether. If it is what the court

                                considers unreasonable, the court may very well
                                have different views to that of a local authority
                                on matters of high public policy of this kind.
                                Some courts might think that no children ought
                                to be admitted on Sundays at all, some courts
                                might think the reverse and all over the country
                                I have no doubt on a thing of that sort honest
                                and sincere people hold different views. The
                                effect of the legislation is not to set up the court
                                as an arbiter of the correctness of one view over
                                another. It is the local authority that are set in
                                that position and, provided they act, as they
                                have acted, within the four corners of their
                                jurisdiction, this court, in my opinion, cannot
                                interfere."
</p>
<p id="p_71">             38.             It appears to this Court that, it is the manner of

             applicability of the test of reasonableness, flowing from the

             above paragraph of the judgment, for which this judgment is still

             treated as an authority by all courts of the Country and approved

             till today. In the opinion of this Court, what flows from the above

             paragraph, is that, no court, as they may differ in their opinion,

             can put up the cloak of „a reasonable man‟ and test the action of

             an authority from its own glasses. The vires of the action is

             necessarily to be tested from the point of view of „a reasonable

             man‟ in the position of the authority and acting as such. It is the

             relevancy, or otherwise, of factors and materials, taken into

             consideration, or ignored by him, while taking an action/decision,

             in exercise of his discretion, within the four corners of his

             powers, which only can be taken into account by a court to hold

             the action/decision „unreasonable‟, or not.

             Courts in the matters of administrative/policy decisions of the

             Government and its instrumentalities, was judgment of the Apex

             Court in the case of K. Nagraj Vs. State of A.P. [(1985)1 SCC

             523], which was relied upon by Mr.Singh, appearing for

             respondent no.8. Learned counsel referred the following

             observations of the Court, made towards end of paragraph 7 of

             the judgment, for this Court‟s consideration :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                "................ But while resolving the validity of

                                which way the balance tilts. That is an exercise
                                which the administrator and the legislature have

             supply of lubricants to it, suddenly and without any notice to it.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_73">             Case of the appellant was that, for almost 18 years, it had

             received supply from the IOC, to be marketed by it to the
 48   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             consumers acting as its distributor. Its stand was that in the long

             period of 18 years it had acted under an unwritten contract to act

             as its agent or distributor, which could not be terminated or

             cancelled unilaterally. This judgment shows that, on the facts of

             the case and from the nature of the business being carried on by

             the appellant, the Court found it manifest that the supply of

             lubricants of the type, with which respondents had monopoly,

             could be carried on by the appellant only as a distributor of the

             IOC. The Court, on facts, held that there was a relationship

             between the IOC and the appellant as manufacturer and supplier

             of the commodity. It found that the IOC was instrumentality

             under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and rules of reasons

             and fair play were applicable to it. Findings of the Court in this

             respect were summarized in paragraph 11 thereof towards end in

                                whether the State or the instrumentality of a
                                State has the right to function in public field or
                                private field is a matter which, in our opinion,
                                depends upon the facts and circumstances of the
                                situation, but such exercise of power cannot be
                                dealt with by the State or the instrumentality of
                                the State without informing and taking into

                                defined. The question, whether an impugned act
                                is arbitrary or not, is ultimately to be answered on
                                the facts and in the circumstances of a given case.
                                An obvious test to apply is to see whether there is

                                impugned act and if so, does it satisfy the test of
                                reasonableness. Where a mode is prescribed for
                                doing an act and there is no impediment in
                                following that procedure, performance of the act
                                otherwise and in a manner which does not

                                arbitrariness. Every State action must be
                                informed by reason and it follows that an act
                                uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. Rule of law
                                contemplates governance by laws and not by

                                of the administrative decision is permitted it will
                                be substituting its own decision, without the

                                cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the
                                invitation to tender is in the realm of contract.
                                Normally speaking, the decision to accept the
                                tender or award the contract is reached by
                                process of negotiations through several tiers.
                                More often than not, such decisions are made

             down in this regard. Perhaps having this in mind, and being

             conscious of the consistent view of the Apex Court flowing from

             the above referred judgments, learned senior counsel for the

             petitioners had suggested that this Court should call for the

             original file from the Ministry and examine it, to ascertain

             whether the decision of the Ministry passed the test of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_32">Article 14</a>

             respondent nos.1 to 3 to produce the concerned original file of the

             Ministry. The same was, accordingly made available to this

             Court, as pointed out above, by learned Assistant Solicitor

             General of India, during the course of his submissions, which this

             Court has perused.

<p id="p_89">             56.           Now, from the records, this Court finds that this file,

             numbered as P-19012/32/2010-IOC, was opened on receipt of a

             representation dated 21.9.2010 from Universal Hydrocarbons

             Company Ltd. (Petitioner no.8), addressed to the Secretary to

             Government in the Ministry, requesting for assured supply of at

             least 2500 M.T. of R.P.C. per month, on the ground that it was

             the oldest calcination unit in Barauni Industrial Area. In the

             representation,      it was pointed out,       that the Unit was

             commissioned in 1973 and had increased its installed capacity to

             60,000 M.T. by mid 1990s. It was mentioned that, since 1990,

             many units had come up which had stronger financial base and
 61   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             were procuring R.P.C. in much excess to their actual utilization,

             causing shortage in availability of R.P.C. to it. Hence, a request

             was made for assured supply of said quantity of R.P.C., if

             necessary, from both Barauni and Bongaigaon Refineries. It

             appears that this representation was referred to the IOC, which

             was duly replied by the IOC, expressing its regret to accede to the

             request of the said Company. It appears that one M/s Amritesh

             Industries Pvt. Ltd. also sent a request to the Ministry for

             resumption of supply of R.P.C. to it, which was also forwarded to

             the IOC. The IOC, in response to the letter of the Ministry dated

             5.10.2010, upon discussion with the Deputy Secretary of the

             Ministry on 18.10.2010, through its letter dated 4.11.2010

             (Annexure-R/2 at page 330) gave exhaustive account to the

             Ministry with regard to current demand supply scenario, present

             system of allocation and future proposition (as noticed in this

             judgment earlier). Then a complaint of Krishna Hydrocarbons

             Pvt. Ltd. (Respondent No.8), a new Unit, dated 25.2.2011 was

             received in the Ministry in respect of non-supply of R.P.C. to it

             and the Marketing Division of the IOC at Barauni indulging into

             quota system and selling R.P.C. at 35% less than the import price.

             A copy of this complaint was also received by the Marketing

             Division of IOC, which replied to it, expressing its inability to

             meet its requirement, with a copy of the same to the Ministry
 62   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             also. In view of the said representation of Krishna Hydrocarbons

             Pvt. Ltd., Ministry appears to have made query from the Director

             (Marketing) of the IOC, through letter dated 2.8.2011, in respect

             of calcination units which were not being given R.P.C. by the

             IOC and as to which was the last unit which was given R.P.C.

             allocation by it. Another representation dated 18.8.2011 of the

             same Krishna Hydrocarbons Pvt. Ltd. was also received in the

             meanwhile. This was also suitably replied by the IOC, through

             letter dated 30.8.2011, with a copy of the same to the Ministry.

             Then it appears that representation of New Age Petcoke Pvt. Ltd.

             (Respondent No.9) was received through the Ministry of

             Transport and Tourism, State of Assam, which was replied by the

             IOC informing that a decision had been taken not to release

             R.P.C. to cancination units commissioned after 1.4.2010. Then a

             representation was received in the Ministry from Carbon

             Resources (P) Ltd. (Respondent No.7), which was also forwarded

             by the Joint Secretary of the Department of Petroleum in the

             Ministry to the Director (Marketing) of IOC through letter dated

             4.1.2012. In the letter of the Joint Secretary it was, inter alia,

             noticed that the representation of Carbon Resources (P) Ltd.

             raised serious issues of IOC being commercially harmed due to

             action of a particular group of R.P.C. purchasers, which were

             using their monopolistic position to force IOC to offer discount
 63   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          63 / 100




             on the sale of R.P.C. by not lifting R.P.C. and thereby choking

             the refinery. Counter affidavit of the IOC, filed before the

             Guwahati High Court in the matter of Brahmputra Carbons Ltd.,

             enclosed with the said representation of the Carbon Resources,

             was also referred in the letter. As the letter of the Joint Secretary

             had also noticed that the representation of the Carbon Resources

             was also for more equitable distribution of the R.P.C., which may

             also possibly enhance the price realized by the IOC, the IOC

             through letter dated 10.1.2012 (Annexure-R/3 at page 333)

             proposed broad changes in the existing guidelines, as enclosed

             with it as Annexure-1 (as noticed in this judgment earlier). By a

             subsequent letter of the Section Officer of IOC Section of the

             Ministry dated 27.1.2012, issued in reference to the said earlier

             letter dated 10.1.2012, IOC was informed that the matter was

             examined in the Ministry and it was requested from the IOC to

             furnish pricing methodology for allocation of R.P.C. to the

             Ministry positively by 30.1.2012. This letter appears to have been

             replied by the IOC on 1.2.2012, pointing out the methodology for

             allocation of R.P.C. from both Barauni and North East Refineries.

             Thereafter, there is a hard copy of exchange of e-mails dated

             29/30.3.2012 from which it appears that the Joint Secretary

             (Marketing) in the Ministry had asked the Director (Marketing),

             IOC to send note on the pros and cons of auction of R.P.C. from
 64   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          64 / 100




             the Refineries, as opposed to the current pricing methodology.

             Along with the said hard copy of the exchange of e-mails

             between the Joint Secretary and the Director (Marketing), a

             „brief‟, appearing to have been prepared by the Director

             (Marketing) in respect of his views on pros and cons of the

             auction, is attached. Thereafter, there is a draft of the impugned

             letter dated 7.5.2012 along with a final office copy of the letter. A

             letter of HINDALCO dated 1.3.2012, addressed to the Ministry,

             is also on record, pointing out mistakes in the pricing pattern in

             allocation system and urging the Government to prevail upon

             PSU Refineries to develop a pricing mechanism with respect to

             R.P.C., based on import parity pricing in a more transparent

             manner, relying on comprehensive import data. This letter of

             HINDALCO appears to have been referred by the Ministry to the

             IOC through letter dated 8.5.2012 i.e. after issue of impugned

             letter, in a routine manner. Thereafter, letter of the IOC dated

             14.5.2012 addressed to the Ministry is on record in which a

             request was made to review the issue. Then, it appears that,

             immediately after issue of the impugned letter, petitioner

             Association submitted its request, addressed to the Secretary of

             the Ministry, for review of the decision contained in the

             impugned        letter.    A     letter    of   a   calcination   unit   of

             Vishakhapattanam dated 15.5.2012 is also on record, requesting
 65   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          65 / 100




             the Ministry to open auction to all the units of the Country. It

             appears      that    the     petitioner        Association   filed   repeated

             representations to different authorities, including Dr. Monazir

             Hassan, Shivanand Tiwary, Dr. C.P.Thakur,                      Members of

             Parliament, which were directly or through the Secretariat of the

             Prime Minister and through Standing Committee on Petroleum

             and Natural Gas etc. were sent to the Ministry. The replies sent

             by the Ministry in respect of repeated representations of the

             petitioner Association, HINDALCO etc. are also on record,

             which need no detailed reference. A letter of the Ministry dated

             7.6.2012 (Annexure-A at page 508) replying to the IOC‟s request

             for review through its letter dated 4.5.2012 is also on record (as

             noticed in this judgment earlier). There is one letter of Biswajit

             Daimary, M.P., (appears to be hailing from Assam), is also on

             record, enclosing a representation of New Age Petcoke (P) Ltd.

             (Respondent         No.9)     and       approving    auction   system    and

             recommending for its early implementation. There is one letter

             from the District Chamber of Commerce and Industries,

             Begusarai dated 17.7.2012 also on record, addressed to the

             Minister of the Department, appreciating its decision to go for

             sale of R.P.C. through auction and complaining that the IOC has

             not yet implemented the said decision. There are some other

             letters, representations etc. also on record, which do not require

             any specific notice by this Court. Letters which have been

             noticed, as above, have been noticed only for the purpose of

             giving brief picture of the development in the matter.

</p><p id="p_90">             57.       Coming to the Note Sheet side of the file, this Court finds

             that on the Note Sheet Joint Secretary on 13.1.2012 dealt with, in

             detail, letter of the Carbon Resources dated 15.10.2011 and

             noticed that the matter was taken up with the Director

             (Marketing) of IOC, vide letter dated 4.1.2012, in respect of the

             issues raised in the letter, inter alia, of using of their monopolistic

             position by a particular group of R.P.C. purchasers to force IOC

             to offer discount on the price of R.P.C. and praying for more

             equitable policy of pricing. The note also notices the contents of

             the letter of the Director (Marketing) dated 10.1.2012 and the

             proposed new changes in the methodology contained in his said

             letter. The Joint Secretary, in his said note, mentions that since

             R.P.C. is a de-controlled/de-regulated product, Ministry may

             convey the IOC that their proposed methodology for allocation of

             R.P.C. has been noted, thereby allowing them to implement the

             new allocation policy. But this note does not appear to have been

             finally approved and a query appears to have been made with

             regard to pricing methodology. It appears that thereafter said

             Joint Secretary gave an alternative proposal on 28.2.2012 to

             convey the IOC that any allocation policy for R.P.C. may be

             devised so long as the same was based on objective criteria,

             transparent procedure and principle of equity apart from other

             technical and commercial considerations. This note also does not

             appear to have been finally approved. Thereafter, after a long

             gap, there is a detailed note of the same Joint Secretary dated

             11.4.2012. From this note, it appears that the matter was

             discussed in presence of Minister of the Department on 31.3.2012

             and it was felt that the current system of allocation of R.P.C.

             could be improved so as to make it more transparent and based

             on objective criteria while also ensuring maximum/highest price

             realization for IOC. He mentions that, therefore, succeeding

             paragraphs of his notes are in the light of the said approach

             decided in the meeting. He notices the current pricing policy of

             the IOC and the comments of the IOC dated 30.3.2012 received

             through the said e-mail in respect of pros and cons of auctioning

             the R.P.C. In the note, comment of the IOC has also been noticed

             and then he records his suggestion for consideration of change of

             methodology of sale of R.P.C. through auction in the light of

             prescription of Comptroller And Auditor General Of India (in

             short „CAG‟) in respect of 2G Spectrum and recently on

             allocation of coal mines. He further recommends that to prevent

             the possibility of distortion in supply/allocation, with all or most

             of the R.P.C. going to the highest bidders, a ceiling on allocation

             capacities, may be considered.

             purposes of price discovery and more efficient use of the

             resources. However, the Additional Secretary also made a

             comment that the current pricing policy of the IOC satisfy the

             requirement of an objective price discovery mechanism, and

             hence, the IOC and the other Oil Marketing Companies may be

             asked to further improve the allocation process, to make it more

             transparent and objective to maximize customer satisfaction. The

             Secretary of the Ministry approved the notes and thereafter matter

             was placed before the Minister, who, on 20.4.2012 under Note

             28, took policy decision in the file in favour of the auction

             process. This decision of the Minister has led to issue of

             impugned letter dated 7.5.2012 (Annexure-1 with the writ

             application). Subsequent notes show that the letter of the IOC

             dated 14.5.2012 and letter of HINDALCO for review of decision

             were considered in the Ministry. Recommendation letters of

             Members of Parliament and other correspondences, available on

             the file, have all been considered and dealt with for suitable

             replies.

<p id="p_92">             60.        Thus, from perusal of the documents available in the file

             of the Ministry and the notings of the Note Sheet side, three

             things are apparent. First, there was claim and counter claim

             being received by the Ministry from different units for allocation

             of R.P.C., with some allegations against existing units using their
 70   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          70 / 100




             monopolistic position in purchase of R.P.C. Ministry did ask

             comments of the IOC in the matter, which proposed

             improvements in the methodology of allocation. However, the

             same was not approved in the Ministry finally, and the IOC was

             asked to give its views on pros and cons of auctioning of R.P.C.,

             which the Director (Marketing) furnished through his e-mail

             dated 30.3.2012. This shows that, while the matter was under

             consideration in the Ministry, views of the IOC was obtained on

             sale of R.P.C. by auction and thereafter, it appears, that the matter

             was discussed threadbare in the meeting held on 31.3.2012, in

             presence of Minister, and a consensus was arrived at to change

             the policy of sale of R.P.C. by allotment on pro-rata basis to sale

             by auction. This was done after taking into account comments of

             the IOC received through its said e-mail dated 30.3.2012.

             Secondly, from the note of the Joint Secretary dated 13.4.2012, it

             appears that in the said meeting dated 31.3.2012, recent reports

             and comments of the CAG, in respect of allotment of 2G

             Spectrum and the coal mines, were discussed and the views of

             CAG were taken into account. That is why, in paragraph 23 in his

             notes, the joint Secretary has recorded "(and following from the

             CAG‟s prescription of the auction route for 2G spectrum and

             recently on allocation of coal mines)". Thirdly, paragraph 24 of

             the Note Sheet, as reproduced hereinabove, shows that the Joint
 71   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             Secretary suggested effective means, to be introduced in the

             auction process, to take care of the apprehensions of the Director

             (Marketing), expressed in his e-mail dated 30.3.2012. Thus, it is

             clear that, in the process leading to the final decision of change of

             policy for sale of R.P.C. by auction, communicated through the

             impugned letter, IOC was involved and consulted and its views

             were taken into account, including, and in particular, views of

             CAG in the matters of allocation of natural resources like 2G

             Spectrum and coal mines and the fear of the Director (Marketing)

             was also taken care of. This clearly demolishes the allegations of

             the petitioners that the decision of change of policy, taken by the

             Ministry, was sudden and abrupt, without any application of

             mind, arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious. Hence, in the

             backdrop of the well defined parameters of judicial review, laid

             down by the Apex Court in the catena of decisions, relied upon

             by learned counsels for the parties and noticed above, besides

             others,     and     also     applying          Wednesbury   principles   of

             reasonableness, this Court does not find that the petitioners have

             made out any case of interference in the decision of the Ministry

             reflected by the impugned letter.

             decisions of the executive or legislative authorities in economic

             matters is very limited. After noticing paragraphs 92 and 93 of

             BALCO (Supra), and some other judgments, findings of the

             Court in respect of judicial review and applicability of doctrine of

                                interference should be only within narrow limits
                                e.g. when there is clear violation of the statute or

                                arbitrariness in the Wednesbury sense. It is the

             was not sudden or abrupt and was not arbitrary, unreasonable,

             capricious and was not without taking into account relevant

             with the same also. To raise the claim of legitimate expectations,

             learned senior counsel for the petitioners had referred to several

             documents available on record, as noticed above, to show that

             there was long standing practice, since last more than 20 years, of

             allocation of R.P.C. to the existing calcination units on pro-rata

             years‟ offtake, on price fixed on the basis of import parity plus

             marketing cost and marketing margin and also quality premium

             ex-Barauni Refinery with notional deduction for North East

             Refineries. He had also pointed out that, in its various

             communications to the existing calcination units, the Ministry

             and third parties, the IOC had clearly expressed its assurance and

             commitment for assured supply to the existing units under the

             methodology in vogue, excluding those commissioned after

             1.4.2010. He submitted that, in the circumstances, from the

             conduct of IOC, legitimate expectation arose to the petitioners

             that assured supply of R.P.C. to them would continue in future

             also. The decision of the Ministry to change the methodology

             clearly killed this expectation and made it highly uncertain for the

             petitioners to get continued supply of R.P.C., and in adequate

             quantity, as being done since last more than 20 years. In support

             of this submission, learned senior counsel for the petitioner

             heavily relied upon judgment of the Apex Court in the case of

             Union of India Vs. Hindustan Development Corporation [(1993)3

             SCC 499], and in particular, on paragraphs 19, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29,

             involved a question of award of contract of supply of cast steel

             bogies by the Railways to 12 suppliers. After much deliberation,

             the Railway Ministry decided to adopt dual pricing system to

             make offers to different sets of tenderers. This led to litigation

             before the High Court as well as Apex Court at the interlocutory

             stage itself, in the process of award of contract, and, also in the

             second round, at the final stage. At the final stage, writ

             applications were allowed by the High Court, against which the

             Union of India, through the Ministry of Railways moved the

             Apex Court. Special Leave Petitions were disposed of earlier by

             judgment dated 14th of January, 1993, conclusions whereof was

             to be given later on, which were given by the Apex Court,

             reported as above. On the basis of earlier practice of the Railways

             of entering into a contract with the established manufacturers for

             supply of cast steel bogies, a plea of legitimate expectation by the

             writ petitioners had been raised and was allowed by the High

             Court. The Apex Court, while entertaining the appeal of the

             Railways, went in detail about the scope of interference in policy

             matters and applicability of doctrine of legitimate expectations in

             fiscal decisions of the Government. Court also considered the

             legitimate expectation and also considered the definition of that

             expression in Halsbury Law of England and found that it had not

             come across any pronouncement on the subject, explaining

             meaning and scope of doctrine of legitimate expectation and

             hence it decided to examine the same elaborately. The Court also

             examined the scope of judicial review, in a challenge made to an

             action on the basis of doctrine of legitimate expectation, with

             reference to English decisions. After elaborate discussion and

             consideration of judicial pronouncements              in   its   various

             paragraphs, including paragraphs referred to by learned senior

             counsel for the petitioners, the Court recorded its final

             conclusions in respect of scope and ambit of applicability of

             legitimate expectation in paragraph 35 of the judgment, as

             reproduced herein below :

<blockquote id="blockquote_54">                                "Legitimate expectations may come in various
                                forms and owe their existence to different kind
                                of circumstances and it is not possible to give an
                                exhaustive list in the context of vast and fast

                                shift and change so fast that the start of our list
                                would be obsolete before we reached the middle.

                                that expectation may be seen as unfair without
                                the expectant person being heard. But there

                                again the court has to see whether it was done as
                                a policy or in the public interest either by way of
                                G.O., rule or by way of a legislation. If that be
                                so, a decision denying a legitimate expectation
                                based on such grounds does not qualify for
                                interference unless in a given case, the decision
                                or action taken amounts to an abuse of power.
</p><p id="p_99">                                Therefore the limitation is extremely confined
                                and if the according of natural justice does not
                                condition the exercise of the power, the concept
                                of legitimate expectation can have no role to
                                play and the court must not usurp the discretion
                                of the public authority which is empowered to
                                take the decisions under law and the court is
                                expected to apply an objective standard which
                                leaves to the deciding authority the full range of
                                choice which the legislature is presumed to have
                                intended. Even in a case where the decision is
                                left entirely to the discretion of the deciding
                                authority without any such legal bounds and if
                                the decision is taken fairly and objectively, the
                                court will not interfere on the ground of
                                procedural fairness to a person whose interest
                                based on legitimate expectation might be
                                affected. For instance if an authority who has full
                                discretion to grant a licence prefers an existing
                                licenceholder to a new applicant, the decision
                                cannot be interfered with on the ground of
                                legitimate expectation entertained by the new
                                applicant applying the principles of natural
                                justice. It can therefore be seen that legitimate
                                expectation can at the most be one of the
                                grounds which may give rise to judicial review
                                but the granting of relief is very much limited. It
                                would thus appear that there are stronger reasons
                                as to why the legitimate expectation should not
                                be substantively protected than the reasons as to
                                why it should be protected. In other words such a
                                legal obligation exists whenever the case
                                supporting the same in terms of legal principles
                                of different sorts, is stronger than the case
                                against it. As observed in Attorney General for

                                exercise of administrative power solely on the

                                legitimate expectations of an individual would

                                be to set the courts adrift on a featureless sea of
                                pragmatism. Moreover, the notion of a legitimate
                                expectation (falling short of a legal right) is too
                                nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the
                                exercise of a power when its exercise otherwise
                                accords with law." If a denial of legitimate
                                expectation in a given case amounts to denial of
                                right guaranteed or is arbitrary, discriminatory,
                                unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or
                                violation of principles of natural justice, the
                                same can be questioned on the well-known
                                grounds attracting <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_33">Article 14</a> but a claim based
                                on mere legitimate expectation without anything
                                more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke
                                these principles. It can be one of the grounds to
                                consider but the court must lift the veil and see
                                whether the decision is violative of these
                                principles warranting interference. It depends
                                very much on the facts and the recognized
                                general principles of administrative law
                                applicable to such facts and the concept of
                                legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit
                                to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts
                                for the review of administrative action, must be
                                restricted to the general legal limitations
                                applicable and binding the manner of the future
                                exercise of administrative power in a particular
                                case. It follows that the concept of legitimate
                                expectation is "not the key which unlocks the
                                treasury of natural justice and it ought not to
                                unlock the gates which shuts the court out of
                                review on the merits", particularly when the
                                element of speculation and uncertainty is
                                inherent in that very concept. As cautioned in
                                Attorney General for New South Wales case the
                                courts should restrain themselves and restrict
                                such claims duly to the legal limitations. It is a
                                well-meant caution. Otherwise a resourceful
                                litigant having vested interests in contracts,
                                licences etc. can successfully indulge in getting
                                welfare activities mandated by directive
                                principles thwarted to further his own interests.
                                The caution, particularly in the changing
                                scenario, becomes all the more important."

             its direction for "the modification by way of judicial review was

             not on the ground of legitimate expectation and in violation of

             Principles of Natural Justice but on the other grounds, namely,

             above, clearly goes against the claim of the petitioners, for

             interference in the present matter on the ground of legitimate

             expectation only, as, in view of the findings of this Court earlier,

             grounds of the impugned order being arbitrary, unreasonable,

             notice the said judgment also, in reference to submissions made

             by him, on the question of grant of relief to the petitioners on the

             basis of legitimate expectation. But this judgment does not hold

             this Court long, as, from a bare reading of the judgment, it is

             apparent that the Court, while dealing with the doctrine of

             legitimate expectation, heavily relied on and referred to the

             observations and discussions of the Court in the case of

             Hindustan development Corporation (Supra) and nothing new

             was added by this judgment to the applicability or otherwise, of

             the doctrine in similar matters. However, observation of the

             Court, made in paragraph 14 of the judgment, on the matter may

             be reproduced herein below for easy reference :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">                                 "As was observed in <a href="/doc/349643/" id="a_34">Punjab Communications
                                 Ltd. v. Union of India</a> the change in policy can
                                 defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it
                                 can      be      justified    on      "Wednesbury
                                 reasonableness". The decision-maker has the
                                 choice in the balancing of the pros and cons
                                 relevant to the change in policy. It is, therefore,
                                 clear that the choice of policy is for the decision-
                                 maker and not the court. The legitimate
                                 substantive expectation merely permits the court
                                 to find out if the change of policy which is the
                                 cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is
                                 irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable
                                 person could have made. A claim based on
                                 merely legitimate expectation without anything
                                 more cannot ipso facto give a right. Its
                                 uniqueness lies in the fact that it covers the
                                 entire span of time; present, past and future.
                                 How significant is the statement that today is
                                 tomorrow's yesterday. The present is as we
                                 experience it, the past is a present memory and
                                 future is a present expectation. For legal
                                 purposes, expectation is not same as anticipation.
                                 Legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred
                                 only if it is founded on the sanction of law.</blockquote><p id="p_104">

</p><p id="p_106">             68.        Similarly, at the beginning of the arguments, Mr. Giri,

             learned senior counsel for the petitioners did raise question of

             applicability of Principles of Promissory Estoppel also in the

             case. However, no arguments were made by him on this issue

             and, from the notes of his arguments, it is clear that this issue has

             been given up by him. Hence, this Court is not required to make

             any elaborate considerations of the same and express its opinion.

             Suffice is to say that, it is well settled that for applicability of

             Principles of Promissory Estoppel clear cut foundation is required

             to be laid down in the pleadings and a definite case has to be

             made out on facts. More so in the matters where executive is not

             dealing with any particular individual rather with a group and is

             taking decision as a policy to deal with them in matter of fiscal

             transactions with them, this Principle may not apply. However,

             this Court leaves this question as it is, as, the written notes of

             involvement of stakeholders i.e. petitioners and other existing

             calcinations units, in the process and the requirement of

             consulting them and taking them into confidence in the decision

             making process leading to the change of methodology. For this he

             placed strong reliance on the case of Mahabir Auto (Supra).

</p><p id="p_108">             70.        This Court may point out that the case of Mahabir Auto

             was decided by the Apex Court clearly on its own facts. The

             Court had found that the IOC had, in practice, treated the

             appellant company as its Lube Distributor and had recognized it

             and represented it to the 3rd parties, for a very long period, as its

             authorized distributor. Although, IOC had taken a stand before

             the Court that there was no approved contract between it and the

             appellant Company and there was irregular course of supply of

             lubricants to it and it was only an ad hoc arrangement between

             IOC and the Company for sale of lubricants to it, the Court found

             that this practice had continued for very long and IOC, in

             different communications and representations to the 3rd parties,

             had created an impression that the Company was acting on its

             behalf as an authorized distributor. The Court found that, due to

             such long practice and status given to the Company by the IOC in

             practice, it had created a right in the Company, at least to be

             heard in the matter, before discontinuing or denying further

             supply to it and ousting or black-listing it, making it disentitled to

             continue in the business of supply of lubricants. Hence, in the

             backdrop of the facts, Court held that fairness demanded that the

             Company ought to have been heard by the IOC before any

             adverse order was passed against it. The observations of the

             Court, in paragraph 18 of the judgment, in this context, have

             already been reproduced in this judgment earlier. However,

             concluding the judgment, findings of the Court in this respect in

             paragraph 20, were as follows :

                                 state enters the contractual field, it should be
                                 governed by the incidence of the contract. It is
                                 true that it may not be necessary to give reasons

                                 fairness must be there to the parties concerned,
                                 and having regard to the large number or the long

</p><p id="p_111">             72.             Facts of the present case are clearly distinguishable

             from the case of Mahabir Auto (Supra). Refineries of the IOC

             needed to evacuate R.P.C., a by-product of the refining process

             and otherwise a waste material for them, regularly from refining

             sites on account of space constraints. Calcination units came up

             in the periphery of Refineries as they found that this, otherwise

             waste material of the Refineries, would be useful for them for

             earning profit by converting it into C.P.C. and selling it to

             aluminium industries at a higher price. A pure commercial

             consideration was behind the setting up of these units. There was
 86   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          86 / 100




             no promise by the IOC or its Refineries, before the units were set

             up, that there would be guaranteed supply to them, in relation to

             their assessed capacity, nor subsequently any promise was made

             to them in this regard, nor these units entered into business of

             conversion of R.P.C. into C.P.C. and sale of the same to

             aluminium industries on behalf of the IOC. They were not acting

             on behalf of the IOC in any manner. It is true that, since many

             units had come up recently and had put a demand on the

             Refineries for supply of R.P.C., production of which was less

             than total assessed capacity of all the existing units, IOC, with

             some approval of the Ministry, had adopted a methodology of

             distributing/selling R.P.C. on pro-rata basis, taking into account

             the average of last three years offtake by them. But this was

             purely a working arrangement between them on economic

             considerations and, at no point of time, and, as admitted by

             learned senior counsel for the petitioners also, in formulating this

             methodology, IOC or its Refineries had ever taken these existing

             calcination units into confidence or had fixed up the price of

             R.P.C. for sale to them with their consultation. Thus, it is clear

             that, except for purchasing R.P.C. from the Refineries, on terms

             and conditions and price as fixed by the IOC, the existing

             calcination units had no say in the matter, nor were they at any

             point of time, given any commitment by the IOC or the
 87   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          87 / 100




             Refineries for dedicated supply of fixed quantity. These

             calcination units, therefore, were only beneficiaries to a

             commercial activity of the IOC and had no involvement in the

             process. In the circumstances, when the Ministry, after taking

             IOC into confidence, took a policy decision to change the

             methodology of sale by allotment on pro- rata basis to sale by

             open auction, there was no requirement of taking the existing

             calcination units also into confidence and there was no

             requirement to consult them in the matter. Moreover, facts of this

             case show that, it is only a change of methodology of sale of

             R.P.C., which has been introduced, taking precaution of interest

             of calcination units functioning in the periphery of the Refineries

             and in the State, by providing that, auction should be restricted

             for the units within the State. Thus, the existing calcination units

             still remain entitled for purchase of R.P.C., with floor price being

             fixed on almost same basis as being fixed earlier. If protecting

             their interest by restricting the auction for local units, the

             Ministry was also intending to get some more profit for the

             Corporation due to increased demand, this cannot be held as

             illegitimate expectation or an attempt by it to indulge into

             profiteering. It may be pointed out that, after the policy decision

             of the Ministry was notified by the impugned letter dated

             7.5.2012, petitioner Association had submitted representations
 88   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          88 / 100




             which did reach the Ministry and were taken into account and

             discussed and suitable replies were sent to the sources through

             which the representations of the petitioner Association was

             received. Hence, clearly submissions on behalf of the petitioners

             in this regard were considered and discussed, which was

             definitely prior to the issue of letter dated 7.6.2012 (Annexure-A

             with the rejoinder of the petitioners to the reply filed by

             respondent nos.1 to 3) (Page 508), to the IOC, issued in reply to

             its letter for review dated 14.5.2012. In any case, taking the

             „stakeholders‟ into confidence, even if considered as desirable,

             on its own surely cannot be a ground for holding the policy

             decision of the Ministry as illegal and unreasonable. Moreover, in

             terms of Mahabir Auto (Supra) their „submissions‟ were

             considered and discussed at the Ministry level before affirmance

             of the decision was communicated to the IOC by said letter dated

             7.6.2012.

             all Courts and authorities in matters covered by it. In the

             R.P.C. through allotment due to conduct of the existing

             calcination units. In the circumstances, a conscious decision was

             taken by the Ministry, after due deliberation in the meeting dated

             31.3.2012 and after consulting and obtaining the opinion of the

             IOC, for change of methodology to sale of R.P.C. through open

             auction. The interest of local calcination units were taken care of

             angle and applying any parameter, this decision, therefore, could

             not be held unreasonable or arbitrary. The guidelines placed on

             record by learned senior counsel for the IOC, drawn up for

             holding e-auction has further fine tuned the process of

             implementation of this              policy by   introducing sufficient

             safeguards for abuse or misuse by any unscrupulous elements,

             which does not need any detailed notice in this judgment. Suffice

             is to say that the safeguards provided in the said guidelines

<p id="p_115">             78.          So far as challenge to the motive of the Ministry for

             holding auction, as only profiteering, is concerned, learned

             Assistant Solicitor General of India has rightly submitted,verbally

             as well as in his written short notes, that had that been the motive,

             the Ministry would not have proposed to fix up floor price of

             R.P.C. at par with import price plus freight etc. Instead, to earn

             more profit, the Ministry would have managed to first raise

             Excise Duty etc. on the imported R.P.C. also, so that it could get

             more as Excise Duty etc. on the imported price and also more

             profit by consequential increase of floor price of the domestic

             R.P.C. He also rightly pointed out that had the profiteering been

             the only motive to change the methodology, instead of restricting

             the auction to the local calcination units, auction would have been

             thrown open to all units of the Country and even of abroad, which

             could have attracted buyers manifold and could have introduced

             tough competition raising bid amount. This Court considers the

             submissions of learned Assistant Solicitor General of India as

             correct. Mr. Giri, learned senior counsel for the petitioners failed

             to point out as to in what manner the decision of the Ministry was

             solely governed with profit motive and nothing else. It has been

             made clear by the Apex Court, more than once, that in

             commercial         and     fiscal       activity,   Government   and   its

             instrumentalities have also a legitimate right to keep profit also

             one of the considerations in mind and their action will be totally

             justified in this regard if it was combined with fair play in action

             and reasonableness. The decision of the Ministry, no doubt, was

             with a view to earn some more profit for the Corporation, which

             is already in red, but it had also taken into consideration the

             interest of local calcination units and the reasonableness of the

             price and thus had kept equitable considerations also in mind,

             which has rightly been pointed out by Mr. Kanth, learned senior

             counsel, is synonymous to reasonableness and fair play. Hence,

             this Court does not find that the charge of profiteering leveled by

             Mr. Giri, to the action of the Ministry has also any substance. As

             such, reliance placed by him on the judgment of Apex Court in

             Ltd. Vs. Union of India [(2007)2 SCC 640] in support of this

             submission, in the light of the facts of the present case, is totally

             misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_116">             79.            Mr. Giri has placed the earlier methodology, being

             adopted by the IOC since more than two decades in detail, as also

             the proposed change in methodology, communicated by it to the

             Ministry through its letter dated 10.1.2012 and talked highly

             about them. He submitted that the methodology adopted earlier

             was reasonable and equitable and in the interest of all existing

             calcination units as well as IOC. He submitted that the change

             proposed by the Director (Marketing) of the IOC through his said

             letter dated 10.1.2012, was with further improvement, by taking

             into account new units also and it ensured assured supply of

             R.P.C. to at least 25% of the assessed capacity of all calcination

             units and then surplus, if any, had to be allocated among existing

             calcination units commissioned before 31.3.2010 in the ratio of

             their assessed capacity or average offtake of last three years, and

             then the remaining R.P.C. was to be allocated to the new units in

             the ratio of their assessed capacity. He put great emphasis on the

             merits of this methodology and submitted that it served the

             purpose and interest of all concerned and was perfectly in
 95   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          95 / 100




             accordance with equitable principles. Hence, he submitted that,

             there was no need for change of policy by the Ministry for sale of

             R.P.C. through auction in place of its allocation in terms of the

             said methodology.
</p>
<p id="p_117">             80.         Submission of Mr. Giri may be correct. This Court also

             finds that the proposed change in the old methodology by the

             Director (Marketing) through his said letter did take care of the

             interest of the new units also. But the question arises, can this be

             a ground for holding new policy introduced by the Ministry as

             bad ? It is settled by catena of decisions of the Apex Court that, in

             matters of fiscal activities, Government and its instrumentalities

             have to be allowed more play in joints and its decision cannot be

             held bad or violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_37">Article 14</a> of the Constitution by holding

             it unreasonable and arbitrary, only on the ground that there could

             be a better decision in the matter in the interest of Government

             and its instrumentalities itself. It is settled that the decisions in the

             fiscal matters involve considerations of diverse factors and this

             Court is not equipped nor has competence to enter into thickets of

             complicated facts and technicalities involved in a fiscal decision

             and form its own opinion, as an appellate authority, and substitute

             it in place of the decision of the Government or its

             instrumentalities. As held by the Apex Court in paragraph 45 of

             the judgment in Bajaj Hindustan Limited (Supra), reproduced
 96   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

             hereinabove, "all administrative decisions in economic and social

             affairs are essentially ad hoc and experimental". Hence, this

             submission of Mr. Giri, though may be very appealing, but fails

             to qualify as a valid ground for this Court to interfere in the

             matter on its basis.
</p>
<p id="p_118">             81.             Mr. Giri, during his arguments, had very seriously

             harped upon the dangers underlying in sale of R.P.C. through

             auction and expressed serious apprehension of its misuse and

             abuse by the vested interests. He submitted that, in an open

             auction, any calcination unit, with deep pockets and greater

             financial resources, or a group of units, by forming a cartel, may

             bid for the entire available stock, offer exorbitant price and lift it,

             forcing other similar units, to solely dependent on import of

             R.P.C. of lower quality, which may not be very viable option, or

             to shut down. He submitted that some units may deliberately do it

             and stockpile R.P.C. much beyond their requirement only to

             reduce or obliterate competition in the field. In fact, when the

             opinion of the IOC was sought for by the Ministry through e-mail

             in the month of March, 2012, the Director (Marketing) through

             his reply e-mail dated 30.3.2012 had sent his comments, in which

             he had also pointed out some draw backs in the methodology of

             sale of R.P.C. through auction. In fact, inter alia, he had also

             expressed apprehension of possibility of formation of cartel.

                                          97 / 100




             Letter of the Executive Director, Consumer Cell of the IOC dated

             14.5.2012 requesting the Ministry for review of the decision also

             pointed out certain draw backs in the new methodology of sale of

             R.P.C. through auction. The representation of Association, filed

             for review of the decision of the Ministry, also raised same

             doubts. Notings of the file mentions that these were considered.

             From the notings, prima facie, it appears that, in the meeting

             dated 31.3.2012, views of Director (Marketing) were taken into

             account and, after discussion, a conscious decision was arrived at

             to change the methodology. The notings on the file shows that the

             said views of Director Consumer Cell and representation of the

             Association were also considered before confirmation of the

             decision by letter dated 7.6.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_119">             82.         But even before first auction could be held, petitioners

             have moved this Court. Thus, change of methodology has not

             been tried and tested even once. In the circumstances, lacuna and

             defects pointed out by the petitioners before this Court and by the

             IOC in its letters and Association in its repeated representations,

             remains in the realm of apprehension in appropriate working out

             of the new methodology. As observed by the Apex Court in Bajaj

             Hindustan Limited (Supra), any administrative decisions of the

             Government or its instrumentality in economic sphere are

             essentially ad hoc and experimental, which can always be

             changed or improved if the situation and events so require. But

             this apprehensions, or the draw backs pointed out in

             implementation of the changed methodology, cannot be a ground

             for striking down the methodology, more so, when it has not been

             given a try, even once.
</p>
<p id="p_120">             83.         Relying on the decision of the Apex Court in the case

             Hansraj Kehar [(1975)1 SCC 40], Mr. Kanth, learned senior

             counsel, also raised an issue that, in fact, depriving           new

             calcination units from competing and participating for purchase

             of R.P.C. itself may be violative of their rights guaranteed under

             <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_38">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India. But this Court does

             not consider it necessary to go into this issue further as, this Court

             has already come to the conclusion that no flaw could be found in

             the decision of the Ministry, communicated through impugned

             letter, calling for any interference in it. For the same reason, this

             Court does not find it necessary to consider and discuss the other

             judgments of the Apex Court, relied upon and referred by the

             learned counsels for the respective respondents, as, in view of the

             conclusions already arrived at herein above, it may only amount

             to adding pages to this judgment.

             conclusions arrived at in this judgment, in respect of various

             issues raised by Mr. Giri, learned senior counsel for the
 99   Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                          99 / 100




             petitioners, this Court finds that the petitioners have completely

             failed to make out a case and satisfy this Court of any necessity to

             interfere with the said policy decision of the Ministry reflected by

             its impugned communication dated 7.5.2012, as contained in

             Annexure-1 with the writ application. Consequently, this Court

             does not find any merit in this writ application and the same is

             dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_122">             85.           But before parting with the judgment, this Court will

             like to put a word of caution for the Ministry and the IOC as well

             as for MSTC, who is to hold auction of R.P.C. on behalf of IOC.

             It is difficult to express any opinion on the apprehensions of the

             petitioners in respect of some unit or group of units lifting entire

             stock. In its comments, communicated to the Ministry, through e-

             mail dated 30.3.2012 and again in its letter dated 14.5.2012, IOC

             has also raised some issues, which are apart from apprehensions

             of the calcination units. Since new methodology has not been

             given a try even once, whether these issues are real or are only

             imaginary and unfounded, cannot be commented upon. But this

             Court feels that they do call for, for the Ministry, the IOC and the

             MSTC to keep a very close eye on the working of the

             methodology and on each and every step in the process of auction

             and see to it that the apprehensions, raised in the said two

             communications of the IOC and in the representations of the
  100        Patna High Court CWJC No.10902 of 2012 dt.18-09-2012

                                                100 / 100




                    petitioner Association, do not come true. This will be more in the

                    interest of IOC itself than the calcination units participating in the

                    auction. This Court is assured that as and when IOC and the

                    MSTC come across any such action by any party, which may

                    raise questions on the impartiality, fairness and objectivity of

                    auction process, they will not hesitate to raise the issue

                    immediately with the Ministry requesting it to reconsider the

                    entire matter and devise ways and means to take remedial steps,

                    in consultation with all concerned.
