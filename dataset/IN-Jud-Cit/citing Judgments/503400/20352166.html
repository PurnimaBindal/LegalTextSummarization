</pre><p id="p_1">IA No.5961/2012 (Order 39 R.1 &amp; 2 CPC) &amp; IA No.7602/2012 (Order 39
Rule 4) in CS(OS) 851/2012

</p><p id="p_2">1.    The present application of the plaintiffs for interim stay being
I.A.No.5961/2012 came up for hearing for the first time before the court on
30.03.2012 when this court passed an ex parte ad interim injunction
restraining the defendant to export or sell their tea products i.e. „BAGAN
Fresh Tea‟ in the packaging which is either identical or deceptively similar
to the plaintiffs‟ packaging or to open other retail outlets in Delhi to sell
their product under the deceptively similar packaging till further orders. The
defendant has thereafter moved an application being IA No.7602/2012 under
Order 39 Rule 4 CPC seeking vacation of the said stay. Notice was issued on
the said application on 25.04.2012. The present order disposes off the said
two applications.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                Page 1 of 18</span>
<p id="p_3"> 2.    The accompanying plaint is filed by the plaintiffs seeking a decree to
restrain the defendant, etc. from selling, advertising, etc tea powder/tea
products sold as „BAGAN Fresh Tea‟ or any other hot beverage products in
packaging which is either identical or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs
packaging or which is a colourable imitation or substantial reproduction of
the plaintiffs‟ packaging. Other connected reliefs including decree for
rendition of accounts are also sought.
</p><p id="p_4">3.    The plaintiffs state in the plaint that they set up their sole
proprietorship concern „Aap Ki Pasand‟ in 1981 and since then they made it
the most reputed name in the luxury segment of the tea market. The
plaintiffs further submit that in 1981, he innovated a new way and manner of
packaging their tea. The innovative features and element of the said
packaging included packing tea in a soft paper packet shaped in a
rectangular sided cuboid. This packet is slipped into a fabric sleeve and is
closed at top by a traditional drawstring/dori. The said pack is then
decorated with ribbon and the label tied around the fabric bag. Lastly the
finished and ornamented pack is slipped inside a glossy see-through poly
sleeve. The plaintiffs claim to have carved a distinct niche for themselves in
the tea market owing to the said unique packaging and excellent quality of
products sold by them.
</p><p id="p_5">4.     In 1981, it is stated that they opened their first tea boutique in Delhi.
It is further stated that the plaintiffs‟ products have been exported to various
countries, their products are sold in all duty free shops in India at
International Airports and are also procured by the Cottage Industries,
Emporia in Delhi and Indian Tourism Development Corporation for their
various outlets and supplied to Air India for its in-flight sale. Some of the
earlier orders were from Maurya Sheraton in 1984 and Hyatt Regency, Delhi

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                  Page 2 of 18</span>
 in 1983 &amp; 1984. Various other such examples are stated. The details of the
plaintiffs‟ turnover are given in para 12 of the plaint. As per the said para,
the sales figure for the year 2010-11 is `5,49,68,752/- whereas the exports
are nearly `76 lacs.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    It is stressed that the trade dress of the plaintiffs consists of distinctive
elements which are completely unique and unknown prior to the plaintiffs
having commissioned their first packaging. The details of the uniqueness of
the packaging are elaborated in para 13 of the plaint and the relevant
description reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          'The soft paper pouch of cuboidal/rectangular shape,
           designed to make a unique look stand-up soft pack;
          The cuboidal shape is adorned with a textile packing bag
           over the primary cuboidal paper pouch;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          The packing bag is ornamented with a drawstring on top
           and flat rectangular bottom which facilities a stand-up
           pouch;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          Only Indian look fabrics are used for the packaging;
          The ornamentation with a centralised label and a ribbon
           to finish it constitutes a typical trade dress;
          The cuboidal shape is volume efficient as it makes a big
           faced pack. It is a tall look pack, albeit, flat in depth,
           that makes a large face of the pack. This facilities many
           marketing messages over a large face of pack;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          The cuboidal and flat bottom pack with a fabric bag is
           light in weight and hence economical to transport even
           by air. SAN-CHA brand even today is exported by air as
           it is an economical and efficient (airworthy of freight) in
           freight cost;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">          Last but not the least, the packing bag (in various textiles) has
           an Indian look and Indian feel;"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">6.    Hence, it is urged that packaging is unique and distinctive and is
protectable under the statute and under common law including under law of
passing off. It is further urged that the packaging is innovative/creative and
is a original artistic work under <a href="/doc/121334999/" id="a_1">Section 2(c)</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                    Page 3 of 18</span>
 is capable of protection.
</p><p id="p_8">7.    It is further urged that in 2011, it was revealed to the plaintiffs that the
defendant‟s product has identical packaging, ornamentation, colour range,
material etc. used for loose tea. The look of the defendant‟s product from a
distance would give an unmistakable impression of the plaintiffs‟ product.
Hence, it is urged that the defendant has copied and imitated the packaging
of the plaintiffs. The imitation is completely dishonest and a mala fide
attempt to take advantage of the hard-earned market built by the plaintiffs.
The defendant has started selling the infringing packet only few months
back. The plaintiffs are stated to have protested in mid 2011. Hence, the
present suit has been filed.
</p><p id="p_9">8.    The defendant has contested the claim of the plaintiffs and has filed
its written statement. The defendant states that they have been marketing
teas in fancy Indian patterned fabric gift packs since 2008 and have built up
a significant reputation and market.
</p><p id="p_10">9.     It is firstly urged that the packing that the plaintiffs seek to restrain is
generic and has no distinctive value qua its products. It is urged that in
order to increase export of tea from India various players in the said industry
have come with different unique ideas. To give an Indian touch various
traders and packers have started packaging in small pouches and have added
a design to lure foreign buyers to buy tea in said pouch as gift
articles/souvenirs. Hence the get-up of the plaintiff, signifying an Indian
origin with traditional fabric pouches, it is stated is absolutely generic to the
trade. It is further urged that there are several other players in the market
segment who are using decorative packaging. Some of the players have been
in the market for over 50 years. Reference is made to some of them like
Golden Tips, Mittal Group of Companies and New Directions Exports and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                    Page 4 of 18</span>
 Crafts.
</p><p id="p_11">10.   It is further stated that the decoration qua the pouch on the basis of
which plaintiffs are claiming distinctiveness is actually something that is
freely available in the market and various expensive merchandize products
and gifts are often sold in this kind of pouch to give the product a feeling of
Indianness and distinctiveness. In fact, it is urged that these pouches are
freely exchanged between people on important occasions such as weddings
and festivals like Diwali, etc. and these pouches have existed for many
years before the plaintiffs commenced trading.
</p><p id="p_12">11.   It is secondly urged that the packaging which plaintiffs seek to protect
is actually a packaging which serves a useful purpose, namely, preserving
tea and its delicate flavour. If the tea is sold in bulk, it can be sold in wooden
chests or paper sacks, etc. In retail when it is sold in small quantity, it must
be sold in small packages which keep it dry, air tight and safe from being
crushed. It is further urged that most of the tea producers who package and
sell tea to retail consumers focusing on the gift and export market have the
following requirements:- (a) packaging must be airtight, (b) packaging must
be traditional or ethnic and indicate an Indian origin or connection, (c)
packaging must be light and retail sized and (d) appearance of gift wrapping
must be there.
</p><p id="p_13">12.   It is next urged that the drinkers of tea are very particular about the
brand of tea they consume, for example Earl Grey, Oolong, etc. Hence,
when they go to a store or emporium, consumers search for brand or search
for a variety of leaf. No consumer of tea will associate a brand of tea with a
vague or a generic method of packaging. It is further urged that regular tea
available in Indian market costs about `500/- per Kg. However, gift packed
aromatic organic teas cost upto `20,000/- per Kg. The tea packaged and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                   Page 5 of 18</span>
 sold by the plaintiffs and defendant costs roughly around ` 4,000/- per Kg
and is therefore consumed by rich and educated strata of society who cannot
possibly be deceived by mere resemblance of tea based on a generic mode
of packaging.
</p><p id="p_14">13.   It is fourthly urged that there are various distinguishing factors in the
style and get up of the two brands and the consumers are hence able to
distinguish between the same. It is urged that the pouches of the defendant
bear the label „BAGAN Fresh' in a very conspicuous manner dispelling any
apprehension whatsoever of any customer or consumer being deceived. The
logo of the plaintiffs is different from the logo of the defendant. The brand
of the plaintiff „Aap Ki Pasand‟ is printed in gold with a wreath whereas the
brand of the defendant „BAGAN Fresh‟ is printed within a green box also
depicting a yellow green leaf. There is stated to be a marked difference in
colour scheme of both the brands. Various other features are listed to try
and argue that there are many dis-similarities between the packaging and get
up of the plaintiffs and defendant.
</p><p id="p_15">14.   It is next urged that the defendant has been in the market since 2008
and the plaintiff has failed to raise any objection. Hence, it is urged that the
present suit is a belated attempt to suppress competition inasmuch as the
defendant has acquired considerable goodwill and made a name for itself in
the market with its latest advent into Delhi Airports and the defendant poses
a serious threat to the business of the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_16">15.   Learned counsel for the plaintiff has strenuously urged that the
plaintiffs have designed a unique and innovative way of packaging their tea
using ethnic Indian fabric material. She relies on various documents filed
alongwith the plaint to submit that the plaintiff enjoys a great reputation and
goodwill including the unique packaging. Reliance is placed on Section 2

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                  Page 6 of 18</span>
 (zb) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks Act</a> whereunder trademark is now expressly defined
to mean a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is
capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of
others and includes the shape of goods, their packaging and combination of
colours. Reliance is placed on the photographs of the packaging of the
plaintiff which are filed alongwith the plaint and also the photographs of the
packaging being used by the defendant to submit that the defendant is
malafidely copying the trade dress of the plaintiff with an attempt to pass off
its goods as that of the plaintiff. Reliance is placed on the annual turn-over
of the plaintiff which is placed on record where it is claimed that for the
Financial Year 2010-11 the plaintiff no.1 had a turn-over of `5.49 crores and
plaintiff no.2 had a turnover of `75.9lacs. Reliance is also placed on various
advertisements issued pertaining to the product of the plaintiff starting from
an advertisement issued in the Economic Times on 11.01.1992. Reliance is
placed on copies of Advertisements issued for the plaintiff‟s product on
09.11.1993, 16.11.1993, 20.07.1996, 25.08.1996, and so on which have been
placed on record. It is urged that the documents of the plaintiffs show that
the plaintiff had been extensively advertising for now nearly 30 years.
Reliance is also placed upon certain orders received on 19.11.1985 and
08.05.1986 from the Ministry of External Affairs in connection with the visit
of the Prime Minister of India abroad to Japan and African countries
respectively. Another such communication is dated 14.6.2010 in connection
with the visit of the Prime Minister to Canada for G-20 Summit. Reliance is
also placed upon an Order dated 8.11.1984 received from Hotel Hyatt
Regency, Delhi and dated 24.9.1985 from Hotel Maurya Sheraton. It is
further urged that the trade mark of the plaintiff i.e. San-cha (Label) is duly
registered as per Registration Certificate dated 08.08.1989. Based on the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                 Page 7 of 18</span>
 above submissions it is urged that the unique packaging of the plaintiff with
its various distinguishing features elaborated as above is closely identified
with the product of the plaintiff.      It is urged that the packaging now
introduced by the defendant is a dishonest attempt to pass off its product as
that of the plaintiff and hence it is urged that the ex parte interim order
passed by this Court on 30.3.2012 should be continued till pendency of the
present Suit.
</p><p id="p_17">16.   Learned counsel for the plaintiffs relies upon the judgment in the case
of <a href="/doc/1335881/" id="a_3">Heinz Italia &amp; Anr. vs. Dabur India Ltd</a>., (2007) 6 SCC 1 where the
Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that colour scheme and overall effect of the
packaging has to be seen. The said judgment relied upon the case of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_4">Cadila
Healthcare Limited vs Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited</a>, (2001) 5 SCC 753
where it was held that in a passing of action similarities rather than dis-
similarities have to be taken note of by the court. Reliance is also placed on
the case of <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_5">Parle Products Pvt. Ltd. vs. J.P. and Co. Mysore</a>, (1972) 1 SCC
618 where the court was of the view that in a passing off action minor
details are not to be looked into but the broad features. Reliance is also
placed on the case of Gorbatschow Wodka KG. Vs. John Distilleries Ltd.,
2011 (4) MhLj 842 where the Bombay High Court held that the expression
trade mark is now expressly defined and includes the shape of the goods. In
that case the court based on the material placed on record by the plaintiff
prima facie held that integral part of the plaintiff‟s product lies in the shape
of the bottle in which the Vodka is sold though the shape of the bottle has no
functional relationship with the nature or quality of the product. Reliance is
also placed on the case of Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd. vs. Borden Inc. &amp;
Ors., 1990 (RPC) 341 where it was held that passing off action is possible
on the get up of the plaintiff‟s goods. Reliance is also placed on the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                  Page 8 of 18</span>
 judgments in the cases of <a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_6">Baker Hughes Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. Hiroo Khushalani &amp;

and Anr</a>., 2002(24)PTC355(Del) to contend that get up of the good can be a
basis for a passing off action in the facts and circumstances of the present
case.
</p><p id="p_18">17.     Learned counsel appearing for the defendant on the other hand has
urged that there are enough reasons to vacate the interim orders passed by
this Court. It is strenuously urged that firstly the trade dress which is being
used by the plaintiff is quite common to the trade inasmuch as packaging
using traditional Indian fabric is a common occurrence. It is urged that there
are already eight to ten manufacturers/dealers in the market using a trade
dress akin to that of the plaintiff. It is secondly urged that the trade dress of
the plaintiff has no innovation nor is it unique in any manner. Hence, it is
urged that the said trade dress is entitled to no protection. It is thirdly urged
that even if the trade dress was similar where the trademarks are different
there would be no question of passing off and no injunction should be
granted. It is fourthly urged that the present application of the plaintiff and
reliefs sought are liable to be rejected on account of delay and laches. It is
urged that the defendant has been in the market since 2008 and has carved
out a market and place for itself. Hence, it is urged that the present suit
filed in 2012 and on account of this delay the plaintiff is not entitled to any
interim relief. It is further urged that the present litigation is only an attempt
to stifle competition as the defendant has made a name for itself.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                    Page 9 of 18</span>
<p id="p_19"> 18.   Learned counsel for the defendant relies upon the judgement of the
Division Bench of this High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1064244/" id="a_11">Kellogg Company vs.
Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai &amp; Anr</a>. 62 (1996) DLT 79 to contend that where
even prima facie get ups are similar, the fact that the brand‟s name is
prominently displayed on the different packets would make it a fit case for
not grant of interim injunction. Reliance is also placed on <a href="/doc/279539/" id="a_12">Samsonite
Corporation &amp; Anr. vs. Vijay Sales</a> 73(1998) DLT 732 where this court held
that the plaintiff has to establish that its trade dress or get up has become by
use distinctive of the plaintiff‟s goods. The word „distinctive‟ would be
taken as meaning factually distinctive and not mere assertion. The plaintiff
has to establish that the trade dress or get up of the plaintiff has become
associated exclusively with the products of the plaintiff. Reliance is also
placed on the judgment of England and Wales High Court (Chancery
Division) in the case of M.Saper LD. vs. Specter's LD. And Boxes Ltd., 13
(R.P.C.) 218 where it was held that competition must remain free inasmuch
as the defendant does no wrong by entering in the market created by another
and competing with its creator.
</p><p id="p_20">19.   It is true that under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_13">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 the shape of a good
has been included in the definition of trade mark. The relevant portion of
<a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_14">Section 2(zb)</a> reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "(zb) "Trade Mark" means a mark capable of being represented
      graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or
      services of one person from those of others and may include
      shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colour"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">20.   The Bombay High Court in the case of Gorbatschow Wodka KG. Vs.
John Distilleries Ltd. (supra) while dealing with the shape of a bottle of
Vodka on facts based on material placed on record by the plaintiff noted that
prima facie the plaintiff has established a reputation and integral part of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                  Page 10 of 18</span>
 reputation lies in the shape of the bottle in which the Vodka is sold. In paras
17 the court held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "17. Prima facie, a comparison of the shape of the bottle which
      has been adopted by the defendant with the bottle of the
      plaintiff would show us striking similarity. As a matter of fact,
      counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant did, during the
      course of the submission, concede that there are similarities.
      Counsel, however, sought to urge that there are differences
      between the shape of the bottle which has been adopted by the
      plaintiff and shape of the bottle that has been adopted by the
      defendant and these differences would emerge if the bottles
      were to be compared, as it were, side by side.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">21.   The court in the above case further held that the defendant is engaged
in the same trade and it was impossible to accept that the defendant would
not have been conscious of the shape which was used by the plaintiff for its
bottle of Vodka. The adoption of the shape by the defendant was held to be
prima facie not honest. The court in the facts granted an appropriate interim
injunction in favour of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_23">22.   Similarly the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1335881/" id="a_15">Heinz Italia &amp;
Anr. vs. Dabur India Ltd</a>.(supra) which pertains to an action against the
defendant from using the mark and the deceptive packaging in paragraph 18
held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "18. ... We are of the opinion however that the colour scheme
      and the overall effect of the packaging has to be seen. We have
      also examined Item D individually which is the exclusive
      packaging for Glucose-D; the one on the extreme left being the
      packaging in the year 1989, the one in the middle being the one
      for the year 2000 (which is impugned in the present suit) and
      the third on the extreme right which is the subject-matter of the
      suit in Calcutta which has been stayed on the application made
      by the respondent. We are of the opinion that the packaging of
      Glucose-D and Glucon-D is so similar that it can easily confuse
      a purchaser. We also feel that mere fact that the respondents
      have time and again made small changes in their packaging is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                 Page 11 of 18</span>
       an attempt to continue to mislead the purchaser and to make it
      more difficult for the appellants to protect their mark, which the
      record shows has acquired an enviable reputation in the market
      which is sought to be exploited by the respondent."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">23.   The real issue is as to whether the plaintiff by long user can claim
exclusive rights to the trade dress/packaging being used by it.
</p><p id="p_25">24.   Lets come to the facts of this case. As per the plaint and the
accompanying documents, the plaintiffs have started using the innovative
manner of packaging of their tea since 1981. The unique part of the packing
features    are   reproduced   in   para   5   above.   Photographs     of   the
packaging/pouch are filed.     They were also produced physically in Court.
The sales figures of plaintiff No.1 are placed on record, which reads as
follows:-
</p><pre id="pre_2">      Fin.Years      Turnover

</pre><p id="p_27">25.    These figures are duly supported by a certificate of Mr. V.K. Thapar
Chartered    Accountant.    The plaintiff has    also   placed   on    record
advertisements, newspaper features and communications to show that the
product is being advertised right since the beginning. The advertisements
relate to and are from the year 1992 onwards. Advertisements issued in the
Economic Times, The Pioneer, Times of India, Swagat In-flight magazine of
Indian Airlines, etc. have been placed on record. Reliance is also placed on
orders received from Ministry of External Affairs in connection with the
visit of the Prime Minister abroad. A communication dated 19.11.1985 from
the Ministry of External Affairs placing an order for tea caddies and in
connection with the Prime Minister‟s visit to Japan is on record. Similar is
an order dated 08.05.1986 in connection with the Prime Minister‟s visit to
African countries. Similar correspondences pertaining to similar other
foreign delegations are also placed on record. The plaintiff has also placed
on record an order dated 08.11.1984 received from hotel Hyatt Regency
Delhi and an order dated 24.09.1985 from Hotel Maurya Sheraton, New
Delhi. On the basis of long usage for the last more than 30 years and on the
basis of this reputation and turnover and its niche mark, the plaintiff has
strenuously urged that the packaging of the plaintiff is unique, innovative
and in the market the packaging is commonly associated as of belonging to
the plaintiffs and their products.
</p><p id="p_28">26.    What is the effect of the above evidence placed on record by the
plaintiff.   The advertisements clearly show the product of the plaintiff
including the packaging that is being used and on account of which the
plaintiff has filed the present Suit for action of passing off.           The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                Page 13 of 18</span>
 advertisements start from 1992. The turn-over of the plaintiff is placed on
record supported by a certificate of the Chartered Accountant. The turn-
over is stated to be attained in the form of sales through the said packaging
which is subject matter of the present Suit. The usage of the brand in the
packaging is long and reasonably extensive. The plaintiff has prima facie
proved that the packaging which is subject matter of the present Suit which
is described in para 5 above is in long use by the plaintiff. The long user by
the plaintiff is not really denied. The evidence also prima facie for the
purpose of disposal of this application shows that the trade dress/packaging
of the plaintiff is part of the essential features on the basis of which the
product of the plaintiff is identified. The trade dress/packaging is prima facie
distinctive and forms an intrinsic part of the goodwill and reputation of the
plaintiff in the market.
</p><p id="p_29">27.    What has been strenuously urged by the learned counsel for the
defendant is that the trade dress being used by the plaintiff is common in the
trade and that it is essentially a traditional Indian fabric which is used by
various manufactures and producers in the market including the defendant
and there is no innovation involved in the same. It is further urged that there
are 8 to 10 other manufactures and dealers in the market which use trade
dress akin to that of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_30">       A perusal of the photographs placed on record by the plaintiffs and
the packets that were produced during the course of arguments would show
that the packaging being used by the plaintiffs has some unique features. It
is no doubt that it is using Indian fabric but that per se is not the only feature
of the packaging. The cuboidal/rectangular shape with the unique stand-up
pack with Indian look fabric with the traditional dori on top with a glossy
packing is being used.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                   Page 14 of 18</span>
<p id="p_31">       The defendant has placed on record some photographs of packaging
used by other manufactures. Even in the written statement the defendant has
depicted pictures of packaging being used by other manufacturers. A close
look of these pictures would show that all kinds of packaging are being used
by the said so called other manufacturers some of which are using the
traditional Indian fabric. Only some of the packaging appears to be some
what identical to that of the plaintiff. However there are no details placed on
record of the date since when these packaging are used by the said
manufactures and the extent of market that they have. The said instances
placed on record by the defendant appear to be stray incidents and do not in
any way dilute the case of the plaintiff. Even otherwise, the use of similar
marks or trade dress by a third party cannot be a defence to an illegal act of
passing off. Reference may be had to the judgment of this Court in the case
of <a href="/doc/48216667/" id="a_16">Pankaj Goel vs. Dabur India Ltd</a>., (supra).
</p><p id="p_32">28.   Learned counsel for the defendant has also relied heavily on the
judgment of the Division Bench of this High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1064244/" id="a_17">Kellogg
Company vs. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai &amp; Anr</a>. (supra) to contend that
where the trade mark is being used on the packaging there can be no
question of passing off based on packaging.
</p><p id="p_33">29.   A perusal of the said judgment would show that it was based on the
facts of the case.    The plaintiff in that case had filed the Suit with a
grievance that the carton in which the defendant was selling corn flakes was
more or less similar in size to that of the plaintiff‟s carton and that the carton
was likely to confuse buyers of corn flakes and there was every likelihood of
the consumers purchasing the defendant‟s goods in the belief that they were
of the plaintiff/appellant. The learned Single Judge came to a conclusion
that the trade dress of the defendant in that case was entirely different from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                   Page 15 of 18</span>
 the trade dress of the plaintiff and there is absolutely no scope for confusion.
In the appeal based on the facts, the Division Bench stated that there were no
grounds made out to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge
refusing injunction.
</p><p id="p_34">30.   Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff has strenuously urged that
even otherwise the judgment in <a href="/doc/1064244/" id="a_18">Kellogg Company vs. Pravin Kumar
Bhadabhai &amp; Anr</a>. (supra) is no longer a good law and that this was noted by
this Court in the case of N. Ranga Rao and Sons versus Anil Garg and Ors.,
2006 (32) PTC 15. However, I need not go into this submission in view of
the fact that in my view the Kellogg‟s judgment was made based on the facts
that the trade dress of the defendant was entirely different from the trade
dress of the plaintiff and there was absolutely no scope for confusion.
</p><p id="p_35">31.   Another contention which has been strenuously urged by the
defendant is that the defendant claims to have been using velvet pouches for
packing its product since 2008 and claims that the plaintiff has needlessly
delayed in filing of the present Suit and that the defendant has in the
meantime carved a market for itself. This submission has to be rejected.
The defendant has not really been able to show that it has been using
identical packaging as that of the plaintiff since 2008.
</p><p id="p_36">32.   As far as the defendant‟s contention is concerned the first thing that
strikes one‟s mind is that there is a complete absence of any attempt to show
the turnover of the defendant in the tea market or the extent of use of the
packaging akin to that of the packaging of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_37">      The defendant has placed on record copies of the invoices which it
has raised for sale of its tea products starting from 2008. A perusal of these
invoices would however show that the defendant is using all kinds of
packages for marketing its product. For example, Invoice No.002 dated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                  Page 16 of 18</span>
 20.08.2008 shows use of velvet pouch, jute pouch, paper mache box, gift
pack, etc.
      One also cannot help noticing that the defendant has placed on record
three bills from one Kailash Chand dated 28.11.2008, 01.12.2008 and
30.12.2008 stating purchase of velvet bags. The purpose of these bills is to
obviously try and show that the defendant has been using the velvet pouch
since 2008. However, these invoices would show that the bills are though
dated over a period of almost one month, all bear invoice numbers in
sequence. Namely, bill dated 28.11.2008 bears bill No.332, bill dated
01.12.2008 bears bill No.333 and bill dated 30.12.2008 bears bill No.334.
</p><p id="p_38">      Clearly not much reliance can be placed on these documents. The
contention of defendant cannot be accepted.
</p><p id="p_39">33.   Reference now may be had to the observations of the Supreme Court
in the case of Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhai Shah &amp; Anr.,(supra) where
in paragraph 13 the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        "13. In an action for passing-off it is usual, rather essential, to
        seek an injunction, temporary or ad-interim. The principles for
        the grant of such injunction are the same as in the case of any
        other action against injury complained of. The plaintiff must
        prove a prima facie case, availability of balance of
        convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable
        injury in the absence of grant of injunction. According to
        Kerly (ibid, para 16.16) passing-off cases are often cases of
        deliberate and intentional misrepresentation, but it is well-
        settled that fraud is not a necessary element of the right of
        action, and the absence of an intention to deceive is not a
        defence, though proof of fraudulent intention may materially
        assist a plaintiff in establishing probability of deception.
        Christopher Wad low in Law of Passing-Off (1995 Edition, at
        p.3.06) states that the plaintiff does not have to prove actual
        damage in order to succeed in an action for passing-off.
        Likelihood of damage is sufficient. The same learned author
        states that the defendant's state of mind is wholly irrelevant to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                   Page 17 of 18</span>
         the existence of the cause of action for passing-off (ibid, paras
        4.20 and 7.15). As to how the injunction granted by the Court
        would shape depends on the facts and circumstances of each
        case. Where a defendant has imitated or adopted the plaintiff's
        distinctive trade mark or business name, the order may be an
        absolute injunction that he would not use or carry on business
        under that name, (Kerly, ibid, para 16.97)."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_40">34.   In my view the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of long
continuous user of the trade dress/packaging which is the subject matter of
the present Suit. The nature and extent of the user by the defendant of the
Packaging/Trade Dress which is subject matter of this suit is not clear.
Balance of convenience would hence be in favour of the plaintiff and against
the defendant. The plaintiffs are likely to suffer an irreparable loss and
injury in case, ex parte injunction granted by this Court is not continued.
</p><p id="p_41">35.   In view of the above, the present application IA No.5961/2012 is
allowed and the defendant is restrained from selling or dealing with tea
products in packaging using the brand name „BAGAN Fresh‟ which is
identical or deceptively similar to the plaintiff‟s packaging as depicted by
the plaintiff in the documents filed alongwith the plaint and as elaborated in
paragraph 5 above till pendency of the accompanying suit.

is dismissed.
