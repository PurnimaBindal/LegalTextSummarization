<p id="p_1">     1. The appellant as a sole proprietor of M/s Prakash Agricultural

        Industries (India) filed an application with the Trade Mark

        Registry on 22.06.1979 seeking registration of the trade mark

        „SWARAJ‟ in respect of Diesel Oil Engines (not for land

        vehicles), hand water pumps and parts thereof in Class 7 for

        sale in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,

        Rajasthan, Bihar and Haryana.                The appellant claimed user of

         the mark since 1975 on an advertisement of the mark in the

        Trade Mark Journal on 16.03.1984.                   The respondent gave a

        notice of intention to oppose the registration of the mark on

        the ground that it was violative of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_1">Sections 11</a>, <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_2">12</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1587793/" id="a_3">18</a> of the

        Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_4">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958 („the said Act‟ for

        short). On completion of trial on this question, the Registrar

        was pleased to dismiss the opposition and accepted the

        request for registration of the mark.
</p>
<p id="p_2">    2. Respondent aggrieved by                  this    Order,     preferred C.M.(M)

        No.49/1994 and succeeded vide Order dated 27.01.1997 in

        seeking a remand for fresh consideration of the matter after

        giving sufficient opportunities to the parties to lead their

        evidence.         Fresh evidence was filed and once again the

        opposition to the mark was dismissed by the Order dated

        30.12.1997.        Respondent aggrieved by this Order preferred

        C.M.(M) No.97/98 before the learned Single Judge of this Court

        (as he then was) which was allowed on 14.01.2000.

</p><p id="p_3">    3. The present appeal has thereafter been preferred under

        <a href="/doc/1294406/" id="a_5">Section 109</a> (5) of the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">    4. The opposition arose on account of the claim of the

        respondent that the trade mark „SWARAJ‟ was registered in its

        name under Class 12 on 12.12.1977 for tractors and parts

        thereof and on 13.05.1986 in respect of hand tools in Class 8

        as also on 13.05.1986 in respect of the tractors/harvester

        combines, forklifts and parts thereof in Class 12.                              The

        respondent claimed identity of marks in respect of similar

        goods as both sets of goods are used in agricultural activity,


_____________________________________________________________________________________________
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">OCJA No.3/2000                                                                   Page 2 of 12</span>
         the source of supply is same from the concerned shops and

        there is commonality of the consumer. Thus, the plea raised

        was of likelihood of discipline or causing confusion in the mind

        of the consumer in respect of the trade source.                                 The

        respondent claimed reputation on account of extensive use

        and pleaded that the registration of the mark of the appellant

        is prohibited on that account in view of the provisions of

        <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_6">Section 11</a> (a) of the said Act.                   On the other hand, the

        appellant pleaded that the goods are quite similar in nature in

        attracting the provisions of <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_7">Section 10</a> of the said Act.

</p><p id="p_5">    5. The impugned order has discussed the aforesaid pleas and

        the finding of the Registrar is that there was no likelihood of

        deception.        The plea of the respondent that the evidence

        produced by the appellant of user from 1975 to 1980 being of

        a doubtful nature has also been considered.                     The alternative

        plea of an honest concurrent user has also been examined.

</p><p id="p_6">    6. The learned Single Judge has found that the undisputed facts

        show the registration of the mark of the respondent. The sale

        figures for tractors show a limited sale between October, 1974

        to June, 1975. The application of the appellant was filed on

        22.06.1979 but they claimed user from 01.06.1975. The two

        marks were identical. The learned Judge has observed that a

        tractor also has an engine fitted to it and is operated with

        diesel oil.      It has a four-stroke engine whereas harvester

        combines are the attachments to the tractor.                       On the other

        hand, the goods of the appellant are a unit for conversion of

        chemical energy of diesel oil into mechanical energy.                        Thus,


_____________________________________________________________________________________________
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">OCJA No.3/2000                                                                   Page 3 of 12</span>
         though the goods may not be same in a technical sense but

        both the equipments are machines for conversion of chemical

        energy into mechanical energy.                      The important aspect

        considered is the user which is primarily in agricultural activity

        forming one class of consumers with the trade channels being

        the same.        Thus, the finding is of a broad similarity, affinity

        and other circumstances like the purchasing public and thus if

        the dispute is judged from a commercial and business point of

        view, there is a chance of confusion and deception in the

        minds of the purchasing public. A finding has also been given

        that the respondent has been in the trade from 1972,

        registration was obtained in 1977 while the appellant filed an

        application for registration in June, 1979 though alleging user

        from 01.06.1975. The knowledge is attributed to the appellant

        on the ground that while making the application they

        consciously made the same for diesel oil engines (not for land

        vehicles) being aware of the fact that for the tractors the mark

        was already registered and thus sought to specifically include

        the goods of the respondent and there cannot thus be an

        honest concurrent user.
</p>
<p id="p_7">    7. Learned        counsel      for    the    appellant,       at    the    inception,

        emphasized that the learned Single Judge of this Court ought

        not to have interfered lightly with the Order of the Registrar of

        Trade Marks merely because another conclusion was possible

        on the basis of the material on record.                   It was pleaded that

        the main aspect of the case was the likelihood of causing

        confusion in the minds of the purchasing public and the


_____________________________________________________________________________________________
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">OCJA No.3/2000                                                                   Page 4 of 12</span>
         products of the appellant and respondent were registered in

        different classes. It was thus submitted that the prohibition of

        registration of the mark would arise in case of an identical or

        deceptively similar trade mark as per <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_8">Section 12(1)</a> of the said

        Act and in view of the registration of the mark being under

        separate classes there was no such likelihood.                       It was also

        emphasized that the relevant date was the date of application.

        The alternative submission once again advanced was based on

        the plea of honest concurrent user under <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_9">Section 12(3)</a> of the

        said Act. It was pleaded on behalf of the appellant that the

        registration of the mark and the sale of goods are two different

        aspects and though the appeal succeeded no action had ever

        been taken by the respondent from the inception of the

        registration of the mark in the form of the injunctive relief to

        prevent the appellant from selling its product under the mark

        in question, which is a factor to be taken into account.

</p><p id="p_8">    8. Learned counsel for the appellant referred to the judgments of

        the learned Single Judges of the Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/1601270/" id="a_10">Gopal

        Hossiery v. The Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks and Others</a>;

        Sons Inc. &amp; Anr.; PTC (Suppl) (1) 567 to advance the plea of

        honest concurrent user.              In this regard, judgments of the

        Learned counsel also referred to the observations of the

        in combination to come to a conclusion whether a mark was

        likely to deceive or cause confusion.

<p id="p_9">    9. Learned counsel also referred to the judgment in Vishnudas

        Trading as <a href="/doc/1747781/" id="a_15">Vishnudas Kishendas v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co.

        Ltd</a>.; 1996 PTC (16) to support the plea arising out the word

        „SWARAJ‟ not being an invented word but one of common use.

        Learned counsel also emphasized that while considering the

        present appeal the principles of a second appeal are not to be

        applied and the High Court has all the powers of the Registrar

        and can make any order which the Registrar could make under

        the said Act.       In this behalf, learned counsel referred to the

        observations in <a href="/doc/623545/" id="a_16">Prem Nath Mayer v. Registrar of Trade Marks

        and Anr</a>.; AIR 1972 Calcutta 261 in para 31 and 33, which are

              the respondent. In dealing with this appeal this Court
              is not a Court of second appeal as contemplated by
              Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appeal
              which this Court is dealing with, is not from the
              judgment of Court subordinate to the High Court. The

              questions of fact. The provisions of the Act enjoin this
              Court to determine questions of deception, confusion
              and deceptive similarity, and that can only be done

        has supported the impugned judgment to contend that the

        trade marks were identical to both in relation to products for

        agriculture.       Learned counsel invited our attention to the

        observations made even by the Registrar while recording his

        finding that the evidence filed by the respondent definitely

        indicated a good reputation of their trade mark „SWARAJ in

        respect of their goods namely tractors but came to the

        conclusion that since the goods are of different descriptions, it

        nullifies the effect of likelihood of confusion ensuing due to the

        identicalness of the trade marks.                The relevant observations

        are reproduced below:

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "The evidence filed by the opponents definitely

              namely, tractors. Since the applicant goods as
              held above are of different description, it
              nullifies the effect of likelihood of confusion
              ensuing due to the identicalness in trade
              marks."

</p><p id="p_17">     11.         Learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that

        the documents filed by the appellant as evidence of reputation

        are highly unreliable. The bills filed by the appellant show the

        trademark of the appellant as „PRAKASH‟ in hand while

        describing the goods sold word „SWARAJ‟ has been written.

        The other bills are also written in hand as „SWARAJ‟.                    It is thus

        submitted that the trade mark really utilized by the appellant

        is „PRAKASH‟ and unreliable evidence has been led to sale

        under the trade mark „SWARAJ‟.
</p>
<p id="p_18">    12.         Learned counsel for the respondent emphasized that

        the products have the same trade source for the sale and

        there are common dealers through whom sales take place.

        The application for registration of the mark by the appellant

        was made only in 1979 though he claimed sale from 1975.

        taken into consideration to decide whether the goods of same

        description are :
</p>
<p id="p_20">        a) Nature and composition of the goods

</p><p id="p_21">        b) Respective uses and functions.

        substantially analogous in kind or commonly used as mere

        substitute or alternative to one another.                  Learned counsel to

</p>
<p id="p_24">    14.          Learned counsel submitted that with reference to the

        order passed by the Trade Mark Registry, Bombay, same can

        be of assistance though not a binding force where the mark

        „ESCORT‟ was sought to be registered for diesel engines and

        was opposed by the proprietors of trade mark of the same

        name for agricultural machinery, tractors, motor cycles etc. It

        was found that the applicants had copied the trade mark and

        the thus the trade name could not be registered.                         We may

        state at this stage itself that, as pointed out by learned

        counsel for the appellant, one aspect considered in this case is

        the manner of writing „ESCORTS‟ which was also similar.

        Learned counsel for the respondent also referred to the

        Judgment of the Chancery Division in the matter of Turney and

        Sons‟ Trade Mark; 1984 10 TLR 175 where it has been

        observed that in deciding whether an application is bona fide

        or not the first question to be asked is as to why the applicant

        seeks to use this mark which a great many people think is

        calculated to deceive especially when it is not a mark being

        used by them for some time but a new mark.                          If suspicious

        circumstances are found, then the trade mark ought not to be

        registered.

</p><p id="p_26">     15.          Lastly learned counsel referred to the Judgment of the

        Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1966437/" id="a_25">Dalip Chand Aggarwal &amp; Ors.v.

        M/s Escorts Ltd., New Delhi</a>; AIR 1981 Delhi 150 to deal with

        the aspect of scope of jurisdiction to rebut the plea of the

        learned Single Judge in respect of findings of the Registrar

        being interfered lightly.             It was observed that a Registrar

        having expert familiarity with the subject, his finding should

        not be lightly interfered with by the appellant court, but at the

        same time the discretion of the Registrar does not relieve the

        court of its individual responsibility. Thus, the discretion of the

        Registrar is like the discretion of everybody else which is liable

        to be controlled by a superior tribunal and the discretion

        should have been judicially exercised.
</p>
<p id="p_27">    16.         On consideration of the relevant pleas of the learned

        counsel for the parties, the principles of law as enunciated in

        the aforesaid judgments are abundantly clear. The question is

        whether the Registrar exercised the discretion judicially and

        on the well-accepted principles.                It is no doubt true that the

        goods are registered under different classes and are not

        identical. The matter has, however, to be looked at also from

        the business and commercial point of view and in this behalf

        the trade channel becomes an important consideration.                            The

        manufactured products in question are both used in the

        agricultural sector. What is important is the profile of the

        customer. The test is of a man of an average intelligence with

        imperfect recollection.            The profile of the customer in the

        present case is likely to be less educated and less discerning.

</p><p id="p_28">     17.         We thus find that the conclusion arrived at by the

        learned Single Judge that the customer may assume the

        source of supply to be one from the respondent in case of the

        product of the appellant on the basis of the same trade mark

        is a grave possibility.          Learned Single Judge has also rightly

        emphasized that the products of both descriptions convert

        chemical energy into mechanical energy.                        The channel for

        buying and selling is also same.
</p>
<p id="p_29">    18.         The evidence filed by the respondent shows that they

        have another trade mark „PRAKASH‟. The bills are printed in

        the name of „PRAKASH‟. The word „SWARAJ‟ has been added

        in front of the office copy of the bills. There are some non-

        printed bills.       It is not understood that if the trade mark

        „SWARAJ‟ was being used from the inception as claimed by the

        appellant, why the bills with the trade mark „PRAKASH‟ were

        printed and not with the trade mark „SWARAJ‟. This throws

        doubt on the nature of evidence led.
</p>
<p id="p_30">    19.         Insofar as the alternative plea of honest concurrent user

        is concerned, the appellant claims to be user from 1975, but

        as stated above the evidence led does not evoke confidence.

        This is coupled with the fact that the application for

        registration was filed only in 1979. If the mark was being used

        from 1975, there was no reason for the appellant not to have

        applied for a period of four years.                 On the other hand, the

        mark of the respondent is registered and sales have been

        shown at least from 1974 albeit the initial sales were not very

        high. The application filed by the respondent was much earlier

         in 1977. Thus, even if the date of the application is taken into

        consideration, the plea of honest concurrent user by the

        appellant is not really advanced.               The reputation of the trade

        mark of the respondent has been recognized even by the

        Registrar.       The appellant succeeded before the Registrar on

        the plea of the goods being of different descriptions and thus

        there being no likelihood of confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_31">    20.         In view of the aforesaid, we find that the appellant has

        not been able to point out any infirmity in the impugned order

        so as to call for our interference.

<p id="p_32">    21.         The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs of

        Rs.10,000/-.
