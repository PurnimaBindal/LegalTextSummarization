     manufacturing,   marketing   and   selling   pharmaceutical   products.       The 





     defendant   company   is   also   engaged   in   the   business   of   manufacturing, 
     marketing and selling of pharmaceutical products.   It is the contention of 
     the plaintiff that the plaintiff has independently conceived and adopted a 
     distinctive mark "LUCYNTA" and registered it in class-5 of Fourth Schedule

     to the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 on 9th March 2012 from 20th  August 2012. 
     It   is   the   contention   of   the   plaintiff   that   the   defendant   would   be 




                                                                                          
     committing   an   act   of   infringement   by   using   the   impugned   mark 




                                                            
     "NUCYNTA".    In this premises, the plaintiff has filed the present suit for 
     injunction   restraining   the   defendant   from   using   the   impugned   mark 
     "NUCYNTA"   since   it   is   infringing   the   plaintiff's   registered   trademark 




                                                           
     "LUCYNTA".   The plaintiff has also taken out notice of motion for certain 
     reliefs during the pendency of the suit and also moved this Court for grant 
     of ad-interim orders.

<p id="p_2">     2.
                         
                   As   against   this   It   is   the   case   of   the   defendant   that   the 
     defendant has invented a new drug, namely, "TAPENTADOL" and coined 
                        
     and adopted a distinctive trademark "NUCYNTA" which is in existence in 
     the international market since 2008.   It is the contention of the defendant 
     that its mark NUCYNTA is registered in various countries   as registered 
      


     trademark much prior to the registration of plaintiff's mark in India.   It is 
   



     the   contention   of   the   defendant   that   taking   into   consideration   the 
     popularity of the defendant's trademark LUCYNTA and  the drug invented, 
     namely,   "TAPENTADOL",   the   plaintiff   has   deceptively   imitated   the 





     trademark NUCYNTA with the same drug.   It is their case that since the 
     adoption of the plaintiff itself is deceptive the plaintiff is not entitled to 
     any relief.  It is further case of the defendant that the defendant has also 





     filed a suit on an action of passing off against the plaintiff in the Delhi 
     High   Court   along   with   application   for   interlocutory   reliefs   which   is 
     pending before the said Court.

     that before considering the prayer of the plaintiff for an ad-interim  relief, 
     it is necessary that the view taken by the Division Bench of this Court in 
     Appeal   No.88/2005   in   Notice   of   Motion   No.2638/2004   in   Suit 




                                                            
     No.2663/2004 dated 16th February 2005 (M/s.Maxheal Pharmaceuticals  
     v.     Shalina   Laboratories   Pvt.Ltd.)   to   the   effect   that   at   the   stage   of 
     consideration   of   an   application   for   interlocutory   orders,   it   is   not 




                                           
     permissible for this Court to go into the question of validity of the mark 
                          
     and   as   long   as   the   mark   remains   on   the   register   (even   wrongly)   the 
     proprietor thereof is entitled for an order of injunction.   I further find that 
                         
     to an extent  the aforesaid view is in conflict with the view expressed by 
     the   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   in   the   case   of  <a href="/doc/194344/" id="a_2">M/s.J.K.Sons     v.

     case of <a href="/doc/1326002/" id="a_3">Hindustran Embroidery Mills Pvt. Ltd.   v.   K.Ravindra and Co</a>., 
     (1974) 76 Bom.L.R. 146, had an occasion to consider the prayer of the 
     plaintiff in the notice of motion based on infringement of trademark as 





     well as passing off.   The learned single Judge had considered the cases of 
     infringement of trademark and passing off separately.   While considering 
     the case of the plaintiff therein, in respect of infringement of trademark, 
     learned single Judge observed thus:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                             ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:04:42 :::</span>

      "6.      It was then sought to be contended by Mr. Shah 
      that, if there was some doubt in regard to the respective 




                                                                                 
      rights of the parties, having regard to considerations of 
      balance   of   convenience,   no   interlocutory   injunction 




                                                   
      should   be   granted,   and   reliance   was   placed   in   that 
      connection on a passage from Kerly on Trade Marks, p. 
      655,   para.   654.   It   is   explained   there   that,   by   the 
      expression "balance of convenience" is meant the relative 
      amounts   of   damage   which   are   likely   to   result   if   the 




                                                  
      injunction is granted and the plaintiff ultimately fails, or 
      if it is refused and he ultimately succeeds, and it is stated 
      that   where   there  is   a   substantial   case   to  be   tried,   the 
      application   for   interim   injunction   may   be   ordered   to 




                                 
      stand   over   to   the   hearing,   upon   the   defendant 
      undertaking to keep an account of his sales under the 
               
      mark objected to.  There is, however, a statement in the 
      same paragraph which shows clearly that it is not the 
      practice to consider the validity of the registration of the 
              
      mark on a Motion for interlocutory injunction, and that, 
      whilst a mark remains on the register (even wrongly), it 
      is not desirable that others should imitate it. As far as 
      the   cruciform   and   script   marks   which   have   been 
      

      registered   are   concerned,   the   same   are   registered 
      admittedly   in   the   name   of   the   plaintiff-Co.,   and   an 
   



      injunction should, therefore, be granted restraining the 
      defendants from infringing1 those marks. It was sought 
      to   be   stated   by   the   defendants   at   the   hearing   of   the 
      Motion before me that they are not selling goods bearing 





      the cruciform or script marks, but are only selling goods 
      bearing the Chimney mark, but that statement is false in 
      view of the plaint in the "threats action" (suit No. 493 of 
      1967) which they have filed in this Court, in para 2 of 
      which it is stated in clear terms that Hernia Embroidery 





      Mills Pvt. Ltd. manufacture and sell textile goods under 
      all   the   said   three   marks,   and   in   which   a   permanent 
      injunction   has   been   sought   by   the   present   defendants 
      against the present plaintiffs in respect of all those three 
      marks."

     The learned single Judge in the aforesaid paragraph has reproduced para-
     654   of   Kerly   on   Trademark   which   states   that   it   is   not   the   practice   to 




                                                                                             
     consider   the   validity   of   the   registration   of   the   mark   on   a   motion   for 




                                                               
     interlocutory injunction, and that, whilst a mark remains on the register 
     (even   wrongly),     it   is   not   desirable   that   others   should   imitate   it.   The 
     learned   Judge,   therefore,   granted   injunction   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff 




                                                              
     therein.   The aforesaid observations of the learned single Judge have been 
     subsequently followed by various learned single Judges of this Court in 
     many matters.   The learned Division Bench of this Court in the case of

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "6.     Mr.Tulzapurkar also submitted that the mark was 
                 earlier registered in the name of American Remedies and 
                 having regard to the fact that in the examination report 
      

                 the   said   mark   (American   Remedies)   was   cited   as 
                 conflicting   mark   there   is   reason   to   believe   that   the 
   



                 respondents managed to get registration  by fraud and 
                 misrepresentation.      The   answer   to   this   contention   is 
                 contained in the judgment of Justice Vimadalal of this 
                 Court   in   <a href="/doc/1326002/" id="a_4">Hindustan   Embroidery   Mills   Pvt   Ltd   vs   K

                 learned Judge pointed out that it is not the practice of

                 out by the person who has got the mark registered in his

                 wrongly), it is not desirable that others should imitate it. 
                 Moreover   the   respondents   have   already   applied   for

     The aforesaid observations of the Division Bench of this Court have been

     interlocutory applications for injunction filed on behalf of the plaintiff in 
     suits of infringement of trademark.   Though, at times,  it has been argued 
     on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiff's adoption itself was either 




                                                           
     fraudulent or that the plaintiff was not entitled to registration of mark in 
     its favour, the learned single Judges of this Court have refused to go into 
     that question, and rightly so, since the Division Bench of this Court has 




                                          
     held that  it is not the practice of this Court to consider the validity of the 
                        
     registration of the trademark in a motion for interim relief taken out by 
     the person in whose favour the  mark is registered and while the mark 
                       
     remains on register (even wrongly) the others should not imitate it.   The 
     single Judges of this Court, undoubtedly, are bound by the aforesaid view 
     of the learned Division Bench.

     economic policy it established a joint venture known as TVS Whirlpool 
     Ltd.   and   filed   various   applications   for   registration   of   their   trademark 




                                            
     WHIRLPOOL in classes- 7, 9 and 11.   It was their case that the trademark 
                          
     WHIRLPOOL   belonging   to   the   plaintiff   had   acquired   global   reputation. 
     One Chinar Trust had applied for registration of trademark WHIRLPOOL.

     the trademark WHIRLPOOL in the name of M/s.Chinar Trust.   While the 
      


     plaintiff was proceeding with the petition for cancellation and removal of 
   



     registration in favour of said Chinar Trust, the plaintiff came across the 
     advertisements   by   which   the   defendant   was   advertising   its   product   as 
     Whirlpool.   As such, plaintiff filed suit and claimed for interim injunction.

     though can stop the others from using the trademark, due to the order of

      appreciate the submission of the learned counsel, it will 
      be necessary to set out section 28(1) of the Act.     This 
      section read as under:
</p>



                                 
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">            "28(1) Subject to the  other provisions of this

            the registered proprietor of the trade mark the 
            exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in 
              
            relation  to the  goods in  respect of which the 
            trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in 
            respect   of   infringement   of   the   trade   mark   in 
            the manner provided by this Act."
</blockquote>      


<p id="p_30">      31. According to section 28(1) of the Act, registration 
      of a trade mark gives to the registered proprietor thereof 
   



      exclusive right to use the same in relation to the goods 
      in respect of which it has been registered.   But from the 
      opening words of section 28(1) namely, "subject to other 
      provisions" it is clear that the right conferred on a trader 





      is not an indefeasible right as the same is expressly made 
      subject to other provisions of the Act.     This is further, 
      made clear by section 27(2) of the Act, which provides 
      that "nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the 
      right   of   action   against   any   person   for   passing   off   the 





      goods   as   goods   of   another   person   or   the   remedies   in 
      respect thereof."  Thus it is manifest that Section 28  of 
      the  Act and all  other  provisions come within  the  over 
      riding   sway   of   section   27(2)   of   the   Act.       Similarly 
      section 33 of the Act also saves vested rights of a prior 
      user.   It lays down that nothing in the Act shall entitle a

      registered proprietor of a trade  mark to interfere with 
      the use of the trade mark by a prior user of the same. 
</p>



                                                                                
<p id="p_31">      Thus   the   right   created   by   section28(1)   of   the   Act   in 
      favour of a registered proprietor of a trade mark is not 




                                                  
      an absolute right and is subsequent to other provisions 
      of   the   Act   namely   sections   27(2),   33   etc.       Neither 
      section   28 nor  any other  provision  of  the  Act  bars  an 
      action for passing off by an anterior user of a trade mark 
      against a registered user of the same.     In other words 




                                                 
      registration of a trade mark does not provide a defence 
      to the proceedings for passing off as under section 27(2) 
      of the Act a prior user of a trade mark can maintain an 
      action for passing off against any subsequent user of an 




                                
      identical trade mark including a registered user thereof. 
      Again this right is not affect by section 31 of the Act, 
               
      under   which   the   only   presumption   that   follows   form 
      registration of a mark is its prima facie evidentiary value 
      about its validity and nothing more.  This presumption is 
              
      not an unrebuttable one and can be displaced.   Besides 
      section   31   is   not   immune   to   the   over-riding   effect   of 
      section 27(2).   Placing reliance on section 28(3) of the 
      Act the learned counsel for the appellant contended that 
      

      when   two   registered     proprietors   of   identical   or   near 
      similar trade marks cannot be deemed to have acquired 
   



      exclusive right to the  use of any of those  trade marks 
      against each other, how can an  unregistered user of the 
      trade mark maintain an action for passing off against a 
      registered use of the same mark and seek an injunction 





      restraining   him   from   using   it.       This   argument   of   the 
      learned   counsel   seems   to   stem   from   a   misconception 
      about   the   real   purpose   and   intent   of   section   28(3). 
      Actually section 28(3) protects registered proprietor of a 
      trade   mark   from   an   infringement   action   by   another 





      registered proprietor of an identical or near similar trade 
      mark.   In this regard it will also be necessary to extract 
      Section 28(3) and section 30(1)(d) which carries of the 
      intent of section 28(3).   These sections read as under:-

<p id="p_32">      32. A reading of section 28(3) with section 30(1)(d) 
      shows   that   the   proprietor   of   a   registered   trade   mark 





      cannot file an infringement action against a proprietor of 
      an identical or similar trade mark.  While section s 28(3) 
      and 30(1)(d) on the one hand deal with the rights of 
      registered proprietors of   identical trade marks and bar

      The rights of action under section 27(2) are not affected

                acquired reputation and goodwill in respect of its goods 
                bearing trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL'  in this country.   Even

                respondents, they are using the mark 'WHIRLPOOL' for 
                their products.   Prima facie it appears to us that buyers 
                are likely to be deceived or confused as to the origin and 
                source of the goods.   They will believe that the product 




                                          
                is manufactured by the respondents, an impression not 
                founded   in   truth.       The   imitation   will   pass   off   as 
                         
                genuine.       No   one   can   be   permitted   to   trade   by

                passing   off   against   registered   user   of   trade   mark   is

<p id="p_35">      20. Injunction is a relief in equity and is based on 
      equitable   principles.   On   the   above   concurrent 
      findings,   the   weight   of   equity   at   this   stage   is   in 
      favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. It 
      has also to be borne in mind that a mark in the form 




                                               
      of a word which is not a derivative of the product, 
      points to the source of the product. The mark/name 
      'WHIRLPOOL'  is   associated  for   long,   much   prior   to 
      the   defendants'   application   in   1986   with   the

<p id="p_36">      border reputation extending to India, the trade mark 
      'WHIRLPOOL' gives an indication of the origin of the 
      goods as emanating from or relating to the Whirlpool 
           
      Corporation   -   plaintiff   No.   1.   The   High   Court   has 
      recorded its satisfaction that use of the 'WHIRLPOOL' 
      mark   by   the   defendants   indicates   prima   facie   an 
      intention   to   pass-off   defendants'   washing   machines 
      

      as those of plaintiffs' or at least the likelihood of the 
      buyers being confused or misled into that belief. The 
   



      fact that the cost of defendants' washing machine is 
      l/3rd of the cost of the plaintiffs' washing machine as 
      stated by Shri Sibal, itself supports the plaintiffs' plea 
      that the defendants' washing machines are not of the 





      same engineering standard and are inferior in quality 
      to   the   washing   machines   of   the   plaintiffs'.   In 
      addition, it has   been rightly held that the grant of 
      interlocutory   injunction   would   cause   no   significant 
      injury to the defendants who can sell their washing 





      machines   merely   by   removing   the.   small   metallic 
      strip  bearing the  offensive  trade  mark/name  which 
      includes 'WHIRLPOOL'. On the other hand, refusal of 
      the interlocutory injunction would cause irreparable 
      injury to the plaintiffs' reputation and goodwill since

                 that the exercise of discretion was in accordance with 
                 the settled principles of law relating to the grant of 
                 interlocutory injunctions in a passing-off action. The

                 against   the   proprietor   of   a   registered   trade   mark.

                 for this reason, Shri Kapil Sibal fairly conceded this

                 registration in favour of the defendants only for the

     2004   (28)   PTC   585   (SC).     The   plaintiffs   therein   had   filed   suit   for 




                                                            
     injunction   based   on   an   action   for   passing   off   in   respect   of   mark 
     "OCUFLOX".   According to the plaintiffs, they were the prior user of the 
     trademark in respect of an eye care product.   It was their contention that 




                                           
     they first used the mark on 9 th September 1992 and marketed the same in 
                         
     various   countries   worldwide.     It   was   also   claimed   that   they   had   also 
     applied for registration in several countries including India.   The plaintiff 
                        
     had applied for interim injunction.   Learned single Judge of the Calcutta

     vacated by him holding that since the plaintiffs' product was not being 
      


     sold in India and defendants having introduced the product first in India, 
   



     plaintiffs were not entitled to an injunction.  Appeal filed by the plaintiffs 
     against the said order was allowed by the Division Bench, which granted 
     injunction in favour of the plaintiff.   The defendants carried the matter 





     before the Apex Court.   While dismissing the appeal, the Hon'ble Apex

      mind the  possibility that with the  passage  of  time, 
      some conflict may occur between the use of the mark

      interest is in no way imperiled. Doctors particularly

      or   Companies   connected   with   medical   field   keep 
      abreast   of   latest   developments   in   medicine   and

      available   in   this   country.   Doctors,   medical

</blockquote><p id="p_42">      This   results   in   a   product   acquiring   a   worldwide 
      reputation. Thus, if  a  mark in  respect of a  drug is 
          
      associated with the Respondents worldwide it would 
      lead to an anomalous situation if an identical mark 
      in respect of a similar drug is allowed to be sold in 
      India.   However   one   note   of   caution   must   be 
      

      expressed. Multinational corporations, who have no 
      intention   of   coming   to   India   or   introducing   their 
   



      product in India should not be allowed to throttle an 
      Indian   Company   by   not   permitting   it   to   sell   a 
      product   in   India,   if   the   Indian   Company   has 
      genuinely   adopted   the   mark   and   developed   the 





      product and is first in the market. Thus the ultimate 
      test should be who is first in the market.

      mere fact that the Respondents have not been using 
      the mark in India would be irrelevant if they were 
      first   in   the   world   market.   The   Division   Bench   had 
      relied   upon   material   which   prima-facie   shows   that

                     material the Division Bench has concluded that the 
                     Respondents were first to adopt the mark. If that be

     It   can,   thus,   be   seen   that   the   Apex   Court     has   held   that   the   relevant 
     question would not be as to who has started using the mark first in India

     It can, thus, be seen that the learned single Judge has taken a view that

     view is required to be taken on the question of validity of registration for 
     grant of injunction.  It has further been held that registration is prima facie 
                          
     regarded as valid,  but mere registration alone is not conclusive and is not 
     binding on the civil court when the application for injunction is considered 
                         
     and decided.     Accepting the contention of the defendant that the word 
     LOWENBRAU has become synonymous with the  beer of German origin 
      

     and that being bona-fide used by them and others all over the world, the 
     learned   single   Judge   found   that   the   defendant   had   valid   defence   and, 
   



     therefore, refused to grant injunction in favour of the plaintiff, who was a 
     registered owner of the trademark LOWENBRAU.

<p id="p_49">                 In   the   facts   of   the   present   case,   we   find   that   the 
                 injunction application was disposed of at a stage when 
                 the   defendant   filed   an   application   for   vacation   of   the 
                 injunction   and   no   written   statement   of   the   defendant 
      

                 was   on   record.   As   already   discussed   hereinabove,   the 
                 stage   of   challenging   the   validity   of   registration   by   the 
   



                 defendant arises only when the written statement is filed, 
                 because it is only in the written statement that the plea 
                 of  the   registration   being  invalid  would  be   taken   up  in 
                 furtherance   of   the   expression   "if   valid"   as   found   in 





                 <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_17">Section 28</a> and also similar language as found in <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_18">Section 
                 124(1)(a)</a>.   This   also   flows   from   the   fact   that   under 
                 <a href="/doc/1868535/" id="a_19">Section 31(1)</a> registration is only a prima facie evidence 
                 of   validity   and   not   conclusive   evidence.   Registration 
                 would   only   be   a   conclusive   evidence   of   validity   if   the 





                 rectification/cancellation   proceedings   filed   for 
                 cancellation   of   the   registered   trademark   do   not   finally 
                 succeed. We are, therefore of the view that in the facts of 
                 the   present   case   since   the   issue   of   invalidity   of 
                 registration is to be taken up only in a written statement

      validity of registrations of the appellant for deciding the 
      aspect of grant of injunction in the facts of the present 
      


      case. When we look at the facts in the present case, we 
      find that when the application was filed for registration 
   



      of   the   trademarks   "LOSORB"   and   "LO-SORB",   the 
      applications clearly stated "proposed to be used'. Quite 
      clearly therefore on the date of registration there was no 
      user at all of the trademark, much less such use of it so 





      as   to   give   the   trademark   a   distinctive   character   as   a 
      result of use made of it or the same being a well known 
      trademark.   Clearly   therefore,   the   registration   of   the 
      trademark   "LOSORB"   and   "LO-SORB"   were   prima   facie 
      invalid because the said trademarks basically are a minor 





      variation   of   a   descriptive   expression   "LOW   ABSORB" 
      which   is   not   an   unusual   juxtaposition   of   words   in   the 
      English   language   and   no   evidence   existed   before   the 
      Registrar   of   distinctiveness   because   the   marks   were 
      sought to be registered not on proof of actual user so as 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:04:42 :::</span>

      to make the same distinctive on the date of filing of the 
      application for registration but only on "proposed to be 




                                                                                
      used" basis. The expression "LOW ABSORB" conveys the 
      same   meaning   as   "ABSORBS   LOW".   Such   descriptive 




                                                  
      word   marks   are   clearly   such   for   which   there   is   an 
      absolute ground for refusal  of registration  by virtue  of 
      <a href="/doc/382675/" id="a_25">Section 9(1)(b)</a> of the Act because clearly the said word 
      marks are in fact clear indications of designation of the 
      kind, quality, intended purpose or other characteristics of 




                                                 
      the   goods   of   which   the   trademark   is   applied.   The 
      registrations   being   prima   facie   invalid   no   action   for 
      infringement would thus lie. On the  issue  of  acquiring 
      distinctiveness   subsequent   to   the   making   of   the 




                                
      application  for  registration, we  have  already dilated at 
      length in the earlier part of this judgment while dealing 
               
      with the issue of passing off that it cannot be said that 
      the   mark   "LOW   ABSORB"   has   acquired   a   secondary 
      meaning by user of a few years.
</p>              
<p id="p_53">      We will now examine the issue whether the expressions 
      "LOSORB"   or   "LO-SORB"   have   achieved   a   secondary 
      meaning even if "LOW-ABSORB" may not have. On this 
      aspect   one   immediately   feels   that   it   is   an   aspect   of 
      


      concern with respect to the claim of the plaintiff that if 
      partly   tweaked   descriptive   words   and   expressions   of 
   



      English   language   are   claimed   to   be   coined   words,   the 
      same   would   result   in   a   grave   and   absurd   situation 
      because   a   non-tweaked   word   being   a   completely 
      descriptive word will in fact be deceptively similar to the 





      tweaked descriptive English language word or expression 
      of which registration is obtained. Meaning thereby that 
      because   of   success   in   getting   registered   a   minor 
      modification of a descriptive word or expression of the 
      English   language,   a   person   who   gets   registration   can 





      prevent   a   purely   descriptive   use   of   a   normal   word   or 
      expression   as   found   in   English   language   dictionary   on 
      the ground that it would be identical with or deceptively 
      similar   to   a   registered   trademark-   a   position   which   is 
      found   in   the   present   case.   Such   a   position,   in   our 
      opinion,   cannot   at   all   be   countenanced   and   must   be

      struck down with a heavy hand.
</p><p id="p_54">      When we see the facts and circumstances of the present 




                                                                                 
      case,   we   find   that   both   the   parties   claim   to   have   an 
      ingredient   in   their   product   namely   edible   oil   an   anti 




                                                   
      foaming agent which results in lower oil being consumed 
      while frying the food. In such a case scenario, it cannot 
      be claimed at this interim stage that there is a secondary 
      significance   by   user   up   to   registration   to   such   coined 




                                                  
      words "LOSORB" and "LO-SORB" keeping in view the fact 
      that   such   coined   words   have   a   clear   reference   to   an 
      indicative   of   the   kind,   quality,   intended   purpose, 
      characteristic   etc.   of   the   goods   and   are   not   ordinarily 
      entitled to registration. We have, while on the issue of 




                                 
      passing off, already adverted to the aspect of whether the 
      sales are related to the trade marks "LOSORB/LO-SORB" 
</p>               
<p id="p_55">      or to "Sweakar/Saffola", being a moot point.
      Having expounded on the law as above, we may again 
              
      add   that   in   a   particular   case,   it   is   possible   that   a 
      descriptive word mark on account of its such extensive 
      user over a great length of time, when no other person 
      has been shown to use the same, the same may in fact 
      become a well known trademark or a trademark which 
      


      has   achieved   such   distinction   by   user   that   it   can   be 
      registered. Where  the  combination  of  words  forming a 
   



      trade mark is an unusual juxtaposition of words or part 
      words the distinction may be achieved more easily than 
      where  the   user  of  words  put jointly  is not  an   unusual 
      syntax and also especially when the adaption is arbitrary 





      with   respect   to   the   goods/trade.   There   can   be   a   case 
      where   a   coined   word   would   be   entitled   to   trademark 
      protection where the coined word is the result of joining 
      of   one   or   two   or   few   normal   non   descriptive   English 
      words of the dictionary or one word out of the two or 





      more   words   forming   a   coined   word   is   an   arbitrary 
      adaption.   As   already   stated,   therefore,   in   trademarks 
      matters, every case necessarily turns upon and is decided 
      on its own facts including but not limited to the trade

               learned   Single   Judge   to   question   the   validity   of   the 
               registration of the trademark for the purpose of deciding 




                                                           
               the interlocutory application, we find that the same was 
               also   justified   because   firstly   no   evidence   was   filed   of 
               distinctiveness   of   the   trademarks   at   the   time   of 
               registration   since   the   same   did   not   exist   because 




                                                          
               admittedly the applications were filed for registration of 
               the   trademarks   on   a   "proposed   to   be   used   basis"   and 
               secondly so far as the evidence of user we have already 
               held that the user in the facts of the present case is not 
               such   as   to   confer   distinctiveness   amounting   to   a 




                                         
               secondary meaning for the word marks which are in fact 
               just a tweaked form of ordinary descriptive words in not 
                        
               an unusual syntax.

     It can, thus, be seen that the Division Bench has taken a view that in an 
     application for injunction, the Court is justified in looking to the prima 
      


     facie validity of the registration of trade mark.     The Division Bench on 
   



     facts found that the learned single Judge was justified in going into the 
     question of validity of registration of the plaintiff's trademark and further 
     found that no case was made out for interfering with the order of refusal 





     of  injunction passed by the learned single Judge.

             the   user   of   that   mark,   and   his   goods   being 
             known in the market by it, he has practically

<p id="p_66">     15.             It   can   be   seen   that   the   Division   Bench   in    M/s.Maxheal  




                                                              
     Pharmaceuticals     v.   Shalina Laboratories Pvt.Ltd.  (supra) held that 
     once the registration is granted in favour of the proprietor, he is entitled to 
     an order of injunction restraining the others from using the same even if 




                                            
     the same is wrongly granted.   It further held that it is not the practice of 
                          
     this Court to go into the question of validity of the registration at the stage 
     of   grant   of   injunction.       However,   the   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   in 
                         
     <a href="/doc/194344/" id="a_28">M/s.J.K.Sons  v.  M/s.Parksons Games &amp; Sports</a> (supra), relying on the

     that a person who himself has imitated somebody else's mark and guilty of 
   



     false   and   misleading   representation   is   not   entitled   to   an   injunction,   is 
     applicable to the cases of infringement of trademark and passing off.   In 
     view of the law laid down by the Apex Court, as discussed hereinabove, 





     there   should   be   no   difficulty   in   so   far   as   action   for   passing   off   is 
     concerned.     It appears to be a settled position of law that an action for 
     passing   off   would   lie   at   the   instance   of   prior   user   even   against   the 





     registered   user.       The   difficulty   would   be   in   respect   of   action   for 
     infringement of trademark, inasmuch as in view of the judgment of the 
     Division   Bench   in     the   case   of  M/s.Maxheal   Pharmaceuticals       v.

     injunction even against a prior user, on the action of infringement, merely 
     on the basis of having registration in his favour.   In my respectful view, 




                                                                                             
     this would lead to anomalous situation.  If an action for passing off is by a 




                                                               
     prior user, the Court would be permitted to go into the issues including 
     the issue of validity of registration of the defendant's trademark and even 
     grant an order of injunction in favour of the person whose mark is not 




                                                              
     registered and against the person whose mark is registered.   However, if 
     an injunction is sought by a proprietor of a registered trademark, in view 
     of   the   view   taken   by   the   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   in   the   case   of

<p id="p_67">     (supra), the Court would be powerless to go into the question of validity 
     or   otherwise   of   the   plaintiff's   registration   and   will   have   to   grant   an 
                          
     injunction merely for asking.    In view of the view taken by the Division 
     Bench,  which  binds   the   learned  single   Judges  of  this  Court,  this  Court 
     would be bound by the said judgment to grant injunction in favour of the 
      


     plaintiff,   who   is   registered   proprietor,   even   if   this   Court   finds   that   the 
   



     adoption of the plaintiff's trademark is fraudulent or deceptive.

     or otherwise of the registration of the trademark.    The perusal of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_31">section

     provides that registration of trademark shall be prima facie evidence of the 
     validity thereof.   I am in respectful agreement with the view taken by the

     registration is only a prima facie evidence of the validity of registration, 
                          
     the courts would be permitted to go into the question of tentative validity 
     of   the   registration   while   considering   the   application   for   grant   of 
     injunction.  No doubt that in such a case, the onus would lie on the person 
      


     who challenges the validity of the trademark and he will have to establish 
   



     that the registration of trademark in favour of the proprietor thereof is 
     prima   facie  or   tentatively   not   valid.       In   my   view,   if   it   is   held   to   be 
     impermissible, it would lead to an anomalous situation.  Even in the facts 





     some   what   similar   to   the   facts   of   the   present   case,   a   party   would   be 
     entitled to get an injunction against the registered proprietor on an action 
     of passing off on the ground that he is a prior user and that the registered 





     proprietor   is   an   imitator.     At   the   same   time,   the   registered   proprietor 
     would be entitled to get an injunction against the prior user on the ground

     register (even wrongly) he is entitled to an injunction against others.   In
