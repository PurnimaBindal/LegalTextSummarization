</p><p id="p_4"> 2.       According to the Plaintif, it is engaged in the business of providing life

insurance, pension and other related insurance products and services in the Indian

market. In the year 2009, the Plaintif was desirous of launching online insurance

policies which could be purchased by customers on the Plaintiffs website or through

online aggregators, in addition to selling policies through traditional means such as via

insurance agents, brokers etc. That in order to diferentiate and distinguish its

'products oferingf from others, and after signifcant deliberations, the Plaintif coined

and adopted a new, unique, distinctive and innovative trade mark being "iTerm".

The Plaintif also conceived and adopted a stylized manner of representing the trade

mark "iTerm" by using lowercase "i" and uppercase "T". According to the Plaintif,

it was the frst entity in India to ofer and sell insurance policies online. On 17 th August

2009, the Plaintif made an application to the Insurance Regulatory and Development

Authority of India ("IRDAI") seeking its approval for introducing insurance

products under the trade mark "iTerm" and ofering them to prospective customers

via online channels, which was approved by the IRDAI on 7 th September 2009.

</p><p id="p_5">3.       According to the Plaintif, in or about October 2009, the Plaintif launched and

started      ofering      for   sale   its   online   insurance   products      on     its   website

www.aegonreligare.com, under the trade mark "iTerm". According to the Plaintif,

the frst set of its insurance policies under the trademark "iTerm" were issued on 27 th

October 2009. In 2017, the Plaintif also launched two other products with variants of


nitin                                                                                                  2/85

 the trade mark "iTerm" viz. 'iTerm Plusf and 'iTerm Foreverf. The Plaintif has

also registered the domain names, www.iterm.co.in, www.iterm100.com and

www.itermplus.com. According to the Plaintif, its trade mark 'iTermf is inherently

distinctive of its products and in any event by virtue of its open, continuous and

extensive use, the said mark has acquired secondary signifcance thereby connoting

and denoting to the members of the trade and public, the insurance policies of the

Plaintif and of no one else. On 18 th May 2018, the Plaintif fled trademark

applications under Nos. 3837083, 3837084, 3837085 and 3837086 all in class 36 with

the Registrar of Trademarks for registration of the trade marks iTerm (word mark),

iTerm Plus (word mark), iTerm Forever (word mark) and iTerm Forever Plus (word

mark), respectively. On 17th November 2018, i.e. after the present suit was fled, the

Plaintiffs trade mark 'iTerm Forever Plusf bearing No.3837086 in class 36 was

registered, however, since the hearing of the present Notice of Motion on the basis of

cause of action for passing of had already commenced, the Plaintif has proceeded

with the hearing without amending and claiming the cause of action for infringement

of trade mark 'iTerm Forever Plusf bearing No.3837086 in class 36.

Plaintif for the frst time learnt that the Defendant had launched its online policy

 trade mark 'iTermf and called upon the Defendant to cease and desist from using the

mark 'iTermf. The Plaintif also initiated communication with the senior

management of the Defendant to explain the rights of the Plaintif in the trade mark

'iTermf and the seriousness of harm and damage caused to the Plaintiffs business

due to the unauthorized and illegal use of the mark 'i-Termf by the Defendant. The

Plaintif also addressed a letter to the IRDAI on 25 th May 2018 and informed the

IRDAI about the Plaintiffs rights in the trademark 'iTermf. The Plaintif further

informed the IRDAI that the act of subsequent adoption of identical trademark by the

Defendant amounts to violation of Plaintiffs rights in the trademark 'iTermf and

requested the IRDAI to look into the matter and take suitable steps to protect the

interests of the Plaintif. On 31st May 2018, senior representatives of the Plaintif also

met with concerned ofcials at the "Life" and the "Actuary" departments of IRDAI.

The IRDAI replied on 6th July 2018 wherein the IRDAI stated that a dispute regarding

usage of the term 'iTerm" as a trade mark is not within the jurisdiction of IRDAI and

therefore the Plaintif may approach an appropriate forum.

</p><p id="p_8">6.       According to the Plaintif, the Defendant by its Advocatefs reply dated 30 th

May 2018 responded to the Plaintiffs cease and desist notice dated 22 nd May 2018. In

the said reply, the Defendant denied the claim of the Plaintif and stated that no trade

mark rights can exist in an expression which is common to the industry where "i"

denotes the Internet and "Term" denotes the nature of the insurance policy. The

 Plaintif vide its rejoinder letter dated 16th June 2018, denied the contentions raised by

the Defendant in its Reply and once again called upon the Defendant to forthwith

cease and desist the use of the impugned mark. Thereafter, the present suit was fled

in June 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.       From a perusal of the record and after hearing the submissions of the Ld.

Senior Advocates for the parties, according to me, the moot question that requires

consideration is whether the Plaintiffs trade mark "iTerm" is inherently distinctive

of its products viz. term insurance policies which are sold over internet or that

whether the Plaintif has acquired immense goodwill and reputation in its mark

"iTerm" that such use of the said expression albeit with additional features by the

Defendant in respect of its term insurance policies sold over internet is likely to lead

to confusion or deception or misrepresentation and consequently damages? The said

question can be considered in three diferent parts:
</p>
<p id="p_10">Issue A: Whether the Plaintiffs mark "iTerm" is an inherently distinctive mark

in respect of its insurance policies sold over the internet?

Issue B: Whether the Plaintiffs mark "iTerm" has acquired secondary meaning

or such secondary signifcance that it connotes and denotes to the members of the

trade and public, the insurance policies of the Plaintif and no one else?

Issue C : Whether the Defendantfs use of its mark 'Aviva i-Term Smartf in

respect of its insurance policies sold over the internet likely to cause

Plaintiffs Submissions


</p><p id="p_12">8.       The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted, that the trade mark

'iTermf is a coined and invented term and it is inherently distinctive; that it is capable

of distinguishing the Plaintiffs product i.e. insurance policies sold over internet from

those of the others; that the word 'iTermf is not an ordinary English language word

and there is no meaning assigned to the word 'iTermf in the English language; that

the word 'iTermf is not found in any dictionary; that the individual meaning of 'if is

not internet or insurance and "term" is not term insurance, in any dictionary; that

any person hearing the word "iTerm" would never be able to relate it to either

'insurancef or 'term insurancef or 'insurance ofered on internetf since the word

'iTermf is neither an ordinary English language word nor a descriptive term; that the

Plaintif has conceived and adopted a stylized manner of representing the trade mark

by using lowercase "i" and uppercase "T"; that being an invented and coined mark,



nitin                                                                                             7/85

 the same deserves the highest degree of protection; that the Plaintif was the frst one

to adopt the trade mark "iTerm" in the year 2009 and no other company was using

the said mark "iTerm" in respect of insurance policies.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.1      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif relied upon a Google Trends report

obtained from the website www.googletrends.com to fortify his submission that the

Plaintiffs trade mark is a coined / invented word and also a distinctive trade mark. He

submitted that a perusal of the Google Trends report shows that prior to 2009 people

have not searched for word / term 'iTermf as it is not a common English language

word or a descriptive term. He submitted that a bare perusal of the graph of the period

after the Plaintiffs adoption and use of the trade mark iTerm (post 2009) would show

a huge spike in the volume of searches done for the word 'iTermf. He submitted that

the related topics refer to the Plaintiffs name, which also show that the general public

associates the term 'iTermf with the Plaintif. He submitted that this is also a factor

which shows the reputation which the Plaintif has acquired in the trade mark

'iTermf. He submitted that apart from the Plaintif, no one else has used the

expression 'iTermf for insurance products till the Defendant adopted the trade mark

'iTermf in May 2018. He further submitted that had the mark 'iTermf been a

descriptive mark or even perceived as a descriptive mark by the insurance industry, it

would have been used by other persons in the industry.

 8.2      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendant is

</pre><p id="p_15">estopped from contending that the mark "iTerm" is descriptive. In support of his

submission, he referred to the Defendantfs trade mark "i-LIFE" bearing registration

No.2095003 in Class 36. He submitted that apart from securing registration of the

trade mark "i-LIFE", the Defendant has also applied for registration of trade marks

'i-Shieldf and 'i-Securef. He submitted that in relation to the Plaintiffs trade mark

"iTerm", the Defendant has contended that the said trade mark is descriptive as "i"

refers to "internet" or "insurance" and the "Term" stands for "term insurance".

He submitted that by adopting the same reasoning as propounded by the Defendant, it

can be argued that the "i" in "i-LIFE" represents "insurance" or "internet" and

"Life" represents "life insurance" thereby forming the descriptive term "Life

Insurance". He submitted that despite this, the Defendant chose to assert exclusive

rights over its mark i-LIFE and is therefore estopped from now contending that the

mark "iTerm" is descriptive. He submitted that even though the Defendantfs

registration is for a device mark, the essential and prominent feature of its trade mark

is "i-LIFE". He submitted that when the Registrar of Trade Marks in his Preliminary

Examination Report objected to the registration of the Defendantfs trade mark "i-

LIFE", the Defendant in its Reply stated that its mark when considered as a whole is

not descriptive. Relying upon this Courtfs judgment in the case of UltraTech Cement

 Limited v. Alaknanda Cement Pvt. Ltd.1 he submitted that Defendant cannot blow

hot and cold at the same time to suit its convenience. He submitted that having

applied for the registration of a mark such as "i-LIFE", the Defendant is now

estopped from contending that the Plaintiffs mark "i-Term" is descriptive.

8.3      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif referred to the Defendantfs Afdavit

in Sur-rejoinder which states that prior to adopting its mark, the Defendant had

conducted a search in the Trade Marks Registry for similar trade marks but did not

fnd any similar trade mark. He submitted that the fact that the Defendant conducted

a search in the frst place is a proof of the Defendantfs intention to adopt and use

'iTermf as a trade mark and is an implicit admission that the Defendant believed that

the mark 'iTermf could have been applied for or granted registration.

8.4      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that use of "i", "e" and /

or "term" is not descriptive of Term Insurance Plans available online and the same

are not used in a descriptive sense. He submitted that various insurance companies

are using "i" as the frst letter in their respective trade marks; however, the sufx in

each case is diferent and is used to distinguish the companyfs products from the

products ofered by other insurance companies in the market. He submitted that the

marks relied upon by the Defendant to show use of "i", "e" and / or "term" in

respect of policies ofered for sale by various companies such as 'iProtectf, 'iSecuref,

Defendantfs Submissions :
</p>
<p id="p_17">9.       The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the mark iTerm / i-

Term is descriptive of the nature and character of the product. He submitted that the

expression 'i-Termf is derived from "i" for internet and/or insurance and "Term"

for the nature of the Insurance Policy. He submitted that considering the Plaintiffs

admission in paragraph 3(i) at page 359 of the Afdavit in Rejoinder, it cannot be

claimed by the Plaintif that the descriptive word "TERM" (denoting the

characteristic of the policy) when combined with the generic letter "i" (not claimed

as proprietary by the Plaintif) constitutes a distinctive trade mark. He submitted that

if both the terms are descriptive, then a combination thereof cannot make the

combination distinctive at all. He relied upon this Courts decision in <a href="/doc/1543503/" id="a_1">Faber-Castell

Aktiengesellschaft &amp; Anr. v. M/s Pikpen Private Limited</a> 2. In this case, it was held

that the trade mark 'TEXTLINERf was a combination of 'TEXTf and 'LINERf,

which two words taken independently are purely descriptive and hence the result of

the combination is also descriptive. He submitted that the mark TEXTLINER was

held to be descriptive of the function which the article was intended to perform. He

<p id="p_18">9.1         The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the test to ascertain

whether a trade mark is descriptive has been set out in the following judgments:

9.2         The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiffs

contention that the Defendant took a search in the Trade Marks Registry before

adopting the impugned mark shows that the Defendant admits that the word 'iTermf

can be used in a trade mark sense or is distinctive or adapted to distinguish, is

untenable. He submitted that the search was taken only to ascertain if any mark

similar to the Defendantfs mark, 'AVIVAf is registered or is pending registration.

9.4      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the Plaintif having

adopted a purely descriptive term as a part of its mark, cannot prevent others from

using the same. Reliance was placed upon the judgments in <a href="/doc/1734765/" id="a_5">Schering Corporation v.

 registration for the mark "i-Life" cannot amount to any admission on the part of the

Defendant that 'if can acquire distinctiveness. He submitted that the said mark is a

(supra) is not applicable to the facts of the present case. He submitted that the

principle of estoppel laid down therein is restricted to the facts of that case. He

submitted that the principle becomes applicable only when a defendant applies for

registration of a trade mark which is identical with or similar to the plaintiffs trade

mark and thereby claims proprietary rights therein. He submitted that in the present

case, the Defendant has never claimed any proprietary rights in the expression

"iTerm". He submitted that in UltraTech Cement Ltd. (supra), the Defendant had

applied for registration of the mark 'UltraTuff thereby claiming proprietary rights

therein. He submitted that in the present case, the facts are diferent and, therefore,

the contention that the Defendant is estopped from contending that "iTerm" is not

 outset, I must express that the Plaintiffs contention that 'iTermf is an invented mark

and is therefore inherently distinctive is not tenable. Relying on google analytic report,

the Plaintif has claimed that for the period between 1 st January 2005 and 31st August

2009 i.e. the period prior to the adoption and use of the trade mark 'iTermf by the

Plaintif, the search volume for the key word 'iTermf was very low, which according

to the Plaintif indicates that there was very little interest in this key word (paragraph

21 of the Written Submissions). This, according to me belies the case of the Plaintif

that 'iTermf has been coined or invented by the Plaintif. If the mark 'iTermf was

coined or invented by the Plaintif meaning thereby that such mark did not exist prior

to the Plaintiffs adoption, there would be no question of search volume for key word

'iTermf being very low - it would have been absolutely nil. The fact that there was a

usage or search of the expression 'iTermf albeit on a very low scale as admitted by the

Plaintif itself, shows that the said expression 'iTermf existed even prior to the

Plaintiffs adoption and use. Hence, it is not possible to accept the contention of the

Plaintif that it has 'coinedf or 'inventedf the mark 'iTermf.

10.1     Assuming that the mark 'iTermf was coined or invented by the Plaintif in

respect of its insurance policies sold over the internet, it is clear that the said mark is

completely descriptive. It is difcult to believe that the Plaintiffs "iTerm" which is

used in respect of term insurance policies sold over the internet, is not derived from

the commonly / descriptive terms "i" (internet / insurance) and "Term Insurance".

 The test is whether the mark by itself, without reference to anything else, describes

the nature or any characteristics of the product or services. A bare perusal of the mark

"i-Term" with respect to the term insurance policies and without any reference to the

Plaintif or Defendant would suggest that it has something to do with 'internetf or

'term insurancef or 'insurancef. It is a mere combination of two general, common and

known elements. Further, even the combination is not an unusual combination so as

to derive any kind of inherent protection. I believe the mark 'iTermf can surely be

termed as descriptive of the goods and services for which it is being used by the

Plaintif and Defendant. In this day and age, it is common to use the letters "i" and

"e" as prefxes in marks relating to goods and services denoting some kind of

association or suggestion relating to internet or electronics.

10.2     In the case of <a href="/doc/2044127/" id="a_6">J.R. Kapoor v. Micronix India</a> (supra) the rival marks were

Microtel and Micronix. It was held that the word 'Microf was descriptive of micro

technology and no one could claim monopoly over the use of the said word. Garware

Polyster India Ltd (supra) was an action for infringement and passing of. Therein the

Court held that the plaintif itself having used the words 'Sun Controlf in a

descriptive manner, the plaintif could not claim monopoly in the use of those words.

Similarly, in the case of Schering Corporation (supra). it was held that a proprietor

cannot claim exclusivity in his trade mark or in the name which is derived from a

generic drug.

 10.3     In Faber-Castell (supra) this Court observed that that the mark

</pre><p id="p_26">"TEXTLINER" was a result of combination of the words TEXT and LINER; that

these two words taken independently are purely descriptive; that the result of the

combination was also descriptive. Similarly, in the present case, the terms "i" and

"Term Insurance" are descriptive and their conjunction is also descriptive. While the

Plaintif may have honestly adopted the mark "iTerm" to distinguish its goods from

those of others, it does not change the fact that the mark is descriptive of the nature of

the product and the mode of purchase / sale of the product.

<p id="p_27">10.4     The test for a 'descriptive markf is set out in the Corpus Juris Secundum,

</blockquote>


<p id="p_28">In my view, the Plaintiffs mark is highly descriptive of the goods and services in

respect of which it is used i.e. online term insurances. I do not believe it requires much

imagination on onefs part to conclude that the mark "iTerm" is derived from the

expression "TERM INSURANCE" / "INSURANCE TERM" when used in respect

of insurance policies. In the circumstances the frst impression of the mark upon the

public who comes across the Plaintiffs mark is to signify a connection with the suit

products i.e. term insurances. It cannot be said that the Plaintiffs "iTerm" trade

mark is an arbitrary or fanciful trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_29">10.5     Further, this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/931564/" id="a_7">Rochem Separation Systems (I) Pvt. Ltd.,

Mumbai v. TAS Engineering Company Ltd</a>. (supra) has held as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              "5. The law relating to passing of is now well settled. A Plaintif to
                     maintain an action has to first satisfy, in the case of a descriptive
                     word, that it has acquired distinctive or secondary meaning in
                     connection with the Plaintifs business, so that the use of those words
                     in the trade name adopted by another is likely to deceive the public."

 secondary meaning / signifcance therein so that the public denotes and connotes the

trade mark to emanate from the Plaintif only and none else. Whether this test has

been satisfed by the Plaintif has been considered by me in the later part of this

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_31">10.7     Apropos the argument of estoppel raised by the Plaintif against the Defendant

in respect of its trade mark application for the mark 'i-LIFEf, I do not concur with the

same and the Plaintif's reliance upon the case of UltraTech Cement Ltd. (supra) in

the facts of the present case is misplaced. The law of estoppel apropos trade marks is

not that a Defendant who claims a proprietary right in one mark is estopped from

raising a defence, in a suit fled by the Plaintif on the basis of another mark, that the

Plaintiffs mark is descriptive. For a Plaintif to press the doctrine of estoppel, it ought

to show that the Defendant on one hand claims a proprietary right in a particular trade

mark which is admittedly identical with and / or deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs

trade mark and on the other hand claims that the Plaintiffs trade mark is descriptive

and no monopoly can be claimed in respect of the same. It is under such

circumstances, that a Plaintif can press the doctrine of estoppel to prevent the

Defendant from arguing that the Plaintiffs mark is descriptive. In the UltraTech

matter (supra), the Defendant claimed statutory right in the mark 'UltraTuff in

respect of cements by fling a trademark application. When the Plaintif fled a suit for

infringement and passing of against the use of the trade mark 'UltraTuff by the


nitin                                                                                           20/85

 Defendant, the Defendant took a defence that the term 'UltraTechf containing Ultra

as one of the leading and essential feature is descriptive and therefore the Plaintif

cannot claim monopoly in the same. It was in this background that this Court held that

the Defendant cannot blow hot and cold at the same time. The facts of the present

case are completely diferent. Admittedly, the Plaintif has not claimed any cause of

action against the use of the Defendantfs trade marks 'i-LIFEf, 'i-Shieldf 'i-Securef

since there is no similarity between the Plaintiffs trade mark 'iTermf and

Defendantfs trade marks 'i-LIFEf, 'i-Shieldf 'i-Securef. For the purpose of the

present proceedings, the only relevant trade mark of the Defendant which has been

impugned by the Plaintif is 'i-Term", for which, admittedly, the Defendant has not

fled any trade mark application. Hence, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be pressed

against the Defendant on the basis of completely diferent marks. Further, according

to me the fact that the Defendant has fled trade mark applications for its other marks

'i-LIFEf, 'i-Shieldf 'i-Securef and has chosen not to fle any trade mark application in

respect of the mark 'i-Termf in fact shows that the Defendant did not consider the

same to be a trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_32">10.8     In so far as the contention of the Plaintif that since the Defendant had

conducted a search in the Register of Trade Marks, it would imply that the Defendant

considered i-Term to be a trade mark, I do not agree with the same. The Defendant

had conducted a search in the Register of Trade Marks for the mark "AVIVA" and


nitin                                                                                          21/85

 not i-Term per se. On the basis of such search, it cannot be said that the Defendant

considered 'i-Termf to be a trade mark or wanted to register 'i-Termf as a trade mark.

The proprietors of trade marks may generally conduct a search for the whole of their

mark including the descriptive elements therein for eg. Sterling Stationery, Novelty

Confectionary Store etc. If such kind of searches are conducted, it could not be said

that it implies that the proprietors considered the word "Stationery" or

"Confectionary Store" to be trade marks.
</p>
<p id="p_33">10.9     I am therefore of the opinion that the mark 'iTermf of the Plaintif is not

inherently distinctive of its insurance policies sold over the internet.

Issue B:          Whether the Plaintiffs mark "iTerm" has acquired secondary

meaning or such secondary signifcance that it connotes and denotes to the

members of the trade and public, the insurance policies of the Plaintif and no

registrations of trade marks containing the letter "i" is unsustainable in a passing of

Observations / Findings :
</p>
<p id="p_44">13.      I have considered the submissions advanced and the case law cited by the Ld.

Senior Advocates for the parties on the above issue. I have already observed that the

mark 'iTermf is descriptive of the goods and services in respect of which it is used by

the Plaintif and the Defendant. There can be no dispute that even a descriptive word

can be used as a trade mark provided it has become well-known and has acquired a

secondary meaning. The principle that even a descriptive term can acquire

distinctivness and a proprietor can seek injunction on the basis of such mark is well

settled. In T.V. Venugopal (supra), the Supreme Court has held as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">               "85. ... Besides, even assuming that the said word is generic yet if it is
                     found by the court that such a mark has attained distinctiveness and
                     is associated with the business of the Plaintif for considerable time
                     and thereafter the Defendant adopts a similar word as one of his two
                     marks to induce innocent internet users to come to the website of the
                     Defendant, which establishes dishonest intention and bad faith,
                     would the court still be not granting injunction to protect the business
                     of the Plaintiff The answer to the said question has to be an
                     emphatic 'No". User of similar word by a competitor coupled with
                     dishonest intention and bad faith would empower a court to restrain
                     such user/misuser to do equitable justice to the agrieved party

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">               88. The test of common field of activity now accepted is that of "common
                     class of consumers". The reason for this is the likelihood of such
                     consumers identifying the Defendant's goods as originating from the
                     same source as the Plaintif. The question therefore would be,
                     whether from the factual situation, an inference can be drawn that a
                     purchaser of the Defendant's product could assume such product as
                     originating from the Plaintif."

<p id="p_45">13.1     In Jagdish Gopal Kamath (supra), this Court has held as under:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">              "50. The answer from the Defendant is only that the two words, taken
                     disjunctively, are commonplace and that, consequently, the Plaintifs
                     can enjoy no monopoly in the two words taken together. For,
                     according to Mr. Ajatshatru, the combination merely describes a
                     restaurant or eatery serving a certain type of South Indian cuisine.
                     The Plaintifs cannot, Mr. Ajatshatru says, monopolize a phrase
                     that is descriptive and generic.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">              51.    This is simply wrong. The reasons are many. As we have seen, the
                     first defence that the phrase is 'common to the trade' is not
                     established. Second, even a generic or descriptive word can, in some
                     situations, acquire distinctiveness. Again, that law is well-settled.</blockquote><p id="p_46">

                      PTC 355 (Del) a learned single Judge of the Delhi High Court held,
                     citing Halsbury's Laws of England, that it is entirely possible for a
                     word or phrase wholly descriptive of goods and services to become so
                     associated with those of a particular person that their use by another
                     amounts to a representation by the second that his goods or services
                     are those of the first. Although the phrase may be primarily
                     descriptive, it may acquire a secondary meaning connoting
                     exclusively the products or services of a particular person and none
                     other. Lengthy linguistic lucubrations do not always lend themselves
                     to forensic accuracy: where a generic word or expression has acquired
                     distinctiveness and uniquely attaches to the plaintif and his business
                     over considerable time and a defendant adopts a similar expression
                     as his own, dishonesty and bad faith are self-evident. It is irrelevant
                     whether the competing representation is intentional or otherwise. A
                     combination of two commonplace individually descriptive words may
                     indeed acquire, by dint of long, prior and continuous user in relation
                     to specific goods or services, protective rights where the words in
                     question come to be uniquely identified with a particular purveyor.
                     The Supreme Court itself has held that the "part of speech" test does

13.2              So, the question before me is whether the Plaintif has discharged the

Court and the arguments advanced, the answer is in the negative.

13.3              It is a settled principle of law that words used in everyday language, are

not to be allowed to be monopolized. The material annexed by the Plaintif inter alia

comprising of online and ofine publications, promotional material etc. is, according

to me, inadequate to hold that Plaintiffs mark 'iTermf has acquired the requisite

goodwill and reputation for 'iTermf to lose its primary meaning and acquire a

secondary meaning so as to denote the goods and services of the Plaintif only. It is

pertinent to note that the mark of the Plaintif is a descriptive mark and the burden to

be discharged by the Plaintif to gain a secondary meaning is very high. It is a settled

principle of law that in order to prove that a mark has acquired a secondary

signifcance, the documents on record must show that the descriptive expression in

question is now frmly established in the public mind with the Plaintif and its goods

and services. In the case of Stokely Van Camp, Inc &amp; Anr. v Heinz India Pvt Ltd.12

               "There is no room whatever for what may be called a secondary meaning
              in regard to such words, as the Lord Advocate pointed out in the course of
              his argument. The word used, and attached to the manufacture, being an
              invented or fancy and not descriptive, it follows that, if any other person
              proceeds to use that name in the sale of his goods, it is almost if not
              altogether impossible to avoid the inference that he is seeking to pass his
              goods of as the goods of the other manufacturer. A person invents or
              applies the term 'Eureka" as the name of a shirt in his sales. If you buy a
              "Eureka" shirt, that seems at once to mean that you are buying a shirt
              made by the particular maker who is selling shirts under that fancy name.
              The public come to adopt the word "Eureka" as applicable to the
              manufacture of the particular person who began to use it and as denoting
              the article he is selling, and if another person employs the word in the sale
              of the same or a similar article, it seems to follow that he is acting in direct
              violation of the law that no one in selling his goods shall make such
              representations as will enable to pass them of as the goods of another, so as
              to get the benefit of that other's reputation.

              A totally diferent principle must apply in the case of goods which are sold
              under a merely descriptive name. If a person employing a word or term of
              well-known signification and in ordinary use - though he is not able to
              obtain a patent for his manufacture, and although he has not got the
              protection of a registered trade-mark for the goods he is proposing to sell - is
              yet able to acquire the right to appropriate a word or term in ordinary use
              in the English language to describe his goods, and to shut others out from
              the use of this descriptive term, he would really acquire a right much more

               valuable than either a patent or a trade-mark; for he and his successors in
              business would gain the exclusive right, not for a limited time as in the case
              of a patent, but for all time coming, to use the word as applicable to goods
              which others may be desirous of manufacturing and are entitled to
              manufacture and sell as much as he is. That being so, it appears to me that
              the utmost difculty should be put in the way of any one who seeks to adopt
              and use exclusively as his own a merely descriptive term."

              "But there are two observations which must be made: one is that a man

              which I have referred, assumes a much greater burden - and, indeed, a

              to discharge - a much greater burden than that of a man who undertakes to
              prove the same thing of a word not significant and not descriptive, but what

 Pahwa and Ors.14 . In that case, while considering whether shaadi.com had acquired a

secondary meaning, this Court has observed the following:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">              15.    That takes us directly to the question of 'secondary meaning' or
                     'secondary significance'. When does an expression acquire a
                     'secondary meaning' and how does it acquire itf Again, this is a
                     phrase much bandied about, and I do believe we need to pause to
                     consider what is meant by all this. What do we mean when we say
                     that an expression has 'acquired a secondary meaning'f This must
                     necessarily mean that the primary meaning of the expression, the
                     one with which it began, has been lost. It is left behind. The
                     expression no longer means what it once did. It has assumed a new
                     avatar. It has transcended its original connotation and now
                     references exclusively in the public mind the claimant's products,
                     goods or services, i.e., that there is an identification of the mark
                     with the claimant rather than with the goods or services in and of
                     themselves.22 The claim of a 'secondary meaning' posits a priori
                     that the expression once had a more commonplace, ordinary
                     meaning - this is the meaning that is now lost. In its first iteration,
                     the expression found place lower on the Indchemie/Miller Brewing
                     scale. It has since moved upward by acquiring a secondary meaning.
                     That is the claim.</blockquote><p id="p_56">

                     believe this can be so. There is no presumption of secondary meaning

                     uninterrupted use of considerable longevity without a competitor
                     attempting to use it.23 When a person uses a common phrase, he
                     runs the risk that others might also use the same expression or
                     another very like it. In British Vacuum Cleaner Company Limited

</p><p id="p_58">                     328., on which Dr. Tulzapurkar relies, Parker J held that there is
                     a distinction between ordinary descriptive words and a 'fancy
                     word', one that does not primarily relate to the article, but perhaps
                     to the person manufacturing it. There can be no restraint against
                     the use of general words. The decision in Ofce Cleaning Services

                     the expression was identified with their business to such an extent
                     that any other traders who wished to use the expression as part of
                     their trade name would have to diferentiate it. Simons J held that
                     where a trader adopts words in common use for his trade name,
                     some risk of confusion is inevitable. But that risk must be run, or
                     else the first user would be allowed to unfairly monopolise the words.
                     In matters of this nature, courts accept even the smallest diferences
                     sufcient to avert confusion.

                     established by cogent material. References to sales and promotional
                     expenses may be used to establish the acquisition of reputation and
                     goodwill, i.e., to show the popularity of a mark. Mere use and
                     statements of sales and expenses do not, of their own, establish the
                     acquisition of a secondary meaning. That proof is always required
                     of goods or services in the second category, 'merely descriptive'
                     expressions; for these are not ordinarily registrable without such
                     proof. That proof must be directed to establishing that the 'merely
                     descriptive' expression in question is now firmly established in the
                     public imagination with the claimant and its goods and services.
                     High sales and expenses will not do; the claimant must show from
                     carefully neutralized market surveys, etc., that this is indeed how
                     the public perceives the mark - not as a mere description, but a
                     pointed reference to the origin, viz., the claimant. Use itself does
                     not establish distinctiveness. The extent to which a mark has lost its
                     primary meaning and the extent to which it has acquired a
                     secondary one are conclusions to be drawn from evidence. That
                     evidence, showing the displacement of the primary meaning by the
                     secondary meaning, must be of the members of the public as well,
                     not merely those specially placed to attest to its uniqueness."


In the above case, this Court has carefully considered what is meant by the expression

<p id="p_62">13.7     In the present case, the Plaintif has a higher burden to discharge whereby it

must establish that in the public mind, the meaning of 'iTermf does not bear any

reference but to the goods / services of the Plaintif. Further, it must show that in the

public mind the descriptive meaning of 'iTermf is lost and the mark 'iTermf has

acquired a secondary meaning / signifcance which marks the origin of the goods /

services in respect of which it is used, to the Plaintif.
</p>
<p id="p_63">13.8     The Plaintif has produced its sales fgures, promotional expenses and

promotional literature to demonstrate the goodwill and reputation acquired by it.

However, I do not fnd any material that would indicate, much less prove, that when

the Plaintiffs mark 'iTermf is used in respect of its goods / services the public

immediately gather the same as that of the Plaintif. There are over 1 billion people in

India and the Plaintif has sold only about 0.15 million insurance policies from October

2009 till date. Further, the Plaintiffs promotional expenses, amounting to Rs.115

Crores, and sales, amounting to Rs.503.73 Crores, do not assist the Plaintiffs

assertion of the mark 'iTermf acquiring secondary meaning. The fgures are not in

respect of Plaintiffs product bearing the expression 'iTermf per se. The Plaintif

 policies ought to have been aware that other parties might adopt deceptively similar or

identical trade marks in respect of their term insurance policies.

13.9     In my opinion, a mere use of the mark albeit continuous does not necessarily

translate into the mark obtaining secondary distinctive meaning. The extent to which

a mark has lost its primary meaning and the extent to which it has acquired a

secondary one are conclusions to be drawn from evidence. High sales and expenses

cannot be the sole criteria and the Plaintif must show market trends, market surveys

etc. to show that this is indeed how the public now perceives the mark and not as a

mere description. The principle behind not granting any protection to the descriptive

marks is that everyone has a right to use such trademarks, and that it would embarrass

the trade or industry if only one manufacturer was to monopolise the use of such

descriptive mark. Furthermore, protection of such descriptive mark has the tendency

to reduce the use of ordinary and commonly used expressions to describe a product. I

see substance in the Defendantfs argument that until the fling of the present action,

the Plaintif has not asserted proprietary rights in its mark 'iTermf whether it is by

using the 'TMf symbol alongside its trade mark or seeking statutory rights /

protection by registration of its trade mark (the Plaintiffs trade mark applications

were fled shortly before fling of the present action). I believe that had the Plaintiffs

Chartered Accountants actually seen the Plaintiffs insurance policies under its trade

 marks, they would not have been of the opinion that the fgures stated in their

certifcates are in respect of the mark "iTerm" simplicitor.

13.10 There is one more important factor which weighs against the Plaintif and its

claim      of    monopolizing          the   expression   'iTermf.    Admittedly,        the     suit

products/insurance policies of the Plaintif are ofered/sold under the trade mark

"Aegon Religarefs iTerm" or "Aegonfs iTerm Life". The names of these

products/insurance policies are not 'iTermf per se. Hence, when the said products of

the Plaintif are advertised or ofered for sale to the customers, the customers are not

subjected to only the expression 'iTermf but to the whole trade mark of the Plaintif

i.e. Aegon Religarefs iTerm or Aegonfs iTerm Life. This is completely diferent than

a case where consumers are subjected to a specifc term only, albeit of a descriptive

nature, as a trade mark. I believe that when a party claims that a part of its trade mark,

which is otherwise descriptive in nature, has achieved a secondary signifcance, like in

the present case, there has to be cogent and specifc evidence even at an interlocutory

stage to show that such part is also being used by the Plaintif independently or that

such part is the leading and essential feature of the trade mark actually used by the

Plaintif or that such part is being used in such a manner by the Plaintif that the

consumers identify and associate such part with the Plaintif and no one else. The

Plaintif has failed to show any of these requirements.

 13.11 Therefore, I am of the view that the Plaintif has been unable to discharge the

burden to prove that the mark 'iTermf has acquired secondary meaning or such

secondary signifcance that it connotes and denotes to the members of the trade and

public, the insurance policies of the Plaintif and no one else.

Advocate for the Plaintif relied upon the following judgments:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                     This was precisely the view which was expressed by Lord Justice
                     Romer in (1905) I KB 592 to which I have already referred in the
                     earlier part of the judgment. To summarise, therefore, a trader
                     acquires a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it
                     upon or in connection with his goods irrespective of the length of such
                     user and the extent of his trade. The trader who adopts such a mark
                     is entitled to protection directly the article having assumed a vendible
                     character is launched upon the market. As between two competitors
                     who are each desirous of adopting such a mark, "it is, to use familiar
                     language, entirely a question of who gets there first." Gaw Kan Lye
                     v. Saw Kyone Saying AIR 1939 Rang 343 (FB). Registration under
                     the statute does not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any
                     greater right than what already existed at common law and at equity
                     without registration. It does, however, facilitate a remedy which may
                     be enforced and obtained throughout the State and it established the
                     record of facts afecting the right to the mark. Registration itself does
                     not create a trade mark. The trade mark exists independently of the
                     registration which merely afords further protection under the
                     statute. Common law rights are left wholly unafected. Priority in
                     adoption and use of a trade mark is superior to priority in

                     Fourthly, It is also well settled principle of law in the field of the
                     trademarks that the registration merely recognizes the rights which

                  mark, the priority in use of the trade mark by the Plaintif will have
                  to be recognized in law. Accordingly, when the Plaintif has earned
                  the reputation and goodwill in the business in the name and style of
                  'Iruttukadai Halwa', the Defendant cannot simply add the word

                  considered opinion that allowing the Defendant to use the trade mark
                  ' Tirunelveli Iruttukadai Halwa' will amount to deceiving the
                  public, hence, no one can be permitted to encroach upon the goodwill

                  who cannot be termed as a honest current user of the mark on the
                  reputation and goodwill of the company, it will constitute invasion of
                  the proprietary right, hence, the same cannot be permitted any

              looking for Brookfield's "MovieBuf" products who are taken by a search

              there is nevertheless initial interest confusion in the sense that, by using

decision in the case of <a href="/doc/185380767/" id="a_19">Laxmikant V. Patel</a> v. Chetanbhat Shah &amp; Anr. 21 . The

relevant excerpt of the judgment is reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">              "13. In an action for passing of it is usual, rather essential, to seek an
                   injunction temporary or ad-interim. The principles for the grant of
                   such injunction are the same as in the case of any other action against
                   injury complained of. The plaintif must prove a prima facie case,
                   availability of balance of convenience in his favour and his sufering
                   an irreparable injury in the absence of grant of injunction. According
                   to Kerly (ibid, para 16.16) passing of cases are often cases of
                   deliberate and intentional misrepresentation, but it is well-settled
                   that fraud is not a necessary element of the right of action, and the
                   absence of an intention to deceive is not a defense though proof of
                   fraudulent intention may materially assist a plaintif in establishing
                   probability of deception. Christopher Wad low in Law of Passing Of
                   (1995 Edition, at p.3.06) states that the plaintif does not have to
                   prove actual damage in order to succeed in an action for passing of.
                   Likelihood of damage is sufcient. The same learned author states
                   that the defendant's state of mind is wholly irrelevant to the existence
                   of the cause of action for passing of (ibid, paras 4.20 and 7.15). As
                   to how the injunction granted by the Court would shape depends on
                   the facts and circumstances of each case. Where a defendant has
                   imitated or adopted the plaintif's distinctive trade mark or business
                   name, the order may be an absolute injunction that he would not use
                   or carry on business under that name, (Kerly, ibid, para 16.97)."</blockquote><pre id="pre_8">

Plaintiffs present claim is incorrectly made i.e. as if the Plaintiffs trade mark is

"iTerm" per se and not Aegon Religarefs iTerm / Aegonfs iTerm Life. He submitted

that as per the material produced on record the, Plaintiffs and the Defendantfs use is

not of simpliciter "iTerm" / "i-Term". He submitted that for the purpose of

considering the Plaintiffs claim for injunction, a comparison is to be made between

the marks as presented to the public which are "Aegon Religarefs iTerm" /

"Aegonfs iTerm Life" and "Aviva i-Term Smart". He submitted that the present

suit is not for the infringement of trade mark, where tests for comparison are diferent

than the tests applied in case of passing of. He submitted that the Plaintiffs claim to

distinctiveness of the trade mark "iTerm" is because of the manner in which it is

represented, i.e. by using lowercase "i" and uppercase "T". He submitted that the

Plaintiffs use of the mark "iTerm" is not consistent and record shows that the

Plaintif has also used "iTerm" with all letters of the word 'TERMf in uppercase. He

submitted that such use of the mark by the Plaintif supports the Defendantfs

contention that the word "Term" or the letter "i" are purely descriptive of insurance

policies and they denote insurance policies which are available on internet or online

and for a particular duration.

 15.3     The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the principle of

</pre><p id="p_87">Initial Interest Confusion does not apply to the present case. He submitted that the

names of the term insurance plans of the Plaintif and that of the Defendant are

sufciently diferent and cannot confuse any reasonable person. He submitted that

persons who use the internet have become accustomed to the manner of use of the

internet which has sufciently changed and has been simplifed. He submitted that the

rapid expansion and commercialisation of the internet initially left Courts facing novel

legal disputes without the common law precedents that typically guided them. He

submitted that in the absence of statutory direction, the common law tradition

dictates following of precedents. He submitted that in such circumstances, often

ofine precedents are applied to cases involving internet / online facts, without re-

evaluating them in light of the provisions of the trade mark law, technological

developments and better understanding of the internet and in context of the facts of

each case. He submitted that the application of the doctrine of Initial Interest

Confusion in trade mark law in relation to the internet context was questionable at frst

and is certainly inappropriate today since this principle is derived from cases

pertaining to purchases and transactions in ofine markets.

15.4     The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the doctrine of

Initial Interest Confusion was considered to be one of the results of presale confusion

 which company they were dealing with at the time of a sale, and thereby stretched the

traditional trade mark law principles. He submitted that the principle of Initial Interest

Confusion is not only completely contrary to the parameters laid down under the law

to establish trade mark infringement, but is completely inapplicable in an action for

passing-of, such as the present case, since under the applicable laws, an action for

infringement and that of passing-of are on totally diferent footings and employ

absolutely diferent principles of law.

any confusion as to the source or the products considering the nature of the products,

the class of customer and the manner in which the products are sold. He submitted

that the Plaintiffs reliance upon the case of Brookfeld Communications (supra) is

misplaced. He submitted that the said judgment was pronounced in the year 1999;

that thereafter, the said judgment was considered in the case of Network Automation

v. Advance System Concepts22, where the Court held that the manner in which

customers browse the internet has changed. He submitted that the Court had further

observed modern internet users exercise a higher degree of care when they browse the

              Nor is it likely to be purchased over the telephone. LANCIA is a very well-

argument that the Plaintiffs mark 'iTermf is always used by the media and the

incorrect and contrary to documents on record. Referring to the Defendantfs trade

mark applications before the Trade Marks Registry, he submitted that the Defendant

itself has registered its trade marks such as 'iLifef and 'iSheildf without its corporate

manufacture products / ofer services of diferent nature and ofer them for sale under

various trade marks along with the companyfs house mark. However, consumers

largely refer to / identify the said products / services by the individual product

identifcation mark, de hors the house mark. To validate his point, he drew an example

from motor vehicles companies such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai whose cars are

known by their product identifcation marks being Swift, i10, i20, etc. The Ld. Senior

Advocate for the Plaintif also relied upon a table mentioning various policies ofered

by the Plaintif and some of its competitors, along with their product identifcation

he wants a LIC policy, but will refer to the identifcation mark of the policy. He relied

 16.2     The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif relied upon this Courtfs decision in

</pre><p id="p_97"><a href="/doc/124137051/" id="a_24">Pidilite Industries Limited v. Jubilant Agri &amp; Consumer Products Limited</a> 28 wherein

this Court held that product identifcation marks are also considered as trade marks

and their use, albeit with the defendantfs house mark, would constitute infringement

and passing of. The relevant excerpt of this judgment is reproduced below :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">              "22. ... Secondly, even for passing of, there is a clear case of deception
                   and/or confusion. The contention of the Defendant is not tenable
                   since the Defendant itself states that 'Jivanjor' is the house mark of
                   the Defendant. It is evident that the product identification mark used
                   by the Defendant is 'Marine PLUS' and that the same is being used
                   as a trademark. The consumers can never identify the product only
                   by the house mark and it is inevitable that the products are referred
                   to and called out only by their product identification marks. It is the
                   settled position that the use of a mark as a sub-brand also amounts to
                   infringement and an injunction ought to follow. As pointed out by the
                   Plaintif, the products bearing the house mark 'Fevicol' have
                   achieved a turnover close to around Rs. 1000 crores, out of which the
                   turnover of the products bearing the mark 'MARINE' (which is only
                   one of the products of the many products bearing the house mark
                   'FEVICOL') has exceeded Rs. 100 crores. The mark 'MARINE' by
                   itself has gained tremendous reputation and goodwill and further
                   distinctiveness and secondary meaning which is associated by the
                   consumers, trade and public at large with the Plaintif alone. ..."

<p id="p_98">16.3     The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the requirement set

out by IRDAI making it mandatory to state the name of the insurance company in the

 the Defendantfs submissions would cause havoc in the market as everyone will start

using popular trademarks of policies along with their house mark. The Ld. Senior

Advocate for the Plaintif drew an analogy between IRDAIfs mandatory requirement

to state the corporate name along with the policy, and mandatory requirements under

acts such as the <a href="/doc/122504373/" id="a_25">Legal Metrology Act</a>, 2009 and the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_26">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940

which require the manufacturer to specify certain information on the packaging of its

products. He submitted that the compliance of such mandatory requirements does not

and cannot defeat trade mark rights of any person, under statute and / or under

common law. In support of his submissions, he relied upon a decision of the Supreme

Court in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_27">Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel and Ors</a>. 29 and

this Courtfs decision in Tilaknagar Industries Ltd. v. Somarasa Distilleries &amp; Anr. 30.

16.4      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendantfs

reliance upon the case of Kaviraj Durga Dutt Sharma (supra) is misplaced. He

submitted that the Defendant has not discharged the burden of proving that the added

material to his use of mark 'iTERMf is sufcient to distinguish his product from that

of the Plaintif. He submitted that the Plaintif has already relied upon the decision of

this Court in Hem Corporation (supra), wherein it is held that addition of corporate

name to the trade mark shall not distinguish his trade mark from that of the Plaintif.

 16.6     The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that insurance policies are

</pre><p id="p_101">purchased by everyone - educated, uneducated, literate (in English) or not, villagers

that for products like insurance policies there is 'no class of consumersf. He

submitted that customers on the internet are not particularly sophisticated / rich,

Khoday Distilleries (supra), the products in question were scotch whiskeys which

of the product scotch whiskey are 'educated and richf. He submitted that the

were considered by the Court in the case of likelihood of confusion between two

luxury cars 'LANCIAf and 'LANCERf are not relevant while considering the

identical mark 'iTermf in relation to insurance policies. He submitted that the

LANCER case was considered by this Court in the case of Goldgem Overseas v.

<p id="p_103">Observations / Findings


</p><p id="p_104">17.      It is important to note here that the present action is only an action for passing

of and not for infringement of the Plaintiffs trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_105">17.1     The principles that (i) registration under the statute does not confer any new

right to the mark claimed or any greater right than what already existed at common

law and at equity without registration; (ii) registration merely facilitates a remedy

which may be enforced and obtained throughout the country; (iii) registration itself

does not create a trade mark and the trade mark exists independently of the

registration which merely afords further protection under the statute; (iv) common

law rights are left wholly unafected; and (v) priority in adoption and use of a trade

mark is superior to priority in registration are absolutely well settled. While there

cannot be any quarrel with the above principles, the same does not and cannot mean

that the prior user without frst showing that it has acquired the requisite goodwill and

reputation in its trade mark seek injunction against the subsequent user. The

 principles governing a case of passing of action are substantially diferent from an

action for infringement. Unlike an action for infringement which is a statutory remedy

provided under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_30">Trade Marks Act</a>, passing of is a remedy in common law and the

principles governing it are found in judicial precedents. At this juncture it seems

crucial to point out that the matter at hand is not an ordinary case of passing of since

the rival products are not openly available in physical market but are available online.

Further, the sale of these products is closely regulated by Government bodies such as

the IRDAI. It would be fundamental to keep these facts in mind before applying the

common principles of passing of.
</p>
<p id="p_106">17.2              Traditionally, passing of in common law is a right for protection of

goodwill in the business against misrepresentation caused in the course of trade and

for prevention of resultant damage on account of the said misrepresentation. It is a

settled principle of law that in an action for passing of, to succeed, the Plaintif must

satisfy three important ingredients:
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><pre id="pre_14">        a)    Goodwill and reputation in the plaintiffs mark,

        b)    Actual or likelihood of deception and confusion caused amongst the public

        c)    Actual or likelihood of injury to the plaintif by such use of the impugned

              trade mark by the defendant.

</pre><p id="p_108"> The fve guidelines as originally laid out by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink v.

Townend &amp; Sons Ltd.35 (the "Advocate Case") were reduced to the above three by

Lord Oliver in the case of Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc 36 which is

popularly known as "Jif Lemon" case. The said three guidelines are referred to as the

classic trinity test. Passing of action is essentially an action in deceit where no person

is entitled to carry on his or her business on pretext that the said business is of that of

another. The reasons why a prior user is considered to be superior than that of any

other rights is simple - a proprietor who has acquired goodwill and reputation by the

prior and continuous use of its trade mark is entitled to protect such goodwill and

reputation against any subsequent user of the mark who misrepresents his business as

that of business of the prior right holder. For the purpose of granting relief on the

basis of passing of, it is necessary to examine whether the Plaintif has generated the

goodwill in the market and whether the Defendantfs user is causing misrepresentation

in the course of trade and damaging the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintif or

there is a likelihood thereof.

 defendant. Since the present action is one in passing of and not infringement, the

Court must consider how the marks are actually used by the Plaintif and the

Defendant. Now, it is a settled principle that to ascertain the likelihood of confusion

or deception the rival trade marks must be compared as a whole. In the present case,

admittedly, the IRDAI guideline mandatorily requires insurance companies such as

the Plaintif and the Defendant to use their corporate name in the name of their

policies for life insurance. A perusal of the record shows that the trade marks used by

the Plaintif are "Aegon Religarefs iTerm" or "Aegonfs iTerm Life" and the trade

mark used by the Defendant is "Aviva i-Term Smart". The Ld. Senior Advocate for

the Plaintif sought to distinguish the Plaintiffs case by stating that "Aegon" is the

Plaintiffs house mark, whereas "iTerm" is its product identifcation mark and

similarly, "Aviva" is the Defendantfs house mark, and "i-Term" is the Defendantfs

product identifcation mark and that the Plaintiffs product identifcation mark must

be compared with the Defendantfs product identifcation mark. I may have concurred

with the Plaintif and compared simpliciter the rival product identifcation marks as

propounded, if the present suit would have been a suit for infringement of Plaintiffs

registered trade mark 'iTermf per se. This is not a suit for infringement and the

Plaintif is not a registered proprietor of the trade mark 'iTermf per se. The present

suit being a suit for passing of, the law dictates that the overall impression of the rival

trade marks including the added material in the Defendantfs trade mark must be

 considered. The following observations of the Supreme Court in the landmark case of

Kaviraj Pandit Durgadatta Sharma (supra) are important:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">              "28. ...In an action for infringement, the plaintif must, no doubt, make
                   out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but
                   where the similarity between the plaintif's and the defendant's
                   mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the
                   court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
                   evidence is required to establish that the plaintif's rights are
                   violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the
                   trade mark of the plaintif have been adopted by the defendant,
                   the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on
                   the goods or on the packets in which he ofers his goods for sale
                   show marked diferences, or indicate clearly a trade origin
                   diferent from that of the registered proprietor of the mark
                   would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing of, the
                   defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added
                   matter is sufcient to distinguish his goods from those of the
                   plaintif."

While some features may be similar between the rival marks, the Defendant may not

be liable for passing of, if it can prove that the remaining features in its mark are

sufcient to distinguish its goods from those of the Plaintif. In the present case, while

comparing the rival marks, i.e. "Aegon Religarefs iTerm" or "Aegonfs iTerm Life"

<p id="p_110">and "Aviva i-Term Smart", as a whole the only similarity seems to be the word

"iTerm" / "i-Term". From the record, it is clear that neither the Plaintif nor the

Defendant use the expressions 'iTermf or 'i-Term" independently. Whenever a

customer would wish to subscribe to the Plaintiffs insurance policies, he would never

 be subjected to the Plaintiffs insurance policy with the expression 'iTermf alone,

what he would be subjected to is the Plaintiffs insurance policy sold under the trade

marks "Aegon Religarefs iTerm" or "Aegonfs iTerm Life". Similarly, a customer

wanting to subscribe to the Defendantfs insurance policy would be subjected to the

insurance policy sold under the trade mark 'Aviva i-Term Smartf and not with the

term 'i-Termf alone. When these rival trade marks are compared as a whole, I do not

fnd them to be visually or phonetically similar at all. Further, it is a settled principle of

law that if the Plaintiffs mark is descriptive (which I have held to be so) then even a

minor addition to the Defendantfs mark is enough to hold the aspect of dissimilarity

between the rival marks.

the observations in the said cases are applicable to the present case at all. In Hem

were granted and no relief for passing of was granted. Further, the argument of the

defendant therein that 'Madhurf, being descriptive, was inherently incapable of

 stage on the basis of law as it stood i.e. prior to the Full Bench decision of this Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/19267666/" id="a_31">Lupin Limited v. Johnson &amp; Johnson37 In</a> view of the same, I do not see

how this case assists the Plaintif. In the case of Pidilite Industries Ltd. (supra), I had

observed that the defendant therein, itself, had applied for registration of a label mark

containing the same word (MARINE) and therefore the principle of estoppel was

applied. Further, the plaintif in that case had established that the word MARINE was

distinctive of its products which is not so in the present case. Still further, I had held

that the class of purchasers would not be aware of the meaning of the word 'Marinef.

The said case has no application to the present case considering the Plaintiffs mark

"iTerm" is descriptive of the character of the subject goods. Further, the examples

given by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif on the basis of motor vehicle

companies such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai whose cars are known by their product

identifcation marks being Swift, i10, i20, etc., I believe the said examples cannot be

applied to the present case for a simple reason that Swift, i10, i20 are all expressions

which are advertised and used independently by the respective companies in a sense

of a trade mark. The respective companies can therefore claim that those marks have

acquired distinctiveness. In the present case, admittedly, the expression 'iTermf is

not used independently at all and I have already held that the said expression is not

distinctive of the Plaintiffs product. Further, the example of LIC policy given by the

 Plaintif in case of insurance policies belies its own case. It is the Plaintiffs case that

when a consumer asks for an insurance policy, he does not simply say he wants a LIC

policy, but will refer to the identifcation mark of the policy such as Jeevan Anand,

Jeevan Saral etc. (Paragraph 66 of the Plaintiffs Written Submissions) This

according to me makes it clear that a customer wanting to purchase an insurance

policy would always refer to or go by the name of the Company frst and then would

refer to the name of the policy thereby eliminating any chance of confusion or

deception merely on the basis of similarity in the names of the policy.

17.5     Admittedly, neither the Plaintif nor the Defendant can sell its insurance

policies without its respective corporate names. This is because of a specifc statutory

requirement imposed by IRDAI upon every insurance company that it must describe

its products with the corporate name. The Insurance Regulatory and Development

Authority of India (IRDAI) mandates under the Laws of Insurance and the various

Regulations, including the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India

(Protection of Policy Holdersf Interests) Regulations, 2017, that amongst others the

name and UIN allotted by the Authority for the product governing the policy, its

terms and conditions; name, code number, contact details of the person involved in

sales process are matters that should be mentioned in a Life Insurance Policy (Page 64

of the Plaint / Page 350 of Defendantfs Afdavit in Reply). If such is the case, I

believe that this is one of the most important factor which reduces or in the facts of


nitin                                                                                           69/85

 the present case eliminates any chance of confusion or deception between the rival

trade marks.
</p>
<p id="p_112">17.6     At this point, let me immediately deal with the argument of the Plaintif that

the compliance of mandatory requirement of IRDAI does not and cannot defeat trade

mark rights of any person, under statute and / or under common law. In the case of

Ramdev Food (supra) the requirement to use the impugned company name was raised

as a defence. Similarly, in Tilaknagar Industries (supra) the defendant therein

claimed that it had a right to use the trade mark label since that label was approved by

the Karnataka Excise Authority. In the present case, the Defendant is not claiming

legitimacy in the use of the expression 'i-Termf on the basis of its approval by the

IRDAI. In other words, the Defendant is not claiming that it is entitled to use the

expression "i-Term" because it has got the mandatory approval from IDRDAI. The

Defendant has relied on the mandatory requirement of IRDAI to only point out how

the marks of the Plaintif and Defendant are required to be represented in public and

that due to such presentation there is no possibility of confusion or deception. I

therefore reject the analogy given by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif

regarding the statutory requirements laid down under the <a href="/doc/122504373/" id="a_32">Legal Metrology Act</a>, 2009

and the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_33">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 requiring manufacturers to specify certain

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">        d.    The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the

 to each factor in every case. In the present case, I have already observed that the

Plaintiffs mark is descriptive in nature as it describes the characteristic of a term

insurance policy available online. Therefore, the nature of the goods involved, the

class of purchasers who buy the policies and the mode and manner of purchasing the

policies or placing orders for the policies, outweigh any slight phonetic or visual

similarity between the rival marks. In other words, the three factors which are more

important and deserve a greater weightage being given to them are (c), (e) and (f).

17.8     I have already observed that the unique characteristic of the subject goods is

that they can only be purchased online from the websites of the parties herein and the

websites of policy aggregators. Obviously since the policies are only available online,

the mode of purchase is through the internet. This gains importance especially

because it is the Plaintiffs case that confusion and deception occurs when a

prospective customer enters the keyword "iTerm" in his online search engine such as

google, the Defendantfs website would be shown as a result along with the Plaintiffs

website. The principle of initial interest confusion was cited by the Ld. Senior

Advocate for the Plaintif to argue that such customer may navigate to the

Defendantfs website under the impression that the Defendantfs website is in fact the

Plaintiffs or that the Defendant has some nexus / afliation with the Plaintif. After

hearing the submissions on the law apropos the principle of initial interest confusion, I

am inclined to disagree with the applicability of the said principle to the facts of the


nitin                                                                                          72/85

 present case. The principle of initial interest confusion was frst recognized by the

United States Court of Appeals in the Brookfeld (supra). This principle was later

applied by the Delhi High Court in the case of Baker Hughes (supra). It was held that

the principle of initial interest confusion applies in a situation where a customer who

is looking for the plaintiffs product develops an "initial interest" in the defendantfs

product believing the same to be emanating from the plaintif or having some nexus

with the plaintif. Even though no purchase is made or the customer realises before

purchasing from the defendant, the mere deception / confusion with respect to the

origin of the defendantfs goods or services shall invoke the principle of initial interest

confusion. However, the Plaintiffs contention that customers search for the

Plaintiffs policies online by using the keyword "iTerm", or that the "interest" of the

prospective customer of the Plaintif will be invoked upon fnding an 'i-Termf product

on the Defendantfs portfolio, is based on an assumption that the Plaintif has acquired

substantial goodwill and reputation in the expression "iTerm" and that the said

expression is distinctive of the Plaintiffs goods and services. As observed

hereinbefore, this is not a case where the Plaintif has been able to show that it has

acquired the requisite goodwill and reputation in the expression 'iTermf per se. In the

absence of such goodwill and reputation it would be incorrect to infer that a

prospective customer of the Plaintif associates the expression 'iTermf exclusively

with the goods and services of the Plaintif and that such customerfs interest will be

 piqued upon coming across the Defendantfs 'i-Termf product. In the case of

Brookfeld (supra), it was held that there may not be a confusion as to the source, but

by using "moviebuf.com", customers of the plaintif therein were diverted to the

defendantfs website and such diversion amounted to getting improper benefts from

the goodwill that Brookfeld developed in its 'MovieBuff mark. This theory is not

applicable in the present case as the Plaintif has failed to show any goodwill in its

mark "iTerm".
</p>
<p id="p_116">17.9     It is pertinent to note that the suits in Brookfeld (supra) were fled nearly two

decades prior to the present suit. In the interregnum the use of electronic devices to

access the internet has increased overwhelmingly. The average person is much more

adept to conduct online searches and is less likely to be confused as compared to a

customer browsing online 18 years ago. In the case of Network Automation (supra)

relied upon by the Defendant, the US Court recognized this development in the class

of customers who access the internet for their demands. The Court recognized that

users in 2011 were more educated and the test in Brookfeld cannot be blindly applied

to the matter in 2011. The said case clearly establishes that (i) the initial interest

confusion arises even if the customer goes to the defendantfs site knowing that it is

not the site of the plaintif and, as such, is not a strict test, more so in view of the fact

that in the present times, an educated searcher on internet, by merely going to the

defendantfs site or seeing defendantfs product, does not in any manner allow the


nitin                                                                                            74/85

 defendant to take beneft of the reputation of the plaintif, (ii) what is required to be

considered is how the search is made and the efect of such search, (iii) the factor that

the customer, though knowing that the product mentioned therein is not of the

plaintif, but results in the defendant getting monetary beneft, is not a determinant

factor to conclude that there is confusion. In comparison, the present suit is of 2018.

In my view it is unlikely that a person who accesses the internet in this day and age

would be confused or deceived by the Defendantfs use of the expression 'i-Termf in

the name of its insurance policies. As I have already observed, the Plaintif has been

unable to establish that its iTerm mark has acquired such secondary signifcance that

any person who sees the expression 'iTermf would immediately associate the same

with the Plaintif and the Plaintif only. Since the sale of the subject insurance policies

is online, I am not inclined to assume that a prospective customer searching for

policies online would use the keyword "iTerm" alone to look for the Plaintiffs

policies. I see merit in the Defendantfs submission that such customer even after

coming across the Defendantfs insurance policy would go back and also review the

policy being ofered by the Plaintif.
</p>
<p id="p_117">17.10             It is further pertinent to note that insurance policies are long term

fnancial commitments through which customers seek to secure important aspects of

their lives. More often than not, a decision is preceded by a search and discussion into

the various options available for them. A customer who sees the Defendantfs policy is

 likely to see other policies including the Plaintiffs before deciding on one. The

customers who purchase online Term Insurance Policy Plans have to read and

understand various terms since the Policy Holder cannot plead ignorance about these

terms after the Policy is purchased. Some of the general terms required to be read and

understood before purchasing online term insurance policy are as follows

credibility, reliability and fnancial standing of the company which is issuing the

policy, its record as to entertainment of claim or rejection of claims, various features

of the insurance policy etc. and, after giving careful thought to the aforesaid, a

decision is made in selecting a particular insurance policy. These policies are not

purchased on the spur of the moment. The Supreme Court in Khoday Distilleries

(supra) held that the class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods by their

education and intelligence and the degree of care which they are likely to exercise in

purchasing or using the goods must be considered. While persons from all walks of life

are free to purchase insurance policies online, customers who purchase policies online

are usually literate persons since they are required to read and understand inter alia

the terms and conditions applicable to the policy being purchased by them. The

LANCER trade mark case (supra) is also a helpful illustration of a similar market

where the buyer makes his purchase with care and after deliberation. Rival marks in

this case were LANCIAf and 'LANCERf, used in respect of cars. The Court therein

has considered the nature of the goods and the manner in which purchase was made to

arrive at the conclusion that notwithstanding the degree of phonetic similarity

between the two marks, there was no real tangible danger of confusion.

 17.12 Due to the nature of insurance policies as a product and the manner in which

they are sold, they cannot be compared with ordinary goods which are available across

the counter such as sweets or even pharmaceutical products. The purchasers of

insurance policies take an informed decision which makes it unlikely that in the

process of such decision the purchasers are confused by a slight phonetic or visual

similarity of the names in respect of such products. I must clarify that this Court is not

assuming that the discerning capacity of customers is based on their education or

wealth. The logic underlying this Courtfs rationale is that the class of customers who

are purchasing insurance policies online are likely to have conducted a fair research

into their options and the benefts ofered to them under each policy; that a slight

similarity in the rival names would not be enough to cause confusion or deception

when a conscious and relatively informed decision is being taken. In view thereof, the

principle set out in Gorbatschow Vodka (supra) is not helpful to the Plaintiffs case.

Further, the goods involved in the case of Goldgem case (supra) were diamonds. The

principle set out in Goldgem case (supra) would not be applicable to the present case

since due to the nature of goods i.e. diamonds, the class of consumers who purchase

diamonds and the mode of purchasing them is distinct from the present case involving

insurance policies. Unlike purchasers of diamonds who are dependent on the guidance

of gemmologists and are dependent almost entirely on the brand name, purchasers of

insurance policies have the ability to discern the best policy available to them

 depending upon the terms and more particularly the Company which is ofering the

same. Thus, the ratio in of Goldgem (supra) is also inapplicable to the present case.

17.13 I therefore hold that considering the nature of the rival marks, rival products,

the class of purchasers who are likely to buy these products and the mode of

purchasing these products, there is no question of any confusion or deception between

the rival trade marks. Particularly, considering the nature of the goods and the manner

in which insurance policies are purchased, there is no possibility of persons who are

buying insurance policies online after analysis and considering the pros and cons,

getting confused.

the expression 'iTermf, would that mere fact be enough to create exclusive

proprietary rights in the said expression in favour of the Plaintif? I think not. The

"frst in the market" test may have been applicable if the mark "iTerm" was

distinctive of the Plaintiffs goods and services. I have held it is not. The case of

<a href="/doc/185380767/" id="a_34">Laxmikant V. Patel</a> (supra) was decided on the basis that long prior user conferred

rights on the party and is required to be protected, which is not the position in the

present case. In the absence of the Plaintif having acquired the requisite goodwill or

reputation in the expression 'iTermf, it cannot be said that the Defendant indulged in

 unfair competition as the Defendant has not used any false or misleading devices to

get any beneft of the alleged reputation allegedly acquired by the Plaintif. Thus, the

said case shall not assist the Plaintif.
</p>
<p id="p_130">17.15 In the absence of the Plaintif having established that its trade mark "iTerm" is

in fact a trade mark or is distinctive of its products, there is no likelihood of confusion

or deception. Thus, the principles of Neon Laboratories (supra) relied upon by the

Plaintif are inapplicable to the present case. The observations in Meghraj Biscuits

(supra) and S. Syed Mohideen (supra) were in the case of a distinctive mark. The

Plaintiffs mark "iTerm" is not distinctive and is not capable of adapting to

distinguish the Plaintiffs goods considering the nature of the goods, the class of

customers and the manner of purchase of online insurance policies. In South India

Beverages (supra) the Court had come to the conclusion that the defendant therein

had slavishly copied the mark of the plaintif therein and therefore cannot be

permitted to continue to use the deceptively similar trade mark. Thus the said

judgment is not applicable to the facts of the present case. In the case of Heinz

(supra) though the argument that the mark is descriptive was raised, it was not

considered. As I have observed, mere prior user will not entitle the Plaintif to get an

injunction without consideration of material regarding what are the marks, how they

are presented to the public, the quality of the Plaintiffs mark "iTerm", and whether

 taking into consideration all factors, confusion can arise. Mere prior user is not a

determinant factor to reach that conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_131">17.16 I, therefore hold that the Defendantfs use of its mark 'Aviva i-Term Smartf in

respect of its insurance policies sold over the internet is not likely to cause

misrepresentation or confusion or deception in the minds of consumers and

consequently there is no likelihood of damage to the Plaintif. In short, the

Defendantfs activities do not constitute passing of.
</p>
<p id="p_132">18.      There is one more factor which according to me is important in deciding the

present application of the Plaintif which is 'the adoption of the trade mark by the

Defendantf. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that due to the

Plaintiffs extensive use of its trade mark and the reputation and goodwill acquired by

it therein, the Defendant, who operates in the same industry and targets the same

market / customers, ought to have knowledge about the use of the trade mark 'iTermf

by the Plaintif and in any case, cannot feign ignorance of the same. He submitted that

from 2009 till May 2018, no other person / entity used the mark 'iTermf in relation to

insurance products falling in Class 36. He submitted that the Defendant has

deliberately adopted the impugned mark "i-Term Smart" in order to come as close as

possible to and to ride upon the goodwill and reputation generated by the 'iTermf

trade mark range of products; and therefore the Defendantfs adoption of its trade

mark is dishonest. Relying upon this Courtfs decision in Anglo-French Drug &amp;

 Industries Ltd. v. Eisen Pharmaceutical Company Pvt. Ltd38, the Ld. Senior Advocate

for the Plaintif submitted that if this Court is even prima facie satisfed that the rival

marks are deceptively similar and the adoption of the impugned mark is dishonest, not

granting an injunction would amount to encouraging dishonest parties.

18.1     Now, admittedly, the Plaintif fled an application for the registration of its

trade mark "iTerm" per se only ten days before fling of the above suit against the

Defendant. This, according to me prima facie shows that the Plaintif was itself aware

of the descriptive nature of its trade mark and hence did not make any application

earlier. From a perusal of the material produced by the parties herein, it does not

appear that the Plaintif has asserted any proprietary rights in its mark 'iTermf at any

point prior to the Defendantfs adoption of its mark. I have observed hereinabove that

the Plaintif has been unable to discharge the burden of proving that it has acquired

such goodwill and reputation in the descriptive mark iTerm that the said mark has lost

its primary meaning and acquired a secondary meaning to be exclusively associated

with the Plaintif. Since the Plaintif does not have proprietary rights in the mark

iTerm, the Defendantfs adoption of the same cannot be termed as dishonest. The

judgment in Anglo-French Drug (supra) is not applicable to the present case since the

Court therein had granted injunction as the conduct of the Defendant was found to be

dishonest, which is not the case here.</p><pre id="pre_18">

for the Plaintif submitted that the documents produced by the Plaintif, including the

Chartered Accountantfs Certifcate certifying the sales of 'iTermf marked policies,

clearly establish that the Plaintif has been using the mark iTerm continuously and

extensively from 2009 till date whereas the Defendant has started using the mark only

in May 2018. He submitted that despite the Plaintif specifcally denying the

Defendantfs user of the impugned trade mark, the Defendant has not produced even a

single instance of sale of its policy under the mark 'iTermf. He submitted that

therefore it is clear that the Defendant has not done any business under the mark

'iTermf and therefore will not be harmed if this Court grants an injunction restraining

the Defendant from using the trademark 'iTermf. He submitted that such injunction

will not lead to stoppage of the Defendantfs business since the Defendant has not

commenced business under the impugned trade mark and the Defendant is also doing

business under various other marks. He further submitted that if an injunction is

denied to the Plaintif, the Plaintif will sufer irreparable harm. He submitted that the

balance of convenience is therefore completely in favour of the Plaintif and against

the Defendant.

as several customers as the legal status of such already purchased policies will be in

jeopardy.
</p>
<p id="p_135">19.2     In my view, any order of injunction against the Defendant now will result in

severe pecuniary injury and fnancial damage to the large number of customers who

have purchased the Defendantfs Insurance Policy. The Defendant has advertised and

sold its product as allowed by the IRDAI. The Plaintif has not been able to show

misrepresentation or damage to its reputation. The Plaintif has not acquired

proprietary rights, statutory or otherwise in the expression 'iTermf. Before fling the

above suit the Plaintif has never asserted any proprietary rights within its mark iTerm

at any point prior to the Defendantfs adoption of its mark. The Plaintiffs trade mark

applications for 'iTermf per se were made only few days prior to fling of the present

action. The Plaintiffs mark being descriptive of the goods and services provided by

the Plaintif and Defendant, injuncting the Defendant in the absence of the Plaintiffs

exclusive rights therein would be unfair. The Plaintif has failed to make out any prima

facie case in its favour. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the Defendant.
