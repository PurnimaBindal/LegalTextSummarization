2     The version of the prosecution was unfolded on the statement of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                     Page 2 of 27</span>

(PW-14) in the hospital after he had obtained a fitness on his application

(Ex.PW-14/A). The statement (Ex.PW-14/A1) is to the effect that Sanju

Devi was living in her jhuggi at Nehru Nagar, Anand Parbhat; at about

9.30 PM on 22.7.2006 while she was preparing a meal in her jhuggi her

neighbour accused Munni Lal and his wife accused Tilisra entered her

jhuggi and told her that there was no one to save her; she had been saved

earlier; they asked her to vacate the jhuggi; the victim refused to vacate

it; thereupon Tilisra caught hold of the hair of the victim and started

beating her with her legs and fists; her husband Munni Lal who had a

danda in his hand started beating her with the danda.         The victim

received injuries. Thereupon Munni Lal took out a sharp edged weapon

from his right pant pocket and attacked the victim on her arms; her

neighbour Vijay Laxmi (PW-5) rushed in. The accused persons ran

away.

<p id="p_2">
3       Pursuant to this statement the initial FIR had been registered

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                    Page 3 of 27</span>
 under the aforesaid provision of law but after the victim had succumbed

to her injuries on 24.7.2006 (two days after the incident) the offence was

converted to the offence of murder. The name of the third accused

Kamal Kishore had surfaced in the disclosure statement of the other two

accused, pursuant to which the conspiracy hatched by all three of them

had emanated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
4     Further version of the prosecution is that Kumari Savitri (PW-8),

daughter of the deceased (aged about 12 years) had seen the incident;

she was in the jhuggi at that time. She deposed that accused Munni Lal

was armed with a danda and his wife Tilisra both entered their jhuggi;

Tilisra caught hold of her mother whereas Munni Lal started beating her

mother with the danada. Accused Kamal Kishore was also present and

he also started beating her mother with fists and kicks; they asked her

mother to vacate the jhuggi. PW-8 became alarmed and rushed to the

house of her aunt (mausi) who was living nearby and narrated the

incident to her.

<p id="p_4">
5     The aunt of PW-8, Manju Devi has been examined as PW-4; she

has corroborated the version of PW-8. On hearing this incident from her

 niece she rushed to her sister‟s jhuggi where she found Sanju Devi lying

on the floor having injuries on her left arm and knife injury on her right

forearm and she was crying with pain. Sanju Devi disclosed to PW-4

that she had been injured by Munni Lal and Tilisra who had after

attacking her run away. She further disclosed that this incident had

occurred at the behest of Kamal @ Baba who wanted the jhuggi.


6     PCR was informed at 10.00 P.M. DD No.37A (Ex.PW-3/D) was

recorded on 22.7.2006 at 10.12 PM noting the information about Sanju

Devi wife of Dinesh Rao had been attacked in her jhuggi. This DD was

marked to PW-14, who on reaching the spot had noted that the injured

had already been removed to the hospital by H.C. Mahener Pal (PW-15)

who was on PCR duty at that time. PW-14 recorded the statement of the

injured in the hospital. The rukka was handed over to Const. Pawan

(PW-7) pursuant to which the FIR (Ex.PW-3/A) was registered.


7     At the spot rough site plan Ex.PW-14/C was prepared and

thereafter the scaled site plan was prepared by SI Mahesh Kumar

14    The    prosecution in support of its case had examined 19

witnesses.   Statement of the accused persons were recorded under

<a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_24">Section 313</a> of the Code who pleaded innocence and stated that they

have been falsely implicated in the present case.

17    On behalf of the appellant Munni Lal arguments have been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                 Page 9 of 27</span>
 addressed by Mr.R.K.Anand, Advocate. Attention has been drawn to

the testimony of PW-4, the daughter of the victim, who has been

projected as an eye-witness as also PW-8, the sister of the victim.

Learned counsel for the appellant points out that there are discrepancies

in the aforenoted two versions and the prosecution has failed to establish

that PW-4 was in living with her mother at the relevant time; it has been

argued that the victim and her husband did not share cordial relations

and their daughter PW-4 was in fact living with her father in U.P.; she

was not an eye-witness. Even otherwise PW-4 and PW-8 both have

stated that they had accompanied the victim to the hospital but this stand

stood controverted by PW-15 who had removed the injured to the

hospital and has categorically in his cross-examination admitted that the

sister and the daughter of the victim had not accompanied him to the

hospital. Attention has also been drawn to the medical report of the

victim i.e. the MLC Ex.PW-1/A. It is pointed out that the versions of the

PW-4 and PW-8 that the victim had been discharged after a prima facie

check-up and appeared to be normal and it was only on her way home

that she felt faint and was taken back to the hospital but this version of

PW-4 and PW-8 is not borne out from Ex.PW-1/A which has neither
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                    Page 10 of 27</span>
 noted any discharge nor has any re-admission been noted in the said

MLC. The two versions cannot be reconciled. Learned counsel for the

appellant submits that at best this could be a case of knowledge on the

part of the accused persons that by their act they could have caused such

injuries upon the person of the victim which had led to her death; there

was no premeditation and common intention on the part of the accused

to cause murder of the victim; the conviction is liable to be set aside. To

support this submission, learned counsel for the appellant has placed

reliance upon the judgments of the Supreme Court reported as (2011) 2

SCC (Crl.) 110 <a href="/doc/1324536/" id="a_25">Satish Narayan Sawant v. State of Goa</a>; (2011) 1 SCC

(Crl.) 352 <a href="/doc/179539960/" id="a_26">Dhan Singh v. State of Haryana</a> as also another judgment of

the Apex Court report in (2005) 9 SCC 71 Shanker Narayan Bhadolkar

Vs. State of Maharashtra. Submission being in all these cases that even

graver weapons of offence had been used and the injuries had been on

vital parts of the body yet in all the aforenoted cases the Apex Court had

thought it a fit case to reduce the offence of murder to an offence under

<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_27">Section 304</a> Part -II of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">IPC</a>. Learned counsel for the appellant thus

submits that the conviction of the appellant can at best be one under

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_29">Section 304</a> Part-II of the IPC.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                     Page 11 of 27</span><p id="p_15">
 18    On behalf of accused Tilisara arguments have been addressed by

Advocate Mr. Dandapani. He has adopted the stand taken by counsel

for the accused Munni Lal. It is pointed out that the role ascribed to

Tilisara is even lesser that that of Munni Lal as Munni Lal was carrying

a danda whereas Tilisra was unarmed; even as per the version of the

prosecution she had hit the victim only by fist and blows. Conspiracy

has also not been established.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
19    On behalf of the accused Kamal Kishore arguments have been

addressed by Advocate Mr.Trivedi. It is pointed out that apart from the

disclosure statement of the co-accused no other evidence is forthcoming

against him; even pursuant to the disclosure statement of the accused no

recovery has been effected. There is, thus, no evidence in the eye of

law. Attention has been drawn to the version of PW-4 and PW-8 who

have been projected as star witnesses of the prosecution. Submission

being that in their statements recorded under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_30">Section 161</a> of the Code no

role of beating had been ascribed to Kamal @ Baba. His name has been

reflected for the first time only in their depositions on oath in court

which is a material improvement qua their versions before the police.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                   Page 12 of 27</span>
 No reliance can thus be placed upon such an evidence. Accused Kamal

@ Baba is entitled to an acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
20    Arguments have been rebutted by the prosecution. Learned Public

Prosecutor points out that the testimony of PW-8 who is an eye-witness

remain untarnished.     Her statement was corroborated by her mausi

PW-4. The medical report also speaks volumes. The cause of death

was the result of injuries inflicted upon the victim by the accused

person; the conviction call for no interference.

been admitted vide MLC No.18157.                  The time of admission was

recorded as 11.25 PM by Dr.Rishi (PW-1). The MLC further notes a

history of assault on the victim.           Patient, however, appeared to be

conscious and well oriented at that time. Her pulse was recorded at 78

beats per minute; her blood pressure was noted as 100/60.                      Three

      alleged criminal activity so as to be able to take suitable steps for tracing and
      bringing to book the guilty party. The first information report, we may point
      out, does not constitute substantive evidence though its importance as
      conveying the earliest information regarding the occurrence cannot be
      doubted. It can, however, only be used as a previous statement for the
      purpose of either corroborating its maker under <a href="/doc/1002421/" id="a_33">Section 157</a> of the Indian
      Evidence Act or for contradicting him under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_34">Section 145</a> of that Act. It

<p id="p_23">24    Apart from the fact that lodging of an information under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_35">Section

154</a> Cr.P.C. keeps the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of

Police informed of the occurrence and when recorded, it in fact becomes

the basis of the case set up by the informant and provides material to the

police to commence investigation. Its fundamental object is that it acts

as a safeguard against embellishment, exaggeration and forgetfulness. It

may not constitute a substantive piece of evidence, but it is a

conveyance of the information at the earliest and cannot be doubted.


25    In the instant case the sequence of evidence shows that the

incident having occurred at 9.30 PM and the PCR having reached the

spot at about 10.00 PM. Attar Singh (PW-2) owner of the STD booth

from where the PCR call was made between 9-10 PM by a young girl

aged 11-12 years is also corroborative. DD entry in the local police

station having been recorded at 10.12 PM and thereafter the injured

having been brought from her residence at Anand Parbhat to the DDU

Hospital (which itself might have taken 40-45 minutes); the MLC (Ex.

PW-1/A) mentions the time of arrival at 11.25 PM at which time the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                    Page 16 of 27</span>
 patient also appeared to be conscious and well oriented. It was in this

intervening period that PW-14 recorded the statement of Sanju Devi

which had then become the basis of the FIR. This sequence of events as

detailed in the ocular testimony of the witnesses (PW-4, PW-8, PW-14

and PW-15) matched the recorded information, both in the DD entry as

also in the MLC.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
26    PW-8 is an eye-witness. She is the daughter of the victim; she

was aged less than 12 years at the time of incident and approximately 12

years at the time of deposition in the Court. Her statement recorded

before the Magistrate as also on oath in Court was after a preliminary

round of questions put to her to enable the Court to draw a conclusion

that she was able to intelligently and rationally understand the said

queries.   She had matched her statement on oath with her statement

recorded before the police. She categorically stated that on 22nd day of

the month at about 9.30 PM while she was in the „Chapper‟ in front of

her jhuggi (being a part of the jhuggi) she saw both the accused Tilisara

and Munni Lal come inside their jhuggi; Munni Lal was armed with a

danda. Tilisara caught hold of her mother from her hair and pinned her

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                   Page 17 of 27</span>
 down to the ground; Munni Lal started beating her mother with danda

blows. Her mother raised alarm and Baba (third accused) thereafter

started beating her mother with fists and kick blows; they were all

asking her mother to vacate the jhuggi as Baba @ Kamal had a tent shop

adjacent to their jhuggi. Police was called. Her mausi Manju Devi

(PW-4) living close by was informed. When PW-8 returned back to her

jhuggi along with PW-4 she saw her mother lying unconscious. Her

mother was removed to the hospital. In her cross-examination she has

stuck to her stand. She denied the suggestion that she was not an eye-

witness. She admitted that in her statement under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_36">Section 161</a> of the

Code she had not mentioned that Baba @ Kamal had attacked her

mother; she has also admitted that initially the doctor has discharged her

mother but thereafter she was re-admitted because after her discharge

she had fainted; she had further admitted that she had gone to hospital

with her mother and mausi.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
27    PW-4, the mausi of PW-8, has corroborated this version of her

niece. Her deposition is to the effect that at 9.30 PM her neice came to

her jhuggi informing her that her mother has been attacked by Munni

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                    Page 18 of 27</span>
 Lal and Tilisara. On her reaching the jhuggi of her sister she found her

sister lying in a pitiable condition; her sister informed her that she had

been beaten by danda blows by Munni Lal and Tilisra had given her

fists and kick blows; they had both entered her jhuggi asking her to

vacate it.   In her cross-examination she had stated that she had

accompanied her sister and niece to the hospital. She admitted that after

the treatment was given to her sister, she was discharged and when they

were on the way back since her sister became unconscious she was

taken back to the hospital re-admited;       She was advised X-ray and

ultrasound; blood was also administered to her as she had undergone a

surgery; she died on the following day because of a spleen ruptured.


28    This testimony of PW-4 in fact discloses that Sanju Devi had

made a dying declaration to her, which statement had then become the

basis of the FIR. Not only can the FIR which is a recorded document

(within less than five hours from the time of incident) be disbelieved but

the statement of PW-4 which is in corroboration of the testimony of

PW-8 also shows no reason as to why the aforenoted accused persons

would be implicated falsely. In fact no suggestion has also been given

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                    Page 19 of 27</span>
 to either PW-4 or PW-8 on this count that they were deposing falsely

and against the accused persons for any ulterior motive.


29    The medical record which is the MLC and the post mortem report

also substantiates the version of the prosecution. The MLC

(Ex. PW-1/A) shows that initially when the patient had been brought in

she appeared to be conscious and well oriented; there was no clinical

abnormality. Thereafter within a span of less than a few hours she was

admitted to the surgical unit of the hospital where she was operated

upon. Dr. Sanjay Singh, Senior Resident Surgery, of the DDU Hospital

has clarified that the patient remained in the hospital and was not re-

admitted after discharge. Testimony of PW-4 and PW-8 on this count

can be reconciled by the fact that the patient was never formally

discharged even though the doctor who had prepared her MLC had

noted that she was clinically normal. She had in fact been kept under

observation. PW-4 and PW-8 at that point decided to take the patient

home when on the way patient had fainted and was then in an emergent

condition admitted in the surgical unit.     The death summary report

(Ex.PW-10/A) evidences that the patient had been operated upon on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                  Page 20 of 27</span>
 23.7.2006 for a spleen rupture; at 6.25 P.M. while in the post operative

care information was received that she needed urgent medical attention;

she was shifted to the ICU but in spite of best efforts she could not be

saved.     She was declared dead at 7.30 P.M. on 24.7.2006. Cause of

death had been opined as abdominal trauma with spleen rupture (post

OP) and cardiac arrest. This medical record clearly establishes that it

was because of the injuries suffered by the victim at the hands of the

accused persons that her death had occurred.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
30       Reliance by the learned counsel for the appellant on medical

opinion about a ruptured spleen would not really assist his case because

this was not a case of a single injury i.e. of only a spleen rupture alone;

it is a case of 14 injuries upon the victim of which the first injury was a

deep abdominal injury which had led to the ruptured spleen.


31       Pursuant to the disclosure statement of accused Munni Lal, the

danda was recovered (Ex.PW-14/E). The subsequent opinion of the

doctor on this weapon of offence (Ex. PW-19/A and Ex. PW-18/C) also

establishes that this weapon could have in fact caused the injuries upon

the victim and which had led to her death.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                     Page 21 of 27</span><p id="p_27">
 32    The motive of the crime has been elicited in the version of the

aforenoted two PWs i.e. PW-4 and PW-8. Both of them have deposed

that accused Munni Lal and Tilisra wanted to get the victim evicted

from her jhuggi at the behest of Kamal @ Baba who was running a tent

house and was storing his tents in the place adjacent to the jhuggi of

Sanju Devi.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
33    The sum total of the evidence thus establishes that both the

accused Munni Lal and Tilisra had in unison entered the jhuggi of the

victim and had given her fist and kick blow which were followed by

danda blows; which in turn caused her death in the next one and half

days. It was a concerted act; each one knew the mind of the other when

they entered the jhuggi of the victim. Their conspiracy to commit the

act stands established.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
34    Role of the co-accused Kamal @ Baba is, however, not clear.

Prosecution has no evidence against him. Apart from his disclosure

statement there is no other evidence to nail him. No recovery has also

been effected pursuant to his disclosure statement. That apart even in

the first version recorded of PW-4 (star witness of the prosecution) she
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                  Page 22 of 27</span>
 has not named Kamal @ Baba as an assailant; his role has been elicited

for the first time only in her version in Court. Even on confrontation she

had admitted this stand. Sanju Devi in her statement had also not named

him. There, thus, being no evidence against accused Kamal @ Baba, he

is entitled to an acquittal; he is accordingly acquitted.


35    The last submission made by the learned counsel for the accused

Munni Lal and Tilisra however needs attention.         Learned counsel for

the appellant has argued that even presuming that death had occurred at

the hands of the aforenoted accused persons; this was not a case of any

premeditation or intent to commit murder. The weapon of offence was

only a danda; that apart accused Tilisra was unarmed; the injuries had

also not been caused on any vital part of the body; apart from injury

no.1 which was in the abdominal cavity all other injuries were mere

bruises; the conviction should be altered to one under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_37">Section 304</a> Part-

II of the IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
36    Relevant would it be to extract the provisions of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_38">Section 304</a> of

the IPC which read as under:
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      "304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.-

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">       Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be
      punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of either description
      for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if

      death. or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
      ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge
      that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to
      cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">37    When a person is killed, it is not always a case of murder. The

intention to commit the act is relevant to decide under which penal

provision the case of the accused would fall. If the case of the accused

falls in any of the exceptions contained in <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_39">Section 300</a> of the IPC his

offence would be punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_40">Section 304</a> IPC. The line of

distinction between offences falling in Part-I and those falling in            part -

II of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_41">Section 304</a> of the IPC may be thin but nevertheless distinct. The

first part connotes an intention and second part attributes a knowledge to

the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
38    It is on this touchstone that the act of the accused persons has to

be analyzed.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                               Page 24 of 27</span>
 39        Accused Munni Lal was armed with a danda; it was two feet

long.     The accused Tilisra (wife of the accused Munni Lal) was

unarmed; she had attacked the victim with her legs and fists.


40      In this background, keeping in view the nature of the weapon of

offence; the fact that the second accused was unarmed; as also the fact

that the injuries were not on any vital part of the body it cannot be said

the accused persons had any pre-design to commit the murder of the

victim.     The degree of seriousness of the injuries has also been noted.

The version of the victim that stab injuries were also inflicted upon her

is neither borne out from the medical record nor any such weapon has

been recovered.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
41      Accused persons can thus be attributed with a knowldge that by

their act they could cause such bodily injuries upon the victim as is

likely to cause her death.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
42      In a similar situation in the case of Satish Narayan (supra) where

there was only one injury caused by stabbing on the back of the

deceased and had proved to be fatal and initially the accused was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">CRL.A. Nos.791/2010, 1014/2010 &amp; 1239/2010                      Page 25 of 27</span>
 unarmed and later on he had taken a kitchen knife the offence under

<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_42">Section 302</a> was converted to an offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_43">Section 304</a> Part-II of the

IPC.    In Dhan Singh (supra) the Apex Court had noted that no

straightjacket formula can be adopted in such like cases; it depends upon

facts and circumstances of each case. In this case also accused persons

had entered the house of the victims and opened attack upon the victim;

the offence was altered from 302 to 304 Part-II of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44">IPC</a>. In Shanker

Narayan (supra) a gun was used; it was fired upon the deceased

pursuant to which he sustained injuries; offence under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_45">Section 302</a> was

converted to an offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_46">Section 304</a> Part-II of the IPC.


43     Both the accused persons (Munni Lal and Tilisra) are accordingly

convicted under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_47">Section 304</a> Part II of the IPC. Accused Munni Lal has

suffered incarceration for about eight years. Accused Tilisra had been

granted bail vide order dated 17.10.2011. At that time she had already

undergone a sentence of about more than four years and six months.

She had a young daughter aged four at that time; she would be less than

six years as on date. The offence has been committed more than seven

years ago. The fact that Tilisra was unarmed also cannot be lost sight of.

 In this background, this Court is of the view that ends of justice would

be met if the accused persons are sentenced to undergo imprisonment

for the period already undergone by each of them.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
44    The appeal is modified in the aforenoted terms and disposed of

accordingly. Accused Munni Lal be released forthwith if not required in

any other case.    Bail bond and surety bond of accused Tilisra be

cancelled.
