                          advertisement/promotion campaign launched by the Defendant, who


                          operates its full-service airline under the trademark                         , for
                          promoting its services under the mark &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; on various online
                          platforms and social media websites. Grievance of the Plaintiff, pithily
                          placed, is that the Defendant has in a brazen and blatant manner copied the
                          registered trademark of the Plaintiff &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; and is using the same for
                          allied and cognate services. Defendant also uses the trademark &#x27;FLY
                          HIGHER&#x27; as a hashtag on its website and since the services of the parties to
                          the lis pertain to the same sector, i.e., aviation, confusion amongst the public
                          and members of the trade is inevitable.

                                behalf in any manner, are restrained from using the mark/name

                                similar to the plaintiff company&#x27;s mark &quot;FLY HIGH&quot; in

                                        of its trademarks. Plaintiff and Defendant operate in
                                        completely different fields i.e. educational training and Airline
                                        industry, respectively. Defendant operates a full-service


                                        Airline under its trademarks                     and the phrase
                                        &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; is descriptive of the services provided and is
                                        used as a part of advertising and promotional campaign.
                                    B. Defendant does not use the phrase &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; as a
                                        trademark, contrary to the claim of the Plaintiff. &#x27;FLY
                                        HIGHER&#x27; is used by the Defendant in conjunction with its


                                        well-known trademark                       as a descriptor and

                                        said phrase. The manner of use of the phrase in the
                                        advertisements etc. would clearly show that it is not acting as a
                                        source-identifier and is not capable of distinguishing
                                        Defendant&#x27;s services from those of the competitors, which is
                                        the function of a &#x27;trademark&#x27; as defined under <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_1">Section 2(1)(zb)</a>

                                        &#x27;Act&#x27;). Pertinently, Plaintiff has failed to cite any provision of
                                        law or a judicial precedent where use of a mark as a non-

                                        trademark as Defendant has several other campaigns and
                                        hashtags, which it does not use in the trademark sense, such as
                                        &#x27;Feel the flavours&#x27;, &#x27;Feel exclusive&#x27;, #VistaraLove etc.
                                    C. Plaintiff cannot allege that Defendant has infringed its
                                        proprietary rights in the trademark FLY HIGH since it does not
                                        use the said mark in classes 16 and 41 in which the Plaintiff
                                        claims to hold registrations. The core services of the Defendant
                                        are in classes 12 and 39 which relate to Airline Industry (goods
                                        and services). At the very highest, assuming without admitting
                                        that Plaintiff has any rights and assuming that Defendant&#x27;s use
                                        is use as a trademark, to maintain a claim for infringement
                                        against the Defendant, Plaintiff would require to have
                                        registrations in class 12 (relating to vehicles), class 39
                                        (transport services) and class 35 (advertising). Plaintiff never
                                        filed applications in classes 12 and 39 and abandoned its
                                        application in class 35, in face of the examination report, citing
                                        similar third-party trademarks. Plaintiff&#x27;s activities are
                                        restricted to educational services through its training academy
                                        and Defendant&#x27;s use of the phrase FLY HIGHER as part of an
                                        advertising campaign, to describe and promote the services
                                        offered and highlight its advantages, high quality etc., cannot
                                        infringe Plaintiff&#x27;s rights.

                                        source identifiers prevents the confusion and defeats any claim
                                        of passing off or misrepresentation. As on date, over 30
                                        trademarks, incorporating the marks FLY HIGH or variants
                                        thereof are on the Register of Trade Marks, either registered or
                                        pending registrations, across various classes of goods and
                                        services, including in classes 35 and 41. Defendant has not and
                                        does not use the phrase as a trademark and since the nature of
                                        services offered by the respective parties are dissimilar, there is
                                        no likelihood of confusion or association and claim for
                                        infringement cannot be sustained under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_5">Section 29</a> of the Act.
                                    E. Without prejudice to the aforementioned contentions, it was
                                        urged that Plaintiff has suppressed its prosecution history for
                                        the mark &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; and obtained ex parte injunction order
                                        by misrepresentation. &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27;, registered in class 41 was
                                        allowed to proceed to registration, with a condition that it shall
                                        give no right to exclusive use of the word &#x27;HIGH&#x27;. Reliance

                                        non-disclosure of a material fact in the plaint disentitles a party
                                        to an equitable relief of injunction.
</p><p id="p_33">                                    F. Additionally, Plaintiff has approached the Court belatedly
                                        despite having knowledge of Defendant&#x27;s promotion campaign
                                        in 2018 and the relief sought is barred by delay, laches and
                                        acquiescence. Launched on 14.12.2018, the campaign was
                                        widely advertised in print media, cinemas, television
                                        advertisements, on popular shows, billboards and hoardings on
                                        digital screens and other impact properties across Delhi,
                                        Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.
                                        Approximately 2480 social media posts including on Twitter,
                                        Facebook, YouTube and Instagram were posted even as late as
                                        in January 2022. Plaintiff has direct knowledge of the
                                        advertising campaign since it follows the Defendant on social
                                        media platforms such as Instagram and Directors of the

                                        Programme Club Vistara since 2019. Importantly, neither of
                                        these facts have been denied by the Plaintiff in its pleadings or
                                        arguments. This Court in <a href="/doc/343238/" id="a_9">Procter &amp; Gamble Company v.

                                        years ago and on this ground alone, the injunction ought to be

                                        Defendant does not offer services in the education or training
                                        sector under the phrase &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; and its campaign was

                                        own profile as India&#x27;s best Airline. Defendant never offered

                                        The channels of trade and class of customers are separate and
                                        distinct. Moreover, to substantiate a claim for passing off,
                                        Plaintiff must demonstrate acts of misrepresentation by the
                                        Defendant and the necessity of misrepresenting arises only
                                        where the Defendant needs to encash on the formidable and
                                        immense reputation garnered by the Plaintiff. In the present
                                        case, Defendant is a joint venture between Tata Sons Pvt. Ltd.
                                        and Singapore Airlines Limited holding majority stake of 51

                                        customers flying to 36 destinations, both domestic and
                                        international, with over 200 flights a day with a growing fleet
                                        of 30 Airbus, 6 Boeings and other aircrafts, under its registered

                                        in travel sector and recipient of several awards from 2016 for
                                        best airlines. Substantial amount is spent on promotion and
                                        advertisements each year because of which the trademark
                                        VISTARA is synonymous with and exclusively associated
                                        with the Defendant and with the stellar reputation that it has

                                        loss or likelihood of loss of reputation is missing.
                                    I. Reliance by the Plaintiff on the earlier interim injunction
                                        orders in other cases cannot aid the Plaintiff, as therein the use
                                        of the mark by the Defendants was in relation to education
                                        Institutions falling in class 41, in which Plaintiff currently

                                        relating to the airline GO AIR. However, therein parties settled
                                        the matter and a consent decree was passed by the Court,
                                        which cannot be used against the Defendant herein.
                                    J. Balance of convenience lies in favour of the Defendant.
                                        Without disclosing true and correct facts to the Court, an ex
                                        parte order of injunction was obtained by the Plaintiff, which
                                        is severely impacting the reputation of the Defendant as well as
                                        its business and customer outreach. Defendant has spent
                                        significant monies on its marketing and promotion campaign
                                        with 2480 social media posts apart from use of &#x27;FLY

                                        Plaintiff amongst the public and trade and any attempt by a
                                        third party to use an identical and/or deceptively similar
                                        trademark ought to be injuncted. The name, fame and repute of
                                        Plaintiff&#x27;s   trademark   are    not     limited   to   geographical
                                        boundaries. Plaintiff&#x27;s total revenue for the year 2019-2020
                                        alone, was Rs.19,451.09 lakhs. Huge expenditure has been

                                        the trademark &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; and various celebrities have

                                        injunctions in favour of the Plaintiff. In fact in CS(COMM)
                                        305/2021, this Court has observed that the trademark FLY
                                        HIGH cannot be termed as generic or descriptive in nature and
                                        at the highest it may be possible to contend that the expression
                                        &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; is suggestive of the services provided by the
                                        Plaintiff therein and in this view, the Defendant cannot raise an
                                        argument that the mark is descriptive or generic or common to
                                        trade.</blockquote>

                                        &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; and is using the same in respect of allied and

                                        well as common law rights. Defendant is well aware of
                                        Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark as it has been in contact with Plaintiff for
                                        recruiting its students since 2014. Defendant is also using the
                                        trademark &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; as a hashtag on its website as also
                                        on its page and various social media platforms. Since both
                                        provide services in the same sector, i.e. aviation, confusion
                                        amongst the public is inevitable.

                                        Plaintiff has a valuable right under <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_10">Section 28(1)</a> to use the
                                        same exclusively and seek relief of infringement against

                                        public. The intent is to mislead innocent and unwary persons

                                        is not correct in its submission that services provided by the
                                        Plaintiff and Defendant are dissimilar. Defendant operates and
                                        provides services in the aviation sector which are, to state the
                                        least, allied and cognate to the services offered by Plaintiff,
                                        i.e., training in field of aviation, hospitality, travel management
                                        and customer service and this is fortified by the admission of
                                        the Defendant in para 37 of the written statement.
                                    F. Reliance by the Defendant on the trademarks of the Plaintiff
                                        which have been abandoned, is completely misconceived and
                                        has no bearing on the present suit, which has been preferred
                                        relying upon registration for the trademark &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; in
                                        classes 16 and 41, which are valid and subsisting. It is denied
                                        that the suit has been filed belatedly. As soon as Plaintiff learnt
                                        of the advertising campaign, it approached this Court seeking
                                        injunction. Admittedly, the advertisement campaign was for a
                                        period of 75 days and the documents filed by the Defendant
                                        show that there are no hoardings/newspaper advertisements
                                        post June/August, 2019 and the social media posts which the
                                        Plaintiff has filed with the plaint merely show that the same
                                        were remnants of the campaign, which allegedly began in the
                                        year 2018 and of which the Plaintiff became aware only in
                                        January, 2022. Plaintiff has always vigilantly protected its
                                        trademark &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; and besides the suits referred to in the
                                        present pleadings, it has filed 21 oppositions against various
                                        parties, who have filed applications for registration of
                                        identical/deceptively similar marks.

                          cognate services, is a gross violation of Plaintiff&#x27;s statutory as well as
                          common law rights. Prime defence of the Defendant per contra is that
                          Defendant&#x27;s use of the phrase/expression &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; is not as a
                          trademark, which is a fundamental requirement for any action of trademark
                          infringement or passing off. Defendant is using &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; solely as a
                          descriptive phrase/expression for its advertising and promotion campaign in
                          respect of its airlines operating under a well-known trademark


                          &#x27;                  &#x27;. The phrase is always used in conjunction with its


                          trademark                      and no services are offered under the
                          phrase/expression &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27;. The expression &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; does
                          not act as a source identifier of Defendant&#x27;s services and it is fallacious to
                          argue that it is a trademark of Defendant. Much was also argued to bring
                          home the point that Plaintiff cannot claim exclusive right in the trademark
                          &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; as the same is prima facie invalid being a term of common
                          parlance, descriptive in character and common to trade. It cannot be claimed
                          by Plaintiff that the trademark is capable of being exclusively associated
                          with the Plaintiff as the trademark &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; has a dictionary meaning,
                          which connotes ambition/pursuit of higher success/a level up and is merely
                          laudatory in nature.
</p><p id="p_45">                          14.   Indubitably, Plaintiff is a registered proprietor of the trademark &#x27;FLY
                          HIGH&#x27; and thus by virtue of provisions of <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_19">Section 28(1)</a> of the Act, it has a
                          statutory right to use the mark exclusively as also seek protection against
                          infringement by third parties. The first question that arises for consideration

                          is whether the registration of the trademark FLY HIGH by the Plaintiff can
                          prevent the Defendant from using FLY HIGHER in light of the defence set
                          up by the Defendant that it is not using the allegedly similar mark as a
                          trademark and assuming for the sake of arguments that the use is as a
                          trademark, the respective services are not identical/similar and there is no
                          likelihood of confusion, besides the fact that usage is in respect of services
                          falling under those classes in which Plaintiff has no registration. Thus the
                          claim of infringement cannot be sustained under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_20">Section 29</a> of the Act.

                          using FLY HIGHER as a trademark, I may illustratively refer to one of the
                          many screenshots of the campaign filed on record by the Defendant to
                          demonstrate the use of &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; in conjunction with its trademark

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                                  &quot;54. It is important to be borne in mind that use of a
                                  descriptive expression as a trade mark by a trader,
                                  irrespective of the said trade mark having acquired a
                                  secondary meaning and distinctiveness in relation to the
                                  trader&#x27;s products, does not entitle such trader from precluding
                                  other traders from using the said expression for the purposes
                                  of describing the characteristic features of their products. I
                                  have no hesitation in stating, albeit without prejudice to the
                                  rights and interests of the plaintiff in the present suit, that by
                                  adopting such a purely descriptive and laudatory expression
                                  &#x27;Sugar Free&#x27; as its trade mark, the plaintiff must be prepared
                                  to tolerate some degree of confusion which is inevitable owing
                                  to the wide spread use of such trade mark by fellow
                                  competitors. Simply because the plaintiff claims to be using
                                  the expression &#x27;Sugar Free&#x27; as a trade mark much prior to
                                  the launch of the defendant&#x27;s product Pro Biotic Frozen
                                  Dessert in the market does not give this Court a good ground
                                  for imposing a blanket injunction on the defendant from
                                  using the expression &#x27;Sugar Free&#x27;, especially when the
                                  defendant intends to use this expression only in its
                                  descriptive sense and not as a trade mark, and even
                                  otherwise, when the use of this expression is widespread in
                                  relation to foods and beverages.&quot;            (emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_51">                          20.   In the aforementioned case, Court had prima facie held that the mark
                          of the Plaintiff was descriptive and by adopting a purely descriptive and
                          laudatory expression, Plaintiff must be prepared to tolerate some degree of
                          confusion which is inevitable owing to widespread use of such trademark by
                          fellow competitors. However, what is of relevance to the present case is the
                          observation that even if the mark of the Plaintiff acquires a secondary
                          meaning and is distinctive in relation to its products, it does not entitle such
                          a person to preclude others from using the expression for purpose of
                          describing the characteristic features of their products and more importantly
                          where the Defendant uses the expression only in a descriptive sense and not

                          would make it an inherently distinctive mark and therefore, its use in

                          footwear, clothing etc. violates the statutory and common law rights of the

                          the Act. What emerges from the observations in the aforesaid judgments is
                          that if the Defendant is able to demonstrate that its use of the allegedly
                          infringing trademark is not as a trademark but merely descriptive of its
                          goods, it can escape the rigours of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_27">Section 29</a> of the Act. In fact, this defence

                          purpose etc. or characteristics of goods or services.
</p><p id="p_52">                          21.     Defendant has taken a categorical stand that its registered trademark is


                                             and its formatives. It is undisputed that the trademark


                                             has been declared as a well-known trademark by a judgment
                          of this Court in CS(COMM) 156/2019, decided on 05.08.2019. In my prima
                          facie view, the Defendant is right in stating that the phrase FLY HIGHER is


                          only used in conjunction with its well-known mark                      and with
                          a sole purpose of advertising and promoting its scheduled Airline operating


                          under                    and is not used as a trademark. FLY HIGHER does
                          not serve as a source identifier so as to distinguish Defendant&#x27;s goods and
                          services from its competitors, and cannot be termed as a &#x27;Trade Mark&#x27;, as
                          defined under the Act. In order to demonstrate the inspiration behind the
                          FLY HIGHER campaign, its aim and objective, Defendant has placed on
                          record screenshots of social media posts as well as the advertisements on the

                          document as under, which would reflect the purpose behind the campaign as
                          well as the contents of the advertisements put in the public domain:
</p>



<p id="p_53">                          22.   A perusal of the various documents in this regard, prima facie
                          evidences that the FLY HIGHER campaign was launched in the year 2018
                          as an extension of Defendant&#x27;s tagline &#x27;FLY THE NEW FEELING&#x27;. The
                          campaign was aimed at inspiring people to invest in flying with Vistara
                          airline, promising high levels of class, quality, lifestyle etc. and not to settle
                          for the second best. Defendant has, in the written statement, explained that
                          the phrase FLY HIGHER seeks to build on inspiration from the trademark


                                             which means &#x27;limitless expanse&#x27; and is interpreted to mean
                          that sky is the limit in terms of its dream to remain India&#x27;s favourite and
                          most trusted Airline and Defendant never intended to use the same in a
                          trademark sense. Defendant has also pointed out that in its other campaigns
                          and hashtags, it uses various other descriptive and laudatory phrases such as

                          &#x27;feel the flavours&#x27;, &#x27;feel exclusive&#x27;, &#x27;arrive fresh&#x27;, etc. and hashtags such as
                          #VistaraLove and #AirlineIndiaTrusts.
</p><p id="p_54">                          23.   Defendant has placed on record documents to show that the phrase
                          FLY HIGH and its variants, such as FLY HIGHER/HIGH FLY etc. are
                          commonly used in articles to describe success of players in the Airlines
                          industry. Furthermore, it is brought out that various Airlines, such as Air
                          India, Emirates, Spice Jet, Lufthansa etc. have been using and continue to
                          use the phrase FLY HIGH or a variation thereof as part of their social media
                          posts, advertising campaigns or even as a part of their Frequent Flyer
                          Programmes and on account of this usage, common to trade, Defendant has
                          never sought registration of the phrase FLY HIGHER.
</p><p id="p_55">                          24.   On a perusal of the documents, this Court finds prima facie merit in
                          the submission of the Defendant that the term FLY HIGH is demonstrably
                          common to Aviation sector and this is fortified by the Master Data of over
                          20 registered companies, incorporating the phrase FLY HIGH/HIGH
                          FLYER/HIGH FLYERS, which continue to be active and have not been
                          struck off from the Register of Companies. Defendant has also placed on
                          record copies of extracts of online records of the Trade Marks Registry
                          showing registrations/pending applications for the mark FLY HIGH/HIGH
                          FLYER. Another significant factor that needs to be noted is that the mark of
                          the Plaintiff proceeded to registration under application no. 1535614 in class
                          41 with a condition that the Plaintiff shall have no exclusive right to use the
                          word &#x27;HIGH&#x27; which, as brought out by the Defendant, is a fact concealed by
                          the Plaintiff in the plaint. From the plethora of documents placed on record,
                          in my prima facie view, this Court cannot agree with the Plaintiff that the
                          Defendant uses the phrase FLY HIGHER as a trademark and thus the edifice

                          built on foundation of the argument that by using a deceptively similar
                          trademark, Defendant is guilty of infringement, falls to the ground.
</p><p id="p_56">                          25.   Defendant is also right in its submission that even assuming for the
                          sake of argument that it uses FLY HIGHER as a trademark, no right of the
                          Plaintiff in its mark FLY HIGH is infringed since Defendant does not use
                          the mark in classes 16 and 41 in which Plaintiff claims to hold registrations
                          and Defendant&#x27;s core services are in classes 12 and 39 relating to Airline
                          industry. Plaintiff has not filed applications in classes 12 and 39 and its
                          registration for the mark FLY HIGH in different classes cannot be the basis
                          to restrain the Defendant in classes for which the Plaintiff has no
                          registration, unless it is able to make out a case that the services are similar
                          or allied and cognate.
</p><p id="p_57">                          26.   Insofar as the services offered by the respective parties are concerned,
                          this Court finds prima facie merit in the argument of the Defendant that
                          Plaintiff and Defendant operate in an entirely different field and industry.
                          Defendant is operating a full-service Airline under its well-known


                                             trademark, while the Plaintiff is engaged in running a
                          training Institute under the FRANKFINN mark. The channels of trade and
                          class of customers are separate inasmuch as Plaintiff&#x27;s target audience
                          comprise young impressionable students seeking soft skills training for
                          future career. Plaintiff does not guarantee any student a career in an Airline
                          and only trains them. No doubt, there is an element of training that the
                          Defendant imparts, however, the same is only limited to a technical training
                          imparted to the cabin crew personnel which is approved and regulated by
                          DGCA and BCAS, coupled with technical examinations to obtain a pass

                          issued by BCAS. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot succeed even in arguing that
                          the services offered by the Defendant are allied and cognate on all the
                          parameters laid down by this Court in <a href="/doc/53358049/" id="a_29">FDC Limited v. Docsuggest

                          user, nature of services, trade channels etc.
</p><p id="p_58">                          27.   The underlying ethos of an infringement action, in my view, under
                          <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_30">Section 29</a> of the Act is: (a) proprietary rights of a registered owner; and (b)
                          public interest. Therefore, a very important ingredient of an action of
                          infringement is likelihood of confusion and/or association amongst the
                          intending purchasers. Hence, the pivotal question that next arises is whether
                          there is a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the services offered by
                          the Defendant or any association between the services of the respective
                          parties. In order to test the likelihood of confusion one would need to
                          holistically examine not only the degree of visual, aural or conceptual
                          similarity between the marks but also the impression of an average
                          consumer with imperfect recollection with respect to the degree of similarity
                          between the goods or services purveyed under the rival marks [SABEL BV
                          v. Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport, [1998] R.P.C. 199 &amp; Kerly&#x27;s Law of
                          Trade Marks &amp; Trade Names, 4th edition at page 247-248]. Looking at the

                          case, at this stage, it is difficult to reach a prima facie conclusion that the
                          services offered by the respective parties are not separate and distinct.
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s target audience are people seeking soft skills training in the travel,
                          tourism, hotel management and Aviation sector with the hope of possible
                          employment opportunities while Defendant&#x27;s customers comprise travellers

                          informed decision to travel by Vistara Airlines would be taken by a person
                          intending to travel, keeping in mind the alleged popularity of the FLY HIGH
                          mark of the Plaintiff or the services pertaining to training in varied fields of
                          travel, hospitality and hotel industry, including Aviation Sector. Plaintiff has
                          not placed on record any material to establish that it has the necessary
                          goodwill or reputation in the services offered by the Defendant. To this
                          Court, prima facie, the argument of the Plaintiff seems too far-fetched for
                          this Court to hold that any prudent person desirous of purchasing an Airline
                          ticket, would be influenced by the stellar reputation of a training Institute,
                          even if it was solely training people for recruitment in Aviation sector,
                          instead of exercising an option from amongst the competing airlines, based
                          on the competitive fares and services offered. Defendant&#x27;s customers, as
                          rightly pointed out, comprise well-informed discerning people, who would
                          not choose to travel in Vistara airlines, based on Plaintiff&#x27;s repute in the
                          training Institute. Prima facie the element of likelihood of confusion or
                          members of the public or trade associating the services offered by the
                          Defendant as emanating from the Plaintiff, is lacking in the present case.
                          Thus, even assuming that Defendant is using FLY HIGHER as a trademark
                          or even as a mark, ingredients of <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_31">Section 29(1)</a> and (2) are not satisfied.

                          print media, cinemas, television as well as billboards and hoardings on

                          YouTube etc. to demonstrate that it launched its national advertising
                          campaign FLY HIGHER on 14.12.2018, which was widely advertised.

                          Plaintiff has denied that there is any delay and claims to have acquired
                          knowledge only in January, 2022 through the advertisement campaign on
                          various online platforms. In wake of documents placed on record by both
                          sides and considering that there are remnants of the campaign even today on
                          various platforms, this is really a mixed question of facts and law and cannot
                          be decided without evidence. Suffice would it be to state that at this stage
                          Plaintiff cannot be ousted on ground of delay and acquiescence.

                          common to trade and has placed on record several documents in support
                          thereof, in an endeavour to demonstrate that the trademark &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; is
                          widely used by third party websites, in context of its dictionary meaning,
                          particularly with respect to aviation sector. The documents filed by the
                          Defendant can be categorised into three distinct categories. First is the
                          category of documents which show use of the trademark &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; with
                          respect to aviation academies by third parties offering identical services as

                          Plaintiff must show that it has garnered goodwill and reputation, which is
                          sought to be encashed by the Defendant by misrepresentation that its goods
                          emanate from or have some connection with the Plaintiff and the
                          confusion/misrepresentation results in injury to the reputation of the
                          Plaintiff. In the present case, Defendant has brought out the stellar reputation
                          and goodwill that it enjoys and the expanse of operations of its full-service


                          Airline under the well-known trademark                     . The growing fleet
                          of its aircrafts, number of flights undertaken, both domestic and
                          international, number of internet users visiting its website, the awards
                          received as Best Airline consistently from 2016 and substantial amounts
                          invested on promotion campaigns, revenue generated etc., are evidence of
                          the reputation garnered by the Defendant. In fact, in the context of
                          promotion campaigns, Defendant has stated in the written statement that
                          from the year 2014-15, it has been spending nearly Rs. 15-20 crores on


                          promotions of its services under the trademark                          and the

                          popular prime time television shows. It is also averred in the written
                          statement that the campaign launched in 2018 was a roaring success and
                          from the &#x27;VISTARA UPGRADE&#x27;, Defendant has earned a revenue of
                          Rs. 14,67,19,952/- since August, 2020 till mid-January, 2022. There is only
                          a general and evasive denial to these averments by the Plaintiff, in the
                          Replication.
</p><p id="p_76">                          34.   It cannot be underscored that in a claim of passing off, Plaintiff must
                          show the reputation/goodwill it has acquired, however, it is equally
                          important to discharge the onus, even though prima facie at this stage, that
                          Defendant is misrepresenting amongst the public by encashing on Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          reputation. Looking at the reputation of the Defendant, as aforementioned,
                          Defendant does not need to encash on Plaintiff&#x27;s reputation to operate its
                          airlines, as rightly contended by learned Senior Counsel for the Defendant.
                          The manner in which the phrase FLY HIGHER is being used by the
                          Defendant does not appear to be with an intent to deceive, misrepresent or
                          confuse members of the public. Prominent use of the well-known


                                             trademark in conjunction with the phrase FLY HIGHER
                          further defies any intent of the Defendant to misrepresent, contrary to the
                          stand of the Plaintiff. Hence, Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie
                          case of passing off against the Defendant.

                          suits are concerned, the subject matter relates to educational institutions
                          which fall within the purview of class 41, in which the Plaintiff holds
                          registration. Additionally, in CS(COMM) 88/2016, the suit is against an
                          ex-employee of the Plaintiff where a claim for misappropriation of
                          confidential information has also been made. Insofar as CS(COMM)
                          287/2019 is concerned, the same was filed against Go Air, however,
                          Defendant has stated in the written statement that a consent decree was
                          passed in the said suit and as rightly contended, the same cannot bind the
                          Defendant in the present suit. Insofar as reliance on the observation of the
                          judgment dated 16.02.2022 passed in CS(COMM) 305/2021, is concerned,
                          the same is inapplicable to the present case, in view of the finding given by
                          this Court in the earlier part of the judgment that Defendant is not using the
                          expression &#x27;FLY HIGHER&#x27; as a trademark. Additionally, in the said case the
                          Defendant was using the mark in respect of services similar to that of the
                          Plaintiff and as evident from para 22 of the judgement it is in this backdrop
                          that the Court held that any person using &#x27;FLY HIGH&#x27; in respect of identical
                          or similar services would be infringing Plaintiff&#x27;s mark. In the present case,
                          as noted above the services offered by the Defendant are not similar to those
                          of the Plaintiff.

                          came to a finding that the word &#x27;Baazi&#x27; was being used by the Defendants as
                          a trademark and not as a description of their services with an intent to gain

                          reputation, having an impeccable and immense reputation of its own.
</p><p id="p_79">                          37.   The facts of the case in the judgment relied upon by the Plaintiff in
                          the case of Sabmiller India Ltd (supra), are wholly different. The Court
                          therein came to a finding that the rival trademarks were visually alike giving
                          rise to likelihood of confusion as the words &#x27;FIVE THOUSAND&#x27; and &#x27;5001&#x27;
                          are phonetically similar. The question before the Court was primarily what
                          constitutes &#x27;use&#x27; and it was held that only because a registered trademark is
                          not used exactly in the manner in which it is registered, it cannot be said that
                          the registered proprietor has abandoned the trademark. In the context of an
                          argument raised by the Defendant that there were multiple marks seemingly
                          similar to that of the Plaintiff, the Court held that the mere presence of the
                          mark on the Register does not prove its user and having regard to the
                          enormity of Plaintiff&#x27;s reputation in the suit mark, some solitary instances of
                          such nature are of no consequence. Quite contrary, in the present case, the
                          Defendant is not using the phrase FLY HIGHER as a trademark and
                          Plaintiff has been unable to controvert the common usage of the said phrase
                          and its variations, not only by Airlines but also training institutes.
</p><p id="p_80">                          38.   Insofar as the judgment in Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. and
                          Another (supra), is concerned, this Court has not given any finding against
                          the Plaintiff and therefore it is unnecessary to delve on the principles laid
                          down therein. As far as the remaining judgments are concerned, suffice
                          would it be to state that each of them deals with comparison of the rival
                          trademarks in terms of visual, structural and phonetic similarity. It bears
                          repetition to state that in the wake of the Defendant not using FLY HIGHER
