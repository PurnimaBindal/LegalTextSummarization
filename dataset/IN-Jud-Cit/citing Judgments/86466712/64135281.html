                  brought to the knowledge of the plaintiff that the sale of counterfeit and

</p><p id="p_24">                   18.     Thereafter, this Court vide the order dated 08.04.2022, noted that
                  since there has been no appearance on behalf of the defendant and the
                  written statement to the plaint had also not been filed by the defendant,
                  the defendant is not interested in defending the suit, and accordingly be
                  proceeded ex-parte.

<p id="p_25">                  SUBMISSION OF PLAINTIFF

</p><p id="p_26">                  19.     The learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that as the defendant
                  chose not to appear before this Court and has been proceeded ex-parte,
                  and further, no written statement has been filed by the defendant, it is a
                  fit case where a Summary Judgment in terms of Rule 27 of the Delhi
                  High Court Intellectual Property Rights Division Rules, 2022 read with
                  Order XIIIA of the CPC, as applicable to commercial disputes,              be

<p id="p_27">                  ANALYSIS AND FINDING

</p><p id="p_28">                  20.     I have considered the submission made by the learned counsel for
                  the plaintiff as also the reports of the investigator and the Local
                  Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                  21.     The plaintiff, along with the suit has filed Legal Proceedings
                  Certificates with respect to the registration obtained by it for the
                  &quot;Western Digital trade marks&quot; described hereinabove. The plaintiff is,
                  therefore, the rightful registered proprietor of the marks in question.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                  22.     Along with the plaint, the plaintiff has also filed the technical
                  report pertaining to the hard-disk drives at Sl. numbers WCAV97740465

                   and WCAV9DX61577, which were purchased by the investigator hired
                  by the plaintiff to visit the premises of the defendant. The report
                  concluded that the hard-disk drives under Sl. number WCAV97740465
                  had been tampered with, as firstly the Printed Circuit Board (in short,
                  „PCB‟) had been changed and the serial number detected by the system
                  of the plaintiff was different from the one on the label of the drive. As far
                  as the drive bearing Sl. number WCAV9DX61577, the investigator
                  concluded that the same had been tampered with as its PCB and label
                  were changed; it had been used for 29,866 hours and, therefore, was an
                  old and used hard-disk drive.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                  23.     It has been submitted by the plaintiff that both the drives were not
                  in the original packaging of the plaintiff and were not sealed in the
                  original ESD bags of the plaintiff. It has been asserted that the packaging
                  is crucial to preserve and protect the sensitivity and performance of
                  electronic products such as hard-disk drives.
</p>
<p id="p_32">                  24.     Pursuant to the order dated 10.12.2019 of this Court, the Local
                  Commissioner has also visited the premises of the defendant on
                  04.01.2020 and found various pieces of the infringing products as also
                  packaging stickers, which were sealed in twenty-four cartons and
                  thereafter released to the representative of the defendant on superdari.
                  Though a claim was made during the proceedings of the Local
                  Commissioner that these hard-disk drives had been purchased on the
                  basis of some invoices, as the defendant has chosen not to appear before
                  this Court, the co-relation of these invoices with the hard-disk drives
                  found during the execution of the local commission remains unproved.

                   Even otherwise, the very fact that packaging stickers were found at the
                  premises of the defendant clearly shows that the defendant is
                  counterfeiting the hard-disk drives and passing them of as those of the
                  plaintiff‟s.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                  25.     In addition, as the report of the investigator itself reveals, the
                  defendants are guilty of passing of old hard-disk drives and used hard-
                  disk drives of the plaintiff as new products of the defendant, by
                  tampering with the PCB and the labels of these hard-disk drives. This in
                  my view, is clearly an infringement of the trade mark of the plaintiff as
                  also passing off goods of the plaintiff as new and un-used, thereby
                  leading to deception, loss and injury to an unwary consumer as also
                  dilution of the trade marks of the plaintiff and unfair trade practices
                  adopted by the defendant. The defendant is also not entitled to seek
                  protection under <a href="/doc/1928889/" id="a_2">Section 30(3)</a> of the Act as it has tampered with the
                  goods of the plaintiff and its labelling.

                                             (2005) DLT 504 this Court has taken the
                                             view that damages in such a case should be
                                             awarded against defendants who chose to
                                             stay away from proceedings of the Court
                                             and they should not be permitted to enjoy
                                             the benefits of evasion of Court
                                             proceedings. The rationale for the same is
                                             that while defendants who appear in Court
                                             may be burdened with damages while
                                             defendants who chose to stay away from the
                                             Court would escape such damages. The
                                             actions of the defendants result in affecting
                                             the reputation of the plaintiff and every
                                             endeavour should be made for a larger
                                             public purpose to discourage such parties
                                             from indulging in acts of deception.</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                             &quot;23. One of the reasons for granting relief of
                                             punitive damages is that despite of service of
                                             summons/notice, the defendant had chosen not to
                                             appear before the court. It shows that the
                                             defendant is aware of the illegal activities
                                             otherwise, he ought to have attended the
                                             proceedings and give justification for the said
                                             illegal acts. Since, the defendant has maintained
                                             silence, therefore, the guilt of the defendant
                                             speaks for itself and the court, under these
                                             circumstances, feels that in order to avoid future
                                             infringement, relief of punitive damages is to be
                                             granted in favour of the plaintiff.&quot;
