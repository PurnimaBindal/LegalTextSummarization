</pre><p id="p_1">Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
</p><p id="p_2">Introduction
</p><p id="p_3">1. The central question that arises for consideration before this Bench is
whether the words "the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief
Commissioner or Principal Commissioner" in Section 260A (2) (a) of the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 ('Act') mean only the 'jurisdictional' Principal or
Chief Commissioner of Income-tax (CIT) or could it include any CIT
including the CIT (Judicial)?
</p>
<p id="p_4">2. The question assumes significance in light of the stand of the Revenue
that unless the 'jurisdictional' CIT receives a certified copy of the order of
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), the limitation of 120 days
within which an appeal has to be filed does not commence. It requires to
be clarified at the outset that the expressions 'Revenue' and 'Department'
are used interchangeably throughout the judgment. Both expressions refer
to the Income Tax Department.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Background facts in ITA 755 &amp; 756 of 2015



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                      Page 2 of 31</span>
</p><p id="p_6"> 3. In I.T.A. Nos. 755 and 756 of 2015 are appeals by the Revenue,
through the Principal CIT Delhi-IV under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">Section 260-A</a> of the Act
against a common order dated 29th October, 2014 passed by the ITAT in
a large batch of 115 appeals. Both appeals were first filed on 25th
August, 2015. Para 8 of both memoranda of appeal state that the
impugned order of the ITAT "was received in the office of the Appellant
on 28th April, 2015". Enclosed with both the appeals was only a typed
copy of the impugned order of the ITAT. The Revenue proceeded to
compute limitation on that basis and claimed, therefore, that the appeal
was filed within time on 25th August, 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4. The Court perused the photocopy of the certified copy of the impugned
order, dated 29th October 2014 of the ITAT. The date stamp on the top
right hand corner of the said order showed that it was delivered to the
office of the CIT, Ghaziabad on 19th December, 2014. The left hand
bottom corner contained an endorsement of the Tax Assistant dated
22/23rd December, 2014. The explanation offered was that at the time the
appeals were heard before the ITAT, the CIT (Ghaziabad) was the
concerned CIT as far as this Assessee was concerned. On the date of the
dispatch of the impugned order of the ITAT, the memo of parties in the
appeal before the ITAT showed the address of the CIT at Ghaziabad.
Therefore, the certified copy of the order was sent to him and received by
him on 19th December, 2014. Pursuant to certain administrative orders
issued by the Income Tax Department ('Department') the jurisdiction
relating to the Assessee was transferred to the CIT, Delhi-IV. The ITAT
was, therefore, asked to send the certified copy of its order to the
'concerned' CIT, Delhi-IV. It was only after receiving the certified copy




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                  Page 3 of 31</span>
 on 28th April 2015 that the said CIT Delhi-IV took a decision regarding
filing of the appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Background facts in ITA 52 of 2015
</p><p id="p_9">5. This appeal by the Revenue through the CIT-7 is against an order dated
16th May 2014 of the ITAT. At the hearing of the appeal on 1st
September 2015, counsel for the Assessee raised a preliminary objection
as regards limitation. It was pointed out by him that the photocopy of the
certified copy of the impugned order of the ITAT bore a date stamp
which showed that a copy had been received in the office of the CIT
(Judicial) on 23rd July 2014. There were two other date stamps on the
first page. One dated 25th July 2014 was in Hindi and was of the CIT,
Central, New Delhi. The other was the stamp of the Office of CIT, Delhi-
V with the date of 19th September, 2014. In para 6 of the memorandum
of appeal, it was stated that the impugned order of the ITAT was served
on the CIT-7 on 29th September, 2014 although there was no such date
stamp anywhere on the first page of the photocopy of the impugned
order. The counsel for the Assessee therefore contended that if a copy of
the impugned order was available with the CIT (Judicial) on 23rd July
2014 or with the CIT (Central) on 25th July, 2014, then the present
appeal which has been filed on 14th January, 2015 was beyond 120 days
from the date of the receipt of the certified copy. There was no
application for condonation of delay as of that date.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6. Following this, the Revenue out of 'abundant caution' filed C. M. No.
23522 of 2015 seeking condonation of 85 days' delay in filing the appeal.
Notice in the said application was issued on 14th October 2015. At that
hearing, the Court's attention was drawn to its decision in CIT v. Sudhir




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                  Page 4 of 31</span>
 Choudhrie (2005)278 ITR 490 which mandated that the ITAT shall
'pronounce its orders' in open court by listing the cases for
pronouncement. The Court was informed by the counsel for the Revenue
that the said judgment was being scrupulously followed and ever since
the ITAT has been pronouncing its orders after listing the matters for
pronouncement in the cause list. The Court was further informed that as a
follow up of the above judgment, there were certain changes made in the
administrative side. One was that for the purposes of <a href="/doc/1350584/" id="a_3">Section 254</a> (3) of
the Act, the requirement of the ITAT having to send a copy of the order
passed by it to the 'Principal Commissioner' or 'Commissioner' was
satisfied by ensuring that the said order was sent to the CIT (Judicial).
This was to facilitate the communication of the orders of the ITAT to the
Department without unnecessary delay.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7. The Court then requested the Assistant Registrar (AR) of the ITAT to
send to it forthwith both by special messenger as well as by email copies
of the circulars/notifications/communications relevant to the issue of
communication of the orders of the ITAT to the Department.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8. At the hearing on 19th October 2015, the Court was shown a copy of
the Office Manual of the ITAT containing the detailed procedure in
relation to matters before the ITAT, including communication of its
orders. Para 76 of the ITAT Manual states that the orders of the ITAT
'shall be in writing and shall be pronounced, signed and dated by the
members constituting the Bench which heard it as required under Rule
</p><p id="p_13">34. Paras 82 (a) and (d) of the Manual which deal with 'communication of
orders' read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "(a) Copies of the Tribunal's order are issued expeditiously to the
        appellant/applicant and the respondent, the Commissioner of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                   Page 5 of 31</span>
         Income-tax and the Departmental Representative in the form as at
        APPENDIX XX after putting the seal as at APPENDIX XX (a) on
        each page of the order issues. Where the appeal before the CIT
        (Appeals) has been restored and/or remanded to him, a copy of
        such order passed in such appeal is also to be sent to the CIT
        (Appeals) concerned."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        (d) Copy of the order meant for the Assessing Officer other than
        those cases remanded to him, is issued through the Commissioner
        of Income tax concerned. Copies to the assessee and the
        Commissioner of Income tax are issued either under registered
        A.D. post or by hand delivery through Peon Book. If sent by post, it
        is sent to the address given in the Memo of Appeal. If no letter of
        authority was filed by one or more of those who appeared for the
        assessee, a copy meant for him will not be issued to him until he
        files the necessary letter of authority. The A.D. Cards received
        from the assessee or the Commissioner of Income-tax are filed or
        pasted on the back of the order kept on the relevant file and date of
        service of the order should be noted in the Order Sheet."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">9. Appendix XX to the Manual gives the proforma of the endorsement
made on the order of the ITAT when forwarding it to the various parties
including the assessee, the Departmental Representative (DR), the
Assessing Officer (AO), the CIT (Appeals) and the CIT. Therefore, it
appears that as far as the Department is concerned, the ITAT dispatches
copies of its orders to at least three officers apart from the DR, one of
whom is presumably the 'concerned' CIT.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10. The Court's attention was also drawn to Instruction No. 4, dated 7th
May 2002 and the subsequent Instruction No. 6/2015 dated 3rd July 2015
which appear to set out the 'work jurisdiction and role' of the CIT
(Judicial). It was stated that pursuant to the said instructions, one of the
copies of the ITAT's order is always sent to the CIT (Judicial) in addition




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                     Page 6 of 31</span>
 to the concerned CIT. If there was a change in the concerned CIT, then
the onus would be on the Revenue to inform the ITAT of such change.
</p>
<p id="p_16">Questions for decision by the larger Bench
</p><p id="p_17">11. In both matters, the Revenue relied on the decisions of Division
Benches (DBs) of this Court in <a href="/doc/22182/" id="a_4">CIT v. Arvind Construction Co. (P) Ltd</a>.
(1992) 193 ITR 330 and <a href="/doc/160136566/" id="a_5">Commissioner of Income Tax v. Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal</a> (2000) 245 ITR 659 (Del) to urge that limitation
would start to run only from the date of service of the order of the ITAT
on the concerned CIT having jurisdiction over the Assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_18">12. Both the aforementioned decisions of the DBs were rendered in the
context of a reference at the instance of the CIT under <a href="/doc/1908938/" id="a_6">Section 256</a> (2) of
the Act. There was no occasion to interpret <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_7">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) of the
Act. Secondly, both decisions were given at a time when there was no
practice of the ITAT 'pronouncing' orders in the open. That practice came
into vogue after an order was passed by this Court in <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_8">CIT v. Sudhir
Choudhrie</a> (supra). The question then was whether it was incumbent on
the Revenue through its DR or CIT (Judicial) to apply for a certified copy
of the order of the ITAT and should limitation for the purposes of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">Section
260A</a> (2) (a) be computed from the date on which such certified copy is
made ready for delivery by the ITAT? Further, whether the receipt of the
copy by the CIT (Judicial) is sufficient to trigger the limitation period
under Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act? Also, in the context of a common
order of the ITAT in several appeals, whether limitation for all the
appeals would begin to run when the certified copy is received first by
either the CIT (Judicial) or any one of the CITs concerned?
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                  Page 7 of 31</span>
<p id="p_19"> 13. In the above background, by the order dated 19th October 2015 in ITA
Nos. 755 and 756 of 2015, the following questions were referred to the
larger Bench for decision:
</p>
<p id="p_20">(i) What is the correct interpretation to be placed on the expression
"received by the Assessee or the Principal Chief Commissioner or the
Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner" in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">Section 260A</a> (2) (a)
of the Act? Does it mean 'received' by any of the named officers
including the CIT (Judicial)?
</p>
<p id="p_21">(ii) Does limitation begin to run for the purposes of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_11">Section 260A</a> (2) (a)
only when a certified copy of the order of the ITAT is received by the
'concerned' CIT within whose jurisdiction the case of the Assessee falls
notwithstanding that it may have been received by any other CIT,
including the CIT (Judicial) prior thereto? Is it open to the Court to read
the word 'concerned' into Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act as a prefix to
any of the officers of the Department named therein?
</p>
<p id="p_22">(iii) In the context of <a href="/doc/1350584/" id="a_12">Section 254</a> (3) of the Act, is there an obligation on
the ITAT to send a certified copy of its order to a CIT other than the one
whose details are given to it during the pendency of the appeal? Will
change in the jurisdiction concerning the case of the Respondent Assessee
to another CIT subsequent to the order of the ITAT have the effect of
postponing the time, from which limitation would begin to run in terms of
Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act, to when such CIT receives the order of
the ITAT?
</p>
<p id="p_23">(iv) After the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_13">CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (2005)
278 ITR 490, do the decisions in <a href="/doc/22182/" id="a_14">CIT v. Arvind Construction Co. (P</a>.)
Ltd. (1992) 193 ITR 330 and <a href="/doc/1090215/" id="a_15">CIT v. ITAT</a> (2000) 245 ITR 659 (Del)
require to be reconsidered, explained or reconciled?
</p>
<p id="p_24">(v) After the change of procedure where orders of the ITAT are
pronounced in the open, is it incumbent on the Department through its
DR or CIT (Judicial) to apply for a certified copy of the order of the
ITAT and should limitation for the purposes of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_16">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) be
computed from the date on which such certified copy is made ready for
delivery by the ITAT?
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                     Page 8 of 31</span>
<p id="p_25"> (vi) Whether the receipt of a certified copy of the order of the ITAT by
the CIT (Judicial) is sufficient to trigger the commencement of the
limitation period under Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act?
</p>
<p id="p_26">(vii) In the context of a common order of the ITAT covering several
appeals, whether limitation for all the appeals would begin to run when
the certified copy is received first by either the CIT (Judicial) or any one
of the officers of the Department mentioned in Section 260 A (2) (a) or
only when the CIT 'concerned' receives it? Where the same CIT has
jurisdiction over more than one Assessee in the batch, will limitation
begin to run for all such appeals when such CIT receives the order in
either of the Assessee's cases?
</p>
<p id="p_27">(viii) Whether administrative instructions issued by the Department for its
own administrative convenience can have the effect of altering the time
from which limitation will begin to run for the purposes of Section 260 A
(2) (a) of the Act?
</p>
<p id="p_28">14. On the same day, by a separate order, ITA 52 of 2015, in which some
of the above questions arose, was also referred to the larger Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_29">Legislative History
</p><p id="p_30">15. It is necessary first to examine the background to the insertion of
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_17">Section 260A</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_18">By the Finance Act</a> No. 2 of 1998 a new sub-
heading and Section were inserted in Chapter XX of the Act. The
Memorandum to the amending Bill explained what may have been the
legislative intent behind the insertion of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_19">Section 260A</a> of the Act. In it, a
reference was made to the decision of the Kerala High Court in <a href="/doc/768486/" id="a_20">CIT v.
Wandoor Jupiter Chits (P) Ltd</a>. (1995) 213 ITR 73 (Ker.), which held
that the limited scope of <a href="/doc/1908938/" id="a_21">Section 256</a> (2) of the Act which provided for
reference by the ITAT to the High Court did not allow for "rendering of
final decision on the issue even where the relevant facts are available to
such a decision". The second reason was that the provision contributes to
the delay in passing of the consequential orders by the AO after the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                    Page 9 of 31</span>
 reference is decided by either the High Court or the Supreme Court, as
the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_31">16. At this stage, there was no particular focus on the expiry of the
limitation period for filing appeal. Significantly, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_22">Section 260A</a> as soon it
was introduced only contemplated the order in appeal being
"communicated to the appellant". Prior to the amendment with effect
from 1st June 1998, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_23">Section 260A</a> read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        260 A. Appeal to High Court.-

read as under:

<p id="p_33">18. By the aforementioned amendment, two distinct changes took place.
One was that in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_25">Section 260A</a>, the words "an appeal
under this Section shall be" was substituted by the words "The Chief
Commissioner or Commissioner or an Assessee aggrieved by any order

"communicated to the Appellant" appearing in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_26">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) was
substituted by the words "received by the assessee or the Principal Chief
Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or

<p id="p_34"> 19. There are certain general observations required to be made at this
stage. The first is that the grant of time of 120 days to file an appeal
against the order passed by the ITAT is contrary to many other statutes
which provide for a shorter period of limitation. The only plausible
explanation is that the legislature acknowledged the inherent delays in the
system and, particularly, the working of the administrative machinery of
the State. The power of the High Court to condone delay beyond that
period would have to be interpreted in this context.
</p>
<p id="p_35">Strict construction
</p><p id="p_36">20. Sub-section (2A) was inserted by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_27">Finance Act</a> 2010, giving
powers to the High Court to condone the delay in filing the appeal. There
was a difference of opinion of the High Courts on whether the High Court
has the power to condone the delay in filing the appeal, although <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_28">Section
260A</a> (7) (inserted by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_29">Finance Act</a>, 1999) stated that the provisions of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 („CPC‟), which related to appeals to
the High Court shall "as far as may be" apply to the appeals under
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_30">Section 260A</a>. With a view to clarifying that the High Court did have
such power to condone the delay, sub-section (2A) was retrospectively
inserted.
</p>
<p id="p_37">21. Considering that in terms of sub-section (2A), the High Court can
condone the delay for as long there is sufficient cause for not filing the
appeal within 120 days, there, necessarily, has to be a strict construction
of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_31">Section 260A(2)</a>. A comparison could be drawn with <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_32">Section 34</a> of the
Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_33">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_34">Section 34</a> (3) of which stipulates
a three-month period for filing a petition to challenge an Award. The
proviso thereto limits the discretion of the Court to condone the delay




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                  Page 12 of 31</span>
 beyond three months up to "a further period of 30 days, but not
thereafter".
</p>
<p id="p_38">The decision in <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_35">CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a>
22.1 <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_36">In CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra), the Court noted that orders of
the ITAT were not being served upon the Department for years together.
It was stated by the counsel for the Revenue appearing in those appeals
that "the orders are duly communicated or served upon the authorities but
sometimes they decline to accept the same and the delay is not
attributable to the Registrar of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal".
</p>
<p id="p_39">22.2 The Court was essentially dealing with the issue of the
pronouncement of the final orders by the ITAT. The contention was that
it was not obligatory to pronounce the final orders after listing them in
Court, since Rule 35 Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 (ITAT
Rules) only required the orders to be communicated to the parties. It was
explained that the ITAT had not been following such a direction
"and does not wish to start the same being not a mandate of law".
</p>
<p id="p_40">22.3 Rule 35 of the ITAT Rules states: "The Tribunal shall, after the
order is signed, cause it to be communicated to the assessee and to the
Commissioner". The word „Commissioner‟ in the said rule is not
qualified by the word „concerned'. The second factor to be noticed is that
Rule 35 still uses the word „communicated to‟ and not „received by‟
which is used in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_37">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) after the amendment by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_38">Finance
Act</a>, 1999.
</p>
<p id="p_41">22.4 <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_39">In CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra), reference was made to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_40">Section
254</a> of the Act which deals with "Orders of Appellate Tribunal". The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                  Page 13 of 31</span>
 provision envisaged that once the ITAT passed an order then under
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_41">Section 254(3)</a>, it was to "send a copy of any orders passed under this
section to the assessee and to the Chief Commissioner or Principal
Commissioner or Commissioner". The Court emphasised that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_42">Section 254</a>
on a plain reading (or by necessary implication) nowhere indicated that
ITAT "could decline to pronounce the orders which are obviously to be
dated and signed on a given date to make such orders effective and
binding".
</p>
<p id="p_42">22.5 The Court in <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_43">CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra) proceeded to hold:
"Known precepts of procedural law would necessarily impose an
obligation upon any forum or Tribunal, judicially determining the rights
of the parties to declare its order on the date it is signed and declared". It
further observed: "The requirement of letting the parties to know the
contents of the order upon its declaration (when its dated and signed by
the Bench of the Tribunal) would be the minimum requirement to the
principles of natural justice. This requirement transcends all technical
rules    of    procedure".       The    rational   explanation   was   that   the
"pronouncement of an order would certainly put the parties at notice and
they would be able to take recourse to the remedies available to them
under law with some urgency, if required".
</p>
<p id="p_43">22.6 The Court in <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_44">CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra) then proceeded to
direct the ITAT to pronounce its judgment and orders "in open hearing
and upon enlisting them for a given date."
</p>

</p><p id="p_45">23. Following the above judgment in <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_45">CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra),
Rule 34 of the ITAT Rules was amended to read as under:

</blockquote><p id="p_46">24. Usually, when an order is pronounced by the ITAT, the fact of such
matter being listed for pronouncement is made known to the parties and
their counsel. Rule 34 if read as a whole makes it mandatory for ITAT to
pronounce orders at a hearing/sitting and obliges it to be made available to
the parties. The DR is expected to remain present when such orders are
pronounced. As noticed earlier, one copy of the order is sent as a practice
by the ITAT to the CIT (Judicial), apart from sending it to the CIT whose
details are made available by the Department to the ITAT at the time of
filing the appeal or to such changed office as may be made known to the
ITAT by the Department.

<p id="p_47">Earlier decisions
</p><p id="p_48">25. There has been no decision as such interpreting the words "received by
the assessee or the Principal Chief Commissioner" occurring in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_46">Section
260A</a> (2) (a) of the Act. The date of such receipt is the trigger for the
commencement of the limitation period of 120 days for filing the appeal.
Reliance has been placed by the Revenue on two decisions of this Court,
which were rendered in the context of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_47">Section 256</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_49">26.1 The first is the decision in <a href="/doc/22182/" id="a_48">CIT v. Arvind Construction Co. (P) Ltd</a>
(supra). One of the questions considered was whether the application by
the Revenue seeking reference was barred by time. It was pointed out that
the order of the ITAT under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_49">Section 256</a> (1) of the Act was sent to the
„Chief Commissioner, Central Revenue Building‟.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                    Page 16 of 31</span>
<p id="p_50"> 26.2 The Assessee urged that the date on which the order was received in
that office i.e., 22nd May 1989 should have been the starting point for
computation of the period of limitation and if so computed, the reference
application would be barred by time. The revenue, on the other hand,
urged that the concerned Commissioner i.e., the Commissioner, Delhi,
Central-II, received the ITAT's order only on 14th August 1989, which
should be the starting point for computation and limitation and not 22 nd
May 1989 when the order under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_50">Section 256</a> (1) "was sent to the Chief
Commissioner".
</p>
<p id="p_51">26.3 The Court noted that the reference application under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_51">Section 256</a> (1)
of the Act had to be filed "not by the Income Tax Officer but by the
Commissioner". It observed that: "It is obviously the Commissioner of
Income-tax who is in charge of the Assessing Officer who would have the
jurisdiction to file an application under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_52">section 256(1)</a>". The Court held
that service of such an order on the Chief Commissioner was of no
consequence and that "It is only when the order was served on the
Commissioner of Income-tax (Central II), that the limitation would
commence". The Court noted that after filing of an application under
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_53">Section 256</a> of the Act, "the jurisdiction of the Commissioner may change.
But, we are not, in the present case, dealing with such a controversy".
</p>
<p id="p_52">27. The above decision was reiterated in <a href="/doc/160136566/" id="a_54">Commissioner of Income Tax v.
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal</a> (supra). In that case, the controversy was
whether the period of limitation would commence from the service of the
certified copy of the ITAT's order on the concerned Commissioner or on
the Commissioner (Central-I) who had no jurisdiction. The Court followed
the decision in <a href="/doc/22182/" id="a_55">CIT v. Arvind Construction Co. (P) Ltd</a>. (supra). It was
reiterated: "It is the Commissioner concerned who alone has the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                     Page 17 of 31</span>
 jurisdiction to file application and it is imperative that it is he who should
be served with a copy of order either under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_56">Section 254</a> or 256 (1)".
</p>
<p id="p_53">28. The above decisions under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_57">Section 256</a> (3) are clearly distinguishable.
The limitation for the purpose of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_58">Section 256</a> begins to run the moment
the order is communicated to the parties. Another distinction to be drawn
is that the word used in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_59">Section 256</a> of the Act „served‟ whereas under
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_60">Section 260A</a> it is „received‟. The word „received' has to be seen in the
context of the decision in <a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_61">CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra), which made
it mandatory for pronouncement of the orders of the ITAT. At the time of
such pronouncement, apart from the AR of the Assessee, the DR is
expected to remain present. Through him the Department becomes
immediately aware of the said judgment of the ITAT.
</p>
<p id="p_54">The 'concerned' CIT

</p><p id="p_55">29. The main thrust of the submissions of learned counsel for the Revenue
is that it is only the 'concerned' CIT or Principal Commissioner of Income
Tax (Pr CIT) who has the jurisdiction over the case who can be a 'party' to
the appeal and not any and every CIT or Pr CIT. It is further pointed out
that in the context of appeals by or against the Revenue, it is not that the
Revenue as a whole that is the aggrieved party but only the concerned
officer dealing with a case or having jurisdiction over the AO of the
concerned case, who would be "the concerned party." Only such CIT or Pr
CIT could file an appeal for the Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_56">30. In this context, it is necessary to also refer to the allocation of work of
the CITs (Judicial) and their jurisdiction. Initially, Instruction No. 4 dated
7th May 2002 specified the jurisdiction and the role of the CIT (Judicial).
It was stated that the administrative decision to file the appeal before the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                      Page 18 of 31</span>
 High Court would vest with the respective administration CIT/CCIT, who
would compile the databank on the question of law and ensure that there
was uniformity in the stand of the Department on a particular issue.
</p>
<p id="p_57">31. Later, these instructions were revised and superseded by Instruction
No. 6 of 2015 dated 3rd July 2015. While reiterating the earlier Instruction,
it was clarified that the actual filing of appeals before the High Court
would remain the responsibility of the jurisdictional Pr CIT/CIT. The CIT
(J) was made part of the Screening Committee and his office would
provide secretarial assistance to the Screening Committee for engagement
of standing counsels and prosecution counsels. The CIT (J) was also
responsible for assisting the Pr CIT/CIT in the work of reviewing and
evaluating their performance.
</p>
<p id="p_58">32. It is in the above context that it is argued on behalf of the Revenue, by
its standing counsel Mr Dileep Shivpuri, Ms. Vibhooti Malhotra and Ms.
Lakshmi Gurung, that the 'aggrieved party‟ is the 'concerned' CIT or Pr
CIT who alone has to take a decision in the matter of filing an appeal. In
other words till the order in appeal of the ITAT is not „received‟ by the
concerned CIT, the limitation for filing an appeal against the said order,
does not, according to the counsel for the Revenue, begin to run. Emphasis
is also laid on the words "the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief
Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner". It is stated
that the prefix 'the' in this context connotes that the particular CIT/Pr CIT
has to take a decision about the filing of an appeal. Reference is made to
the decisions in <a href="/doc/1542029/" id="a_62">Consolidated Coffee v. Coffee Board</a> 1980 (3) SCR 625
and <a href="/doc/499876/" id="a_63">Shree Ishar Alloys Steels Ltd. v. Jayaswal Neco</a> AIR 2001 SC 1161.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                    Page 19 of 31</span>
<p id="p_59"> 33. Reference is also made to the decision in <a href="/doc/1537030/" id="a_64">Adi Pherorzshah Gandhi v.
H.M. Seervai</a> AIR 1971 SC 385, where the scope and ambit of the words
„person aggrieved‟ under <a href="/doc/256237/" id="a_65">Section 37</a> of the Advocates Act, 1961 was
considered. It is pointed out that any person feeling disappointed with the
result of the case would not be a „person aggrieved‟. "He must be
disappointed of a benefit which he would have received if the order had
gone the other way".
</p>
<p id="p_60">34. The Revenue also relies on the decision in <a href="/doc/806212/" id="a_66">Infosys Technologies Ltd.
v. Jupiter Infosys Ltd</a>. (2011) 1 SCC 125, where the Supreme Court
discussed the scope of the word „aggrieved‟ occurring in the Trade and
<a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_67">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958. An application under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_68">Sections 46</a> or 56 of
that statute had to be by "a person aggrieved". Such a person, it was held,
"must be one whose interest is affected in some possible way". It is
accordingly submitted in the present case by the Revenue that it is only the
jurisdictional Commissioner who can be said to be 'aggrieved' by the
decision of the ITAT. Reference is also made to the decision in <a href="/doc/1098837/" id="a_69">State of
Maharashtra v. Ark Builders Pvt. Ltd</a>. (2011) 4 SCC 616 which in the
context of Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_70">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 emphasised that the
period of limitation under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_71">Section 34(3)</a> of the Act would commence only
"from the date on which the order/award was received by the party
concerned in the manner prescribed by the law".
</p>
<p id="p_61">35. On the other hand, it is pointed out by Mr. C.S. Aggarwal, Senior
counsel for the Assessee, that it is the date of pronouncement of the order
which should be taken as the date on which that order is „received‟ for the
purposes of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_72">Section 260A(2)(a)</a> of the Act. This is because the order is
pronounced in the open and the date of pronouncement is duly notified by
the ITAT. Reference is also made to Section 33 of the CPC read with



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                   Page 20 of 31</span>
 Order 20, Rule 1(1) thereof, which states that the Court would pronounce
the judgment in open court after notifying the parties or the pleaders. It is
pointed out that the date of pronouncement of orders by the ITAT is
always notified in advance. A DR is always present at the time of
pronouncement of such judgment or order.
</p>
<p id="p_62">36. Supplementing the above submission, Mr. Abhishek Maratha, counsel
appearing for the Assessee in ITA No. 52 of 2015 pointed out that after
the change of procedure where the orders of the ITAT are pronounced in
the open it is incumbent on the Department through its DR or CIT
(Judicial) to apply for a certified copy of the order. It is also pointed out
that under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_73">Section 256</a>, the expression used is „served‟. In <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_74">Section 260A</a>,
the word „communicated‟ was substituted by the word „received‟. This
word 'received', according to Mr.Maratha, has to be read as 'pronounced'
in the presence of DR. Limitation would, therefore, begin to run from the
date of pronouncement of the judgment excluding the time taken in
obtaining a copy thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_63">37. At the outset, the Court would like to observe that in any matter
arising from an order passed by the ITAT against the Department, an
„aggrieved‟ person is the entire Department. It is not any individual officer
of the Department who can be said to be 'aggrieved'. It would be factually
and legally incorrect to state that only that AO, CIT or Pr CIT within
whose jurisdiction the Assessee's returns are scrutinised will be the
aggrieved party and not any other officer of the Department. The CIT or
the Pr CIT is a representative of the Department which is the party
aggrieved.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                    Page 21 of 31</span>
<p id="p_64"> 38. In other words, there can be no doubt that in all cases where the
decision of the ITAT has gone against the Revenue, it is the Revenue as a
whole which is the 'aggrieved party'. An individual CIT or Pr CIT can
prefer the appeal on behalf of the Revenue as an aggrieved party. If the
legislative intent was to confer the power to file an appeal only by the
'concerned' CIT or Pr CIT or Chief CIT, then words to that effect ought to
have been used. The use of the prefix 'the' preceding the words CIT or Pr
CIT in Section 260 A (2) (a) serves only the grammatical correctness of a
preposition and nothing more. It is not to be read as meaning "that
particular CIT" or the "concerned CIT".
</p>
<p id="p_65">39. The interpretation of the prefix "the" has to be both purposive and
contextual. The object of the provision is to enable the filing of appeals
within a period of limitation. As it is, the period of limitation (120 days) is
considerably longer than in routine cases (30, 60 or a maximum of 90
days). The interpretation has to serve the purpose of not lengthening the
period of limitation further, but to ensure that the time limit is strictly
adhered to. Relaxation of the period of limitation in such cases has to be
an exception and not the rule. The decisions in <a href="/doc/1542029/" id="a_75">Consolidated Coffee v.
Coffee Board</a> (supra) and <a href="/doc/499876/" id="a_76">Shree Ishar Alloys Steels Ltd. v. Jayaswal
Neco</a> (supra) were rendered in the context of different statutes where the
wording of the provisions in question dictated the result of the
interpretative exercise. They are not useful in the interpretation of the
word "the" which precedes the words CIT or Pr CIT in Section 260 A (2)
</p><p id="p_66">(a) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_67">40. The context in which the interpretive exercise is to be undertaken is
that of the statute of limitation. Usually, the commencement of limitation
is that point when there is 'knowledge' of an order or judgment. In the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                      Page 22 of 31</span>
 context of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_77">Section 260A(2)(a)</a>, the question that should be asked is: "when
was the Department/Revenue aware of the order" and not "when was that
particular CIT or Pr CIT having jurisdiction have knowledge of the order".
Once a responsible officer or representative of the Department such as its
DR or the CIT (Judicial) is aware of the order, then from that point it is a
purely internal administrative arrangement as to how the said officer
obtains and further communicates the order to the officer who has to take
a decision on filing the appeal. Of course, the time taken to obtain a copy
of the order by such DR or CIT (Judicial) would be excluded. However,
the period of limitation will not cease to run only because the 'concerned'
officer has not yet received the order.
</p>
<p id="p_68">41. The counsel for the Revenue point out that the requirement that the
ITAT should pronounce orders was not a statutory one but was brought
about by a decision of this Court. Whilst this is correct, Rule 34 of the
ITAT Rules equally provides the statutory underpinning of this principle.
The fact that the jurisdictional CIT was not present at the time of
pronouncement of the order of the ITAT will make no difference. The first
officer of the Department who receives the certified copy should be taken
to have „received‟ it on behalf of all the officers of the Department. How
such officer who first receives the copy ensures that it reaches the
particular officer who has to take a decision on filing an appeal is for the
Department to figure out. That internal issue of the Department cannot
possibly extend the time for filing of the appeal beyond 120 days as
provided under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_78">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) of the Act

</p><p id="p_69">42. The problem can also be viewed from the angle of the frequent
transfers and posting of the income tax officers including CIT/Pr CIT on
account of the allocation/re-allocation of duties and other administrative



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                   Page 23 of 31</span>
 exigencies. It is possible that the CIT who was the „concerned‟ CIT at the
time of dispatch by the ITAT of the copy of the order ceases to be such
when he receives the copy. That will not give rise to a fresh period of
limitation or postpone the commencement of limitation till such time the
substitute 'concerned' Pr CIT/CIT receives a copy of the said order. Given
the fact that, legislatively, a larger period of limitation has been granted
for filing appeals, there is no warrant for any flexibility in the
interpretation thereby giving a discretion to officers of the Department to
extend the period of limitation beyond what is envisaged by the statute. In
these very cases, the impugned order was received by a particular CIT
(Judicial) and then sent to the „concerned‟ CIT, who was shifted out by the
time a copy reached him. Meanwhile, the period of 120 days lapsed. The
period of 120 days cannot be sought to be stretched indefinitely till the
'concerned' CIT receives the order. That would then defeat the legislative
purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_70">43. Viewed differently, the contextual interpretation of the expression
„receive‟ would be when the parties notified of the pronouncement are
represented at that time in the open court. When pronounced, both parties
are said to receive it. The agency which they choose for transmission to
the official or executive component to authorise an appeal is not the
concern of the judicial system.
</p>
<p id="p_71">44. Another context would be the absence of arbitrariness and
discrimination in the manner of treatment of the parties to the litigation.
Section 260 A (2) (a) applies to both, the Assessee as well as the Revenue.
When it is the Assessee who is aggrieved, limitation for filing the appeal
will begin to run once the Assessee through its AR receives a copy of the
order of the ITAT. Where the AR is present at the pronouncement, or even



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                   Page 24 of 31</span>
 when such AR chooses not to remain present for pronouncement, the
Assessee should be taken to be aware of the order from that moment.
From then on, barring the time taken by such AR to obtain a copy of the
order, the limitation for filing an appeal would begin to run. Assuming
that the Assessee is a large company, and a decision as to filing an appeal
can only be taken by, say, its Managing Director (MD), an argument that
the limitation does not begin till the order has reached the desk of the MD
of that company will not be countenanced. Therefore, what applies to an
Assessee should equally apply to the Revenue particularly since the
legislature has not couched the language in a manner that brings out any
difference in the treatment of both the parties to the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_72">45. The decisions in the <a href="/doc/1098837/" id="a_79">State of Maharashtra v. Ark Builders Pvt. Ltd</a>.
(supra), <a href="/doc/1537030/" id="a_80">Adi Pherorzshah Gandhi v. H.M. Seervai</a> (supra) and <a href="/doc/806212/" id="a_81">Infosys
Technologies Ltd. v. Jupiter Infosys Ltd</a> (supra) were in the context of
statutes other than the Act. Apart from reiterating the settled principles of
interpretation of statutes, over which there can be no dispute, the said
decisions are therefore not particularly helpful to the Revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_73">46. On the other hand, the settled legal position is that where the words
and expressions used in the statute are unambiguous and clear, there is no
scope for the Court to 'read into' the statute words that do not exist. In the
present case, if the Revenue's argument were to be accepted, the Court
would be adding a prefix 'concerned' to the words CIT or Pr CIT or Chief
CIT in Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act. In the considered view of the
Court, that is not permissible for the Court to do so in the circumstances
explained hereinbefore.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                     Page 25 of 31</span>
<p id="p_74"> 47. Administrative instructions issued by the Department might insist that
the CIT (Judicial) cannot by himself take a decision on filing an appeal.
That, however, cannot extend the statutory period of limitation for filing
the appeal. It is up to the Department to devise the protocol to ensure that
</p><p id="p_75">(i) the decision to file the appeal and (ii) the steps to prepare and file such
appeal are completed within the stipulated statutory period of 120 days
from the date when the order was first received either by the DR or by the
CIT (Judicial) or any other CIT. As long as the order to be appealed
against is served on an officer of the Revenue, be it a DR or a CIT
(Judicial), limitation will begin to run from that date.
</p>
<p id="p_76">48. It is possible that immediately after pronouncement, the AR or the DR
or both may apply for a certified copy of the order of the ITAT. In that
case, the time taken for the certified copy to be readied for collection by
the applicant will be excluded while computing limitation. But here again,
if earlier to such date, a copy is received by a party from the ITAT, then
such earlier date will be the starting point for limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_77">49. Consequently, where the order is common to several appeals, while for
the assessee the starting point for limitation will be when the assessee
aggrieved by such order first receives a copy thereof; for the Revenue, the
date when the DR or the CIT (Judicial) first receives a copy thereof will
be the starting point for limitation for all the appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_78">50. It is, therefore, not possible to accept the submission that till a
particular jurisdictional CIT or Pr CIT has not received the order of the
ITAT, the period of limitation for filing an appeal against that order does
not commence.

<p id="p_79"> Answers to the Questions

</p><p id="p_80">51. The answers to the questions referred to this Court are answered thus:
</p>
<p id="p_81">Q: (i) What is the correct interpretation to be placed on the expression
"received by the Assessee or the Principal Chief Commissioner or the
Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner" in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_82">Section 260A</a> (2) (a)
of the Act? Does it mean 'received' by any of the named officers including
the CIT (Judicial)?
</p><p id="p_82">Ans: The word „received‟ occurring in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_83">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) would mean
received by any of the named officers of the Department, including CIT
(Judicial). The provision at present names four particular officers i.e. the
Principal Commissioner, Commissioner, Principal Chief Commissioner,
and the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax. These are the only
designations of the officers who could receive a copy of the order. In the
absence of a qualifying prefix „concerned‟, the receipt of a copy of the
order of the ITAT by any of those officers in the Department including the
CIT (Judicial) will trigger the period of limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_83">Q: (ii) Does limitation begin to run for the purposes of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_84">Section 260A</a> (2)
</p><p id="p_84">(a) only when a certified copy of the order of the ITAT is received by the
'concerned' CIT within whose jurisdiction the case of the Assessee falls
notwithstanding that it may have been received by any other CIT,
including the CIT (Judicial) prior thereto? Is it open to the Court to read
the word 'concerned' into Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act as a prefix to
any of the officers of the Department named therein?
Ans: In <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_85">Section 260A</a> (2) of the Act, the words CIT, Pr CIT or Chief CIT
are not prefixed or qualified by the word 'concerned'. There is no warrant
for the Court to read into the provision such a qualifying word. The Court
rejects the contention of the Revenue that limitation for the purposes of
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_86">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) begins to run only when a certified copy of the order
of the ITAT is received by the 'concerned' CIT within whose jurisdiction




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                   Page 27 of 31</span>
 the case of the Assessee falls notwithstanding that it may have been
received by any other CIT, including the CIT (Judicial) prior thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_85">Q: (iii) In the context of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_87">Section 254</a> (3) of the Act, is there an obligation
on the ITAT to send a certified copy of its order to a CIT other than the
one whose details are given to it during the pendency of the appeal? Will
change in the jurisdiction concerning the case of the Respondent Assessee
to another CIT subsequent to the order of the ITAT have the effect of
postponing the time, from which limitation would begin to run in terms of
Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act, to when such CIT receives the order of the
ITAT?
</p><p id="p_86">Ans: As far as the obligation of the ITAT under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_88">Section 254</a> (3) of the Act
is concerned, the said obligation is satisfied once the ITAT sends a copy
of an order passed by it to the Assessee as well as to the Pr CIT or the CIT
or even the CIT (Judicial). The ITAT has to be simply go by the details as
provided to it in the memo of parties. If there is a change concerning the
jurisdiction of the CIT and it is some other CIT who has jurisdiction, it
will not have the effect of postponing the commencement of the period of
limitation in terms of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_89">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) of the Act. The statute is not
concerned with the internal arrangements that the Department may make
by changing the jurisdiction of its officers. It is for the officer of the
Department who first receives a copy of the ITAT‟s order to reach it in
time to the officer who has to take a decision regarding the filing of an
appeal.

 v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra). While the former decisions may not require
reconsideration, they require to be reconciled with the latter decision in
<a href="/doc/1409881/" id="a_97">CIT v. Sudhir Choudhrie</a> (supra). The decisions in <a href="/doc/22182/" id="a_98">CIT v. Arvind

the Revenue in its interpretation of Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_89">Q: (v) After the change of procedure where orders of the ITAT are
pronounced in the open, is it incumbent on the Department through its DR
or CIT (Judicial) to apply for a certified copy of the order of the ITAT and
should limitation for the purposes of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_100">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) be computed
from the date on which such certified copy is made ready for delivery by
the ITAT?
</p><p id="p_90">Ans: While there is no requirement for the DR or CIT (Judicial) to apply
for a certified copy of the ITAT, in any event under the extant ITAT
Rules, a copy of the order is sent to the CIT (Judicial). In the context of
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_101">Section 260A(2)(a)</a> of the Act, once an order is listed for pronouncement
in the ITAT, the DR or the CIT (Judicial) should be taken to be aware of
the order. From that point, it is a purely an internal administrative
arrangement as to how the DR or CIT (Judicial) obtains and further
communicates the order to the officer who has to take a decision on filing
the appeal. It is possible that immediately after pronouncement, the AR or
the DR or both may apply for a certified copy of the order of the ITAT. In
that case, the time taken for the certified copy to be readied for collection
by the applicant will be excluded while computing limitation. But here
again, if earlier to such date, a copy is received by a party from the ITAT,
then such earlier date will be the starting point for limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_91">Q: (vi) Whether the receipt of a certified copy of the order of the ITAT by
the CIT (Judicial) is sufficient to trigger the commencement of the
limitation period under Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act?
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">ITA Nos. 52/2015, 755/2015 &amp; 756/2015                                    Page 29 of 31</span>
<p id="p_92"> Ans: The receipt of a certified copy of the order of the ITAT by CIT
(Judicial) would trigger the commencement of the limitation period under
Section 260 A (2) (a) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_93">Q: (vii) In the context of a common order of the ITAT covering several
appeals, whether limitation for all the appeals would begin to run when
the certified copy is received first by either the CIT (Judicial) or any one
of the officers of the Department mentioned in Section 260 A (2) (a) or
only when the CIT 'concerned' receives it? Where the same CIT has
jurisdiction over more than one Assessee in the batch, will limitation
begin to run for all such appeals when such CIT receives the order in
either of the Assessee's cases?
</p><p id="p_94">Ans: Where there, is a common order of the ITAT covering the several
appeals, limitation would begin to run when a certified copy is received
first by either the CIT (Judicial) or one of the officers of the Department
and not only when the CIT „concerned‟ receives it. When the same CIT
has jurisdiction for more than one Assessee, the limitation begin to run for
all from the earliest of the dates when the DR of CIT (Judicial) or any CIT
first receives the order in any of the cases forming part of the batch
disposed of by the common order. If there are four separate orders passed,
then the limitation begins to run when such separate orders are received
first by any officer of the Department.
</p>
<p id="p_95">Q: (viii) Whether administrative instructions issued by the Department for
its own administrative convenience can have the effect of altering the time
from which limitation will begin to run for the purposes of Section 260 A
(2) (a) of the Act?
</p><p id="p_96">Ans: Instructions issued by the Department for its administrative
convenience cannot alter the time when limitation would begin to run
under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_102">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) of the Act. To reiterate these administrative
instructions are for the administrative convenience of the Department and
will not override the statute, in particular, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_103">Section 260A</a> (2) (a) of the Act.
