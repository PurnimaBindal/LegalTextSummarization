1.         By this order, I shall  dispose off  the contentions, raised on 

           behalf of the parties, on the point of sentence.



2.         In the present case,   convicts, namely,  Smt.  P. M. Singh 

           (A­1),  Dr.   G.   S.   Thind  (A­2),    Dr.   R.   Pal  (A­3)  and    Raj 

           Kumar Gupta(A­4),  have been  convicted  for the offence

3.         It has been strongly contended on behalf of the State by 

           the  Ld. PP for the CBI  that this is a  corruption  case,  in 

           which,   the   convicts   have   been   convicted,   as   they   were 

           involved  in the conspiracy and that in pursuance to the 

           systematic and well­planned conspiracy, they fraudulently 

           acted in connivance with K. L. Bhatia (since deceased), to 

           cheat the NDMC and by abusing their official position as 

           public servants, flouted the provisions of lease deed, rules 

           and regulations of building bye laws, Master Plan, Zonal 

           Plan and NDMC Act, which were required to be adhered to 

           issue   the   health   licence.       That   the   health   licence   was 

           cancelled   by   the   NDMC   (duly   approved   by   the   then 

           Chairperson on 21.2.2000) in the year 2000 as the premises 

           were re­entered and vested with the President of India and 

           were being misused as a hotel in the premises meant for 

           residential group housing, on the letter dated 2.8.1999 of L 

           &amp; DO.   The present convicts  fraudulently granted health 

           licence illegally  on 15.1.2003 to the accused K. L. Bhatia 

           (since   deceased),   who   was   proprietor   of   Centre   Point 

           Hotel, by falsely projecting part of the notification dated 

           7.5.1999,   the  earlier  notings   and   their   own  notings   right

           under   their   nose.     The   accused   K.   L.   Bhatia   (since 

           deceased) cheated the NDMC   for making personal huge 

           gains   and   all   the   convicts   joined   him   to   cause   him   big 

           pecuniary gains. 

               

4.         The   State   has   further   contended   that   the   maximum 

           prescribed   substantive   punishment   with   fine   be   handed 

           over to all the convicts, so that enough and clear  message 

           goes   to   one   and   all   and   especially   to   the   potential 

           offenders,   who   are   in   the   waiting   to   commit   such   like 

           crimes so that the punishment act as a deterrence and the 

           intent  of the legislature is fulfilled. 



5.         Convict, P. M. Singh (A­1), has prayed that a lenient view 

           be  taken  on  the   ground  that  she  is  a  senior   citizen and 

           retired from the service as Chairperson.  That she was the 

           Financial   Commissioner   of   Delhi   State.       That   she   has 

           unblemished   record.     That   her   both   children   are   living 

           abroad.       That she has an old mother of 88 years of age 

           residing in Chandigarh and nobody is in the family  to look 

           after her.  That the convict  is afflicted with hypertension. 

           That her husband is also of old age, who retired from army 

           and is residing with her in Delhi.    That she remained co­

           operative during   the  long  trial of the  case.    She further 

           submitted  that there  is no  case  of illegal  gratification  of 

           money.   That she  is not the beneficiary of any gain.  That 

           she   is   not   a   previous   convict.       She   has   prayed   that   a 

           lenient view may be taken.

           aged about 66 years.   That he has attended the hearings 

           regularly during the long trial of seven years.         That the 

           case is ten years old    and  period of ten years   is a long 

           period.     That he is not a previous convict.   That he has 

           been   afflicted   with   various   diseases   like   blood   pressure, 

           hypertension, diabetes and heart problem and he is under 

           regular treatment and medicines.   It is further submitted 

           that this is not a case of demand and acceptance of bribe 

           but   only   relates   to   violation   of   certain   rules   and 

           regulations.   He has prayed for a lenient view.



7.         Convict,  Dr.   R.   Pal  (A­3),  has   also   prayed   for     a   lenient 

           view.  He has submitted that  he was doctor by profession 

           and he has processed the file for the first time and put up 

           only two notes, wherein   he mentioned the earlier notes.

           earning   male   member   of   the   family.       That   he   is   not 

           involved in any other case.  That after his retirement,  he is 

           working  in CGHS  as doctor.        He  prayed  for  minimum 

           sentence.  



8.         On   behalf of convict,   Sh. Raj Kumar Gupta(A­4), it has 

           been submitted that he is still in service.     That he is the

           lenient   view   may   be   taken   and   minimum   sentence   be 

           given.

           lenient view.     



10.        The contentions, raised by the the convicts, have met stiff 

           and very strong opposition on behalf of the State.   It has

           been   urged   that   convict,  P.   M.   Singh,   the   then 

           Chairperson, has been convicted, as she had illegally and 

           dishonestly   approved   the   health   licence   in   respect   of   a 

           hotel by flouting the rules and norms of Building Bye Laws, 

           Master Plan, Zonal Plan and NDMC besides covenants of 

           the lease deed where the leassor was the Government and 

           the title vested in the President of India.  That she affixed 

           her   signatures   on   the   notesheet   despite   having   the 

           knowledge of re­entry by L&amp;DO and she later on scored 

           out her said  signatures.      It has,  further,  been stated on 

           behalf   of   the   State   that   being   a   public   servant   at   the 

           relevant time, convict  P. M. Singh acted corruptly with full 

           vigour, in approving of health licence against the norms of 

           the NDMC.   It has, therefore, been urged that this convict 

           deserves maximum punishment. 



11.        Regarding the  convict,  Dr. G. S. Thind  (A­2),  it is stated 

           that   he   ignored   the   recommended   note   dated   9.12.2002 

           and   intentionally,   did   not   follow   pre   conditions   for   the 

           issue   of   licence   and   fraudulently     put   up   a   note   dated 

           15.1.2003   and   thereafter,   he   made   interpolations   in   the 

           same.  That he is not entitled to any mercy or compassion.

           appended   two   favourable   notes   dated   15.1.2003   and 

           approved   the   note   put   up   by   convict   R.   K.   Gupta   and 

           deliberately   concealed   the   relevant     conditions   of   the 

           notification dated 7.5.1999 for the grant of Licence for the 

           guest house mentioned in the notification.  He is also not 

           entitled to any mercy or compassion.



13.        Similarly,  it is stated  that convict  R.  K.  Gupta  (A­4)  was 

           involved in the conspiracy with other convicts and that in 

           pursuance to the systematic and well­planned conspiracy, 

           he   dishonestly   processed   the   application     for   Health 

           Licence and put up a detailed favourable note, in which 

           dishonestly incorrect and twisted facts were incorporated 

           for renewal/grant of Licence to Centre Point Hotel.     It is 

           stated that he is not entitled to any mercy or compassion.



14.        It is further urged on behalf of the State that most of the 

           pleas taken by the convicts   are routine and stock pleas 

           and   in   any   case,   in   the   case   under   the   <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_8">Prevention   of 

           Corruption Act</a>,   these pleas taken   are not considered as 

           mitigating circumstances.  It has, therefore,  been  prayed 

           that exemplary punishment   be awarded to the convicts

17.        At the very outset, it is observed that there is no quarrel 

           over   the   settled   propositions   of   law   discussed   in   the 

           aforesaid case law,  cited by the parties. 



18.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case law, reported as  Dr. 
           Subramanyam Swami    Vs. Dr. Manmohan Singh,  2012, 
           AIR(SC) page 1185, has observed that ­:
                     "The magnitude of corruption in our public 
                     life   is   incompatible   with   the   concept   of 
                     socialistic secular democratic  public.   The 
                     duty   of   the   Court   is   that   any   anti  
                     corruption   law   has   to   be   interpreted   and 
                     worked   out   in   such   a   fashion   as   to  
                     strengthen to fight against corruption."


19.         It has further been observed in the same case that  "In a 

           situation   where   two   constructions   are   eminently  

           reasonable,  the Court  has to accept  the one  that  seeks  to  

           eredicate  corruption  to the one which seeks to perpetuate 

           it."



20.                  It   has   been   held   in   case   reported   as  Narendra

                     "Corruption  at  any level  does  not  deserve  

                     either  sympathy or leniency."  



21.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case law, reported as State 
           of Madhya Pradesh   V Sheikh Shahid,  AIR 2009 SC 2951, 
           has observed that ­:
                     "Justice   demands   that   Courts   should 
                     impose punishment  befitting  the crime so 
                     that   the Courts   reflect  public    abhorrence  
                     of the crime.   The Court must not only keep 
                     in view  the rights of the criminal  but also  
                     the rights  of the victim of the crime and the 
                     society   at   large   while   considering     the 
                     imposition of appropriate punishment." 




22.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan 

           Vs. Vinod  Kumar,  decided  on,  18th  May,  2012 (Criminal  

           Appeal No. 1887) reiterated   the law laid down in State of 

           J&amp;K   Vs.   Vinay Nanda,  AIR 2001 SC P 611,  and observed 

           that  superannuation of the convict   and the pendency   of  

           criminal  trial  for over a period of time cannot  be treated  a  

           special reason to reduce  the sentence.

                      "It   is   a   normal   thing   that   'trial'   of   the 
                      person  is   considered     a period  of   'agony'  
                      undergone by him.  But  we tend to forget 
                      the   agony   of   the   society   and   the 
                      complainant   who   dared     lodge   the  
                      complaint.   The   entire   purpose   of   the 
                      legislature   of   sentencing   the   offenders  
                      stands defeated  and that is the one reason  
                      that   wages   of   corruption   are   considered  
                      more   attractive     in   this   country.     The  
                      person caught is not always   a first­timer  
                      corrupt.       He   may   have   been   indulging  
                      into     corrupt   activities   /   practices   for   a  
                      long   number     of   years.       It   is   to   his  
                      advantage that the trial is prolonged.   He  
                      spends   a   fraction   of   amount,   earned   by 
                      corrupt   practices   on   litigation   and 
                      professionals     to   see   that   ultimately     he  
                      makes     Criminal     Justice   System     a  
                      laughing stock.   In this process, the entire  
                      legislative purpose of punishing a corrupt  
                      stands defeated. 


24.        It   was   further   observed   by   the   Hon'ble   Court   in   the 

           aforesaid case  that ­:

                      constitute 'special reasons'." 


25.        It   was   held   by   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in   the   case 

           reported   as  State   of   M.   P.   Vs.   Shambhu   Dayal   Nagar,

                      "Corruption by public servant has become  
                      gigantic   problem.   It   has   spread 
                      everywhere. No facet of public activity has  
                      been   left   unaffected   by   the   stink   of  
                      corruption.       Large   scale     corruption  
                      retards  the nation building activities and  
                      everyone has to suffer on that count."


26.        In   the   same   appeal   quoting   'M   B   Joshi   Vs.   State     of 

           Maharashtra, AIR 2001 SC 147' the Hon'ble   Apex   Court 

           observed that­:

                      "It is the defect  of the system that longevity

                      regarded     as   sufficient     for   reducing     the 
                      sentence     mandated   by   the   Parliament  
                      legislative exercise  would stand defeated."

31.                   It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
           the case reported as  State   of   M. P. Vs. Ram Singh,  AIR 
           2000 SC 870,  that­:                    
                      "Corruption   in   a   civilised     society     is   a 
                      disease like cancer, which   if not detected 
                      in time  is sure to maliganise the polity of  
                      the   country   leading   to   disastrous 
                      consequences.   It   is   termed   as   plague  
                      which is not only contagious   but if   not  
                      controlled   spreads like a fire in a jungle.  
                      Its virus is compared with HIV  leading to  
                      AIDS being incurable.  The socio­political  
                      system   exposed   to   such   a   dreaded  
                      communicable  disease is likely to crumble  
                      under   its   own   weight.     Corruption   is 
                      opposed   to  democracy     and  social   order,  
                      being  not only anti people, but aimed and

                      "undue   sympathy   to   impose   inadequate  
                      sentence   would   do   more   harm   to   the

                      every   court   to   award   proper   sentence 
                      having regard to the nature of the offence 
                      and the manner in which it was executed  
                      or committed etc."

                      offences under two enactments generally,  
                      it is wrong  to have consecutive  sentences.  
                      But   this   rule     has   no   application     if   the  
                      transaction  relating to offences is not  the

                      'recognise, learn   to control   and exclude'  
                      many diverse  data.  It is a balancing  act

                      Government  and the society at large into 
                      disrepute.  It is  through  the agency of  the

                      Legislature as well as of the Government is

                      offenders are brought to book. It is through

                      servants that the welfare of the society can

                       "When   corruption   was   sought   to   be  
                       eliminated   from   the   polity   all   possible  
                       stringent   measures   are   to   be   adopted 
                       within   the   bounds   of   law.   One   such  
                       measure   is   to   provide   condign 
                       punishment.   Parliament   measured   the 
                       parameters  for such condign punishment  
                       and   in   that   process   wanted   to   fix   a  
                       minimum   sentence   of   imprisonment   for 
                       giving   deterrent   impact   on   other   public 
                       servants who are prone   to corrupt deals. 
                       That   was   precisely   the   reason   why   the  
                       sentence     was   fixed   as   seven   years   and  
                       directed     that   even   if   the   said   period   of  
                       imprisonment   need   not   be   given,   the 
                       sentence   shall   not   be   less   than   the 
                       imprisonment   for   one   year.   Such   a 
                       legislative   insistence     is   reflection   of 
                       Parliament's   resolve     to   meet   corruption  
                       cases with very strong hand to give signals  
                       of deterrence as the most pivotal feature of  
                       sentencing  of  corrupt  public  servants. All 
                       public servants   have to face very serious  
                       consequences.     If   on   the   other   hand   any  
                       public servant  is given the impression that  
                       if   he   succeeds   in   protracting   the 
                       proceedings that would help him to have  
                       the   advantage   of   getting   a   very   light

                       incentive   to   public   servants   who   were  
                       susceptible   to   corruption   to   indulge   in  
                       such   nefarious   practices   with   immunity.

                       also   defeat   the   purpose   as   the   corrupt  
                       public servants could   easily raise the fine

           contentions.   I have also examined the asserted mitigating 

           and   aggravating   circumstances,   pointed   out     by   the 

           parties.  In this case, all the convicts  blatantly flouted most 

           dishonestfully the preceding notings including their own 

           notings  in the licence file. Convict R. K. Gupta, admittedly, 

           visited   the   premises   for   inspection   and   he,   therefore, 

           knew that Centre Point  Hotel ( a full  fledged hotel) was 

           running at the spot illegally yet he presented  it as a Guest 

           House   fraudulently.     Convict,   Dr.   R.   Pal   fraudulently 

           twisted and used notification dated 7.5.1999 and distorted 

           the facts falsely.   Dr. G. S. Thind fraudulently overlooked 

           his own previous note dated 9.12.2002 and subsequently, 

           interpolated   and distorted the record of the note sheet.

           of   prosecuting   him)   and   subsequently,   scored   out   her 

           signatures.   All the convicts ruthlessly violated lease deed,

           on record. A bare perusal of the same makes an interesting 

           reading. It shows that accused PM Singh admits of signing

           thought scoring it out. This shows her malafides.

           5000   Sq.   meters   and   therefore,  no   guest   house   could 

           operate from the property in question even in view of the

           accused   K.L.   Bhatia   (since   deceased).     Accused   Dr.   G.S. 

           Thind,   the   then   MOH   submitted   file   for   approval   of 

           Chairperson on 15.01.03. The then Chairperson, accused 

           Smt. PM Singh affixed her signatures on the same date in 

           token of approval and marked the file back to MOH. All 

           this is evident from the notings contained in Ex.PW1/D in 

           file,  Ex.PW2/1.   Thereafter,   accused   Dr.   G.S.   Thind   on 

           17.01.03   marked   the   file   back   to   Chief   Medical   Officer 

           (License),   who   in   turn   marked   the   file   to   SI­V.   That   it 

           appears that signatures of accused Smt. PM Singh, dated 

           15.01.03   and   the   marking   'MOH'   written   by   her   were 

           scored   out,   which   appears   to   have   been   done 

           subsequently by accused Smt. PM Singh herself. Accused 

           Dr.   G.S.   Thind   also   interpolated   by   elaborating   his   note 

           later   as   is   evident   from   the   note,  Ex.PW1/D  in   file, 

           Ex.PW2/1  and which is corroborated by the report of the 

           forensic   expert   proved   on   record.   The   aforesaid 

           manipulation seems to have been done by accused   PM 

           Singh  &amp; Dr. G.S. Thind after the matter flared up and got

           13.01.2006 while considering defence statement submitted

           exhibited  in CC no.  27/11 as  Ex.PW45/DA).  It makes an

           accused   Smt.   PM   Singh   in   her   defence   statement 

           submitted   to   CBI   contended   that   the   unauthorized

           on meeting of the prescribed parameters of regularization 

           after   having   discussed   the   same   with   the   then   Chief 

           Architect. She contended that she was not aware that the 

           said building was being used for commercial purpose and 

           that  neither   preceding  notes  in  the  file  were   mentioned 

           nor any objection or action by L &amp;DO was informed to her 

           by   the   then   Chief   Architect   during   discussion.   That   she

           accorded her approval  for renewal of health license or for 

           regularization   of   unauthorized   construction.   She   has 

           further   stated  that  she appended  her   signatures  on   the 

           note of MOH on 15.01.03 (appearing in note Ex.PW1/D in 

           file  Ex.PW2/1) and had marked it to MOH but  on second 

           thought as she was not comfortable with the proposal, 

           she immediately struck out her signatures. She further 

           stated that since she had not passed any order, she was 

           under impression that if her approval was needed, the 

           official concerned of NDMC would come back to discuss 

           with her.  The prosecution ought to have relied and placed 

           this   note   to   show   the   false   stand   taken   by   accused   PM 

           Singh,   subsequently.   However,   the   defence   while   cross 

           examining PW39 had thankfully and fairly brought the said 

           notings of PW39 in the Ministry's file summoned by them

           clearance from CA (Chief Architect) NDMC. The file was

                the act of agreement. Conspiracy is a clandestine activity.  
                Persons generally do not form illegal covenants openly. In

                a conspiracy without even being informed of the identity

                 prevail in a conspiracy trial. Contrary to the usual rule, in  
                 conspiracy   prosecutions,   any   declaration   by   one 
                 conspirator,   made   in   furtherance   of   a   conspiracy   and  
                 during   its   pendency,   is   admissible   against   each   co­
                 conspirator. Despite the unreliability of hearsay evidence, it  
                 is admissible in conspiracy prosecutions. Thus conspirators  
                 are   liable   on   agency   theory   for   statements   of   co­
