<p id="p_2">     2.              It is the case of the plaintiffs that plaintiff No.1 was registered 
     with the Charity Commissioner on 8th  October 1993.   It is their further 




                                                            
     case   that   after   registration   the   plaintiffs   have   established   various 
     educational   institutions   in   association   with   Southern   New   Hampshire 
     College.   It   is   their   case   that   the   plaintiffs,   since   last   two   decades,   are 




                                              
     conducting   various   education   courses   in   the   field   of   technology, 
                           
     management, hotel management etc.     It is their case that the plaintiffs 
     were notified as ITM University by Chhattisgarh Government.   It is also 
                          
     their case that the institutions of the plaintiffs are recognized by All India 
     Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and their courses have received 
     accreditation.       The   students   after   passing   the   course   from   their 
      


     institutions have got placements in various reputed concerns.   It is their 
   



     case   that   the   plaintiffs   have   adopted   the   trademark   "Institute   for 
     Technology and Management - ITM" for last several years and have made 
     huge   expenditure   on   advertisement   and,   as   such,   the   word   "ITM"   has 





     become synonymous with the plaintiffs' educational activity.   It is further 
     submitted by the plaintiffs that recently before filing of this suit,  on 18 th 
     March 2010, one student desirous of seeking admission in the plaintiffs' 





     institute   for   technology   and   management   pointed   out   the   allegations 
     made against ITM Gurgaon.  It is the case of the plaintiffs that only after 
     the information was given by the said student the plaintiffs came to know 
     that the defendants were using a similar and deceptive mark as that of the

     plaintiffs.     It is submitted that the plaintiffs then issued notices to the 
     defendants  asking   them   to   refrain   from  using   the  plaintiffs'   trademark.

<p id="p_3">     However, since even after receipt of the notices, the defendants did not 




                                                              
     stop   using   the   said   trademark,   the   plaintiffs   were   required   to   file   the 
     present suit along with notice of motion.

<p id="p_4">     3.              Heard Shri Kadam, learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs 
     and   Shri   Chaudhary,   learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the 
     defendants.

                     Shri   Kadam,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the 
     plaintiffs   submits   that   the   plaintiffs   are   using   the   impugned   trademark 
                          
     right from 1991.  He further submits that in any case the trademark of the 
     plaintiffs has been duly registered.   He submits that as long as trademark 
     of   the   plaintiffs   is   registered,   it   is   not   permissible   for   the   Court   to   go 
      


     beyond the registration and in case of infringement of the said mark an 
   



     injunction must follow.   The learned counsel further submits that in any 
     case the plaintiffs are in the field of education  much prior to that of the 
     defendants  and, as such, irrespective of the registration of the trademark 





     of the plaintiffs, on the ground of prior use their trademark is liable to be 
     protected.       Learned   counsel   further   submits   that   the   defendants   have 
     nowhere averred as to how they adopted the trademark which they are 





     using and, as such, the defendants with dishonest and deceptive intention 
     are using the trademark of the plaintiffs.       In reply to the contention of 
     the defendants that since the words used in the the trademark are generic 
     in nature the same cannot be registered, learned counsel for the plaintiffs

     submits that since the defendants themselves have filed suit against the 
     University of the same name at Gwalior, notified by the Madhya Pradesh

     trademark "ITM University" is much prior to that of the plaintiffs.   It is 
     submitted that the claim of the plaintiffs that plaintiff No.1 is university is 




                                                                                   
     itself without any basis.   It is submitted that the plaintiff No.1 has claimed 




                                                           
     to be university under the Chhattisgarh University Act.  However, the said 
     Act has been struck down by the Apex Court and, as such, the plaintiff 
     No.1 cannot claim to be a university.     It is further submitted that the 




                                                          
     plaintiffs' claim is fraudulent and, therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled 
     to   any   equitable   reliefs.       He   submits   that   the   defendant   is   the   first 
     autonomous college established in the State of Haryana, running from the 




                                            
     year 1996 and now, in view of the notification dated 21 st  October 2009 
                          
     issued by the State of Haryana, it is the first autonomous university in the 
     State of Haryana.  Learned counsel further submits that the defendants are 
                         
     running various courses like MTech, MBA, BBA, LLM, BBA-LLB and 7,500 
     students are taking education in the defendant society.     It is submitted 
     that   the   defendant   university   has   a   large   campus   at   Gurgaon   having 
      


     various facilities for the students.   It is submitted that the defendant is a 
   



     university as notified by the Haryana Government under the provisions of 
     the Haryana Private Universities Act, 2009 whereas the plaintiff No.1 is 
     only an institute recognised by a non-statutory body.   He submits that the 





     perusal   of   the   list   of   universities   approved   by   the   University   Grant 
     Commission (UGC) would reveal that defendant's name is found in the 
     said list whereas the plaintiff's name is not found there.   He submits that 





     from the perusal of documents relied upon by the plaintiffs themselves, it 
     would   reveal   that   the   plaintiff   No.1   is   not   an   university   but   only   an 
     institute.  Learned counsel further submits that there are various institutes 
     running   in   the   country   having   the   words   "Institute   of   Technology   and

                "28. ...........           The   action   for   infringement   is   a 
                statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of 
                         
                a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive 
                right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods 
                (Vide<a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_29"> s. 21</a> of the Act). The use by the defendant of the 
                        
                trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for 
                passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action 
                for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in respect 
                of   passing   off   consists  merely   of   the  colourable  use  of  a 
      


                registered   trade   mark,   the   essential   features   of   both   the 
                actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a 
   



                colourable limitation of a trade mark in a passing off action 
                would   also   be   such   in   an   action   for   infringement   of   the 
                same   trade   mark.  But   there  the   correspondence   between 
                the two ceases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff 





                must, no doubt, make out that use of the defendant's mark 
                is   likely   to   deceive,   but   were   the   similarity   between   the 
                plaintiff's   and   the   defendant's   mark   is   so   close   either 
                visually,   phonetically   or   otherwise   and   the   court   reaches 
                the   conclusion   that   there   is   an   imitation,   no   further 





                evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights 
                are   violated.   Expressed   in   another   way,   if   the   essential 
                features   of   the   trade   mark   of   the   plaintiff   have   been 
                adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing 
                and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets 
                in   which   he   offers   his   goods   for   sale   show   marked

      immaterial;   whereas   in   the   case   of   passing   off,   the 
      defendant   may   escape   liability   if   he   can   show   that   the 
      added   matter   is   sufficient   to   distinguish   his   goods   from 




                                                
      those of the plaintiff. 
</p><p id="p_23">      29. When   once   the   use   by   the   defendant   of   the   mark 
      which is claimed to infringe the plaintiff's mark is shown to 




                                               
      be "in the course of trade", the question whether there has 
      been an infringement is to be decided by comparison of the 
      two marks. Where the two marks are identical no further 
      questions   arise;   for   then   the   infringement   is   made   out. 
      When the two marks are not identical, the plaintiff would 




                                 
      have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so 
      nearly resembles the plaintiff's registered trade mark as is 
               
      likely to deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods 
      in respect of which it is registered (Vide<a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_30"> s. 21</a>). A point has 
      sometimes been raised as to whether the words "or cause 
              
      confusion"   introduce   any   element   which   is   not   already 
      covered   by   the   words   "likely   to   deceive"   and   it   has 
      sometimes been  answered  by  saying  that  it  is  merely  an 
      extension   of   the   earlier   test   and   does   not   add   very 
      


      materially   to   the   concept   indicated   by   the   earlier   words 
      "likely to deceive". But this apart, as the question arises in 
   



      an   action   for   infringement   the   onus   would   be   on   the 
      plaintiff   to   establish   that   the   trade   mark   used   by   the 
      defendant in the course of trade in the goods in respect of 
      which   his   mark   is   registered,   in   deceptively   similar.   This 





      has necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the 
      two marks-the degree of resemblance which is necessary to 
      exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by 
      laying down objective standards. The persons who would 
      be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and 





      it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject 
      of consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual 
      or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. The 
      purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the 
      essential   features   of   the   plaintiff's   trade   mark   are   to   be

               the essential features of the mark is in essence a question of 
               fact and depends on the judgment of the Court based on 




                                                                                
               the evidence led before it as regards the usage of the trade. 
               It should, however, be borne in mind that the object of the 
               enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by 




                                                        
               the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of 
               the registered mark of the plaintiff. 
</p><p id="p_24">               30. The   mark   of   the   respondent   which   he   claims   has 




                                                       
               been   infringed   by   the   appellant   is   the   mark   'Navaratna 
               Pharmaceutical Laboratories', and the mark of the appellant 
               which the respondent claimed was a colourable limitation 
               of that mark is 'Navaratna Pharmacy'. Mr. Agarwala here 
               again   stressed   the   fact   that   the   'Navaratna'   which 




                                         
               constituted   an   essential   part   of   feature  of  the   Registered 
               Trade   Mark   was   a   descriptive   word   in   common   use   and 
                        
               that if the use of this word in the appellant's mark were 
               disregarded, there would not be enough material left for 
               holding that the  appellant had used a trade  mark which 
                       
               was deceptively similar to that of the respondent. But this 
               proceeds, in our opinion, on ignoring that the appellant is 
               not,  as   we   have  explained  earlier,  entitled  to   insist  on  a 
               disclaimer   in   regard   to   that   word   by   the   respondent.   In 
      


               these circumstances, the trade mark to be compared with 
               that   used   by   the   appellant   is   the   entire   registered   mark 
   



               including the word 'Navaratna'. Even otherwise, as stated in 
               a slightly different context : (Kerly on Trade Marks 8th Edn.

     Pharmaceuticals Laboratories  (supra), I have examined the facts in the

     engaged in the field of imparting higher education.   As contended by the 




                                                           
     plaintiffs,   the   plaintiffs   are   running   various   courses   in   the   faculties   of 
     management,   health   sciences,   hospitality,   culinary,   fashion   designing, 
     financial markets and engineering.  From the material placed on record by 




                                                          
     the plaintiffs, it would reveal that the plaintiffs have registered their mark 
     on   8th  October   1993.     Material   is   placed   on   record   to   show   that   the 
     plaintiffs have  purchased books from  1993.   Material  is also placed on 




                                            
     record to show that the plaintiffs have started PGDBA (MBA) from the 
                          
     year 1992.      Material placed on record would show that name given by 
     the   plaintiffs   to   their   institution   is   "Institute   of   Technology   and 
                         
     Management".    Material on record would also reveal that plaintiff No.1 
     was notified as private university under the provisions of the Chhattisgarh 
     Private Universities Act.     However, it is to be noted that in view of the 
      


     judgment of the Apex Court in the case of  <a href="/doc/564368/" id="a_32">Prof.Yashpal &amp; ors.  v.  State

     and as a consequence of which the universities established under the said 
     Act   including   that   of   plaintiff   No.1   ceased   to   exist.       No   doubt,   the 





     plaintiffs   have   placed   on   record   a   copy   of   the   notification   dated   3 rd 
     February   2012   issued   by   the   Chhattisgarh   Government   under   the 
     provisions   of   Chhattisgarh   Private   Universities   (Establishment   and 





     Operation) Act, 2005 whereby the ITM University has been recognised. 
     The perusal of the said notification would reveal that the said permission 
     has been granted in favour of the ITM University which   is said to have 
     been   registered   on   13th  August   2003   under   the   Firms   and   Societies

     violated.     It has further been held by the Apex Court that when once the  
     use   by   the   defendant   of   the   mark,   which   is   claimed   to   infringe   the 




                                                           
     plaintiffs'   mark,   is   shown   to   be   "in   the   course   of   the   trade"   then,   the 
     question whether there has been any infringement has to be decided by 
     comparison of two marks.     It has been held that where two marks are 




                                             
     identical no further question arises and the case of infringement is made 
                           
     out.   However when two marks are not identical, the plaintiff will have to 
     establish that mark used by the defendant nearly resembles the plaintiff's 
                          
     registered trademark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation 
     to which it has been registered.   As held by the Apex Court, relying on the 
     the observations of Kerly on Trade Marks, 8 th  Edn. in such a case   the 
      


     proper course is to look at the marks as whole and not to disregard the 
   



     parts which are common.

<p id="p_31">     14.             It would also be relevant to refer to the judgment of the Apex 





     Court in the case of <a href="/doc/2044127/" id="a_35">J.R.Kapoor  v.  Micronix India</a>, 1994 PTC 14-260 : 
     1994 SCC-Supp 3 215.  In the said case, the plaintiff who was the owner 
     of   the   registered   trademark   MICRONIX   had   filed   a     suit   against   the 





     defendant   under   the   trade   name   MICROTEL.       The   High   Court     had 
     granted injunction.     In appeal against the order of injunction the Apex 
     Court observed thus:

      descriptive of the micro technology used for production of 




                                                                         
      many electronic goods which daily come to the market, no 
      one   can   claim   monopoly   over   the   use   of   the   said   word. 
</blockquote><p id="p_32">      Anyone producing any product with the use of micro-chip 




                                                
      technology would be justified in using the said word as a 
      prefix to his trade name.   What is further, those who are 
      familiar with the use of electronic goods know fully well 
      and are not  likely to be misguided or confused merely by, 




                                               
      the prefix 'micro' in the trade name.   Once, therefore,  it is 
      held that the word 'micro' is a common or general name 
      descriptive   of   the   products   which   are   sold   or   of   the 
      technology by which the products are manufactured, and 




                                 
      the users of such products are, therefore, not likely to be 
      misguided or confused by the said word, the only question 
               
      which   has   to   be   prima-facie   decided   at   this   stage   is 
      whether the words 'tel' and 'nix' in the trade names of the 
      appellant and the respondent are deceptive for the buyers 
              
      and users and are likely to misguide or confuse them in 
      purchasing   one   for   the   other.       According   to   us, 
      phonetically   the   words   being   totally   dissimilar   are   not 
      going to create any such confusion in the mind of the users. 
</p>      

<p id="p_33">      Secondly, even the visual impression of the said two trade 
      names is different.     In the first instance, the respondent's 
   



      trade name 'MICRONIX' is in black and white in slimmer 
      letters   and   they   are   ensconced   in     designs   of   elongated 
      triangles both above and below the said name.     On the 
      other  hand, the  appellant's trade name  'MICROTEL' is in 





      thick bold letters in red colour without any design around. 
      As regards the logo, the  respondent's logo consists  of the 
      word 'M' in a slim letter with 'I' sporting a dot on it and 
      drawn in the well of 'M'.     Below the  letter 'M' in  small 
      letters is written word 'MICRONIX' and all these letters and 





      words   are     wrriten   in   white   in   a   black   square   in   north-
      south direction.   As against this, the appellant's logo is one 
      letter, vi?.., 'M' which is drawn in bold board letter with its 
      left   leg   sllimmer   than   all   other   parts   which   are   in   thick 
      board brush.   The letter has also white lines drawn across 
      it which is in blue colour.   There is no other letter nor is it

      set against any background.    We are, therefore, unable to 
      see how the visual effect of both the logos will be the same 




                                                                       
      on the mind of the buyers.   This being the case, we are of 
      the view that there is no even the remotest chance of the 
      buyers and users being misguided or confused by the two

      mentioned words "For Colour/Black and While TVs and FM

      the   said   words   are   written   by   both   the   parties   on   their

      respondent-plaintiff's   carton   is   in   black   and   white   the 
      appellant's carton is fully in colour.

     It can, thus, be seen that the defendants' trademark uses the words "itm

     of  the trademark which is used by the defendants.   Whereas in one of the

     is printed as "ITM UNIVERSITY" but in bigger font alphabets IHMCT are 
     printed and, that too, combined with the words "INSTITUTE OF HOTEL 
                        
     MANAGEMENT &amp; CATERING TECHNOLOGY".   Perusal of the registration 
     of the plaintiffs' mark   dated 11 th October 2006 (page 192 of the plaint) 
     would reveal that mark, in fact, is registered in the name of "itm-IHMCT".

<p id="p_48">     From the perusal   of the aforesaid oobservations of the Apex Court it is 
     clear   that   when   a   distinctive   label   is   registered   as   a   whole,   such 
     registeration would not give any exclusive statutory right to the Proprietor 




                                                           
     of the Trade mark to the use of any particular word or name contained 
     therein apart from the mark as a whole.   I have already reproduced the 
     trade   mark   as   a   whole   which   have   been   registered   in   favour   of   the 




                                             
     plaintiff.       It   can   be   seen   that   in   the   first   mark   only   words   ITM   are 
                           
     common   with   words   used   in   the   mark   of   the   defendaants   whereas 
     insofaras  the  second  mark is  concerned,  words ITM   and  University  are 
                          
     common   in   the   trade   mark   of   the   plaintiff   and   that   of   the   defendant. 
     However, as held by the Apex Court the Registration of mark as a whole 
     would not confer any statutory right in favour of the plaintiff with respect 
      


     to parts of words used in  a mark which is registered as a whole.   In that 
   



     view of the matter, I find that merely because the Alphabets ITM which is 
     used   in   both   the   registered   trade   marks   of   the   plaintiff   and   word 
     University which is used in the second trade makr of the plaintiff are also 





     found in the defendant's trade mark, cannot be a ground to hold that a 
     prima-facie   case   is   made   out   by   the   plaintiff   for   infringement   of   its 
     statutory rights.

     have to be construed in the course of the trade.     As already discussed 
     hereinabove, I find that there is no similarity in the marks used by the 




                                                                                   
     plaintiffs and that of defendants.   In that view of the matter and in view 




                                                           
     of law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of   <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_39">Durga Dutt Sharma  
     v.  Navararatna Pharmaceuticals Laboratories</a> (supra)  it will be for the 
     plaintiffs to establish that the mark used by the defendants is so nearly 




                                                          
     resembling the plaintiff's' registered trademark as is likely to deceive or 
     cause   confusion   in   relation   to   the   services   in   respect   of   which   it   is 
     registered.       On   visual   comparison   of   the   marks   of   both   plaintiffs   and 




                                            
     defendants, I prima facie find that it cannot be said that the mark used by 
                          
     the defendants is of such a nature which can deceive or cause confusion. 
     As held by the Apex Court in the aforesaid case,  the persons who would 
                         
     be deceived are the purchasers of the goods or services and it is likelihood 
     of their being deceived would be the subject of consideration.

     Hiralal Prabhudas    (supra), some of the factors which are to be taken 
     into consideration are nature of the commodity; class of purchasers; mode 
     of purchase; and other surrounding circumstances.     Undisputedly, both 





     the   plaintiffs   and   the   defendants   are   catering   to   the   educated   classes, 
     inasmuch as both of them are running courses for higher education.   As 
     held by the Apex Court in the case of  <a href="/doc/507033/" id="a_40">Khoday Distilleries Ltd.  v.  Scotch

     similarities in the marks of the plaintiff and defendant, it is difficult to 
     believe that in the present era, the students seeking admission for higher 




                                                                                  
     education     would   be   confused   or   deceived   by   any   similarities   in   the 




                                                          
     trademarks of the plaintiffs and the defendants.   The students who are 
     seeking   higher   education,   who   are   required   to   make   investment   of   a 
     substantial amount for their higher studies, are bound to make enquiries 




                                                         
     regarding   credentials   of   the   institutes   concerned.       In   today's   era   of 
     advanced technology, the information of the institutes is easily available 
     on the internet.     The students before taking decision would apply their 




                                           
     mind   to   the   suitability   of   the   institute   on   the   basis   of   information 
                          
     available, since it will be an important decision pertaining to their career. 
     In   this  background   it   is  difficult  to   believe   that  the   students   would   be 
                         
     misguided or confused by the trademark either of the plaintiffs or of the 
     defendants.

<p id="p_51">     20.              It is, however, pertinent to note that both the plaintiffs as 
   



     well as the defendnats have applied for registration of trademarks in the 
     name of "ITM University".   The application of the plaintiffs is of 22 nd June 
     2010 whereas that of the defendnats is of 1 st April 2010.   It is, thus, clear 





     that   the   defendants'   application   for   registration   for   "ITM   University"   is 
     prior to that of the plaintiffs.  If the plaintiffs are of the opinion that they 
     are absolute owners of the trademark ITM and, such, defendants cannot 





     use the trademark ITM University, then there was no necessity on behalf of 
     the plaintffs to make an application for registration of the trademark in 
     the name of "ITM University".

     notice the adverse newsreports pertaining to the defendants, is also totally 
     unbelievable.   The courses conducted by the defendant are duly approved 
     by AICTE for a period of not less than a decade.   It is well known that list

     and all at least in the same field.  The plaintiffs are also in the education 
     field   and   it   is,   therefore,   difficult   to   believe   that   though   defendants' 




                                             
     courses are duly approved by AICTE for a period of more than a decade 
                          
     the plaintiffs were not aware of the existence of the defendant.    Since I 
     find that there is no similarity in the trademarks of the plaintiffs and the 
                         
     defendants and, in any case, no such similarity which would deceive or 
     create confusion in the mind of the users of the services rendered by the 
     plaintiffs and the defendants, I am of the considered view that plaintiffs 
      


     have failed to make out a prima-facie case.

     using   the   trademark   which   is   derived   from   common   generic   and 
     descriptive trade or service in which the user of the trademark is engaged 
     in.   At the same time I do not  think it necessary to go into the question 





     raised by the defendants as to whether plaintiff No.1 is an university or

     Chhattisgarh   dated   3rd  February   2001,   the   plaintiff   No.1   is   not   a   trust

<p id="p_55">     23.            I am aware about the law laid down by this Court that once a 
     case   of   infringement   of   trademark   is   made   out   the   factors   regarding 
     balance of convenience and irreparable injury would not be germane.  As 




                                                         
     already discussed hereinabove I have held that theer are no similarities in 
     the   registered   trademark   of   the   plaintiffs   and   trademark   used   by   the 
     defendants.     In tht view of the matter, I find that the consideration of 




                                            
     balance of convenience and irreparable injury would also be relevant in 
                          
     the   present   matter.       As   already   stated   hereinabove,   more   than   7,000 
     students are taking education in various institutes run by the defendants.

     defendant university is established under the Haryana Private Universities 
      


     Act  and,  if   any  injunction   as sought  is  granted,  it  would  prejudice  the 
   



     career of the students who are bonafide taking  education in the institutes 
     which are  duly approved by various competent  authorities.    As against 
     this, if injunction is not granted, the plaintiffs can always be compensated 





     in   the   monetary   terms,   if   they   establish   that   due   to   the   use   of   the 
     impugned trademark by the defendants they have sustained any damages. 
     In any case, the perusal of the advertisements issued by the defendants 





     clearly state " We have no other branch or campus in India".     It is thus  
     clear that the defendants have themselves declaeered   that they do not 
     have any sort of relationship with the educational institute having similar 
     name.  As such the interest of the plaintiff is sufficiently safeguarded.
