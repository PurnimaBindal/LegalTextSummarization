                              opinion of the State as well as that of the
                              University. The concerned department of the
                              State and the affiliating university have a
                              role to play, but it is limited in its
                              application. They cannot lay down any
                              guidelines or policies in conflict with the
                              Central statute or the standards laid down by
                              the Central body. The State can frame its
                              policies, but such policy again has to be in
                              conformity with the direction issued by the
                              Central body. Though there is no such
                              apparent conflict in the present case, yet it
                              needs to be clarified that grant of approval
                              by the State and affiliation by the University
                              for increased intake of seats or
                              commencement of new college should not be
                              repugnant      to     the    conditions     of
                              approval/recommendation granted by the
                              AICTE. These authorities have to work in
                              tandem as all of them have the common
                              object to ensure maintenance of proper
                              standards of education, examination and
                              proper infrastructure for betterment of

                          University. We are unable to accept this submission
                          inasmuch as the power to increase the intake also
                          includes the power to decrease the intake capacity.
                          The power to do on general principles also includes
                          the power to undo, whatever power is being
                          exercised under the 1987 Act. We, therefore, find it

                          difficult to read a parallel exercise of power in the
                          hands of the University in the matter of reduction,
                          which is only available to the extent of pointing out
                          deficiencies to the AICTE for taking appropriate
                          action in terms of the judgment in the case of
                          Parshvanath Charitable Trust (supra), that too even

                          line as provided therein. In the instant case, even if
                          the deficiencies have been located and have been
                          reported during the pendency of this proceeding, the
                          same would be relevant for the purpose of coming

                          would desire to take in the light of the deficiencies

                          present case, we find that this information which has
                          been tendered by the University, according to the
                          AICTE, was after the cut-off date as prescribed in

                          AICTE, on inspection of the Ist petitioner
                          college reported that the Ist petitioner
                          college fulfils all the conditions prescribed
                          by the norms and standards laid down by
                          AICTE. The respondents did not make any
                          specific assertion that such a report of the
                          AICTE is factually incorrect. Assuming for
                          the sake of argument that, in the opinion of
                          the respondents, the petitioner college has
                          not in fact fulfilled any one of the conditions
                          required under the norms specified by the
                          AICTE, the only course of action available
                          for the respondents is to bring the
                          shortcomings noticed by them to the notice of
                          the AICTE and seek appropriate action

                          the decision of the respondent not to grant
                          the affiliation to the first petitioner college is
                          wholly untenable and is required to be set
                          aside. The same is accordingly set aside.
                          Since the respondent did not decline the

                          the norms stipulated by the respondent

                          prescribed by the respondents is not being

                          possible for us now to be persuaded by the
                          observations made by the Division Bench in the case
                          of Trichy Engineering College (supra), in paragraph
                          34 to 38 thereof. A careful reading of paragraph 20
                          in the judgment in the case of Parshvanath
                          Charitable Trust (supra) would also indicate that the
                          Apex Court has observed that the role of AICTE vis-
                          a-vis the Universities is only advisory,
                          recommendatory and one of providing guidance,
                          thereby subserving the cause of maintaining
                          appropriate standards and qualitative norms and not
                          as an authority empowered to issue and enforce any
                          sanctions by itself. We find these observations to be
                          weighing enough to grant sufficient authority to the
                          University to take appropriate action in the event
                          any such deficiency is found, but the route and the
                          process of taking such action has to be through the
                          AICTE itself by tendering appropriate information
                          timely and for taking action by the AICTE. We may,
                          therefore, also observe that the AICTE, upon
                          receiving such information, shall be bound to
                          consider and pass appropriate orders and not shelve
                          the issue by avoiding to take action on a report
                          submitted by the University, as it would directly
                          affect the affiliation of the University, the running of
                          the courses and also importantly the fate of the
                          students, who are to be admitted against such
                          courses. We hope and trust that the University and
                          the AICTE will act in coalition and coordination in
                          future in order to ensure that timely action is taken
                          for the purpose of deciding the running of the

                          that the Anna University has over-reached its authority
                          and has assumed the powers over the areas which are

                      strength available in the petitioner – Institutions / Colleges. Instead, the

                      Anna University has proceeded to withdraw the Affiliation on the ground of

                      deficiency in Faculty members. It is clear from the above order that the

                      Anna University cannot take any decision in areas which falls within the

                      exclusive domain of the AICTE and the Regulation relied upon by the Anna

                      Letters have been issued without putting the petitioner – Institutions /

                      Colleges on notice and calling for their explanation. The impugned Letters

                      had serious civil consequences and the Anna University ought not to have

                      opportunity to the petitioner – Institutions / Colleges. Apart from the lack

                      within the jurisdiction of the AICTE, the impugned Letters of Anna

                      University is also bad since it violates principles of natural justice.

<p id="p_76">                            16     The AICTE after receiving the communication from the Anna

                      University ought to have independently conducted an inspection.                 The

                      AICTE cannot piggy back on the Report of the Anna University and take a

                      decision to bring the petitioner – Institution / College in WP.Nos.10280 &amp;

                      10353 of 2020 under ''No Admission'' category. This is more so due to the

                      fact that the AICTE did not find any deficiency on any front while

                      considering the continuation of the approval for the petitioner – Institutions

                      / Colleges during the Academic Year 2020-21. The AICTE ought to have

                      put the petitioner – Institution / College in WP.Nos.10280 &amp; 10353 of 2020

                      on notice and conducted an independent inspection before coming to a

                      conclusion as to whether the petitioner – Institution / College should be

                      placed under ''No Admission'' category. Therefore, the order passed by the

                      AICTE which is the subject matter of challenge in WP.No.10353 of 2020

                      also suffers from illegality since it was passed without following the

                      principles of natural justice.
