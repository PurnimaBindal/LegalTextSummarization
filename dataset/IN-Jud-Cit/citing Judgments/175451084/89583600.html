                          &#x27;Times Defence&#x27; and &#x27;Times Teaching&#x27;, thereby causing confusion amongst
                          the general public, amounting to infringement of Plaintiff&#x27;s registered
                          trademarks under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_2">Section 29</a> of the Act. Defendant is engaged in a

                          adopted the impugned trademarks to gain unfair advantage of Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          immense reputation and cleverly pass off its services as that of the Plaintiff.
                          The end-users of the services of the Defendant, who are primarily aspiring
                          students, are likely to be confused that Defendant is a branch of or is in
                          some manner associated/affiliated with the Plaintiff. The fact that
                          Defendant&#x27;s coaching services are online does not lessen the likelihood of
                          confusion between the two competing marks for two reasons viz.

                          loss and tarnishment of Plaintiff&#x27;s image in public. Even assuming that

                          examinations. Through uninterrupted and continuous usage of the
                          trademarks, the same have come to be exclusively associated with the
                          Plaintiff and none else. Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks denote quality study material
                          and educational services and have become synonymous with a high degree
                          of excellence. The services offered by the Plaintiff under the various
                          trademarks of which T.I.M.E. is a dominant part and has acquired
                          distinctiveness, have come to be known and recognized in the trade circles
                          in a short span of time. The huge reputation and goodwill earned by the
                          Plaintiff is evident from the annual turnover in the last 9 years, more
                          particularly, from 2015 onwards, when the brand turnover has been over
                          Rs. 300 crores. Plaintiff has been vigilant in protecting its rights in the

                          trademark/trade name for provision of identical services, particularly, when
                          it is not the Defendant&#x27;s case that it was unaware of Plaintiff&#x27;s tuition/

                          would show that Defendant has adopted and copied the prominent and
                          essential feature of Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark, i.e., &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27;, which is distinctive

                          Plaintiff, Ms. Rajeshwari H., learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
                          Defendant, at the outset, submitted that during the pendency of the suit,
                          Defendant has adopted the trademark &#x27;FUTURE TIMES COACHING
                          CENTRE&#x27;, which is dissimilar to Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks and Defendant
                          undertakes to use only the newly adopted trademarks, in future. Since
                          Defendant is no longer using the Trademark TIMES COACHING
                          CENTRE, no relief can be claimed in the suit and the injunction application
                          deserves to be dismissed on this ground alone.

                          not the registered proprietor of the trademarks TIME or TIMES.
                          Significantly, in 2003 Plaintiff was using the trademark TIMES when,
                          TIME Inc. an Institute in USA filed a suit being CS(OS) 1389/2003 against
                          the Plaintiff. The suit was settled and Plaintiff agreed not to use the
                          trademark/word TIME and to use &#x27;T.I.M.E&#x27; in conjunction with the name of
                          its Institute, i.e., Triumphant Institute of Management Education. Plaintiff
                          has thus given up all rights to the trademark TIME, as the settlement binds
                          the Plaintiff and operates as an estoppel not only against the parties to the
                          settlement but also qua Plaintiff&#x27;s rights against all third parties. Plaintiff

                           cannot thus assert that TIMES is deceptively similar to T.I.M.E. Reliance is

</p><p id="p_19">                          15.   It was contended that Plaintiff does not have registrations in the
                          trademarks TIME or TIMES and over the years, Plaintiff has not even
                          endeavoured to apply for the same. In the absence of registration in the
                          words TIME/TIMES, mere registrations in the device marks as a whole, will
                          not confer the right to exclusivity/monopoly over part of the trademark, i.e.,
                          T.I.M.E. Plaintiff has cleverly drafted the plaint, particularly para 7, to
                          create a wrong and false impression that it is the proprietor of
                          the mark T.I.M.E. instead of T.I.M.E. - TRIUMPHANT INSTITUTE OF

                          a trademark consists of several matters, its registration shall confer on the
                          proprietor exclusive right to use of the trademark taken as a whole. <a href="/doc/1322502/" id="a_8">Section
                          17(2)(a)(ii)</a> of the Act further provides that when a trademark contains any
                          part which is not separately registered as the trademark, the registration
                          thereof shall not confer any exclusive right in the matter forming only a part
                          of the whole of the trademark so registered. Therefore, the attempt to dissect
                          the word T.I.M.E. from the whole trademark and compare it with the
                          impugned trademark alleging deceptive similarity, is impermissible in law.

</p><p id="p_21">                          17.   It was next contended that the trademark TIMES is common to trade
                          and there are several entities who have been using TIMES, with or without
                          suffix/prefix, such as TIMES by Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd. since 1992;
                          TIMES ACADEMY - R.P. Sharad since 1996; TIMES - Kamlesh Harjani
                          since 1984; TIMES PUBLISHING HOUSE - Times Publishing House since
                          1984; and TIMES CENTRE OF MEDIA STUDIES - Bennett, Coleman &amp;
                          Co. Ltd. since 1989. TIME is generic word with a dictionary meaning and
                          being non-distinctive, cannot be monopolized by the Plaintiff. It is a settled
                          position in law that trademarks which are generic and common to trade are
                          weak marks and not entitled to protection under the Act.
</p><p id="p_22">                          18.   It was further contended that Plaintiff&#x27;s and Defendant&#x27;s trademarks
                          are dissimilar. Plaintiff uses the word T.I.M.E. as an acronym, as a part of its
                          trademarks T.I.M.E. - TRIUMPHANT INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT
                          EDUCATION, in a peculiar style, with gaps and dots, which is clearly
                          distinct from Defendant&#x27;s user of &#x27;TIMES&#x27;, both in the earlier trademark and
                          the changed trademark &#x27;FUTURE TIMES COACHING CENTRE&#x27;. Rival
                          trademarks are thus visually, structurally and phonetically different.
                          Additionally, respective parties operate in different spheres and fields.
                          Plaintiff has been providing coaching in Management courses for the past
                          several years and is a new entrant in SSC and Bank Exams, which is evident
                          from the documents filed by the Plaintiff, more particularly, the order dated
                          17.08.2009, passed by this Court and the judgment dated 30.04.2014, in
                          CS(OS) 664/2013, wherein Plaintiff&#x27;s Director had stated that Plaintiff

                           the newspaper articles filed by the Plaintiff also demonstrate their ability to
                          provide training in Management courses only. Compared and contrasted
                          with this, Defendant is a bona fide user of its trademarks, continuously and
                          exclusively since 2018-19, with respect to coaching services for SSC and
                          Bank PO Exam to aspirants in Tier-II and III cities and there is no likelihood
                          of confusion amongst the class of consumers. In any case, the target
                          consumers are students who will search and apply their mind before
                          investing money in a coaching centre and no student would be confused into
                          believing that Defendant&#x27;s coaching centre has any association with the
                          Plaintiff. Reliance was placed on the judgment in <a href="/doc/1012570/" id="a_11">J.K. Oil Industries v.
                          Adani Wilmar Limited</a>, 2010 SCC OnLine Del 586, to contend that
                          identity/similarity of registered trademark with the impugned mark is a sine
                          qua non for a claim for infringement. It was also strenuously urged that
                          Defendant operates in its own specialised field and has no intent to
                          misrepresent and/or encash on Plaintiff&#x27;s reputation and the trademarks
                          being dissimilar, no case of passing off is made out against the Defendant.
</p><p id="p_23">                          19.   Learned counsel distinguished the judgments relied on behalf of the
                          Plaintiff. It was submitted that in M/s Kirorimal Kashiram Marketing &amp;
                          Agencies Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the competing marks were &#x27;DOUBLE DEER&#x27;
                          and &#x27;GOLDEN DEER&#x27;, which were deceptively similar, however, the
                          competing trademarks in the present case are dissimilar and the mischief lies
                          in comparing the word TIMES, dissecting the same from the whole
                          trademark in which the Plaintiff has registration. In Max Healthcare
                          Institute Limited (supra), the mark of the Plaintiff was &#x27;MAX/MAX
                          HOSPITAL&#x27; whereas the impugned mark was &#x27;MAX CURE&#x27;. It was held
                          that MAX is not an abbreviation in English language and was distinctive.

                           Quite apart, in the present case, TIMES is a dictionary and generic word and
                          Defendant is not using T.I.M.E. but FUTURE TIMES. The judgment in
                          V Guard Industries Ltd. (supra) does not assist the Plaintiff since the
                          essential feature, if any, of its trademark (device) is T.I.M.E. and not
                          TIMES.
</p><p id="p_25">                          20.   Arguing in rejoinder, learned counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that
                          the Settlement Agreement entered into between the Plaintiff and TIME Inc.
                          has no relevance to the present suit for infringement and passing off, as the
                          Agreement merely identified the manner of Plaintiff&#x27;s use from a visual
                          perspective, so as to distinguish it from TIME Inc. and does not prevent the
                          Plaintiff from phonetically referring to it as TIME or from restraining third
                          parties from using trademarks deceptively similar to the prominent and
                          essential feature of its trademark, i.e., T.I.M.E., especially with respect to
                          identical/similar services. This is supported by the fact that Settlement
                          Agreement has no condition or restriction and there is no entry in the
                          Register of Trade Marks, limiting the scope of Plaintiff&#x27;s rights in its
                          registered trademarks. It is natural that the general public would continue to
                          phonetically refer to Plaintiff&#x27;s mark as TIME.
</p><p id="p_26">                          21.   It was argued that the defence of <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_12">Section 17</a> of the Act is unavailable
                          to the Defendant, inasmuch as Plaintiff also has registrations over the word
                          mark T.I.M.E. TUTIONS. It was reiterated that the principle of &#x27;anti-
                          dissection&#x27; and identification of &#x27;dominant mark&#x27; are not antithetical to one
                          another and rather complement each other as held in several judgments. In
                          any case, it is a well-settled principle that defence under <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_13">Section 17</a> of the
                          Act is not available to a party who infringes the prominent part of another

                          the Defendant to claim non-infringement and absolve itself and that too,
                          without showing substantial use of such alleged infringers, which would
                          pose a threat to the distinctiveness of Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks. Courts have
                          time and again held that a registered proprietor of a trademark is not

                          Defendant that the trademarks TIME/TIMES are generic, it was contended
                          that the Defendant having itself applied for registration of the trademark
                          TIMES COACHING CENTRE cannot claim that the said words are generic.
                          Moreover, the word T.I.M.E. has acquired distinctiveness because of the
                          long, extensive and uninterrupted user as a part of Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks and
                          is exclusively associated with the Plaintiff&#x27;s coaching Institutes.

                          submissions dated 08.06.2022 and also argued during the course of hearings.
                          An undertaking was also given that Defendant shall henceforth run its
                          Institute under the newly adopted trademarks. Learned counsel for the
                          Plaintiff had resisted this stand on the ground that Defendant continues to
                          use the word &#x27;TIMES&#x27; for its services and displays the same prominently on
                          its websites etc. and the newly adopted trademark &#x27;FUTURE TIMES
                          COACHING CENTRE&#x27; is deceptively similar to Plaintiff&#x27;s registered
                          trademarks, as the essential part of the trademark T.I.M.E. continues to
                          be a part of Defendant&#x27;s trademarks. Mere addition of &#x27;FUTURE&#x27; is
                          inconsequential, according to the Plaintiff.

                          registered whereas the impugned trademarks are unregistered. Being a
                          registered proprietor of the trademarks, Plaintiff is entitled to use the same
                          exclusively as well as to protect them from infringement by third parties

                          a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a
                          trademark which because of its identity with or similarity to the registered

                          registered trademark, is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public or
                          likely to have an association with the registered trademark. Therefore, the
                          first issue that pronouncedly emanates is if the competing trademarks can be

</blockquote><p id="p_31">                           26.   In view of the categorical stand of the Defendant that it has adopted
                          the trademark FUTURE TIMES COACHING CENTRE and would continue
                          to do so in future, it is to be first seen if this singular factor is sufficient to
                          dismiss the claim of the Plaintiff for injunction, keeping in backdrop that
                          Plaintiff contends that Defendant continues to use the word &#x27;Times&#x27;
                          prominently not only as a part of the changed mark, but also standalone, as
                          well as the relief sought in the plaint for injunction against any mark which
                          is deceptively similar to Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks. In my view, the points
                          adumbrated by the Plaintiff would require consideration.
</p><p id="p_32">                          27.   Two vexed questions arise at this stage: (a) whether T.I.M.E is an
                          essential and dominant part of Plaintiff&#x27;s marks; and (b) whether FUTURE
                          TIMES COACHING CENTRE is prima facie deceptively similar to the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademarks.
</p><p id="p_33">                          28.    In the context of determining similarity of trademarks, in an action
                          for infringement, the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_18">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma
                          v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>, AIR 1965 SC 980, observed as
                          follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                &quot;29. When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is

                                course of trade&quot;, the question whether there has been an
                                infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two marks.
                                Where the two marks are identical no further questions arise;</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">                                for then the infringement is made out. When the two marks are
                                not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark
                                used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff&#x27;s

                                 registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion
                                and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered
                                (Vide <a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_19">Section 21</a>). A point has sometimes been raised as to
                                whether the words &quot;or cause confusion&quot; introduce any element
                                which is not already covered by the words &quot;likely to deceive&quot;
                                and it has sometimes been answered by saying that it is merely
                                an extension of the earlier test and does not add very materially
                                to the concept indicated by the earlier words &quot;likely to
                                deceive&quot;. But this apart, as the question arises in an action for
                                infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that
                                the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of trade in
                                the goods in respect of which his mark is registered, is
                                deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be ascertained by a
                                comparison of the two marks -- the degree of resemblance
                                which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable
                                of definition by laying down objective standards. The persons
                                who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the
                                goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the
                                subject of consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic,
                                visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff&#x27;s mark.
                                The purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the
                                essential features of the plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark are to be found in
                                that used by the defendant. The identification of the essential
                                features of the mark is in essence a question of fact and depends
                                on the judgment of the Court based on the evidence led before it
                                as regards the usage of the trade. It should, however, be borne
                                in mind that the object of the enquiry in ultimate analysis is
                                whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is
                                deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the
                                plaintiff.&quot;

                                the goods of the respective owners of the marks. If, considering
                                all those circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there
                                will be a confusion, that is to say, not necessarily that one man
                                will be injured and the other will gain illicit benefit, but that
                                there will be a confusion in the mind of the public which will
                                lead to confusion in the goods -- then you may refuse the

                          are deceptively similar, it would be pertinent to address the contention raised
                          by the Defendant that Plaintiff cannot assert an exclusive right on T.I.M.E.
                          since it has registration for the device mark as a whole. According to the
                          Defendant, Plaintiff holds proprietary rights in the trademarks T.I.M.E. -

                          would have to be read as a whole and Plaintiff is not entitled to dissect the

                          corresponding parts in the impugned trademarks, to allege likelihood of
                          confusion. This plea is predicated on the provisions of <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_22">Section 17</a> of the Act.
                          Coupled with the said contention is another argument that the words
                          &#x27;TIME/TIMES&#x27; are generic and non-distinctive in character and cannot be
                          monopolized by the Plaintiff, to sue the Defendant for infringement.
</p><p id="p_38">                          32.   This contention of the Defendant, according to this Court, is
                          misconceived, in view of the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court
                          in <a href="/doc/42490190/" id="a_23">M/s. South India Beverages Pvt. Ltd. v. General Mills Marketing Inc. &amp;
                          Anr</a>., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1953, which is a complete answer. The
                          controversy before the Division Bench was with respect to the two
                          competing marks being &#x27;HAAGEN DAZS&#x27; of the Plaintiff, in respect of
                          ice-creams and frozen yogurts and the trademark &quot;D&#x27;DAAZS&quot; in respect of
                          ice-creams and frozen desserts. The Court, laying stress on the anti-
                          dissection rule, observed that the rule mandated that Courts while dealing
                          with cases of trademark infringement involving composite marks, must
                          consider them in their entirety rather than truncating or dissecting them into

                           component parts and making comparison with the corresponding parts of the
                          rival trademarks, to determine likelihood of confusion, raison d&#x27;etre,
                          underscoring the said principle being that commercial impression of a
                          composite trademark on an ordinary prospective buyer is created by the
                          trademark as a whole and not by its component parts. Having so observed,
                          the Court further noted that it needs no reiteration that while the trademark is
                          to be considered in entirety, yet it is permissible to accord more or less
                          importance or &#x27;dominance&#x27; to a particular portion or element of a trademark
                          in cases of composite marks. Some of the observations of the Division
                          Bench relevant to the present case are as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                &quot;21. The view of the author makes it scintillatingly clear,
                                beyond pale of doubt, that the principle of &#x27;anti dissection&#x27; does
                                not impose an absolute embargo upon the consideration of the
                                constituent elements of a composite mark. The said elements
                                may be viewed as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate
                                determination of probable customer reaction to the conflicting
                                composites as a whole. Thus, the principle of &#x27;anti-dissection&#x27;
                                and identification of &#x27;dominant mark&#x27; are not antithetical to one
                                another and if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said
                                principles rather compliment each other.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                23. It is also settled that while a trademark is supposed to be
                                looked at in entirety, yet the consideration of a trademark as a
                                whole does not condone infringement where less than the entire
                                trademark is appropriated. It is therefore not improper to
                                identify elements or features of the marks that are more or less
                                important for purpose of analysis in cases of composite marks.</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">                                24. In this regard we may fortify our conclusion by take note of
                                the decision reported as 405 F. Supp. 530 (1975) Eaton Allen
                                Corp. v. Paco Impressions Corp. The facts of the said case
                                reveal that the plaintiff manufactured coated paper under the
                                registered trademark &#x27;Super-Ko-Rec-Type&#x27;. The defendant

                                 manufactured and advertised a similar product under the mark
                                &#x27;Super Type&#x27; and &#x27;Super Type-7&#x27;. The defendant contended that
                                the only similarity between the said marks was use of the words
                                &#x27;Super&#x27; and &#x27;Type&#x27;, terms which were neither significant parts
                                of the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark nor protectable as a
                                matter of law. The court held that the consideration of a
                                trademark as a whole does not preclude infringement where
                                less than the entire trademark is appropriated.
</p><p id="p_40">                                25. Therefore, the submission of the appellant-defendant
                                predicated upon the principle of &#x27;anti-dissection&#x27; that action for
                                infringement would not lie since use of the word &#x27;D&#x27;DAAZS&#x27;
                                does not result in complete appropriation of the respondent-
                                plaintiff&#x27;s mark &#x27;HAAGEN DAZS&#x27;, which is to be viewed as an
                                indivisible whole, is liable to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_41">                                26. Dominant features are significant because they attract
                                attention and consumers are more likely to remember and rely
                                on them for purposes of identification of the product. Usually,
                                the dominant portion of a mark is that which has the greater
                                strength or carries more weight. Descriptive or generic
                                components, having little or no source identifying significance,
                                are generally less significant in the analysis. However, words
                                that are arbitrary and distinct possess greater strength and are
                                thus accorded greater protection.[174 F. Supp. 2d 718, 725

</p><p id="p_42">                                27. It would be pertinent to recollect that in the present case,
                                the mark of the respondent-plaintiff-&#x27;HAAGEN DAZS&#x27;, is a
                                unique combination of Danish-sounding words, which have no
                                recognised meaning whatsoever in any language or etymology.
                                Evidently, the owner of the mark coined these arbitrary words
                                in order to make its brand name sound original or unique.

                                a high degree of phonetic similarity between the mark of

                          Bench of this Court in United Biotech Pvt. Ltd. (supra), wherein the
                          registered trademark of the Appellant was &#x27;FORZID&#x27; in class 05 and
                          Respondent filed application for removal of the mark, on the ground that it
                          was deceptively similar to an earlier registered trademark &#x27;ORZID&#x27;, (label
                          mark), registered in the name of Respondent No. 1 therein, in class 05.
                          The IPAB allowed the rectification application and the learned Single Judge
                          dismissed the writ petition, challenging the said order. In an intra-court
                          Appeal filed by the Appellant, the principal argument of the Appellant was
                          that Respondents&#x27; assertion of statutory right in the word &#x27;ORZID&#x27; was
                          contrary to provisions of <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_24">Section 17</a> of the Act, which bestow no right on
                          part of the registered trademark. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme
                          Court in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_25">Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel and
                          Others</a>, AIR 2006 SC 3304, the Division Bench held that though &#x27;ORZID&#x27;
                          was a label mark, the word &#x27;ORZID&#x27; contained therein was worthy of
                          protection. Para 26 of the judgment in United Biotech Pvt. Ltd. (supra), is
                          as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                &quot;26. We find that the learned Single Judge rightly held that
                                when a label mark is registered, it cannot be said that the word
                                mark contained therein is not registered. We, thus, are of the
                                opinion that although the word &quot;ORZID&quot; is a label mark, the
                                word &quot;ORZID&quot; contained therein is also worthy of protection.
                                The learned Single Judge has rightly observed that the
                                judgment of the Supreme Court in Ramdev Food Products
                                Ltd. (supra) is the complete answer. This aspect is considered
                                and the argument of the appellant is rejected in the following

                                    in <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_26">Ramdev Food Products Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai
                                    Patel</a>, (2006) 8 SCC 726 : AIR 2006 SC 3304 is a
                                    complete answer. The Court there referred to an earlier
                                    decision in <a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_27">Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok Chandra
                                    Rakhit</a>, AIR 1955 SC 558, which concerned the
                                    proprietory mark &#x27;Shree&#x27; which formed part of the device
                                    as a whole and was an important feature of the device.
                                    The Supreme Court observed that registration of a trade
                                    mark as a whole would give the proprietor &quot;a right to the
                                    exclusive use of word &#x27;Shree&#x27; as if separately and by
                                    itself.&quot; Therefore it would not be correct for UBPL to
                                    contend that the registration held by OCPL does not
                                    cover the word mark ORZID.&quot;&quot;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                          34.   Apposite it would be to refer to another judgment of this Court in
                          <a href="/doc/175451084/" id="a_28">Himalaya Drug Co. v. S.B.L. Ltd</a>., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 5701, wherein
                          the Court elucidated on the &#x27;essential and prominent&#x27; features of the
                          trademark for the purpose of determining disputes relating to infringement
                          of trademark and I quote the relevant passages as follows:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                                &quot;44. The courts have propounded the doctrine of prominent and
                                essential feature of the trade mark for the purposes of
                                adjudication of the disputes relating to infringement of trade
                                mark. While deciding the question of infringement, the court
                                has to see the prominent or the dominant feature of the trade
                                mark. Even the learned single judge agrees to this proposition
                                when the learned judge quotes McCarthy on Trade Marks that
                                all composite marks are to be compared as whole. However, it
                                is dependent on case to case to basis as a matter of jury
                                question as to what can be the possible broad and essential
                                feature of the trade mark in question.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                45. It is settled law that where the defendant&#x27;s mark contains the

                                matter, the correct approach for the court is to identify an

                                 judgment and burden of the evidence that is placed before the
                                Court&quot;. In order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is
                                deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features
                                of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side
                                by side to find out if there are differences, rather overall
                                similarity has to be judged. While judging the question as to
                                whether the defendant has infringed the trade mark or not, the
                                court has to consider the overall impression of the mark in the
                                minds of general public and not by merely comparing the
                                dissimilarities in the two marks.

                                ocular test alone but if a word forming part of the mark has
                                come in trade to be used to identify the goods of the owner of
                                the trade mark, it is an infringement of the mark itself to use
                                that word as the mark or part of the mark of another trader for
                                which confusion is likely to result. The likelihood of confusion
                                or deception in such cases is not disproved by placing the two
                                marks side by side and demonstrating how small is the chance

                                observe that in most persons the eye is not an accurate recorder
                                of visual detail and that marks are remembered rather by

                           held by the Division Bench, principle of anti-dissection and identification of
                          &#x27;dominant mark&#x27; are not antithetical to one another and viewed holistically,
                          they complement each other. Examining the device mark of the Plaintiff,
                          this Court is of the prima facie view that the acronym &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27; is a
                          dominant part and essential feature of the device mark of the Plaintiff and it
                          can assert a right on its exclusive use, based on registration in the device
                          mark as a whole. This prima facie conclusion stems from visually looking at
                          the trademark, i.e., the lettering style, its disposition, font size, colour and
                          the placement.
</p><p id="p_50">                          36.   It is now to be seen if the impugned trademarks are similar to the
                          dominant part of Plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademarks, in a manner that is likely
                          to cause confusion on the part of the public or likely to have an association
                          with the registered trademarks. On a visual comparison of the rival marks,
                          prima facie it appears that Defendant has copied the dominant part of
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s device and word marks, i.e., T.I.M.E. Contention of the
                          Defendant that it has not appropriated the mark of the Plaintiff as it is using




                          trademarks FUTURE TIMES COACHING CENTRE/
                          and not T.I.M.E., is misplaced, in view of the observations of the Division
                          Bench of this Court in M/s. South India Beverages Pvt. Ltd. (supra),
                          wherein it is clearly observed that if essential/dominant feature is copied, it
                          is not a defence to infringement that whole of the mark is not appropriated.
                          Comparing &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27; and &#x27;TIMES&#x27;, this Court finds that the two are
                          phonetically identical and it bears repetition to reiterate that phonetic
                          similarity or identity constitutes an important index of determining

                           similarity/ identity in the context of infringement. Plaintiff is right in its
                          contention that the acronym &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27; and the word &#x27;TIME&#x27; would be
                          identical in pronunciation and confusion on account of phonetic identity
                          cannot be ruled out. The two words are also visually deceptively similar,
                          save and except, that in Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks, &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27; is used in a
                          manner that the letters are separated with dots, which in my view, is a trivial
                          dissimilarity to overcome deceptive similarity of the two words. Defendant
                          has copied essential feature of the trademarks of the Plaintiff, i.e.,
                          &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27;, which has become distinctive of Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks and the
                          services rendered under them and in my prima facie view, even the changed
                          trademarks of the Defendant, i.e., FUTURE TIMES COACHING CENTRE
                          (word and device), on account of their deceptive similarity, are unlikely to
                          reduce deception or confusion, amongst unwary purchasers with average
                          intelligence and imperfect recollection.
</p><p id="p_51">                          37.   Defendant has sought to raise a defence that word &#x27;TIMES&#x27; is a word
                          used in common parlance, has a dictionary meaning and is descriptive
                          besides being common to trade. In order to deal with this defence, this Court
                          alludes to a judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/190360510/" id="a_33">Central Park Estates Pvt. Ltd. and

                          CENTRAL PARK; and (b) CENTRAL PARK is purely descriptive and in
                          public domain with a dictionary meaning and incapable of distinctiveness.
                          The Court applied the prominent mark test and held that the essential feature
                          of Plaintiffs&#x27; mark is CENTRAL PARK, which was copied by the
                          Defendants and there was overall similarity in the competing marks. With
                          respect to the second issue, the Court observed that &#x27;CENTRAL PARK&#x27; as
                          per the Oxford Dictionary was a large public park in the centre of
                          Manhattan in New York City and no doubt, the two English words were
                          used co-jointly, however, the mark was not readily connectable to the
                          business of the Plaintiff in real estate and therefore was not descriptive of
                          the products. <a href="/doc/90123644/" id="a_34">In H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB &amp; Anr. v. HM

                          while dealing with the competing marks &#x27;H&amp;M&#x27; and &#x27;HM&#x27; held that a word,
                          even if generic, if applied to a business with which the word is
                          unrelated, is indeed to be protected and merely because it is an alphabet or
                          acronym is immaterial. Applying the principles to the present case,
                          T.I.M.E. is an acronym of Plaintiff&#x27;s Company&#x27;s name and wholly
                          unconnected with the business of the Plaintiff and therefore, entitled to

                           of <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_35">Section 17</a> of the Act, the registration of the trademark as a whole will not
                          confer on the Respondent the exclusive right to use part of the label or
                          trademark. Defendant&#x27;s reliance on the judgment, in my view, is misplaced
                          and the answer to this plea lies in the various judgments aforementioned, as
                          well as in the judgment in case of J.K. Oil Industries (supra), cited by the
                          Defendant itself. In para 8 of the said judgment, the Court held that
                          registered proprietor may be able to protect a part of a registered trademark,
                          if he is able to show that it is not common to trade or that it has obtained
                          distinctive character. In the present case, dominant part of the trademark,
                          i.e., &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27; has, in my prima facie view, acquired distinctiveness and
                          services offered by the Plaintiff using the acronym as a part of its trademarks
                          have come to be associated with the Plaintiff and none else. Plaintiff has
                          placed material on record pointing to its formidable and stellar reputation,
                          popularity and success. The judgment relied upon is, therefore, wholly
                          inapplicable to the facts of the present case.
</p><p id="p_55">                          39.       Before drawing curtain on this issue, it would be important to deal
                          with a somewhat connected argument of the Defendant that the word
                          &#x27;TIMES&#x27; is common to trade and in support thereof, Defendant has
                          enumerated few trademarks, where &#x27;TIMES&#x27; is used with a suffix or by
                          itself.
</p><p id="p_56">                          40.       Defendant has, in the written statement, enumerated the trademarks
                          comprising of the word &#x27;TIMES&#x27; as well as the classes for which they are
                          registered. A bare perusal of the table shows that the trademark mentioned at
                          serial no. 1 is registered in class 01, serial no. 2 in class 05, serial no. 3 in
                          class 07, serial nos. 4-20 in class 09, serial nos. 22-25 in class 16, serial no.

                          serial no. 37 in class 45, while serial nos. 31-34 in class 41.
</p><p id="p_58">                          41.   Be it noted that the trademarks of the Plaintiff which are in lis before
                          this Court are registered in class 41, i.e., coaching, education, training and
                          sporting and cultural activities, etc. The Institute renders services for
                          coaching and training aspirants for various competitive examinations such as
                          CAT, CLAT. The illustrations given by the Defendant in support of the plea
                          that &#x27;TIMES&#x27; is common to trade cannot inure to its advantage as most of
                          the trademarks cited are in different classes and the services are wholly
                          unrelated to the services rendered by the Plaintiff. As far as the trademarks
                          at serial nos. 31-34 are concerned, it was argued by learned counsel for the
                          Plaintiff, during the course of hearing that these Institutions have closed
                          down and this argument was not rebutted on behalf of the Defendant.
                          Moreover, apart from mentioning the name of the Institutes, the class of
                          registration and the user detail, Defendant has not provided any further
                          details of the activities carried out by these Institutes. On an independent
                          search on the Google, it is noticed that no information is available with
                          respect to three Institutes and in respect of one, i.e., Times School of
                          Journalism, it is seen that it was conducting PG Diploma Journalism
                          Programme, which is currently stated to be suspended. Therefore, the
                          Defendant has been unable to establish a prima facie case of the
                          trademark T.I.M.E. being common to trade. In any case, Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          inaction against third parties cannot constitute a valid defence for the
                          Defendant. The matter can be seen from another angle. Even assuming that
                          there are entities who are using the trademark &#x27;TIMES&#x27;, the Plaintiff is not
                          expected to sue all infringers who may not be affecting its business. In

                          Another</a>, (1970) 3 SCC 665, the Supreme Court held that the proprietor of a

                          prejudice to its distinctiveness. I may only refer to a passage in this
                          context from the judgment in <a href="/doc/943914/" id="a_37">Express Bottlers Services Private Ltd. v.
                          Pepsico Inc. &amp; Ors</a>., 1988 SCC OnLine Cal 62, which is extracted
                          hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">                                &quot;.....To establish the plea of common use, the use by other
                                persons should be shown to be substantial. In the present case,
                                there is no evidence regarding the extent of the trade carried on
                                by the alleged infringers or their respective position in the trade.
                                If the proprietor of the mark is expected to pursue each and every
                                insignificant infringer to save his mark, the business will come to
                                a standstill. Because there may be occasion when the malicious
                                persons, just to harass the proprietor may use his mark by way of
                                pinpricks.... The mere use of the name is irrelevant because a
                                registered proprietor is not expected to go on filing suits or
                                proceedings against infringers who are of no consequence...
                                Mere delay in taking action against the infringers is not sufficient
                                to hold that the registered proprietor has lost the mark
                                intentionally unless it is positively proved that delay was due to
                                intentional abandonment of the right over the registered mark.
                                This Court is inclined to accept the submissions of the
                                respondent No. 1 on this point... The respondent No. 1 did not
                                lose its mark by not proceeding against insignificant
                                infringers...&quot;

                                  the owners of trade marks or copy rights are not expected to run
                                 after every infringer and thereby remain involved in litigation at
                                 the cost of their business time. If the impugned infringement is
                                 too trivial or insignificant and is not capable of harming their
                                 business interests, they may overlook and ignore petty violations
                                 till they assume alarming proportions. If a road side Dhaba puts
                                 up a board of &quot;Taj Hotel&quot;, the owners of Taj Group are not
                                 expected to swing into action and raise objections forthwith.
                                 They can wait till the time the user of their name starts harming
                                 their business interest and starts misleading and confusing their
                                 customers.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_62">                          43.    The next plea raised by the Defendant and which is relevant for the
                          sake of completeness to decide the issue of infringement under <a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_39">Section
                          29(2)(b)</a> of the Act is that the services of the Defendant are entirely
                          different. While the Plaintiff focuses on providing coaching/training for
                          management courses, Defendant is a bona fide user of the trademark for
                          providing coaching to SSC and Bank PO examination aspirants in Tier II
                          and III cities albeit Plaintiff is now expanding and entering into the segment
                          of the Defendant and creating hurdles for small coaching centres. This plea
                          of the Defendant, in my opinion, is not well founded. Plaintiff in response to
                          the said averment in the written statement has categorically refuted the same
                          in the replication and has stated that Defendant has concealed the fact that
                          Plaintiff is providing coaching services for all competitive examinations in
                          all cities including Tier-I cities like Delhi as well as online coaching services
                          which can be accessed by students throughout the country. This stand of the
                          Plaintiff was not traversed or refuted by the Defendant. In this Court&#x27;s prima
                          facie view, the services provided by the Defendant are similar, if not wholly
                          identical to the Plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_64">                           44.   Plaintiff has also succeeded in establishing prima facie long and
                          continuous use of its trademarks as well as the number of Institutes it runs
                          across the country, such that the acronym T.I.M.E., because of its stellar
                          reputation come to be associated with Plaintiff&#x27;s educational and
                          training/coaching services. Plaintiff is thus prima facie correct in its
                          submission that because of the commonality in the services of the respective
                          parties, the public at large and more particularly, the students would get
                          confused with the origin of services offered by the Defendant and mistake
                          the same to be that of the Plaintiff, on account of the deceptive similarity in
                          the acronym T.I.M.E. and TIMES in the Defendant&#x27;s trademarks. The
                          confusion will be compounded because of the deceptive similarity in the
                          domain names. It needs to be noted, at this stage, that Plaintiff has placed on
                          record screenshots from the website and the YouTube channel of the
                          Defendant, reflecting the usage of the trademark by the Defendant. A bare
                          perusal of the screenshots indicates that Defendant is advertising and
                          promoting its Institute and services in a manner that the word TIMES is
                          appearing very prominently and conspicuously in comparison to the other
                          parts of the trademarks and needless to state that this is with a view to
                          highlight the same and encash on the reputation of the Plaintiff. Since the
                          word TIMES appears prominently in the advertisements and the field of
                          activity of the Defendant is similar to that of the Plaintiff, likelihood of
                          confusion amongst the students, desirous of applying for the courses to
                          prepare for the competitive examinations, cannot be ruled out. In fact, it may
                          be noted that even currently, Defendant is using the word &#x27;TIMES&#x27;
                          prominently and &#x27;TIMES Coaching&#x27; in the description while advertising its
                          services. Screenshots are placed hereunder, for ready reference:-

                          ingredients of <a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_40">Section 29(2)(b)</a> of the Act are fulfilled. Plaintiff has
                          established a prima facie case of infringement against the Defendant.
</p><p id="p_67">                          46.   This Court also notices that several interim orders have been passed
                          by this Court granting interim protection to the Plaintiff with respect to the
                          acronym &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27;, against user by third parties, in respect of coaching/
                          training Institutes, where the impugned marks are TIME/TIMES. The
                          interim orders are primarily predicated on phonetic identity between the
                          acronym T.I.M.E. and the impugned word TIME/TIMES as well as
                          commonality in activity. In fact, a Division Bench of this Court in
                          FAO(OS)(COMM) 87/2019 had, as an interim measure, restrained the
                          Respondent therein from using the trademark/trade name TIME/T.I.M.E./
                          TIME+, on the ground that the Plaintiff herein who was the Appellant in the
                          said case was a registered proprietor with immense reputation, running a
                          chain of more than 270 Institutes and the nature of business of the Appellant
                          and Respondent being identical, there was every likelihood that students
                          would be misled albeit the appeal finally ended in a settlement between the
                          parties. No doubt, interim orders do not constitute judicial precedents,
                          however, the mere fact that several Courts have in their wisdom granted
                          interim injunctions in favour of the Plaintiff, in respect of its acronym
                          T.I.M.E. does show prima facie the strength of the trademarks and the need
                          to protect them, at this stage.

                           Inc. in CS(OS) 1389/2003. I am afraid even this contention is bereft of
                          merit. The settlement entered into between the Plaintiff and TIME Inc. has
                          no relevance in the present suit for infringement and passing off and can
                          only bind the parties to the lis in the said suit. The settlement, in my prima
                          facie view, cannot prevent or debar the Plaintiff from protecting its rights in
                          the registered trademarks, whose essential part is the word &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27;,
                          against the third parties, with similar services. As rightly pointed out by
                          learned counsel for the Plaintiff the object of the Settlement Agreement was
                          to create a distinction between the visual depiction of the trademarks of the
                          signatory parties and cannot jettison phonetic similarity of its marks qua a
                          third party in another matter. In this view, the judgment in the case of B.L.
                          Sreedhar (Supra), relied upon by the Defendant, is inapplicable to the facts
                          of the present case.
</p><p id="p_69">                          48.   The next plank of the argument of the learned counsel for the Plaintiff
                          is that the actions of the Defendant tantamount to passing off its services
                          under the impugned trademarks, domain name, mobile application,
                          YouTube channels and other platforms.
</p><p id="p_70">                          49.   Passing off is a common law remedy premised on the principle that no
                          one has a right to represent his goods or services as those of someone else&#x27;s
                          and grants protection of goodwill in business against misrepresentation
                          caused by another entity or person in the course of trade. The essential
                          elements of the action of passing off have been emphasised time and again
                          as: (a) misrepresentation made by a trader in course of trade to prospective
                          customers; (b) calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader

                           WLR 68]. This Court has rendered prima facie finding in the earlier part of
                          the judgment that essential/dominant part of the Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark is
                          visually similar and phonetically identical to the Defendant&#x27;s impugned
                          trademarks and that the services are also similar.
</p><p id="p_71">                          50.   Plaintiff has prima facie established that it has formidable and
                          immense reputation and goodwill. It is stated that it commenced running of
                          coaching Institutes in 1992 and in 1995, the Company came into existence.
                          Plaintiff has grown into a specialist multi-location, multi-programme
                          training provider and is run on corporate lines. Currently, Plaintiff has over
                          214 offices in 109 towns and cities across the country and offers training for
                          National level exams such as CAT, GATE, CLAT, IIT foundation
                          programmes, State-level examinations, etc. Plaintiff has also expanded into
                          a broader arena of education and training with pre-school chain with
                          currently 391 pre-schools across 97 cities and towns. Plaintiff&#x27;s coaching
                          Institutes train more than 1,50,000 aspirants for competitive examinations
                          each year. The brand turnover of the Plaintiff was approximately Rs.312.83
                          crores in the year 2018-19 alone. It is further averred that &#x27;T.I.M.E.&#x27;
                          coaching and studying material has produced exceptional results which is
                          evident from the CAT 2016 exam wherein 12 students scored 100
                          percentile. Plaintiff has also averred that it provides coaching services by
                          way of recorded video lectures to its students and its website is fully
                          operational. Plaintiff also owns YouTube channel and runs various mobile
                          applications such as &#x27;TIME FOR CAT&#x27; and &#x27;TIME FOR GATE&#x27; etc.
                          Plaintiff thus has a reputation in respect of the services it provides and use of
                          &#x27;TIMES&#x27; in the impugned trademark for similar services is a
                          misrepresentation by the Defendant which is likely to cause confusion

                          Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_72">                          51.    In my prima facie view, the use of the word &#x27;TIMES&#x27; by the
                          Defendant for which it has no plausible explanation, is dishonest and only
                          with a view to misrepresent to the general public that Defendant&#x27;s Institute
                          has an association or a connection with Plaintiff&#x27;s Institute or is a branch
                          thereof and is calculated to injure its goodwill and reputation. The very fact
                          that the Defendant has chosen to adopt the word TIMES as a part of the
                          trademark, without disclosing a single reason as to why it chose only the
                          word TIMES for similar educational and training programmes, is by itself
                          indicative of the intent to confuse the consumers and encash on Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          reputation. Plaintiff has thus established a prima facie case of passing off
                          against the Defendant.

                          granted vide order dated 02.02.2021 is hereby confirmed, with the
                          modification that the injunction shall apply to the newly adopted trademarks

                          however, made clear that Defendant is at liberty to run its Institute under any
                          other trademark including FUTURE COACHING CENTRE without using
                          the word &#x27;TIMES&#x27;.

                          prima facie and tentative and shall have no bearing on the final adjudication
                          of this suit.

                          Defendant is continuing to violate the injunction order and is guilty of
                          contempt. The stand of the Defendant per contra is that during the pendency
                          of the suit, it has changed the trademark from TIMES COACHING
                          CENTRE to FUTURE TIMES COACHING CENTRE and the changed
                          trademark is not deceptively similar to Plaintiff&#x27;s trademark T.I.M.E. -
                          TRIUMPHANT INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION. A
                          detailed reply has been filed where an attempt has been made to distinguish
                          the two rival trademarks visually, phonetically and structurally. An
                          additional affidavit dated 23.05.2022 has been filed in which it is stated on
                          behalf of the Defendant that after adopting the trademark FUTURE TIMES
                          COACHING CENTRE, Defendant has changed the name of website,
                          Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube channels, including the thumbnails
                          of the impugned videos alleged to be infringing.
</p><p id="p_79">                          56.   In the earlier part of the judgment, this Court has rendered a prima

                          COACHING CENTRE is deceptively similar to the registered trademark of
                          the Plaintiff. However, the question that arises in the present applications is
                          whether the Defendant can be held guilty of contempt of the orders passed
                          by this Court. It is a settled position in law that for bringing an action for
                          civil contempt, Petitioner would have to satisfy the Court that the alleged
                          contemnor has wilfully disobeyed or violated any order, direction, judgment

                           or any other process of the Court. &#x27;Wilful&#x27; means an act or omission done
                          voluntarily and intentionally with an intent to disobey or disregard the law.
                          <a href="/doc/183982/" id="a_41">In Kapildeo Prasad Sah and Others v. State of Bihar and Others</a>, (1999) 7
                          SCC 569, the Court observed that for holding the Respondent guilty of
                          contempt, it has to be shown that there was wilful disobedience of the order
                          of the Court. Power to punish for contempt is to be resorted to when there is
                          clear violation of Court&#x27;s order. Since notice of contempt and punishment
                          has far reaching consequences, these powers should be invoked only
                          when a clear case of wilful disobedience of Court&#x27;s order is made out.
                          At the same time, it is important to remember that disobedience of Court&#x27;s
                          order strikes at the very root of law on which our system of governance is
                          based.
</p><p id="p_80">                          57.      Judged on these parameters, this Court finds that act of the Defendant
                          cannot be termed as wilful disobedience. The interim injunction granted by
                          this Court restrained the Defendant from using the trademarks &#x27;TIMES
                          COACHING CENTRE&#x27; as well as the domain names, comprising the word
                          &#x27;TIMES COACHING&#x27;, including any other trademark, label, etc.
                          deceptively similar and infringing the Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks. The reply filed
                          by the Defendant and the additional affidavit reflect that Defendant in its
                          wisdom understood the injunction order to mean that it was restrained from
                          using the trademarks &#x27;TIMES COACHING CENTRE&#x27;, domain name
                          &#x27;www.timescoaching.in&#x27;, mobile application           &#x27;Times   Coaching&#x27; and
                          YouTube channels namely, &#x27;Times Coaching&#x27;, &#x27;Times Defence&#x27; and &#x27;Times
                          Teaching&#x27;. With this understanding, Defendant changed the trademark to
                          &#x27;FUTURE TIMES COACHING CENTRE&#x27; in the belief that this would not
                          be a violation of the injunction order.
