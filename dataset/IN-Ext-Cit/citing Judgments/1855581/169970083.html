            Arbitration Request No. 89 of 2019
             ---------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 27th day of January, 2020


                             ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">            This is a proceedings under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_1">Section 11(6)</a> of the

Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (the Act) for appointment

of arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            2.   The petitioner is the proprietor of a concern

engaged in providing cable TV services. He has been providing

cable TV services to his customers based on Annexure A-1

franchise agreement entered into with the respondent on

16.11.2010. Annexure A-1 agreement provides for resolution of

the disputes by recourse to arbitration.       It is stated by the

petitioner that though the said franchise agreement           was

entered into for a period of ten years, on the expiry of the said

term, the petitioner requested the respondent, in terms of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019                 3</span>



Annexure A-4 letter to renew the agreement for another ten

years and on the basis of the said request, the agreement

continued without interruption. It is alleged by the petitioner

that in the course of business, dispute arose between the

parties as regards the amounts payable to the petitioner. It is

also alleged by the petitioner that though the petitioner called

upon the respondent to take steps to resolve the dispute by

recourse    to   arbitration   in       terms   of   Annexure   A-2

communication, the request made by the petitioner in this

connection has not been acted upon by the respondent. The

petitioner, therefore, seeks orders appointing an Arbitrator for

resolution of the disputes raised by him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           3.    A statement has been filed by the respondent.

The stand taken by the respondent in the statement is that

Annexure A-1 agreement was executed only for a period of 10

years; that the agreement has not been renewed thereafter;

that the dispute raised is not in respect of the period covered

by Annexure A-1 agreement and that the dispute is, therefore,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019                4</span>



not liable to be resolved by recourse to arbitration.

</p><p id="p_4">           4.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as

also the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent.

</p><p id="p_5">           5.     The   learned    counsel    for   the     petitioner

conceded that there is no agreement in writing to renew

Annexure    A-1   agreement.      The   learned   counsel    however

contended that since it is admitted by the respondent that the

business arrangement between the parties continued even

after the expiry of the term specified in Annexure A-1

agreement, the petitioner is entitled to invoke the arbitration

clause contained in the agreement for resolution of the dispute.

</p><p id="p_6">           6.     Per contra, the learned Senior Counsel for the

respondent pointed out that only arbitration agreements in

writing can be taken note of for the purposes of the

proceedings under the Act. It was contended that insofar as it

is admitted that there is no arbitration agreement between the

parties in writing for the period after the expiry of the term

specified in Annexure A-1 agreement, and insofar as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019               5</span>



dispute raised is not a dispute arose during the period during

which the arbitration agreement was in force, the same is one

to be resolved otherwise than by recourse to arbitration.

</p><p id="p_7">           7.    I have given my thoughtful consideration to the

contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties.

</p><p id="p_8">           8.    In the light of the provision contained in

<a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_3">Section 11(6A)</a> of the Act, and the decision of the Apex Court in

<a href="/doc/133653680/" id="a_4">Duro Felguera S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Limited</a>, (2017) 9

SCC 729, the only point arising for consideration is as to

whether there exists an arbitration agreement between the

parties. The fact that there is an arbitration clause in Annexure

A-1 agreement is not disputed by the respondent.           The said

arbitration clause reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         Arbitration Clause:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         Any dispute arising out this agreement shall be referred for
         Arbitration as per the   provisions of   the Arbitration and
         <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_5">Conciliation Act</a> 1996.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">There is no dispute also to the fact that Annexure A-1

agreement was one entered into for a period of ten years
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019                 6</span>



commencing from 16.11.2000 and the said term has expired on

16.11.2010. There is also no dispute to the fact that no written

agreement to renew Annexure A-1 agreement was entered into

between the parties. There is also no dispute to the fact that

the dispute, for the resolution of which the proceedings are

initiated, is a dispute     arose after 16.11.2010.       The specific

case of the petitioner is that in the light of Annexure A-4

request sent by the petitioner to the respondent on the expiry

of the term of Annexure A-1 agreement, the very same

agreement continued for another term of ten years and since

the dispute arose during the said period, the petitioner is

entitled to invoke the arbitration clause contained in Annexure

A1 agreement for        resolution of the dispute.       The relevant

portion of Annexure A-4 request, in terms of which the

petitioner stated to have claimed extension of the term of

Annexure A-1 agreement for a further period of ten years,

reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   "This is to inform that M/s Kannileth Cable T.V.   Net
              Works wishes to extend the term of the above referred
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019                    7</span>



              franchisee agreement for a    further term of ten years and
              have a successful business relation with Asianet Satellite
              Communications Pvt. Ltd."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_10">The respondent has no case that they have not received

Annexure A-4 request. On the other hand, as regards the said

case,   the    stand    taken    by   the    respondent      is   that   the

arrangement continued only for collection of subscription

charges. The relevant portion of paragraph 10 of the statement

of the respondent wherein the aforesaid admission is made

reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                          "10.   It is submitted that on expiry of ten years,
              the agreement was not renewed.         It was not extended.
              However the arrangement for collection of subscription
              charges alone continued."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_11">The pleadings of the respondent in the statement filed by them

indicate beyond doubt that in terms of the franchise agreement

entered into between the petitioner and the respondent, the

petitioner was virtually acting as the agent of the respondent

for collection of subscription charges. The pleadings of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019                8</span>



parties would also indicate that the agreement was not

renewed since there was dispute between the parties as to the

share of the petitioner out of the collection charges.       True,

ordinarily, an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part

of the offeree, yet it does not mean that an acceptance always

has   to   be    given   in   so   many   words.   Under   certain

circumstances, the offeree's silence, coupled with his conduct,

which takes the form of a positive act, may constitute an

acceptance, an agreement sub silentio.        In the light of the

aforesaid principle, according to me, on facts, it can be

certainly inferred that the franchise agreement entered into

between the petitioner and the respondent          continued even

after the expiry of the term made mention of in Annexure A-1

agreement, on the same terms except as regards the share of

the petitioner out of the collection charges. In other words, the

arbitration clause contained in Annexure A1 agreement is also

very much       a part of the arrangement continued after the

expiry of the original term, especially in the absence of any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019                 9</span>



material indicating a contrary intention. No doubt, in the light

of <a href="/doc/1846895/" id="a_6">Section 7</a> of the Act, the arbitration agreement for the

purpose of the Act shall be one entered into between the

parties in writing. Similarly, there cannot be any dispute to the

proposition that the existence of the arbitration agreement is a

sine qua non for making a reference under <a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_7">Section 11</a> (6) of the

Act.   But, I do not find any requirement under law that the

arbitration clause in a case of this nature needs to be extended

and re-affirmed in writing for the purposes of the Act,           even

while the parties were continuing the arrangement on the very

same terms except as regards the share of the petitioner out

of the subscription charges. The requirement under <a href="/doc/1846895/" id="a_8">Section 7</a> of

the Act is not desecrated according to me, since the original

agreement containing the arbitration clause is one entered into

in writing. Needless to say that the petitioner is entitled to

invoke the arbitration clause contained in Annexure A1

agreement     for     resolution   of   the   dispute   raised,    not

withstanding that the agreement was not renewed in writing.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> A.R. No. 89 of 2019               10</span>



It is seen that in a similar matter, in <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_9">Bharat Petroleum

Corpn. Ltd. v. Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>., (2008) 1

SCC 503, the Apex Court has also taken an identical view.

</p><p id="p_12">             In the result, the arbitration request is allowed and

Adv.Sreelal Warriar, Warriar &amp; Co., Advocates, Arbitrators and

Mediators, Warriam Road, P.B.No.5000, Cochin - 682 016 is

appointed provisionally as the Arbitrator to resolve the dispute

between the parties. The Registry is directed to obtain

disclosure    statement   under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_10">Section 11(8)</a> of the Arbitration

and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_11">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 from the Arbitrator and place the

matter before the court for confirmation of the appointment of

the Arbitrator. The Registry shall retain the original of the

disclosure statement and append a copy of the same to the

order.
