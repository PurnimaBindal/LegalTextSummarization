       CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
             and
             HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN

               ORAL JUDGMENT

                (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)


18.1.2011.               These four petitions filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
             Constitution raise common challenge to the constitutional validity
             of the Government Notification dated 3rd June 2002 published in
             the Official Gazette of the State of Bihar on 9th August 2008.
</p><p id="p_30">                         The petitioners in C.W.J.C. No. 7489 of 2006 are the
             wife and the brother of the deceased Sharma Choudhary, a class
             IV employee of the respondent no.6, Canara Bank. According to
             the writ petitioners the said Sharma Choudhary died on account of
             the atrocities meted to him being a Scheduled Caste person. The
             petitioners have, therefore, prayed that the police be directed to
             register the offence under Section 3 (2) (v) read with Section 3 (1)
</p><p id="p_31">             (x) of the Scheduled Castes and the <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_2">Scheduled Tribes (Prevention

             1989‟) read with <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code; that the
             police be directed that the investigation for the offence be made by
             a police officer of the rank of the Deputy Superintendent of Police.
</p><p id="p_32">                         The petitioner in C.W.J.C. No. 16407 of 2007 is one
             Ambuj Sharma @ Ambuj Kumar Sharma, an accused in Uphara
             P.S. Case No. 23/2000 registered for offences punishable under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4"> the
             Indian Penal Code</a>, <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_5">Arms Act</a> and under the Act of 1989.

             for offences punishable under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6"> the Indian Penal Code</a> and the Act

<p id="p_34">            C.W.J.C. No. 18736 of 2008 is filed in public interest
by an organization, namely, Dalit‟s Watch through its Secretary,
Umesh Kumar Kundan.
</p><p id="p_35">            The impugned Notification has been issued by the
State of Bihar in exercise of power conferred by <a href="/doc/191735910/" id="a_7">Section 9(1)</a> of
the Act of 1989 to authorise the officers of the rank of Police
Inspector, Sub Inspector of Police and Assistant Sub Inspector of
Police to investigate the cases filed under the Act of 1989 within
the State of Bihar with effect from 31st March 1995. The impugned
Notification reads as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "In exercise of the powers conferred by
      <a href="/doc/112842872/" id="a_8">section 9(1)</a> of the Scheduled Castes and the
      <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_9">Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a>,
      1989 (No. 33 of 1989) and having regard to the
      number of cases filed under this Act, the State Govt.
      authorises all the officers of the rank of Police
      Inspector, Sub-Inspector of Police and Assistant
      Sub-Inspector of Police to investigate the cases filed
      under this Act within the State of Bihar with effect
      from 31.3.95, the date of coming into force of The
      Scheduled Castes and The Scheduled Tribes
      (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 made under
      this Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            BY ORDER OF THE GOVERNOR OF BIHAR"</blockquote>


<p id="p_36">            The challenge to the Notification is mainly on the
ground that the impugned Notification is violative of <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_10">Section 9</a> of
the Act of 1989 and Rule 7 of the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995
(hereinafter referred to as „the Rules‟). Another limb of the
challenge is that the impugned Notification is ultra vires in so far
as it is made retrospective with effect from 31st March 1995. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                        -5-</span>




Notification is intended to validate the invalid actions of
investigation by an officer below the rank of Deputy
Superintendent of Police. It is also submitted that the impugned
Notification extends beyond the power conferred upon the State
Government to empower any officer of the State Government to
exercise the powers of a police officer of arrest, investigation and
prosecution of the persons before a special court. The relevant
<a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_11">Section 9</a> of the Act of 1989 and Rule 7 of the Rules read as under:

       position of all investigations done by the
       investigating officer.</blockquote>

<p id="p_38">            It may be noted that <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_15">Section 9</a> of the Act of 1989
confers power upon the State Government to empower any
government officer to exercise the power of a police officer by
notification in the Official Gazette. It is, therefore, imperative that
such notification has to be published in the Official Gazette of the
State. Any notification issued in exercise of the said power unless
published in the Official Gazette of the State would not be
effective. In the present case though the impugned Notification
was issued on 3rd June 2002 it was not published in the Official
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      -7-</span>




             Gazette until 9th August 2008. It must, therefore, be held that the
             impugned Notification became effective from the date of its
             publication in the Official Gazette i.e. on and from 9th August
             2008.
</p><p id="p_39">                         The learned Advocates have also argued that the
             impugned Notification has been issued without application of
             mind i.e. without reference to the circumstances stated in <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_16">Section 9</a>
             of the Act of 1989. In their submission it has not been issued for
             prevention or for coping with the offences under the Act of 1989.
             If at all necessary, such notification could have been issued in
             respect of a district or a part of a district alone and not for the
             entire State of Bihar. Further, <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_17">Section 9</a> of the Act of 1989
             envisages conferment of the power of a police officer of arrest,
             investigation and prosecution upon the officers of the government
             i.e. government officers other than police officers.

</p><p id="p_41">                         Learned advocates, Mr. Amanullah and Mr. Prasoon
             Sinha have appeared for the respondent State Government. They
             have submitted that the State Government has made the impugned
             Notification   retrospective   in   its   application.   Hence,   an
             investigation made in respect of the offences punishable under the
             Act of 1989 by a police officer empowered under the impugned
             Notification, though he may be below the rank of the Deputy
             Superintendent of Police stands validated by the impugned
             Notification. It is further submitted that in any view of the matter,
             until the date of the Rules (i.e. 31st March 1995) there was no
             restriction on investigation of offences punishable under the Act of

</p><p id="p_44">            We have considered the above referred judgments.
            We are unable to agree with any of the aforesaid
arguments. Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_26">section 9</a> of the Act of
1989 refers to "any case or class or group of cases"; that
necessarily means that the conferment of powers is not restricted
to prevention of offences alone but also to deal with the offences
already committed. The impugned Notification also refers to the
number of cases filed under the Act of 1989. The said reference
displays active application of mind to the prevailing circumstances
and need for early investigation. The submission, therefore,
deserves to be rejected. The said Sub-section (1) further refers to
"any officer of the State Government". The phrase would also
include a police officer. In our view, nothing in <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_27">section 9</a> of the
Act of 1989 restricts the power of the State Government to a
district or a part of a district alone. It does enable the State
Government to exercise the power conferred by the <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_28">section 9</a> of
the Act of 1989 in respect of a district or a part of a district, but
that cannot be read to mean that such power cannot be exercised
for the whole of the State.

any other provision of this Act". In view of the aforesaid non-
obstante clause, the impugned Notification issued in exercise of
the power conferred by <a href="/doc/191735910/" id="a_31">section 9(1)</a> the Act of 1989 will have an
overriding effect and can not be held to be ultra vires the said Act.
We do not need an elaborate discussion to say that the rules
framed under an act are part of that enactment. Therefore, the
words "anything contained in the provisions of the Act" will
sweep into its embrace the provisions contained in the Rules also.
We may examine the matter from a different angle. The aforesaid
non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/32443604/" id="a_32">Section 9</a> of the Act of 1989 gives an
overriding effect to a notification issued by State Government
under that Section over the provisions contained in the Act of
1989. That should include <a href="/doc/56780019/" id="a_33">Section 23</a> of the Act of 1989 and the
Rules made thereunder. The impugned Notification issued in
exercise of the power conferred by <a href="/doc/191735910/" id="a_34">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act of 1989,
in any manner cannot be said to be ultra vires the Act of 1989 or
the Rules made thereunder.
</p><p id="p_46">            <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_35">The Act</a> of 1989 has been enacted especially for
protection of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes people from
crimes against them committed by non-Scheduled Castes and non-
Scheduled Tribes people. <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_36">The Act</a> of 1989 does not restrict the
investigation of such crimes by a particular police officer or a
particular class of police officers. In other words, any police
officer empowered under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure to
investigate a crime or lodge a prosecution was competent to make
arrest, investigate or lodge prosecution in respect of the crime
punishable under the Act of 1989. However, by the Rules framed
under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/56780019/" id="a_38">Section 23</a> of the Act of 1989 published in
the Gazette of India on 31st March 1995 a restriction was imposed

<p id="p_48">in respect of investigation of offences committed under the Act of
1989. Under Rule 7 of the Rules the police officers not below the
rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police alone are empowered to
investigate a crime punishable under the Act of 1989. In other
words, by necessary implication, the police officers lower in rank
than a Deputy Superintendent of Police are debarred from
investigating such crimes. The necessary consequence would be
that the investigation made in respect of such crime by a police
officer lower in rank than the Deputy Superintendent of Police
after the date of the Rules i.e. on and from 31st March 1995 is
unauthorized and is invalid. A prosecution lodged consequent to
such investigation would fail. It is apparent that with a view to
validating such invalid investigation and consequent unauthorized
prosecution the Government of Bihar has issued the impugned
Notification empowering the police officers below the rank of
Deputy Superintendent of Police such as Police Inspector, Sub-
Inspector of Police and Assistant Sub Inspector of Police to
investigate the crimes punishable under the Act of 1989 effective
from 31st March 1995.
</p><p id="p_49">             There is no gainsaying that the Parliament or a State
Legislature has power to enact laws and also to specify the date
from which such law shall become applicable. The operation of
such law may be made retrospective by an express provision or by
necessary implication. But how far such law can be made
retrospective in operation has to be decided in the context of the
matter. In our view, the impugned Notification in so far as it
confers power of investigation upon the police officers below the
rank of the Deputy Superintendent of Police is valid. Its operation
with retrospective effect is also valid to the extent that any offence
committed prior to the date of the impugned Notification can, after

<p id="p_51">the date of the impugned Notification, be investigated by a police
officer who has been vested with the power of investigation
though he may be of the rank below the rank of the Deputy
Superintendent of Police. But to accept the argument advanced by
the learned advocates Mr. Amanullah and Mr. Sinha would
amount to validating the acts which were unauthorized and invalid
from inception. In other words, if an investigation in such crime
has been made by a police officer below the rank of the Deputy
Superintendent of Police prior to the date of the publication of the
impugned Notification, such investigation and consequent
prosecution which were otherwise invalid cannot stand validated
by the impugned Notification.

the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1214358/" id="a_39">I.T. Officer, Alleppey
v. M.C. Ponnoose</a> (supra). In that matter in exercise of power
conferred by <a href="/doc/3387275/" id="a_40">Section 2(44)</a> (ii) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_41">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961, as it
stood amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_42">Finance Act</a>, 1963, by a Notification issued
on 14th August 1963 a Tehsildar in the State of Kerala was vested
with the powers of a Recovery Officer with effect from 1st April
1962. The said Notification was published in the Official Gazette
on 20th August 1963. The action of tax recovery by the Tehsildar
after 1st April 1962 but prior to 14th August 1963 was held to be
invalid.

                 be valid although the offence in question may have been
