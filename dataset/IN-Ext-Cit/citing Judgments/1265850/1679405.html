    defendant from using in relation to its business or service, the mark

    Kalpataru Construction Overseas Private Limited and it's name was




                                                   
    changed to the present name with effect from 6th June, 2006. Plaintiff

    No.2, as stated above, was incorporated on 27th November, 2000. The




                                       
    defendant was incorporated much later on 27th January, 2006. The
                        
    plaintiff's case is that the defendant carries on business similar to the
                       
    business of plaintiff No.2.

    upon the case that the said mark is a well known mark has acquired

    secondary significance in trade circles and has almost become a




                                        
    household name and the plaintiff would, therefore, be entitled to
                         
    reliefs even in respect of the goods and services, which are not similar.
</p>                        
<p id="p_13">    I have found this case to be well founded in view, inter-alia, of the

    following facts.
</p>
<p id="p_14">          There are twenty partnership firms and companies incorporated
      
   



    under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a>, 1956 in the Kalpataru group involved in a

    variety of commercial activities. The plaintiff No.1 has developed





    properties all over the city and its extended suburbs and outside

    Mumbai.

<p id="p_15">          In the advertisements for the sale of units in the properties





    constructed by the group companies, the name of plaintiff No.2 is

    included, indicating a connection of plaintiff No.2 with the Kalpataru

    group. Plaintiff No.2 has been carrying on business of providing

    various services including integrated facilities management services to

    various commercial and residential complexes, BPOs, IT and ITES,




                                                                            
    malls, hospitals and industrial organizations. Plaintiff No.2 has, in the




                                                   
    course of its business, been extensively using the said trademark with

    the permission and licence of plaintiff No.1 since the year 2000.
</p>



                                                  
<p id="p_16">          The gross business income of the twenty companies in the

    plaintiff's group for the year 2009-2010, was `.49,000,000,000/-.
</p>



                                       
<p id="p_17">    Most of these companies have used the said trademark extensively. It
                        
    is important, however, that the gross business income has been
                       
    enormous not merely in the year 2009, but even in the previous years.
</p>
<p id="p_18">    For instance, in the year 2005-2006, i.e. before the defendant was

    incorporated, it was `.12,696,000,000/-. It is also significant to note
      
   



    that the word "Kalpataru" forms a part of the corporate name and

    trading style of several other group companies and firms involved in a





    variety of commercial activities.
</p>
<p id="p_19">          The    advertisements and business promotional expenses of

    some of the companies in the Kalpataru group increased from





    `.3,20,00,000/- in the year 2004-2005 to `.9,34,00,000/- in the year

    2009-2010. The plaintiffs have also referred to several advertisements

    companies and firms in the group.

<p id="p_20">          The device mark has been used by the plaintiffs and many of




                                                                             
    the other companies in the Kalpataru group extensively in a variety of




                                                     
    ways, including on letter-heads, visiting cards and other stationery.

<p id="p_21">          The plaintiffs have also received several awards, including at




                                                    
    the Asia-Pacific Property Awards 2010, the Best Architect Multiple

<p id="p_22">    6.    In August, 2008, the plaintiffs noticed an advertisement issued

    by the defendant. The advertisement mentions the full name of the

    defendant in which the word "KALPATARU'S" is substantially larger
      
   



    than the other words. The advertisement states prominently:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "OUR SERVICES : HOUSE KEEPING, GUEST

    in the present case. I will refer to them while dealing with the

    submissions.

<p id="p_25">          The plaintiff's advocate replied to the same by a letter dated 31st




                                                   
    October, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_26">          The plaintiffs' case is that thereafter it did not notice the said




                                                  
    mark being used and therefore, did not file any proceedings.

<p id="p_27">    8(A) An article appeared in the 23rd September, 2010 publication of
                        
    the Hindustan Times. The article stated that the officials of the
                       
    Organizing Committee of the Common Wealth Games had found that

    the performance of the two main Indian vendors for cleaning work

    including "Kalpataru" was shoddy.         The article further states :
</p>      
   



<p id="p_28">    "Kalpataru which is in charge of cleaning the Games Village

    residential towers numbered 16 to 34 had been given dressing down





    and the Organizing Committee had decided to rope in more agencies

    in view of the said place being found to be filthy by a number of

    foreign delegates." The article goes on to describe the poor work





    carried on by "Kalpataru".

    (B)   Another prominent article appeared in the 29th September, 2010

    publication of the Indian Express. In this article too, it is stated that




                                                                            
    during the evaluation process, the Organizing Committee had




                                                    
    disqualified Kalpataru Hospitality, which finally got the bid along

    with another company. The article further states that the publication




                                                   
    was in possession of a copy of the minutes of the 35 th meeting of the

    Organizing Committee whereat a member had given a presentation




                                        
    indicating that the shortlisted firms including "Kalpataru", did not
                          
    understand the scope of the work and that the Committee evaluated
                         
    the bids and disqualified "Kalpataru" as they had not met some of the

    requirements and technical parameter. The article roundly criticised

    "Kalpataru".
</p>      
   



<p id="p_30">    (C)   The plaintiffs relied upon the letters received by them from their





    customers making enquiries in respect of the articles. This was

    obviously to indicate the damage that is being done and the prejudice

    that is being caused as a result of the defendant passing off its services





    as those of the plaintiffs.

    defendants submitted that the articles do not prove the truth of what is




                                                                             
    stated therein and are purely hear-say evidence. This action for




                                                     
    infringement and passing off is not concerned with the truth or falsity

    or what is stated in the articles. Even assuming the same to be false,




                                                    
    the fact that such articles have appeared itself prejudices the plaintiffs

    enormously for the readers of the articles and those who are otherwise

          "13. ................................................................................
<p id="p_51">          The real question in each case is whether there is as a
          result of misrepresentation a real likelihood of confusion
          or deception of the public and consequent damage to the

     state of mind of public in deciding whether it will be




                                                                      
     confused. With the passage of time and reputation
     acquired, the trade mark 'Kirloskar' has acquired the




                                              
     secondary meaning and has become almost a household
     word. The judgments relied upon by Mr. Kane pertain to




                                             
     the cases of one type of business and not where variety
     of businesses have been carried by the plaintiff and
     defendant as in the instant case. The business activities




                                  
     of the Respondents vary from pin to piano as borne out
     from the object clauses of the Memorandums of
                   
     Association of the Respondents. The Appellants have still
                  
     to commence their business activities but as mentioned
     in the Memorandums of Association of 1st Appellant in
     each appeal, some of the object clauses therein overlap
      

     with the activities of Respondents and more particularly
   



     of Respondents Nos. 6 and 7.

<p id="p_52">     14. In the case of trading name which has become





     almost a household word and under which trading name
     a variety of activities are undertaken, a passing off can
     successfully lie if the defendant has adopted identical or





     similar trading name and even when the defendant does
     not carry on similar activity. Even if the defendant's
     activities in such circumstances, are remote, the same
     are likely to be presumed a possible extension of
     plaintiff's business or activities. In the instant case, the

     Respondents have established that word 'Kirloskar' has
     become a household word and their businesses cover

     connection with some activities of the Respondents and




                                              
     activities of the Appellants. In the case of Albion Motor
     Car Company Ltd. v. Albion Carriage and Motor Body




                                             
     Works Ltd. (34 RPC 257) (supra) on which reliance has
     been placed by Mr. Tulzapurkar, it has been held that the
     Defendant Company's business had not been proved to




                                 
     be the same class of business as that of the Plaintiff
     Company, yet the probability of confusion between the
                  
     two companies, both being connected with the motor car
                 
     industry, was proved and injunction was granted. In that
     case, the Plaintiff Company carried business in a large
     way as makers of engines and chassis of commercial and
      

     other motor-cars, their goods being identified and known
   



     to the trade by the name 'Albion' for which they had two
     Trade Marks. The defendants did not make motor cars or
     manufacture engines or chassis. In the action, the





     plaintiffs alleged that the use of the word 'Albion' in the
     title under which the defendants company was later on
     incorporated was calculated to deceive and lead to the





     belief that the defendant Company was a branch of or
     connected with the plaintiff company."

    does not deal in the same goods in respect of which the trademark is

    business carried on by it did not overlap with the business of any of
      
   



    the companies enlisted by the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court held that

    by using the plaintiff's trademark as a part of its corporate name, the

     words "Mahindra" and "Mahindra &amp; Mahindra" in its




                                              
     companies / business concerns for a long span of time
     extending over five decades. The name has acquired a




                                             
     distinctiveness and a secondary meaning in the business
     or trade circles. People have come to associate the name
     "Mahindra" with a certain standard of goods and




                                 
     services. Any attempt by another person to use the name

     probability will create an impression of a connection
                  
     with the plaintiffs' Group of Companies. Such user may
     also affect the plaintiff prejudicially in its business and
     trading activities. Undoubtedly, the question whether the
      

     plaintiffs' claim of "passing-off action" against the
   



     defendant will be accepted or not has to be decided by
     the Court after evidence is led in the suit. Even so
     for the limited    purpose of considering the prayer





     for interlocutory injunction which is intended for
     maintenance of status quo, the trial court rightly held
     that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and





     irreparable prejudice in its favour which calls for
     passing an order of interim injunction restraining the
     defendant Company which is yet to commence its
     business from utilising the name of "Mahendra" or
     "Mahendra &amp; Mahendra" for the purpose of its trade
