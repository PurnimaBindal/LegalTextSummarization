</pre><p id="p_5">4.    Ground No.2 raised by the assessee is against the
confirmation of rejection of books of accounts by Ld. CIT(A)
thereby upholding the order of AO.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    The facts in brief are that the assessee is an individual and
doing the business of trading and investments in shares.
During the year the assessee did not file any return of income
under section 139(1) of the Act. Thereafter, the assessee was
issued notice under section 142(1) of the Act on 04.01.1993,
however, the same was not complied with.                             The original
assessment in this case was completed under section 144 of the
Act      on    28.02.1995           assessing      the     total      income             at
Rs.20,29,21,230/- by making various additions. It is pertinent
to mention that the assessee did not furnish any books of
accounts       before    the    AO     and       AO    accordingly        completed
assessment on the basis of available information and incomplete
books found at the time of search by making additions under
section       69    in   respect      of       unexplained     investments               of
Rs19,86,14,228/-.         The matter reached the Tribunal and the
Tribunal vide order dated 13.06.2008 restored the matter to the
file of Ld. CIT(A) with the direction to admit the books of
accounts as evidence and decide the appeal after giving a
reasonable opportunity to the assessee. In the second round,
the ld    CIT(A)     partly allowed the appeal of the assessee vide
order dated 31.12.2015 and therefore the assessee as well as the
Revenue are in appeal before us.                      The assessee could not
produce       the   books      of    accounts         during   the     assessment
proceedings because they were not complete due to several
unforeseen and uncontrollable reasons beyond the control of the
assessee and consequently the assessment was framed on the
                                                         ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors
                                  4                             Smt. Rina S. Mehta


basis of information/details and material gathered by the AO
and the information supplied by the assessee.           The AO made
several additions on account of dividend and interest of
Rs.31,43,803/-,   unexplained         receipts   Rs.11.63,200/-           and
unexplained investments          Rs.19,86,14,220/-. Although the
Tribunal had directed Ld. CIT(A) to admit and consider the
books of accounts, the Ld. CIT(A) did not examine the books
and passed the appellate order without considering the books of
accounts.    The reason cited by the Ld. CIT(A) was that the
assessee was directed to produce the books before the AO and
the AO was directed to submit the remand report but inspite of
that no such remand report was furnished despite several
opportunities given to the AO.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   The Ld. A.R. submitted before the Bench that the books of
accounts are important piece of evidence for the purpose of
determination of income. The Ld. A.R. submitted that since the
AO has accepted the primary evidences filed before him
comprising   contract   notes,    dividend       warrants    and        bank
statement etc., then there was no reason for rejecting the books
of accounts as entries made therein were on the basis of above
primary evidences and records which were before the AO. The
Ld. A.R. submitted that income from investments in the form of
dividend and interest etc. have been determined and accepted as
shown in the books of accounts which incidentally is more than
the income assessed by the AO in the assessment order. The
Ld. A.R. also submitted that the books of accounts are verifiable
with the supporting evidences such as bank statements,
contract notes and income warrants etc and since substantial
transactions of investments were with brokerage firms within
                                                       ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors
                                  5                           Smt. Rina S. Mehta


the family, the assessment records of these brokerage firms in
the family of the assessee who were assessed with same AO,
could have been examined. Thus the accuracy and reliability of
the books of accounts could be determined with various
evidences and    documents.     The Ld. A.R. also referred to the
observations of the co-ordinate Benches in several cases of
related entities that books of accounts which were prepared
under great difficulties should not be rejected on flimsy grounds
, yet the books of accounts of the assessee have been rejected
without any justification and cogent reasons.         The Ld. A.R.
therefore requested that the books of accounts ought to have
been accepted. The Ld. A.R. further submitted that the books of
accounts were rejected by the AO not only in the case of the
assessee but also in the cases of all the family members where
the assessments were framed under similar circumstances. The
Ld. A.R. also referred to the decision of the co-ordinate Bench in
the case of Hitesh S. Mehta. Vs. ACIT ITA No.5190/M/2017 A.Y.
1992-93 order dated 31.08.2020 wherein the co-ordinate Bench
has held the rejection of books of accounts to be incorrect and
decided the issue in favour of the assessee. The Ld. A.R. finally
prayed that the books of accounts of the assessee deserved to be
accepted in view of the facts and circumstances as narrated
above and also the decision of the co-ordinate Bench as cited
(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   The Ld. D.R., on the other hand, relied heavily on the order
of authorities below and submitted that the books of accounts
,which were not filed before the AO and nor Ld. CIT(A) in the
first round of litigation but filed before the Tribunal for the first
                                                       ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors
                                 6                            Smt. Rina S. Mehta


time, can not be relied upon and was rightly rejected by the
authorities below.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.   After hearing both the parties and perusing the material on
record,   we   find that   dividend and    interest    income           was
determined by the AO on the basis of bank statements and
dividend warrants filed by the assessee and the said income was
duly accounted for by the assessee in the books of accounts. We
also note that in view of such massive search on the assessee
the books of accounts could not be produced before the AO in
the first round of litigation because these could not be computed
and only computed in the later series on the basis of information
on record available with the assessee. We note that these books
were filed as additional evidences for the first time before the
Tribunal in the first round and Tribunal after admitting the
same restored the matter to the file of the Ld. CIT(A) with the
direction to decide the appeal of the assessee after considering
the said books of accounts. However, we note that Ld. CIT(A)
has again disregarded the books of accounts filed by the
assessee without even pointing a single defect for the said
rejection. In our opinion, the rejection of books of accounts by
the Revenue authorities is not correct in view of the fact that all
the relating evidences such as contract notes, dividend warrants
and the bank statements and other evidences available on
record were accepted which was used to complete the books of
accounts. In our opinion the books of accounts constitute an
important piece of evidence and therefore we are not in
agreement with the conclusion drawn by the Ld. CIT(A) on this
issue that too without pointing out any defects and deficiency in
the books of accounts. We also note that the books of accounts
                                                     ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors
                                 7                          Smt. Rina S. Mehta


were also rejected in the case of all the related entities. We note
that in one of the related entities <a href="/doc/125730279/" id="a_1">M/s. Hitesh S. Mehta vs. ACIT</a>
(supra) the co-ordinate bench of the Tribunal under similar
circumstances has held the rejection of books of accounts as
invalid and incorrect and accordingly decided the issue in favour
of the assessee. Accordingly, following the said decision of the
co-ordinate bench of the Tribunal we also hold that there is no
reason and justification for rejecting the books of accounts as
both the authorities below have failed to give the reasons or
point out any defects in the books of account      for rejection of
books of accounts. Accordingly, we allow this ground in favour
of the assessee. Ground no. 2 is allowed.
</p>


<p id="p_10">9.In ground No. 3 and 4, the appellant has challenged the
addition on account of unexplained investments as sustained by
the Ld. CIT(A).
</p>

<p id="p_11">10. The brief facts are that the assessment         was originally
completed u/s. 144 of the Act on 28.02.1995 making                       an
addition on account of unexplained investment                   at Rs.
19,86,14,228/-. The said addition was made on account of
alleged unexplained purchase of shares. During the course of
assessment    proceedings,    information    pertaining        to       the
investments in shares by the appellant were collected by the AO
from the following sources:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      a. Details of shareholding provided by various companies.
      b. Custodian&#x27;s letter dated 29.10.1993 giving details of
        shareholding in various companies.

     d. Details of seized shares.


</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_12">On the basis of the above information, a detailed list of the
investments in various shares was prepared by the AO and in
respect of each scrip, the highest holding from the various
sources was treated as the investments of the appellant made
during the year. The said list was marked as Annexure 1 to the
assessment order. The assessee was called upon by the AO to
furnish the evidences in respect of the investments as listed in
Annexure 1 and made by her during the year. Accordingly, the
assessee filed Investment in Share Account and contract notes
in support of purchase of shares to substantiate and explain the
investments made by her. The AO, however, concluded that the
evidences filed by the assessee till 20.02.1995 are considered as
explained though no such notice was given and the assessment
order which could have been passed by 31.03.1995 was
suddenly passed on 28.02.1995 after seeing the compliance
being made by the assessee. In fact, a list of the investments
made and supported by evidences filed vide and upto letter
dated 20.02.1995 is prepared and marked as Annexure 2. It was
explained that for the reasons best known to AO, he ignored the
evidences filed vide letter dated 21.02.1995, 28.02.1995 and
01.03.1995. He accordingly passed the order on 28.02.1995,
treating the difference between the investment, as per Annexure
1 and the investments as per Annexure 2 as the unexplained
investments of the assessee. On the basis of the fact that the
shares stood registered in the name of the assessee, the AO
made the presumptions that the appellant has actually made
the investment (i.e. that she has actually paid for the purchase
                                                              ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors

of the shares) and that the said investments were made during
the relevant year. The aforesaid material collected by the AO was
never disclosed or confronted             to the assessee and repeated
requests made by the assessee to allow inspection and supply
copies of the materials as also to grant cross-examination of the
person supplying such material was not granted to the assessee
which is duly confirmed in the assessment order itself passed
on    28.02.1995.    The      submissions      made     by   the      assessee
explaining that she had funded the investments by availing
interest-bearing loans from the 3 brokerage firms was also
rejected resulting into a huge addition being made to the income
of the assessee as unexplained investments.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">11.   Before the Ld. CIT(A) in the 1st round as well as in the 2nd
round, the assessee submitted that the evidences filed by the
assessee   vide     letters   dated       21.02.1995,   28.02.1995             and
01.03.1995 which ought to have been considered by the AO
were not considered and if the same were taken into account,
large part of the additions was liable to be deleted on that
ground alone.       It was submitted that there is no distinction
between the evidences filed by the assessee prior to 20.02.1995
and those     filed subsequently before           the    passing of the
assessment order through letters dated 21.02.1995, 28.02.1995
and 01.03.1995, all before receipt of the assessment order. The
Ld. CIT(A) in the impugned order after considering the
submissions of the appellant directed the AO to consider the
investments reflected in the aforesaid 3 letters and delete the
additions. He also directed the AO to restrict the additions by
giving due credit in respect of the shares received as bonus
shares or on account of conversion of debentures as explained
                                                             ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors

by the appellant and that such investments cannot be treated as
unexplained since there was no fresh investments made but the
shares were received through bonus issue or on account of
conversion of debentures on the existing investments. The Ld.
CIT(A)   upheld   the   addition        on   account   of      unexplained
investments only in respect of the residual investments after
granting the aforesaid reliefs. The Ld. CIT(A) also directed the
Assessing Officer that the amount of addition so sustained
should be determined by adopting the purchase rate of the
shares so treated as unexplained on the basis of the date of
purchase found in the various correspondences and the
information gathered by the AO and also after considering the
submissions of the assessee. Thus, even the challenge to
valuation adopted by the AO was granted in favour of the
assessee.
</p>

<p id="p_13">12.The ld. AR submitted that such residual additions sustained
by the Ld. CIT(A) were incorrect and unjustified for several
reasons. It is stated that the additions sustained by the Ld.
CIT(A) are summarised at Page 1 of PB. The ld AR submitted
that investments treated as unexplained are liable to be deleted
as they were duly recorded in the aforesaid books of accounts
and can also be proved with the help of contemporary evidences
which are available on record that these were accounted for
investments of the assessee. In this regard, reliance is placed by
the ld AR on the following evidences which conclusively prove
that these investments were made by the assessee and that the
same does not represent unrecorded investments of the
assessee. These evidences are as follows:

made any unexplained investments. The Hon&#x27;ble Special Court

evidences of contract notes and the averments and assertions
made by the appellant and her family members were already
accepted in each and every proceedings before Hon&#x27;ble Special

could not have taken a completely contrary view that the

when u/s 9-A of the Torts Act, only the Special Court has
exclusive jurisdiction to determine the ownership of shares in
respect of notified entities.
</p>

<p id="p_24">16.   The ld AR submitted that all the above evidences clearly
proved that the investments were duly recorded by the appellant
in the books of accounts and that the investments were made
out of the credit granted by the 3 brokerage firms in the family.
Under these circumstances, these investments cannot be treated
as unexplained u/s. 69 of the Act. This is because not only these
investments have been proved to be recorded in the books of
accounts, the nature and source of the said investments have
also been explained by way of several evidences listed above.

said case, the Hon&#x27;ble Tribunal has deleted the said addition

</pre><p id="p_27">19.   We have heard the rival submissions of both the parties
and perused the material on record. We find that in this case the
AO has considered the evidences filed by the assessee in the
form of contract notes which were filed by the assessee in
support of purchase of shares to explain investments made by
her. However, the AO considered these evidences filed by the
assessee till 20.02.1995 and framed the assessment on
28.02.1995. Thus we note that AO has ignored the evidences
filed by the assessee vide written submissions dated 21.02.1995,
28.02.1995 &amp; 01.03.1995 which has resulted into difference of
Rs.19,86,14,220/- which was added as unexplained investment.
However,   we   find   that   Ld.    CIT(A)   had   considered            the
submissions of the appellant and has granted relief in respect of
the details on the evidences filed by her on the aforesaid 3 dates
vide various submissions filed before the Assessing Officer.
Accordingly, the Assessing Officer is directed to recompute the
unexplained investment after giving credit on account of the
details on the evidences furnished by the appellant vide her
submissions dated 21.02.1995, 28.02.1995 and 01.03.1995.
The Ld. CIT(A) has also granted relief on account of the bonus
shares received by the appellant as well as the shares received
on conversion of the existing investment and debentures.
However, we fail to understand the reasons for which the
balance investments have been sustained as unexplained. We
note that the assessee has filed numerous evidences before the
Assessing Officer as well as Ld. CIT(A) to prove that all the
investments which have been treated as unexplained were duly
recorded in the books of accounts and were supported by
                                                    ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors

appropriate evidences. The investments have been reflected in
the Ledger account of investments in the books. Further, the
appellant has also filed the Ledger account of the brokerage
firms in her books to show that the shares were purchased
through the brokerage firm on credit from them. Further, the
appellant has also filed the copies of the Ledger account of the
appellant in the books of all the 3 brokerage firms reflecting
therein the details of transactions of shares purchased by them
on behalf of the appellant. Moreover, we find that these
purchases have been duly supported by the affidavits of all the 3
brokerage firms, copies of which have been filed before us at
Page 86-108 of PB No, 1. We have gone through these affidavits
and find that the brokerage firms who have purchased shares on
behalf of the appellant and duly confirmed these purchases. In
fact, they have also provided the list of shares purchased by
them on behalf of the appellant, which covers the investments
treated by the Assessing Officer as unexplained. Our attention
was also invited to the statement of Shri Ashwin Mehta recorded
u/s. 131 of the Act on 22.06.1996, wherein he had accepted
that shares were purchased by his brokers on behalf of the
family members including the appellant. It is also noted that the
custodian in its affidavit dated 01.03.2006 has accepted that the
shares are purchased on behalf of the family members including
the appellant by the brokerage firms of Harshad Mehta, Ashwin
Mehta and Jyoti Mehta. As such, in our opinion, there are ample
evidences submitted by the appellant to prove that the shares
were acquired by her through the brokerage firms on credit, and
that the shares are duly reflected in your books of accounts and
that they are fully explained. We also note that this plea of the
                                                                    ITA No.1367/M/2016 &amp; ors
                                         18                                Smt. Rina S. Mehta


assessee has been accepted by the Hon&#x27;ble Special Court and
also the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court that shares were sourced out of
three brokerage firms by taking interest bearing loan. We also
note that similar issue also came up before the co-ordinate
bench of the Tribunal in the case of related entities namely
<a href="/doc/723750/" id="a_5">Rasila Mehta and Rina S. Mehta vs. Custodian</a> (supra), <a href="/doc/808484/" id="a_6">Ashwin
S. Mehta &amp; ors. vs. Custodian</a> (supra) and these were accepted
as acquired out of credit extended by three brokerage firms. As
such, the requirement of s. 69 of the Act to prove the nature and
source of the investments made also stand satisfied, in asmuch
as the appellant has proved with evidences that the shares have
been purchased and sourced out of the credit given by the
brokerage firms. In other words, the source of these investments
are the credit granted by the brokerage firms which was also
confirmed by way of their books of accounts as well as the
affidavit confirming the transactions made by them on behalf of
the appellant. Moreover, we find that all the investments made
by the assessee including dividend and interest on debentures
etc. were accounted for in the books of accounts and therefore
the same can not be treated as unexplained investments. In our
opinion, the investments made by the assessee have been
explained with the source of funds arranged from three
brokerage firms. In our considered view, the issue is squarely
covered by the decision of the co-ordinate bench of the Tribunal
in the case of related entities <a href="/doc/125730279/" id="a_7">M/s. Hitesh S. Mehta vs. ACIT</a>
(supra) wherein the addition made under similar circumstances
have been deleted. The operative part is as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     &quot;12. We observe that the said addition comprised of various amounts as have stated
     in para 8 above. The first amount of Rs.12,38,857/- comprised of two components
     one Rs.5,09,932/- in respect of which the assessee has not been provided the third
     party evidences relied upon by the AO i.e. companies letters and these companies

      are stated on serial no 1 to 8 in para 9 above. Since the assessee has not been
      provided the copies of these letters at the time of assessment proceedings and the
      fact has been brought to the notice of the AO during assessment proceeding vide
      letter dated 27.03.2015, therefore, the addition of Rs.5,09,932/- cannot be sustained.
      This has been held by the Tribunal in the earlier round in ITA. No.538/M/2012 vide
      order dated 01.05.2013 in assessee&#x27;s own case. Pertinent to the mentioned that the
      order of the Tribunal was challenged of the revenue before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court
      and Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court vide order dated 07.06.2016 in ITA. No. 2490 of
      2013 has upheld the views of Tribunal and dismissed the question of law raised by
      the revenue. The case of the assessee is also supported by the decision of the
      Tribunal in the case of assessee&#x27;s brother Late Shri Harshad S. Mehta in ITA.
      No.637/M/2007 dated 02.01.2008 wherein it was categorically observed that
      wherever additions were made on the basis of seized material or material collected
      from third parties and copies thereof were not provided to the assessee, in that case,
      the addition cannot be made. It was also held that if the assessee has requested for
      the cross examination, an opportunity must be provided to the assessee for such
      cross examination. So far as, the second amount of 7,28,925/- representing the
      addition made on the basis of letters filed by four companies as mentioned at serial
      no. 9 to 12 in para no. 9 above, we find that in the said letters details provided were
      incomplete as it is not clear whether the same pertain to the year under
      consideration. For example, the details and information provided by these companies
      do not explain to which year these transaction relate to and there were several flaws
      in the said letters. Thus, the details provided by above 4 companies do not reflect the
      exact details to come to the conclusion the correct holding of the assessee and
      therefore, we find merits in the arguments of the Ld. AR that the addition on the
      basis of said letters is not justified and can not be sustained. Accordingly, we set
      aside the order of the CIT(A) on the issue and direct the AO to delete the addition.&quot;

<p id="p_30">21.The facts in brief are that there are certain deposits in the

In the first round of litigation the Ld. CIT(A) remanded the

the Ld. CIT(A) in the first round vide order dated 13.03.2003.
Based on the same, the Ld. CIT(A) in the second round also
confirmed the additions in the impugned order of Ld. CIT(A) by
observing that the Ld. A.R. of the assessee has not given any
further explanation and accordingly the ground of appeal of the
assessee was dismissed on this issue.
</p>
<p id="p_31">22.   The Ld. A.R. submitted before us that these deposits were
fully explained by the assessee before the Ld. CIT(A) in the first
round. The Ld. A.R. also submitted that in the second round,
the full details were given in the books of accounts produced
which were remanded back to the AO by Ld. CIT(A). However,
the authorities have failed to take cognizance of the books of
accounts and the entries recorded therein. The Ld. A.R. referred
to page No.119 of paper book No.1 which contained itemwise
details of deposits and also referred to page No.12 to 125 which
contained the copies of dividend income, miscellaneous income,

view that assessee has explained these deposit entries in the
bank statement of the assessee to the tune of Rs.10,27,900/- for
which no addition is called for. Moreover, the authorities below
have failed to taken the cognizance of books of accounts which
we have already allowed in favour of the assessee by holding
that books of accounts were incorrectly      rejected by the Ld.
CIT(A). Consequently ground No.5 is partly allowed in favour of
the assessee by directing the AO to delete addition to the tune of
Rs.10,27,900/-. Whereas balance addition of Rs.1,35,300/- is
confirmed. The ground no. 5 is partly allowed.

<p id="p_36">25.    Issue raised in ground No.6 is against the confirmation of
disallowance of interest expenses of Rs.2,04,00,000/- by Ld.
CIT(A) as made by the AO by not granting deduction on account
of funds borrowed for the purpose of investments and business.

the issue is of recurring in nature arising in every year in the
case of the assessee and also her family members for the past
several years and has been decided in favour of the assessee

relied on the following decisions of the coordinate benches in

that charging of interest under the above three sections is
mandatory. We accordingly uphold the order of Ld. CIT(A) and

                    chargeability of interest under section 234A, 234B &amp; 234C of the Act.
                    On this aspect, pleas of the assessee are two fold. First, the plea is to
                    the effect that the provisions of section 234A, 234B and 234C are not
                    applicable to notified entity. This aspect of the matter is required to
                    be held against the assessee following the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble
                    Bombay High Court in the case of Divine Holdings Pvt. Ltd( ITA
                    No.3334 of 2010 dated 7/3/2012), as decided by our Co-ordinate
                    Bench in the case Eminent Holdings Pvt. Ltd. in ITA
                    NO.2139/Mum/2013 dated 18/6/2014, which also was a case of
                    notified entity under the Special Court (Trial of Offences relating to
                    transactions in <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_10">Securities) Act</a>, 1992. At the time of hearing this
                    aspect of the matter was fairly conceded by the Ld. Representative
                    of the assessee. 6.1 The second plea of the assessee is with regard to
                    the quantum of interest chargeable under <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_11">section 234A</a>, <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_12">234B</a> &amp;
                    <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_13">234C</a> of the Act which is to the effect that the interest should be
                    charged after considering the amount of tax deductible at source on
                    the income assessed. Similar plea of the assessee was upheld by our
                    Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Eminent Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
                    Following the same, we deem it fit and proper to restore the matter
                    back to the file of AO who shall recompute the interest chargeable
                    under <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_14">section 234A</a>, <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_15">234B</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_16">234C</a> of the Act after considering the
                    amount of tax deductible at source on the income assessed.
                    Needless to mention, the AO shall allow the assessee a reasonable
                    opportunity of being heard and thereafter, recompute the interest
                    chargeable under <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_17">section 234A</a>, <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_18">234B</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_19">234C</a> of the Act, as per law.
                    Thus, on this aspect, the assessee partly succeeds.&quot;
