  rejected the representation on 14.8.2014 on the

<p id="p_26">20.       Learned advocate            Mr. A.B. Munshi for the

  authorities have deducted more than 50% of the
  land from the land which was allotted Final Plot
  No. 64 under the sanctioned Draft Town Planning
  Scheme in the year 1973 by making variation in
  the sanctioned Draft TP Scheme and thereby the
  petitioners are deprived of the valuable land
  which was allotted as Final Plot no.64. It was
  pointed out that there was no provision at the
  relevant point of time nor there was any policy
  to     deduct      more     than     50%      of    land     in      the       TP

  considering           the        provisions           pertaining               to
  statutory deduction applied for the entire Town
  Planning Scheme, proportionate land was deducted
  from the total land area and thereafter Final

  to      deprive            the        petitioners             from          getting

  be varied by applying <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_14">section 71</a> only to make

  2011, standard of deduction adopted for new TP

  petitioners was sought to be acquired in the

  reservation of the land for the purpose of slum
  clearance and housing board and road as the land
  acquisition proceedings were already initiated
  which were under challenge before this Court.
  When this Court quashed and set aside the land
  acquisition         proceedings               in    the     year        1969        by
  allowing Special Civil Application N.1014/1964,
  AMC thought it fit to vary the Town Planning
  Scheme        so   as    to     include            the    land      which         was
  proposed to be acquired under reservation for
  public purpose and accordingly Final Plot no. 64
  was     divided     into        four      parts          being      F.P.        Nos.
  64/1, 64/2 and 64/3 which were allotted to the

  State Government sanctioned the varied Draft TP

  in the gazette on 10.4.1975. Thus the varied
  Draft TP Scheme was sanctioned prior to coming
  into        force       of      the       Act,           1976.        In        such
  circumstances, the contention raised on behalf
  of the petitioners that there is a deduction of
  more than 50% of the land is not tenable, as
  such land was reserved for public purpose for

Wd/o Hansrajbhai Devjibhai Patel v. State of Gujarat</a>

Scheme.

<p id="p_40">4)     In case of <a href="/doc/128216998/" id="a_31">Satyadev Parasnath Pandey v. State of
Gujarat</a> (supra), this Court held that provisions of
<a href="/doc/48596542/" id="a_32">section 48A</a> of the Act, 1976 clinches the issue that
the land in question would vest in the authority
after the draft scheme has been approved by the State
Government.              It     was       held        that      doctrine               of
proportionality requires that the balance has to be
stuck between the individual claim and the right of
the society and accordingly when the land is reserved
for public purpose, the petitioner cannot claim any
compensation from the respondent authority.

  the Final Town Planning Scheme which has been
  sanctioned           and       has     achieved          finality            as      per

  varied final town planning scheme no.24(Manipur
  ­Distribution­ varied) and land admeasuring 7289
  sq. mtrs of Final Plot No. 64/4 is provided for
  post and telegraph and slum clearance housing.
  The scheme has thus become final and therefore,
  no    interference              can    be        made    as     the      same        has
  become part of the statute. More particularly,

  by    directing           the     petitioners            to      approach            the
  respondent authorities to make representations
  which ultimately were rejected in view of the
