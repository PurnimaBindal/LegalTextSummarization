                      genuine products of the Plaintiff only after importing the same

                      from the plaintiff.



                              3(b) The Defendant is one of the major associates of the

                      Plaintiff in India since 2005, who purchases goods from Plaintiff

                      and then sells them in the Indian market. The Plaintiff has been

                      the said trademark. The defendant also represented that it is a

                      very old establishment and has all the necessary infrastructure to

                      resell and market the products of Plaintiff.                It was clearly

                      understood between Plaintiff and the Defendant that Defendant

                      would only be permitted to resell Plaintiff's products under

                      Plaintiff's trademark.



                              3(c) In may 2014, the Plaintiff was shocked to receive a

                      complaint from an Indian company viz., M/s. Apco Trading

                      Company, who used to purchase Plaintiff's products from the

                      Defendant, in respect of quality of some of its products. The

                      above said company also forwarded some samples of "ball

                      valves" sold by the defendant, portraying them to be imported

                      from the Plaintiff directly from Italy.     M/s. Apco also forwarded

                      copy of a certificate, purportedly issued by the Plaintiff which was

                      used by the Defendant to fortify its claim that the valves came

                      from the Plaintiff while selling the same to M/s.Apco.

                              3(d) It is the contention of the Plaintiff that certificate is

                      fake certificate, which has been forged to deceive the innocent

                      customers. The products supplied by the Defendant to M/s.Apco

                      was spurious/counterfeit product and the materials used in such

                      valves did not comply with the international standards set for

                      those products and being followed by the Plaintiff. The counterfeit

                      products sold by the Defendant was deceiptively similar to the

                      original valves as manufactured by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff was

                      shocked on such revelations as the defendant at any point of

                      time never purchased any such product from the Plaintiff ever

                      since 2005.      The Plaintiff sent a warning letter dated June 9,

                      2014 called upon them to refrain from selling the counterfeit

                      product under Plaintiff's trademark and also refrain from issuing

                      false certificates. After receiving the above letter, the Defendant

                      through its C.E.O. Mr.Abbas Lehry telephonically contacted

                      Mr.Federico Salatini of the Plaintiff company on June 11, 2014.

                      During the above conversation the Defendant did not deny the

                      facts alleged facts. Further, the Defendant vide its e-mail dated

                      June 13, 2014 admitted the fact that it has been issuing the

                      certificates to the customers though such certificates were never

                      issued and/or authorised by the Plaintiff. Hence, it is the

                      contention of the Plaintiff that the Defendant sold the above

                      mentioned counterfeit product in India by falsely using the

                      Plaintiff's trademark. The Defendant has absolutely no right to

                      pass off its products as that of plaintiff's. Hence the suit.



                              4. In the written statement filed by the Defendant it is

                      averred as follows:



                              4(a). The present suit is a collusive litigation involving the

                      plaintiff      and   M/s.Apco   Trading   Co.   (hereinafter        called      as

                      brothers. In the year 1950 a firm in the name and style of

                      M/s.Lehry Brothers was started.      This firm was involved in

                      distribution of the valves apart from importing and reselling

                      valves in India. In 2006, the firm began manufacturing certain

                      types of valves apart from merely importing and reselling them.

                      The Plaintiff originally began selling its products in India only

                      from the year 1996.     Some of the products supplied by the

                      plaintiff were found to be faulty and therefore the arrangement

                      with M/s.Thakur Bhai was terminated. The Plaintiff subsequently

                      appointed separate importers for different regions in India. The

                      Plaintiff subsequently appointed separate importers for different

                      regions in India. The Plaintiff and Defendant came into contact

                      only through M/s. Modern Sales Agencies based in Mumbai who

                      was the importer of the plaintiff's products for the west and

                      south zone. The Defendant was appointed by the Plaintiff as the

                      importer for the southern zone covering the states of                 Tamil

                      Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Pondicherry.

                              4(b) In January 2012, the Defendant brought to the notice

                      of the Plaintiff that there was ample business opportunity for the

                      Plaintiff       in   an   upcoming   residential   project       in     Chennai.

                      Thereafter, the Defendant was appointed as the importer for the

                      western zone. The Defendant has on many occasions brought it

                      to the notice of the Plaintiff that the products supplied by them

                      have been found to be defective and the Plaintiff has time and

                      again agreed to replace the same. E-mail dated 04.02.2013 the

                      Defendant appraised the Plaintiff about complaints received from

                      three different clients to whom the Plaintiff's products were

                      supplied. These complaints relates to breakage of cups and

                      punchering of the diaphragm in the Pressure Reducing Valves,

                      leakage in 3” Ball valves and deviation in the angle of the threads

                      in 3/4” Ball valves which were not parallel.             Similar complaints

                      also received from M/s. Lanco a customer based in Hyderabad.

                      By various correspondence, the Defendant also brought to the

                      notice of the Plaintiff about the defects. Only the Defendant has

                      increased the turnover of the Plaintiff's products in and is

                      importing and reselling products of the Plaintiff worth about Rs.4

                      Crores.         The Defendant's turnover for the Plaintiff's products in

                      India is more than the turnover earned by all other importers of

                      the Plaintiff's products in India.         The Defendant is currently

                      holding the products imported from the Plaintiff worth Rs.3

                      Crores. The Defendant has not used the trademark "RB".



                              4(c) It is the further contention that the Plaintiff in fact

                      provides only one certificate covering the entire consignment of

                      imported products.           However, the Defendant has to annex a

                      quality certificate with each and every sale of the Plaintiff's

                      products to third party consumers.          Many of the buyers of the

                      plaintiff's products are contractors and builders to whom the

                      products cannot be sold without annexing quality certificates.

                      Further the Defendant in many cases sell small quantities where

                      the buryers pay the value by cash and the products have to be

                      delivered immediately. In such cases also the Defendant cannot

                      wait for the Plaintiff to send quality certificates which have to be

                      issued to the Defendant. Therefore the Plaintiff was made aware

                      that the Defendant would be annexing copies of the certificates

                      sent by the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff at no point of time objected

                      to the same. However, in order to suit the convenience of the

                      Plaintiff, the facts have been twisted by the Plaintiff alleging that

                      the Defendant have been issuing forged certificates. Hence, it is

                      the contention of the Defendant that the suit itself engineered by

                      its   competitor     and   the   Defendant    is   never       involved       in

                      manufacturing counterfeit products.



                              5. In the reply statement the Plaintiff has stated that

                      through their local representative in India Mr.Sudhir Paithankar,

                      they discovered the counterfeit valves bearing the RB sign

                      supplied by the Defendant, have been used by Amrappali Group

                      in NOIDA. They found that the valves supplied were counterfeit,

                      and even the cartons were tampered.

                      India. The firm has been continuously trading in valves and

                      plumbing equipment since then. The Defendant began selling its

                      They also specifically brought to the notice of the Defendant

                      about the complaint received from three different clients to

                      whom the Defedant's products               were supplied. In this regard,

                      various letters also sent to the Defendant. The Plaintiff from

                      2005 has increased the turnover of the Defendant's products in

                      India and was importing and reselling products of the Plaintiff

                      worth about Rs.4 Crores. The Plaintiff's turnover for the

                      Defendant's products in India was more than the turnover earned

                      by all the other importers of the Defendant's products in India.



</p><p id="p_22">                              9(b) Under these circumstances the Plaintiff was shocked to

                      receive a notice dated 09.06.2014 from attorneys alleging that

                      the Plaintiff was involved in manufacturing counterfeits of the

                      defendant's products and selling them in the market in India.

                      The same was denied by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff currently

                      holding the products       imported from the Defendant worth

                      Rs.2,46,687,371.00. When the matter stood thus the Defendant

                      has sent letter dated 08.07.2014 informed all customers of the

                      Defendant's products that the business arrangement between the

                      Plaintiff and defendant stood terminated and requested that all

                      pending requests for products should be redirected to the

                      Defendant directly and several notices also sent to the other

                      customers of the Plaintiff. Many pending invoices raised by the

                      Plaintiff were not paid by the customers due to the false

                      allegations circulated by the Defendant.       The Defendant spread

                      false allegations against the Plaintiff with the knowledge                that

                      these allegation are false and with an aim to bring disrepute to

                      the Plaintiff. These have been calculated              to    damage the

                      reputation of the plaintiff in the market as a leading supplier of

                      the Defendant's products. Hence the suit.



</p><p id="p_23">                              10. In the written statement filed by the Defendant in

                      C.S.No.891 of 2015 it is averred as follows:



</p><p id="p_24">                              10(a). It is the case of the Defendant that the present suit

                      is merely a counter blast to the suit for “passing off” filed on

                      behalf of the Defendant bearing C.S.No.405 of 2014 pending

                      before this Court and there is no merit in this suit. There is no

                      cause of action in favour of the Plaintiff to file the present suit

                      and reiterated his pleadings raised in C.S.No.405 of 2014

                      pending before this court. Hence the same need not be once

                      again repeated.

                      expressed its concern.             However, Defendant avoided such

                      concerns. It is his contention that around May 2014 the plaintiff

                      has received samples of valves purportedly manufactured by the

                      Plaintiff by an Indian Company namely, Apco Trading Company.

                      Thereafter he found that thay all manufactured by the Defendant

                      are counterfeit. Ex.P.15 Investigation Report filed by the Plaintff

                      clearly proves the     counterfeit products manufactured by the

                      Defendant.       The   evidence   of   the   person       who      prepared

                      investigation report clinchingly established the fact that the

                      Defendant is using counterfeit product and passing off the goods.

                      Ex.P.19 Trade Mark Applications given by the Defendant itself

                      clearly established the fact that the Defendant claimed to be

                      manufacturered the he using the product from 2008.                    Ex.P.19

                      Trade Mark Application filed by the Defendant established fact

                      that the Defendant used the mark of the Plaintiff.             Ex.P.19 and

                      the oral evidence of P.W.1     probabalise the plaintiff's case that

                      the counterfeit valves were being sold in India by using the trade

                      mark of the plaintiff.    The Defendant has purposefully avoided

                      the answer a question relating to the import data.               The above

                      conduct also clearly established the mala fide intention of the

                      Defendant company.

                      Ex.P.13 has accepted the generating both quality Certificates but

                      denied the sale of counterfeit goods. It is the further contention

                      of the learned counsel that to prove the allegation of the

                      defendant that customers are buying the goods. No one was

                      examined in this regard by the Defendant. Whereas the Passing

                      off Plaintiff goods have been clearly established. Further, nothing

                      prevented the Defendant from clear the goods. Therefore, there

                      cannot be any damages either for defamation or for the goods

                      imported by the Defendants. Exs.D.18 to D.33, Ex.D.36, Ex.D.8

                      and Ex.D.46 are only a photocopies those documents cannot be

                      given any important.           Ex.P.19 series proves          the fact that the

                      Defendant company was admittedly the importer of the plaintiff's

                      product         and   trade   mark   is   the   plaintiff's     trademark,          the

                      Defendant filing the application claiming the trademark of the

                      damages.           Hence, it is his contention that Ex.P.19 itself clearly

                      proved not only passing off but also counterfeit product being

                      sold by the Defendant.              Hence, it is his contention that the

                      Plaintiff is entitled to decree and judgement in the suit with

                      punitive damages and the cross suit filed by the Defendant has to

                      Defendant           submitted       that   admittedly       there      is    no     proof

                      whatsoever filed by the Plaintiff to prove the alleged counterfeit

                      products.          What the plaintiff sought in the plaint is to seek

                      legitimate accounts of the Defendant.                  It is his contention that

                      the relationship between the Plaintiff and Defendant is Principal

                      and Dealer. Only the defendant has enhanced the reputation of

                      the Plaintiff in India. Only in order to terminate the dealership

                      the entire suit has been filed with the help of the competitor of

                      the defendant in the market.                  The alleged investigation report

                      and the alleged samples sent by the Apco, the competitor of the

                      Defendant is fabricated only to do away with the Defendant from

                      the business. Further, it is his contention that the Plaintiff used

                      to sell the bulk of goods and issue only one Certificate and it was

                      the practice that in order to annex a quality certificate with each

                      and every sale of the Plaintiff products to third party customer a

                      xerox certificate generated and given to the purchasers. It is the

                      practice in the field, that has been taken by the Plaintiff to

                      contend that the Defendant is generating the bogus certificate

                      thereby selling counterfeit products. Ex.P.13 Reply Notice cannot

                      be taken into admission. What was contended in the above notice

                      is to explain the true facts.    Therefore, such notice cannot be

                      treated as admission.

                      counterfeit products filed. Ex.D.5 termination letter did not refer

                      as counterfeit. Even in the evidence no question was put to the

                      Defendant on the above certificate etc., The Plaintiff has invoked

                      the Letter of Credit on 24.2.2014 thereafter issued letters to all

                      the dealers stating that the Defendant dealt with the counterfeit.

                      The termination was made with bad faith only to tarnish the

                      image of the Defendant. No complaint whatsoever ever raised by

                      the purchaser questioning the alleged counterfeit goods dealt by

                      the Defendant. Ex.P.15 Report is fabricated one and the evidence

                      was collected only after the suit. In Ex.P.9 there is interpolation.

                      Ex.P.8 series photographs alone filed. No evidence to show who

                      took the photographs. Ex.P.10 is also not admissible since it is

                      issued by some other company.        Ex.P.11 original data was not

                      marked which is admitted by the Plaintiff.             It is his further

                      contention that Ex.P.14 Photographs matched with the photos

                      contained in Ex.P.16.     It is clearly indicated that the alleged

                      inspection is an after thought. In fact even at the time of filing of

                      the Plaint there is no whisper about the counterfeit products.

                      The evidence created after the suit at the instance of Apco who is

                      the competitor of the Defendant.     Hence it is the contention of

                      the learned Senior Counsel that all the documents relied upon by

                      the Plaintiff is not admissible in evidence. Whereas the e-mails to

                      various customers of the Defendants clearly defamed the

                      defendant and tarnished their name.        The Plaintiff having sent

                      the materials and encashed LOC has spread the false rumours as

                      against the Defendant, which prevented the sale of the original

                      materials. Therefore, it is his contention that the plaintiff has to

                      compensate for the loss sustainable by the Defendant due to

                      non-sale of the goods.

                      is concerned, misrepresentation has not pleaded and the Plaintiff

                      himself admitted that the suit is only for the ball valves and no

                      turnover particulars given in the suit.            Turnover for India not

                      pleaded and the auditors were not examined. P.W.2's cross

                      examination specifically indicated that no counterfeit product

                      that certificates submitted by the defendant, there are many

                      typographical errors hence it is the contention of the plaintiff that

                      the defendant used fake certificate and forged the certificate of

                      the plaintiff to deceive the innocent customer.               Further, the

                      counterfeit products and also by forging the certificate issued by

                      the Plaintiff.    Ex.P.9 series when carefully seen, absolutely there

                      is no dispute with regard to the plaintiff's trademark and their

                      business dealing with the valves of various varieties. The plaintiff

                      2005.       This fact is not in dispute. Specific contention of the

                      plaintiff is that on 15.05.2014, they received a complaint from

                      one M/s.Apco Trading Company. Only on the basis of the above

                      counterfeiting the product and also forging the certificate issued

                      by the Plaintiff.      Ex.P.9 is filed by the Plaintiff in this regard to

                      prove the alleged counterfeit and forgery committed by the

                      Defendant.       Ex.P.9 series filed to show that the Defendant has

                      passing off only in respect of the Ball Valves. It is to be noted

                      that the date mentioned in Ex.P.9, does not match with the date

                      on which they purchased the goods from the Defendant. P.W.1

                      also admitted in his evidence that the date of Ball Valve certifying

                      in Ex.P.9 is 5.4.2012. Whereas the products said to have been

                      purchased in the year 2014.       Similarly, P.W.1 in his question

                      purchaser only when he purchases the product from the seller. It

                      is also to be noted that when the alleged invoices Ex.P.9 relates

                      to the Ball Valves only, the question of issuing certificate for the

                      admitted that the Pressure Reducing Valves never sold under

                      Invoice Ex.P.9.            When the particular goods itself were not sold,

                      their allegation that the forged certificate was issued by the

                      Defendant in respect of the goods which was never sold is highly

                      improbable.           The main contention of the plaintiff that the

                      defendant have generated the certificates issued by the Plaintiff

                      in respect of their goods and admitted the same in their e-mail

                      communications.             The Defendant in their written statement has

                      admitted that the average size of any consignment imported

                      from the plaintiff is a container of goods which has around

                      40,000 to 50,000 pieces. Unlike such a bulk import, the

                      Defendant          sells     the        imported    products      in    much        smaller

                      quantities. For instance, there are customers who by 10 or 20

                      pieces.         The plaintiff provides only one certificate covering the

                      entire      consignment            of    imported    products.           However,         the

                      defendant has to annex a quality certificate with each and every

                      sale of the plaintiff's products to third party consumers. Since,

                      many of the buyers of the plaintiff's products are contractors and

                      builders to whom the products cannot be sold without annexing

                      quality certificates and since small quantities to be delivered

                      immediately, the defendant cannot wait for the plaintiff to send

                      quality certificate which have to be issued to the Defendant.

                      Therefore, the Plaintiff was made aware that the defendant would

                      be annexing copies of the certificates sent by the Plaintiff and the

                      Plaintiff at no point of time objected the same. Further the

                      admitted in question No.147 tht a certificate can be given only

                      when he purchases the product from the seller.               He has also

                      admitted that Ex.P.9 does not say the certificates are attached.

                      Ex.P.9 there are two certificates available.        It is stated in the

                      plaint that the alleged sale of Ball Valves in the year 2014.

                      Whereas the certificates annexed in Ex.P.9 show that the year of

                      2012. Further one of the certificates also relate to the Pressure

                      Reducing Valve in the year 2014. Curious to note such sale was

                      made to M/s.Apco Trading Co., as could be seen from the invoice

                      dated 07.04.2014.      Therefore, merely, on the ground that the

                      defendant has admitted in the e-mail that they are generating

                      certificates to annex the same whenever the small quantity sold,

                      it cannot be concluded that the entire certificate of the defendant

                      has been forged. Initial burden lies on the plaintiff to prove not

                      only the manufacture of the counterfeit product but also the plea

                      of forgery of certificates. The alleged forged certificate has not

                      been filed.     Further, the counterfeit products also not been

                      Project name is known as `Jaypee Aman'. As per the Plan, the

                      IO visited the project and enquired some people and clicked the

                      Plaintiff show that the valves are manufactured by the defendant

                      which was prepared by one Mr.Sudhir Paithankar. He has given a

                      report on the basis of the visual examination on the valves based

                      on the Investigation Report filed under Ex.P.15.                         Ex.P.15

                      However, no original documents could be recovered from the I.O.

                      The I.O also said to have been clicked certain photographs and

                      left the premises. Based on the above photographs Ex.P16 said

                      to be the export report came to be filed. It is relevant to note

                      that the I.O. has not seized any material objects. It is also found

                      from the report that apart from the plaintiff there are one other

                      suppliers viz., V.H.Shaw company also supplied the products to

                      the defendant.     Therefore, when there are many suppliers who

                      supplied the valves, without any concrete evidence that the

                      alleged counterfeit valves are actually supplied by the Defendant

                      the court cannot infer or presume that the defendant in fact the

                      manufactured of the counterfeit products and supplied to the

                      customers. One another aspect to doubt the contention of the

                      plaintiff with regard to the alleged counterfeit products is Ex.P.16.

                      Ex.P.16 report prepared by one Mr.Sudhir Paithangar has not

                      examined before this Court.

                      has conducted the visual examination on the valves randomly

                      selected and found in the mentioned construction site. So

                      according to the Report only Valves collected from the site were

                      of materials whatsoever effected from the site.                     Similarly, in

                      Ex.P.16         series,   the   report   of   Mr.Sudhir       Paithankar,         the

                      photographs of valves annexed in the report on bare comparison

                      with Ex.P.14 makes it clear that the photographs contained in

                      Ex.P.14 are identical with the Ex.P.16 photographs.                         Ex.P.14

                      contention of the Defendant that the said Apco is the competitor

                      of the defendant and he was the root cause for filing the suit by

                      report have been fabricated and created after the filing of the

                      suit.     Further the author of Ex.P.14 is also not examined and

                      Ex.P.15 does not indicate that the investigation officer recovered

                      the counterfeit product allegedly found on both sites.                        Whereas

                      appointed as the distributor for the Western Zone which has been

                      clearly admitted by the plaintiff in his evidence. From the cross

                      examination of P.W.1, it can be seen that only after the complaint

                      from one M/s. Apco Trading Co., Ex.P.12 letter was sent to the

                      defendant. In Ex.P.12, it is not specifically stated by the plaintiff

                      that counterfeit of Ball Valves were sold by the defendant. It is

                      to be noted that the suit itself is for 'passing off' with respect of

                      Ball Valves as admitted by the plaintiff. If really the plaintiff were

                      sure that the defendant was dealing with the counterfeit products

                      of ball valves, there is no reason as to why it has not been

                      mentioned in Ex.P.12. Ex.P.12 only relates to Pressure Reducing

                      Valves (PRV). It is not stated specifically by the plaintiff that the

                      defendant is selling counterfeit valves in Ex.P.12.               It is also

                      admitted by P.W.1 in his evidence.             Whereas, as already

                      products since the company has industrial mass production to

                      the case, merely some damage in diaphragm found by the

                      Investigating Officer, it cannot be concluded that all the defects

                      15, 20 mm 40 mm valves. These discrepancies in size of the so-

                      called pressure reducing value also create serious doubt about

                      the entire plaintiff case. When the invoice Ex.P.9 sent by Apco

                      shows as if ball valves have been sold by the defendant.                   The

                      next question arises is how the test report certificate relates to

                      Pressure Reducing Valve.      This is also one of the reason which

                      create doubt about the alleged test report contained in Ex.P.9.

                      advertisement Ex.P.17 after getting approval from the plaintiff,

                      for which the defendant has not denied specifically.               Whereas,

                      P.W.1 has said that he do not remember. The plaintiff has also

                      admitted that the advertisement in Ex.P.17 was corrected by Mr.

                      registration of the Trade Mark. Ex.P.19 indicate that application

                      was given by the Defendant company on 12.03.2013 claiming

                      included in Class 06 for mark “RB”.          It is the contention of the

                      plaintiff       that   the   Defendant   deliberately      applied       for     the

                      registration of the Plaintiff's mark and pursuing such application

                      till 03.06.2017.        Thereafter he proceeded to withdraw the said

                      application.       The conduct of filing application for registration of

                      the “RB” trademark itself indicate that the Defendant was selling

                      the products of the Plaintiff.       No doubt Ex.P.19 was filed by the

                      defendant for the registration of the trade mark “RB” in

                      mistake and it is the contention of the defendant that he was not

                      aware of the such application being filed before the trademark

                      and the same was filed by his son. The defendant wanted to have

                      the trade mark for its lehry lavy brand to be registered. Mr.

                      registration of the trademark himself and he has erroneously

                      appliced “RB” Logo.        Though the Defendant has given an

                      explanation in the application       was given erroneously                 and

                      inadvertently, such explanation cannot be countenanced for the

                      simple reason that the application in fact signed by the

                      defendant.      Therefore, the explanation in this regard has no

                      presumption that the Defendant has sold the goods of the

                      Plaintiff. Such presumption cannot be drawn merely on such

                      applications for the simple reason that the plaintiff has appointed

                      the Defendant as dealer, not only in the south India but also

                      Bombay as per his evidence and he has also admitted that the

                      defendant was major reseller of Plaintiff's products in India.

                      Further there is no evidence whatsoever available on the side of

                      Plaintiff at the time of trade mark application dated 12.03.2013.

                      There were counterfeit products manufactured and sold by the

                      made in Itali.          As discussed above, the question of taking

                      evidence by the investigator is also highly improbable. As already

                      discussed above, the investigation report, the photographs in fact

                      allegedly sent by the Apco. Such being the position unless the

                      plaintiff       establishes with concrete evidence that the defendant

                      has manufactured the counterfeit product at the time of

                      applications merely some applications filed for registration of

                      trade mark RB, it cannot be concluded that the defendant has

                      manufactured counterfeit ball valves. Though the filing of such

                      application for RB mark not legally correct and give rise to an

                      inference that the defendant make such applications to sell its

                      product in the name of the Plaintiff.       The issue remains in this

                      case not really selling the plaintiff's product. The specific issue is

                      with regard to the alleged counterfeit product manufactured by

                      the Defendant. Unless there is concrete evidence adduced by the

                      Plaintiff to prove the manufacture of the counterfeit product at

                      that time, this court is of the view that merely on the basis of the

                      Ex.P.19, it cannot be concluded that the defendant in fact

                      seller of the plaintiff.   This fact is not in dispute. On entire

                      perusal of the evidence of P.W.1 the dispute mainly started when

                      the turnover     has come down at the relevant point of time.

                      Merely because of turnover has come down that may not be a

                      ground to hold that such short of sale was because of the

                      counterfeit product and such inference cannot be drawn.                    The

                      increase or decrease of the turnover always depends upon the

                      various factors. One cannot expect that only the plaintiff goods

                      always sold and turnover will increase every year.               Therefore,

                      merely on that ground, it cannot be inferred            that there were

                      counterfeit products. Admittedly the defendant also dealing with

                      the plumbing and similar business.             The Defendants also

                      manufactured different type of valves from the year 1996. Such

                      being the position, when the plaintiff's specific allegation that the

                      Defendant is manufactured the counterfeit products of the

                      plaintiff, the entire burden lies on the plaintiff to establish the

                      manufacture of counterfeit product of the plaintiff. Except relying

                      upon the investigation report, which has also contained serious

                      discrepancies as discussed above, this Court is unable to

                      countenance the contention of the plaintiff. Further no materials

                      whatsoever filed in this regard to show that the products are

                      the question of directing the defendant to disclose the identity of

                      the counterfeit goods allegedly sold by him does not arise. The

                      allegation of manufacturing counterfeit products.

                      volume of ball valves. The Plaintiff neither pleaded nor proved his

                      turnover before the court.         Similarly not a single alleged

                      counterfeit product is produced. From the above discussions this

                      Court answer all the issues against the Plaintiff.



                      Issues in C.S.891 of 2015:
</p>
<p id="p_114">                              48. The Defendant in C.S.No.405 of 2014 is the Plaintiff in

                      C.S.No.891 of 2015. Under Ex.P.12 dated 09.06.2014 letter was

                      sent charging the Defendant that the Defendant manufacturing

                      products and selling the same as that of Plaintiff's products. As

                      discussed the earlier issues in O.S.No.405 of 2014 miserably

                      failed to establish the counterfeit products, the ball valves.

                      Further it is also relevant to note that the plaintiff in C.S.No.405

                      of 2014 has not taken any application for appointment of

                      Advocate Commissioner. Whereas the Defendant/Plaintiff has

                      filed an application for appointment of Advocate Commissioner to

                      find out        any counterfeit product.   The Commissioner in fact

                      examined the goods supplied by the Plaintiff. The Commissioner

                      did not find any counterfeit products.               The Report of the

                      Commissioner also filed on record. No objection whatsoever filed

                      by the Plaintiff in C.S.No.405 of 2014 in this regard. Further it

                      has already held above that the Plaintiff has not produced any

                      original certificate. Quality Certificates annexed with Ex.P.9 also

                      having corrections and interpolations.        Whereas, as discussed in

                      the previous issues, the original certificate has not been filed. In

                      this regard the Defendant has also spoken about the necessity

                      for generating the certificate.       In the written statement, the

                      Defendant's specific case is that since large size of consignment

                      reported from the Plaintiff that it is a container around 40,000 to

                      50,000 pieces, the Defendant used to provide only one certificate

                      covering the entire consignment of their products. Therefore, to

                      annex the quality certificate each and every sale of the

                      Defendant's products to third party consumers after making the

                      plaintiff aware that the Defendant would be annexing the copies

                      of the certificate.      In this regard evidence of P.W.1 is also not

                      denied in the cross examination. When the explanation offered

                      by the witness and spoken in the chief examination not

                      controverted nor denied, such evidence deemed to be the

                      vacated the Plaintiff sent the communication dated 8.7.2014 to

                      all the customers that the relationship with the Defendant is

                      has invoked the letter of credit for a sum of Rs.64,84,371/-

                      towards the goods imported by the Defendant in May 2014 prior

                      to the termination.      Ex.D.4 is Letter of Credit. The LC was

                      encashed when the goods of the plaintiff was struck with the

                      defendant. Thereafter several communications were sent to the

                      customers as discussed above alleging the counterfeit products.

                      Having admitted that Ex.D.5 never intended to blame the

                      defendant for counterfeit products, thereafter           communication

                      was sent under Ex.D.12 dated 7.4.2015.        Further the Plaintiff in

                      O.S.No.405 of 2014has admitted writing letters Ex.D.9 to the

                      customers. After the termination of the dealership under Ex.D.8

                      dated 26.8.2014 it is also admitted by the Plaintiff during his

                      cross examination that they have permitted the Defendant to sell

                      evidence also stated that several customers also received such

                      letters terminating him as counterfeiter. However, no cross

                      examination whatsoever done by the plaintiff in this regard. The

                      Ex.D.8 and Ex.D.9 and the admission of P.W.1 also clearly

                      indicated that the communications were sent to the customers

                      defaming the defendant. Above communications are in fact

                      without any evidence, therefore such conduct certainly amounts

                      to defamation. Further without establishing the counterfeit

                      products, having supplied the goods and encahsing LoC and

                      entitled to a sum of Rs.3,02,57,868/- till the date of payment of

                      redelivery of the goods, it is admitted by the Senior counsel that

                      goods           worth   Rs.1,13,00,000/-   already         sold       by       the

                      Defendant/Plaintiff in O.S.No.891 of 2015. In view of the above

                      and further fact that LoC has also encahsed, this Court is of the

                      view that there is no need whatsoever for directing the

                      Defendant/Plaintiff in C.S.No.405 of 2014 to pay that amount.

                      Admittedly the Defendant/Plaintiff in C.S.891 of 2015                    is also

                      dealing with the similar business from the year 1996, now the

                      products are already with them, such view of the matter,                       the

                      Defendant can market the above goods in his own name, though

                      it contains the mark of the plaintiff. Till such goods are sold, the

                      plaintiff has no right whatsoever to complain about the goods

                      being sold by the defendants. Similarly Plaintiff in O.S.No.405 of

                      2014 is not entitled to make any further defamatory statement

                      in view of the fact that immediately after the goods were

                      imported by the plaintiff Letter of Credit has been encashed and

                      dealership agreement was terminated. Such view of the matter

                      this    court    is   of   the    view   that   the     Defendant/Plaintiff           in

                      C.S.No.891 of 2015 is entitled to sell the goods imported from

                      the Plaintiff in the same mark and liquidate the same.



</p><p id="p_120">                              52. This court is not inclined to pass any direction to the

                      Plaintiff in C.S.No.405 of 2014 for payment of money towards the

                      goods, since the Defendant is also involved in the same business

                      and dealing with the products. Therefore he can very well

                      liquidate the stock. Accordingly the money claimed by the

                      Defendant/Plaintiff in C.S.No.405 of 2014 is negatived.

                      However,        taking     into   consideration    of    the     nature       of    the

                      defamations, the defamatory statements made against the

                      Ball Valves has not been established, this court is of the view that

                      loss of reputation.    It is admitted case of both side that the

                      and branding him as a counterfeiter, certainly would have caused

                      loss to reputation as well as business. Further fact that the

                      evidence of the D.W.1 that the turnover has completely reduced

                      because of such communications by the plaintiff also probabalise

                      the case of the defendant for claiming compensation.               Though,

                      Rs.50 lakhs compensation is claimed by the Defendant/Plaintiff in

                      C.S.No.891 of 2015, this court taking into consideration of

                      overall situation and the nature of the evidence, particularly non-

                      denial of evidence of the D.W.1 as to the reduction of the

                      turnover, inclined to award the Defendant                     a sum of
