</pre>
<p id="p_1">Ashok Bhushan, C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           The only question to be decided in this Original

Petition is as to whether the petitioner is entitled for

compensation for the improvements made on the land, given

as Kuthakapattom lease to his late father, which land has been

resumed by the State Government on 04.08.1997. Against the

judgment dated 06.12.2007 passed by this Court in Review

Petitions and Original Petition, the State Government filed a

Special Leave Petition. The Supreme Court vide its judgment

and order dated 06.08.2014 disposed                   the Civil Appeal

Nos.5355 - 5357 of 2009 by setting aside the order of the High

Court and remitting the matter to the High Court for

reconsideration of the issue whether the 1st respondent (the

petitioner in this O.P.) is entitled for compensation on account

of the improvements made on the land.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           2. Before we proceed to consider the issues it is

necessary to note the relevant facts which emerge from the

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -:2:-</span>


pleadings of the parties. Reference of various earlier proceedings

undertaken in respect of the land also need to be noted.

Kuthakapattom lease of 94 Acres of land in Survey No.745/1 of

Thingal Karikkakom village and 3.32 Acres in Survey No.86/1 of

Chithara Village was granted to petitioner's father Thangalkunju

Musaliyar in the year 1944 under the scheme "Grow More Food".

The trees which were standing on the land were cut on

01.01.1948 by the Government Authorities from the leased area

and the trees and firewood were collected and put to auction by

notice dated 04.10.1948 on 01.11.1948. The Lessee made

considerable improvements in the property including planting of

rubber trees during the period 1962-'63.       The father of the

petitioner died in the year 1966 and thereafter the petitioner

came into possession and enjoyment of the property as the legal

heir. Under the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 proceedings were

undertaken against the petitioner to the effect that the petitioner

had to surrender 101.88 Acres, including the 94 Acres held as

Kuthakappattam lease treating it as excess land. The petitioner

resisted it and contended that the property has to be exempted

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                -:3:-</span>


being rubber plantation prior to 01.04.1964.    The Taluk Land

Board upheld the plea of the petitioner holding that there is no

excess land. The State filed CRP No.2180/1978 in the High Court

against the decision of the Taluk Land Board, which CRP was

dismissed by the High Court on 05.12.1980. SLP(C) No.2833 of

1981 filed by the State before the Supreme Court was also

dismissed on 09.08.1982.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            3.    In the mean time in the year 1971 the Village

Officer booked Land Conservancy Case No.35/1971 alleging

illegal occupation by the petitioner. Notice under Rule 9 of the

Kerala Land Conservancy Rules was served on the petitioner.

The petitioner appeared and filed written objection.          The

Tahsildar imposed a fine of Rs.25/- and Prohibitory assessment

amounting to Rs.470/-. It was stated that since the Pattam has

been received up to 1971-72, the prohibitory assessment for the

relevant period alone would be realised. The petitioner filed Land

Conservancy Appeal No.2222/1973 which was dismissed by the

Revenue Divisional Officer by order dated 30.04.1973.

</p><p id="p_5">            4. Petitioner filed revision before the Board of

Revenue. The Board of Revenue stayed the eviction proceedings

vide its order dated 07.05.1973. Subsequently the Board of

Revenue by order dated 24.09.1973 intimated the petitioner that

the revision is to be filed before the District Collector, Kollam.

Petitioner submitted a revision petition on 03.11.1973 before the

District Collector. The revision petition was heard by the District

Collector who vide order dated 26.02.1974 confirmed the position

declared by Revenue Divisional Officer. Petitioner approached the

Government and obtained stay on 06.05.1974. The Stay order

granted by the State Government was vacated on 31.08.1989.

After the State Government vacated the Stay order, petitioner

submitted a representation to the State Government for

assignment of 94 Acres of land in Survey No.745/1. The District

Collector vide order dated 24.10.1994 recommended assignment

of 94 Acres of land in Survey No.745/1.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            5. During the year 1994-95 the State Government

proposed a Scheme for        rehabilitation of 75 'Kani' families

(Aadivasi) who were evicted from Vamanapuram Irrigation

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               -:5:-</span>


Project.   The State Government decided to acquire altogether

about 124 Acres of land from the petitioner which includes the

land in Survey No.745/1(94 Acres). Order dated 27.05.1995 was

issued by the Government of Kerala to the concerned District

Collectors, directing to take necessary action for procurement of

land after detailed valuation by the Revenue Authorities.

Pursuant to the said Government Order, a High Power Meeting

was convened chaired by the Minister of Irrigation and Cultural

Affairs which included Secretaries of Irrigation, Revenue and

Forest Departments and other officials. In the meeting the Joint

Secretary (Revenue) told that 94 Acres of Government Land now

under the custody of petitioner is only an unauthorised

occupation by the petitioner, as the lease of the property has not

so far been extended. After considering all aspects Government

decided to resume the land after paying the value of

improvements in the 94 Acres and the Tahsildar, Pathanapuram

was directed to take urgent steps for valuation of the

improvements in the 94 Acres.       Tahsildar submitted a report

dated 30.04.1996 valuing the improvements effected in 94 Acres

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                -:6:-</span>


as Rs.1,70,94,000/-. The valuation was objected by the

petitioner.    On 11.04.1997 the Tahsildar prepared a second

valuation report confirming the earlier valuation. The petitioner

bonafide believed that in view of the representation made before

the Government to pay the value of improvements, proceedings

are under way and he shall be paid the value of improvements

before taking any decision regarding the resumption of land. The

State Government without giving any reason, vide its order dated

28.07.1997,       intimated that   the petitioner's request   for

assignment of 94 Acres of land in Survey No.745/1 is rejected.

</p><p id="p_7">            6.     A notice dated 01.08.97 was issued by the

Tahsildar, Pathanapuram to the petitioner stating that since the

Kuthakapattom for about 94 Acres of land was not renewed after

the death of petitioner's father and there was violation of the

terms of the agreement and the Land Conservancy Case was

decided against the petitioner, the petitioner should handover

possession. Petitioner was directed to be present on 04.08.1997

to handover the possession. The notice dated 01.08.1997 was

served on one of the staff of the petitioner on 02.08.1997.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       -:7:-</span>


Aggrieved by the decision of Government, petitioner filed this

Original Petition No.13433 of 1997 on 04.08.1997 itself praying

for the following reliefs:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "i) to call for and examine the records leading to Ext.P6

      notice and to quash the same by the issuance of a writ of

      certiorari or other appropriate writ, direction or order;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       ii) to declare that the respondents have no manner of right to

      resume the 94 Acres of land in Sy. No.745/1 of Thingal

      Karikkakam Village, 3.32 Acres in Sy. No.86/1 of Chithara

      Village from the possession of the petitioner and direct the

      respondents to reconvey the land assumed possession.

       Iii) alternative declare that the respondents shall have no right

      to take forcible possession of 94 Acres of land in Sy. No.745/1

      of Thingalkarikkakam Village without payment of adequate

      and reasonable compensation."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              7. Petitioner filed two applications for interim relief

which were rejected by the learned Single Judge against which

W.A. No.1497 of 1997 was filed which appeal was dismissed with

the observation that the Original Petition itself is being posted for

hearing.      The Original Petition was disposed of by a Division

Bench vide its judgment dated 28.01.2005. The Division Bench

held that the right of the Government to resume the land cannot

be questioned and the only remedy available to the petitioner is

with regard to the compensation. Since the report of the

Tahsildar and other documents were before the Government, this

Court observed that the Government may take a final decision

with regard to value of improvements effected by the petitioner.</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">            8. The petitioner filed a Review Petition No.289 of

2005. The Division Bench on 06.02.2006 directed the Revenue

Secretary to make available the records of land conservancy

cases passed by different authorities. Again on 07.03.2006 when

the records were not produced, the Division Bench directed the

responsible officer of the Revenue Department to be present

before the Court on 13.03.2006. The officers appeared and

informed the Court that files relating to land conservancy case

are not traceable.     On 13.03.2006 the Court directed the

Secretary to take a decision on the valuation of improvements

within one month. R.P. No.1115 of 2006 was also filed by the

State of Kerala. Both the Review Petitions as well as Original

Petition were decided by the Division Bench vide the judgment

dated 06.12.2007. The Division Bench during the pendency of

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     -:9:-</span>


the Review Petitions has also appointed an expert commissioner

to value the improvements in the land. The expert commissioner

has submitted a report regarding the value of the improvements.

The Division Bench after considering the earlier report of

Tahsildar on the valuation who suggested Rs.1,70,94,000/- and

by subsequent report of the expert commissioner who assessed

the value as Rs.1,34,44,340/- disposed of the Original Petition

and Review Petitions as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "In the result, the review petitions and the original petition are

      disposed of as follows : (1) We find that the petitioner is not

      entitled to get back the property from the Government, (2) We

      hold that the petitioner is entitled to the value of improvements

      of Rs.1,34,44,340/- (rupees one crore, thirty four lakhs, forty

      four thousand, three hundred and forty only) and that the

      Government is directed to pay the same, (3) It is also held that

      the Government shall not distribute the land without making the

      payment for the value of improvements and (4) We direct the

      Government to pay the amount within 3 months from today,

      failing which the petitioner will be entitled to 6% interest on the

      said sum from the date of default (i.e.after the period of 3

      months)."

</p><p id="p_11">             9. Against that judgment dated 06.12.2007 the State

filed Special Leave Petitions in the Supreme Court which were

decided on 06.08.2014 and the Civil Appeal numbers are 5355 -

5357 of 2005. The State Government, in compliance of the

Division Bench judgment dated 06.12.2007, has deposited the

amount of compensation before the Registrar (General),High

Court of Kerala. The Apex Court passed directions in the Civil

Appeals permitting the petitioner to withdraw the amount by

submitting a bank guarantee before the Registrar (General), High

Court. The Apex Court set aside the order of the High Court. It

shall be useful to quote the entire judgment of the Apex Court

which is to the following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             "We have heard learned counsel for the rival parties for

      some time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             A perusal of the impugned order reveals, that the High

      Court, while adjudicating upon the controversy, determined the

      monetary value of the improvements made by respondent

      No.1, and thereupon directed the appellant before this Court, to

      pay the determined amount, to respondent No.1.</blockquote><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">             The appellant before this Court had clearly and

      effectively raised a plea, that respondent No.1 was not entitled

      to any compensation for the improvements made on the land

      under reference.   In the above view of the matter, it was

      imperative for the High Court, in the first instance, to

      determine,    whether  respondent    no.1    was   entitled   to

      compensation on account of the improvements made by

      respondent no.1. If the answer to the above proposition had

      been rendered in the affirmative, then and only then,

      respondent no.1 would have been entitled to the payment

      determined in his favour. The first question having not been

      adjudicated upon, we are satisfied that the impugned order

      passed by the High Court is liable to be set aside, and the

      matter remitted to the High Court for re-consideration of the

      issue, whether respondent no.1 was entitled to compensation

      on account of improvements made on the land.           Ordered

      accordingly. All contentions on the instant issue are left open.

      Parties are accordingly directed to appear before the High

      Court on 25.08.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            In case, the High Court arrives at the conclusion that

      respondent no.1 was entitled to compensation on account of

      the improvements made on the land, the determination already

      rendered by the High Court, in the impugned order, shall be

      given effect to.
</p>
<p id="p_15">            During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the

      respondent no.1 made a statement to this Court, that he had

      withdrawn the amount determined by the High Court and

      furnished a bank guarantee in lieu thereof. He desires to re-

      deposit the aforesaid amount in the Registry of the High Court,

      so as to be placed in a fixed deposit in a scheduled bank.

      Leave and liberty is granted to respondent no.1 to do so.

</p><p id="p_17">             10. After the order of Apex Court this Original Petition

was taken up for hearing. The petitioner deposited the amount of

compensation which was withdrawn by him. During the course of

hearing State Government filed I.A. No.9506 of 2015 dated

27.06.2015 praying for accepting certain documents.               In the

affidavit filed in support of the petition for accepting documents,

it is stated that the basic document, on which the entire claim is

based, is of the year 1948 issued by the Kollam Divisional Forest

Officer in favour of the father of the petitioner which is of a total

extent of 50 Acres of land for a period of 4 years. Certain other

documents have been annexed and it was pleaded that the

petitioner's case that he was granted 99 years lease for an area

of 94 Acres is falsified on the strength of the documents. It was

further contended that the petitioner is not entitled to any value

of improvements. The petitioner has also filed a counter affidavit

opposing the acceptance of documents. We have permitted the

learned Special Government Pleader of the State to refer to and

rely on the additional documents produced.

<p id="p_18">            11. We have heard Sri.P.B. Krishnan, learned counsel

for the petitioner and Smt.Suseela R. Bhatt, learned Special

Government Pleader(Revenue) for the State. Learned counsel for

the petitioner submits that the only issue which is required to be

considered in this case is with regard to the valuation of the

improvements existing on the land. This Court may not permit

the State to raise issues of facts including the Kuthakappattam

lease of 99 years granted to the petitioner's father which lease

was clearly admitted by the respondents and the whole case

proceeded on the basis of the said lease.

<p id="p_19">            12. It is submitted that the District Collector had filed

a counter affidavit in the Original Petition where grant of lease in

favour of petitioner's father in the year 1944 for 99 years

consisting of 94 Acres of land in Survey No.745/1 has been

clearly admitted.      The State Government has also clearly

admitted the grant of lease. Even if additional documents filed by

the State during the hearing of this Original Petition, be looked

into, they in no manner support the argument now raised by the

learned Special Government Pleader that the lease granted to the

petitioner's father was not 99 years but was a lease for 50 Acres

only for 4 years. It is submitted that the document pertaining to

50 Acres of land is of 4 years lease which is not concerned with

the lease granted to the petitioner's father and may be a different

grant of lease in different Survey number.
</p>
<p id="p_20">            13. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

petitioner was clearly entitled for compensation for the

improvements made. It is submitted by learned counsel for the

petitioner that the Kuthakapattom lease granted to the

petitioner's father was an heritable lease and after the death of

the father of petitioner the petitioner and other legal heirs came

into lawful possession of the leased land and continued to enjoy

the same. It is submitted that the stand taken by the respondent

that the lease having not been renewed after the death of the

petitioner's father, the petitioner's possession became unlawful, is

wholly unsustainable. It is submitted that petitioner's possession

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                              -:15:-</span>


after the death of his father was a lawful possession and

Kuthakapattom lease given to his father was never terminated in

accordance with the Kuthakapattom Rules, 1947. It is submitted

that the proceedings under the Kerala Land Conservancy Act,

1957 were wholly without jurisdiction. Petitioner being never in

unauthorised occupation of the land, in fact the proceedings

under 1957 Act should have been dropped. In the objection filed

by the petitioner he clearly pleaded that the petitioner's

possession is not unauthorised and hence proceedings are

without jurisdiction. He submits that the respondents have no

jurisdiction to resume the land without cancelling the lease in

accordance with the Kuthakapattom Rules and the petitioner was

never served with a notice for cancellation of the lease.   The

entire action of resuming the land and refusing payment of

compensation for the improvements are without jurisdiction. It

is submitted that the petitioner was not in unauthorised

possession and cannot be termed as a trespasser and hence he

cannot be denied the value of improvements.

</p><p id="p_22">            14. It is further submitted that according to the

Kuthakappatam Rules a lessee is entitled to remove his

improvements before the possession is taken back.       Petitioner

was not even given an opportunity to remove the improvements.

He is clearly entitled for payment of compensation.          It is

submitted that in spite of three different orders passed by

Division Bench directing the State, Collector and Tahsildar to

produce the files pertaining to the Land Conservancy Act, 1957,

no records of the proceedings including any of the orders passed

have been submitted before the Court. This Court has to draw an

adverse inference against the respondent with regard to the Land

Conservancy proceedings and on the said proceedings no reliance

can be held in so far as the alleged unauthorised occupation of

the petitioner.      It is submitted that the Land Conservancy

proceedings or any decision taken therein imposing fine,

prohibitory assessment or treating the petitioner as unauthorised

occupant cannot affect the petitioner's right which flow from the

Kuthakapattom lease and the said proceedings have to be

declared as null and void not affecting any of the right of the

petitioner.    Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits

that the State has represented to the petitioner that it will be

paying the value of improvements as is clear from the

proceedings dated 01.03.1996 and the order passed by the State

Government dated 27.05.1995, the State Government cannot go

back from its promise to pay the value of improvements. The

principle of promissory estoppel is fully attracted in the present

case under which petitioner cannot be denied the compensation

for value of improvements.       It is further submitted that the

aforesaid proceedings dated 01.03.1996 and the order of the

State Government dated 27.05.1995 clearly indicate the intention

of the Government to resume the leased land with all its

improvements, since the object of the Government was to

rehabilitate the 75 'Kani' families(Aadivasi) who could have been

rehabilitated only when the improvements are there in the land.

The State thus never wanted the petitioner to take away the

improvements made in the land under the Kuthakapattom lease

due to which reason now the State cannot deny the payment of

compensation for improvements.

documents filed by the State through the Interlocutory

Application, No.9506 of 2015 it is clear that the lease which was

granted to the petitioner's father was a lease dated 08.01.1948

for 50 Acres of land for a period of 4 years. There is no other

documents available, hence the petitioner having not filed the

copy of the lease document, petitioner has no right to claim any

compensation for the improvements he has made.                It is

submitted that the petitioner having failed to prove the

Kuthakapattom lease (Survey No.745/1) for 99 years given in the

year 1944 the entire case of the petitioner falls to on the ground.

It is submitted that in the Land Conservancy proceedings, fine as

well as prohibitory assessment were imposed by the Tahsildar,

and the petitioner was declared as unauthorised occupant. Lease

having not been renewed and further there was violation of the

were rightly passed. It is submitted that the petitioner had filed

the appeal against the order of Tahsildar, which was dismissed

and Revision Petition was also dismissed, the Land Conservancy

proceedings having been finalised against the petitioner, his

possession is unauthorised and no person being in unauthorised

possession of the Government Land can claim any compensation

for improvements made by him.

Pleader that the Kuthakapattom lease was not heritable. It is

submitted that there is clear prohibition of the alienation of

Kuthakapattom lease hence the Statute indicate that lease could

not have been inherited by the petitioner or other legal heirs. It

is submitted that the petitioner had not paid lease rent after the

death of his father, hence he cannot claim any compensation for

improvements.       It is further submitted that, according to the

Kuthakapattom Rules 1947, a lessee is not entitled for

compensation for improvements which has been already held by

this Court by a Division Bench reported in Rev. Fr. K.C.

Government in the year 1974 and continued to be in possession

without there being any right.        The State Government has

vacated the interim stay in the year 1989. It is submitted that

the petitioner being unauthorised occupant, he has no right to

2015 dated 27.06.2015 has been filed on behalf of the State of

Kerala and others      during the course of hearing praying for

receiving documents marked as Exts.R3(a) to R3(j).        On the

basis of the aforesaid application it is contended by the learned

Special Government Pleader that the lease granted to petitioner's

father, Thangal Kunju Musaliar was not a lease for 99 years of 94

acres in 1944 but was a lease of only 50 acres of dry land for a

period of 4 years as disclosed by Ext.R3(a). Exhibit R3(a) is

dated January 08, 1948. Along with I.A. No.9506 of 2015 certain

documents, i.e., receipt dated 29.5.1123ME showing deposit of

Rs.178/- for right of cultivating 50 acres of dry land, Gazette

Notification    dated 19 Kanni, 1124ME (4.10.21948) by which

notice was published by the Divisional Forest Officer for sale of

firewood and timber collected from the leasehold        of Thangal

<p id="p_36">            20. Learned counsel for the petitioner             strongly

opposed the acceptance of           the aforesaid documents.         He

submitted that existence of Kuthakapattom in favour of

petitioner's father for 99 years in Sy.No.745/1 and 86/1 was

never denied by the State.         It is submitted that the categorical

stand taken by the respondents throughout the litigation has been

that the petitioner's father was granted Kuthakapattom           for 99

years of the lands in the aforesaid survey numbers in which lease

land rubber plantation was made in the year 1962-63 and after the

death of    petitioner's father in 1966 the lease was not renewed

hence petitioner's possession became unauthorised.              Learned

counsel has referred to the counter affidavit filed by the District

Collector and other materials on record, which will hereafter be

referred, to prove his contention that the Kuthakapattom            was

never denied.      It is useful to refer to the pleadings in the context

of Kuthakapattom granted in favour of the petitioner's father.

taken against the petitioner by notice dated 01.08.1997 clearly

stated that the kuthakapattom lease of about 94 acres of land

in Sy.No.745/1 was not renewed after the death of Thangal

Kunju Musaliyar and there was violation of the terms of the

kuthakapattom agreement.             In the impugned action itself the

State Government has referred to the kuthakapattom                      of 94

acres in Sy.No.745/1. There was no occasion for the State

years of 94 acres in Sy.No.745/1 was granted to the petitioner's

father.       Petitioner has filed O.P. No.13433 of 1997 on

04.08.1997 and in the Original Petition counter affidavits were

filed by the District Collector, Additional District Magistrate,

orders were issued by the State Government, reports were filed

by the State Government wherein grant of kuthakapattom lease

in favour of the petitioner's father for 99 years of the land in

Sy.No.745/1 was admitted. The State took up the matter in the

Apex Court by filing a Special Leave Petition against the Division

Bench judgment of this Court dated 06.12.2007. The Division

Bench judgment had clearly referred to the lease for 99 years

of 94 acres of land in Sy.No.745/1 to petitioner's father.    But

before the Apex Court grant of lease in favour of petitioner's

father was never questioned. The Apex Court vide its judgment

dated 16.08.2014 has remitted the matter back to the High

Court for consideration of the only question as to whether the

petitioner is entitled to compensation on account of the

improvements made on the land. It is relevant to note that the

matter was pending in Original Petition after judgment of this

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997

Court on 28.01.2005.      Review Petition was filed by the State.

But in the Review Petition also the grant of lease for 99 years of

94 acres in Sy.No.745/1 was never questioned. The State having

admitted the lease and based its impugned action only on the

ground that after 1966 lease was not           got renewed hence

petitioner's occupation became unauthorised and liable for

eviction, it is not permissible for the State at this stage to come

up with the       case that   lease for 99 years of 94 acres in

Sy.No.745/1 was not granted. The State cannot be allowed to

go back from its decision in view of the facts and pleadings as

noted above.       However, since on the basis of the documents

brought on record along with I.A. No.9506 of 2015, the learned

Special Government Pleader has emphatically argued that the

documents brought on record clearly established that           lease

granted to the petitioner's father was only 50 acres and that too

for four years only, we proceeded to examine the documents on

merits to avoid any prejudice to the State.

which is Ext.R3(c). Exhibit R3(a) is a letter by the Divisional

Forest Officer to the petitioner's father on 8th January, 1948

referring to application dated 26.12.1944 calling him to appear on

28.05.1123ME with evidence to prove that he has sufficient stock

of seeds to cultivate the land allotted. The aforesaid letter does

not refer or relate to Sy.No.745/1 (94 acres) which plot was

leased out to the petitioner's father as kuthakapattom      for 99

years.    The said letter can in no manner be said to be related to

the kuthakapattom granted to the petitioner's father for 99 years.

Even if the said letter was issued and petitioner's father had

deposited Rs.178/-, the price for cultivating 50 acres of dry land

for a period of four years, that in no manner affect the claim of

kuthakapattom for 99 years of 94 acres in Sy.No.745/1. Grant of

50 acres of land for cultivating for a period of four years is a

transaction not affecting the kuthakapattom granted to the

petitioner's father in Sy.No.745/1 of 94 acres.       Grant of the

said lease was never denied by the District Collector and the

State in their pleadings in the Original Petition and rather in the

pleadings they had admitted the grant of lease. Exhibit R3(f)

years granted to petitioner's father of 94 acres in Sy.No.745/1

which had already been filed by the petitioner as Ext.P7 and is

not related to the 50 acres of land granted for four years for

cultivation.   It is on record that the trees which were planted on

the land which was given to the petitioner's father on

kuthakapattom       were cut on 01.01.1948 and removed by the

Government and auctioned.        Thus the auction notice  produced

which were cut and removed by the Government from the

kuthakapattom granted to the petitioner's father for 99 years of

the learned Government Pleader that kuthakapattom            for 99

years of 94 acres in Sy.No.745/1 was never granted to the

<p id="p_47">Rule 15(b)(iii) clearly empowers the               Tahsildar to        cancel the

lease either on the termination of the lease without notice or at

any of the time after three months notice if the land or tree is

required for Government or public purposes. Form C annexed to

the Rules contains the conditions for grant of kuthakapattom.

Condition No.9 of Form C contains the same provision as noted

In exercise of the powers under Section 7 of Regulation III of

superseding all existing rules. Rule 26(b)(iii) of the 1947 Rules

Government Pleader is that the kuthakapattom is not heritable

on the pleas of the District Collector and the State and as noted

above after the death of petitioner's father in 1966 the

leased was not renewed hence petitioner's possession became

unauthorised.         Respondents' case throughout    is the   that

kuthakapattom granted to petitioner's father was not heritable.</blockquote><p id="p_50">

</p><p id="p_51">            29. As noted above, Section 2(2) of Regulation III of

1097 is the definition clause. As per <a href="/doc/1601535/" id="a_5">Section 2(2)</a> 'assignment'

includes transfer of a land by way of lease. 'Assignee' contained in

<a href="/doc/1601535/" id="a_6">Section 2(3)</a> includes his heirs.     Thus the enactment clearly

contemplated that Kuthakapattom is heritable. Learned Special

Government Pleader submitted that in Kuthakapattom Rules

1935 as well as 1947 there is no provision which would indicate

that the Kuthakapattom is heritable.      But the provisions of the

enactment under which rules have been framed clearly provides

that assignee includes his heirs.    When provision is specifically

made in the enactment non-repetition of such provision in the

rules has no consequence. Learned Special Government Pleader

referring to the kuthakapattom rules submitted that the rules

clearly prohibits alienation by a lessee.    Rule 26(b)(i) provides

that the lessee shall not alienate the lease without obtaining the

previous sanction of the authority who granted the lease. The

above provision in no manner indicate that the lease is not

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                -:39:-</span>


heritable. Restrictions on alienation have a different purpose and

object.     In view of the clear provisions of the Kuthakapattom

Rules under Regulation III of 1097, i.e., the parent enactment

under which         1935 and 1947 Rules have been framed,

kuthakapattom granted to the petitioner's father for 99 years of

94 acres in Sy.No.745/1 was clearly heritable after the death of

the petitioner's father in 1966 and the lease was inherited by the

petitioner and other legal heirs.     Thus the submission of the

learned Special Government Pleader that the lease is not

heritable cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_52">            30. It has further been pleaded on behalf of the

respondents that the petitioner did not get the lease renewed

after the death of his father in 1966 hence his possession became

unauthorised.       Thus the basis of the action taken by the

respondents that the lease was not renewed after the death of

petitioner's father hence the possession of the petitioner became

unauthorised is unfounded.        Kuthakapattom granted to the

petitioner's father does not require any renewal after the death

of petitioner's father in 1966.

</p><p id="p_54">            31. Other submission which has been pressed by the

learned Special Government Pleader is that there was violation of

condition of lease since the lease was granted for cashew

plantation whereas in the year 1962-63 the cashew plantation

was replaced by rubber plantation.       It is submitted that there

being    violation of  the terms of the lease, possession of the

petitioner became unauthorised.       As noted above, violation of

terms and conditions of lease empower the authority to cancel

the lease. There is no pleading on behalf of the respondents that

at any point of time proceedings were initiated under the 1947

Kuthakapattom Rules for cancellation of the lease for 99 years of

94 acres on the ground of violation of the terms and conditions

of the lease. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

there was no violation of the terms and conditions of the lease.

Rubber plantation was not beyond the scope of the lease and

further there being no proceeding undertaken under the 1947

Rules, for cancellation of the lease on the ground of the alleged

violation it is not open for the respondents to contend that there

was violation of terms and conditions of the lease. We thus came

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997

to the conclusion that after the death of petitioner's father in

1966 neither renewal of the lease was required nor petitioner's

possession became unauthorised.               Further no proceedings have

been taken for cancellation of the lease on the ground of the

alleged violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, hence

it is not open for the respondents to contend that possession of

the petitioner became unauthorised on the above ground.

judgment of the Apex Court in                <a href="/doc/1887042/" id="a_7">Smt. Gian Devi Anand v.

      the deceased tenant and all the rights and obligations of the

      determination of the tenancy and to his heirs on the death of such

      tenant is a creation of the Act for the benefit of the tenants, it is

      open to the Legislature which provides for such protection to make

      appropriate provisions in the Act with regard to the nature and

      extent of the benefit and protection to be enjoyed and the manner

      in which the same is to be enjoyed. If the Legislature makes any

      provision in the Act limiting or restricting the benefit and the nature

      of the protection to be enjoyed in a specified manner by any

      particular class of heirs of the deceased tenant on any condition

      laid down being fulfilled, the benefit of the protection has

      necessarily to be enjoyed on the fulfilment of the condition in the

      manner and to the extent stipulated in the Act. The Legislature

      which by the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_12">Rent Act</a> seeks to confer the benefit on the tenants

      and to afford protection against eviction is perfectly competent to

      make appropriate provision regulating the nature of protection and

      the manner and extent of enjoyment of such tenency rights after

      the termination of contractual tenancy of the tenant including the

      rights and the nature of protection of the heirs on the death of the

      tenant. Such appropriate provision may be made by the

and revision are not denied. Thus we proceed on the footing that

Land Conservancy proceedings were initiated against the

petitioner wherein his possession was declared unauthorised. It

is relevant to note that the petitioner objected to the Land

Conservancy proceedings by filing an objection on 26.04.1972.

In the Counter Affidavit of the 2nd respondent dated 05.11.1997

the details of Land Conservancy proceedings were pleaded.

Petitioner filed a reply and in his affidavit dated 17.12.1997 it

was pleaded that proceedings in LC Nos.35/71 and 50/88 were

without jurisdiction and null and void. Copy of the petitioner's

objection dated 26.04.1972 filed to the notice received under the

Land Conservancy proceedings was brought by the petitioner in

CMP No.4676/97 in WA No.1497/97 which writ appeal was filed

against the order dated 12.08.97 passed in O.P. No.13433/97.

proceedings under 1957 Act is based on unauthorised occupation of

Government Land.      Unauthorised occupation by a person invites

proceedings under Land Conservancy Act, 1957. Thus the

unauthorised occupation is a jurisdictional fact which give

jurisdiction to the authorities to proceed under the Land

Conservancy Act, impose fine, prohibitory assessment and

eviction. In the present case the case of the respondent through

out has been that after the death of the petitioner's father, the

lease was not renewed and rubber plantation having been

effected in the year 1962-63 thus the terms and conditions of

lease were violated.     The pleadings to the above effect were

made in paragraphs 3 of the Counter Affidavit of the District

Collector.    It is useful to extract the pleading of the District

Collector in the counter affidavit (relevant portion of paragraph

</p><p id="p_73">3) which was to the following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">      "3. xx       xx   xx The Kuthakapattom was not renewed after

      the demise of Sri.Thangal Kunjuy Mussaliyar. The conversion

      Paragraph 4 of the counter affidavit further stated as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">             "4. The Village Officer, Kulathupuzha has booked L.C.

      Case No.35/71 against the petitioner herein for the violation of

      Kuthakapattom conditions and illegal occupation.           The

      Revenue Inspector, Kulathupuzha inspected the site and

      verified the mahazar on 18.09.71.          The 3rd respondent,

      Tahsildar also inspected the site on 08.10.71 and found that the

      occupation is illegal. A notice under Rule 9 of Kerala Land

      Conservancy Rules was served on the petitioner on 25.10.71

      with directions to appear before the 3rd respondent on 30.10.71.

      The petitioner appeared and sought time for production of

      documents. He had filed a written objection on 26.04.72. The

      counsel for the petitioner was heard on 30.09.72 and an order

      was passed by the 3rd respondent on 30.11.72.           The 3rd

      respondent found that the conversion of the area into a rubber

      plantation   is  illegal and    the  occupation   is   therefore

      unauthorised. The petitioner has committed an offence under

      Section 5 of the Kerala Land Conservancy Act, 19576.</blockquote><p id="p_75">

      Rs.25/-. Prohibitory assessment at the ordinary rate would be

      realised from the petitioner. It was made clear that since the

      Pattom has been received up to the year 1971-72, prohibitory

      assessment at the ordinary rate for the remaining period alone

      would be realised.        It was further ordered that the

      encroachment will be evicted forthwith."
</p>
<p id="p_77">            38. Thus the Land Conservancy proceedings were

initiated on the premise that the petitioner is an unauthorised

occupant. We have already held while deciding issue Nos.III and IV

that there was no requirement of renewal of the lease and the lease

being heritable, petitioner continued to be in lawful possession of

the Kuthakapattom lease after the death of his father in 1966 and

further, no proceedings under Kuthakapattom Rules, 1947 were

initiated on the ground of any alleged violation of conditions of

lease,    the said ground was also not available to term the

possession of the petitioner as unauthorised occupant.     Learned

counsel for the petitioner has contended that the Land Conservancy

proceedings were without jurisdiction since the jurisdiction was

wrongly assumed by the authorities on the premise that petitioner's

possession is unauthorised occupation of Government Land.

Unauthorised occupation is a jurisdictional fact on which basis the

land Conservancy proceedings can be initiated. In the event the

possession by a person is not unauthorised, there is no occasion to

draw proceedings under the Land Conservancy Act, 1957. When

the authority without existence of a jurisdictional fact assumes

jurisdiction, assumption of such jurisdiction can be held without

jurisdiction.    In this context reference is made to the judgment of

the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1858272/" id="a_28">Arun Kumar and others v. Union of India and

others</a> [2007 (1) SCC 732]. The Apex Court in the above decision

has laid down that the jurisdictional fact is a fact which must exist

before a court-tribunal or an authority assumes jurisdiction over a

particular matter. Following was laid down in paragraphs 75, 76 and

84:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">              "75.   In Halsbury's Laws of England, it has been stated;

              "Where the jurisdiction of a tribunal is dependent on the
      existence of a particular state of affairs, that state of affairs may
      be described as preliminary to, or collateral to the merits of, the
      issue. If, at the inception of an inquiry by an inferior tribunal, a
      challenge is made to its jurisdiction, the tribunal has to make
      up its mind whether to act or not and can give a ruling on the
      preliminary or collateral issue; but that ruling is not conclusive".

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">              76. The existence of jurisdictional fact is thus sine qua

      non or condition precedent for the exercise of power by a court

      of limited jurisdiction.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">              84.   From the above decisions, it is clear that existence

      of 'jurisdictional fact' is sine qua non for the exercise of power.</blockquote><p id="p_78">

</p><p id="p_79">      If the jurisdictional fact exists, the authority can proceed with

      the case and take an appropriate decision in accordance with

      law. Once the authority has jurisdiction in the matter on

      existence of 'jurisdictional fact', it can decide the 'fact in issue'

      or 'adjudicatory fact'. A wrong decision on 'fact in issue' or on

      'adjudicatory fact' would not make the decision of the authority

      without jurisdiction or vulnerable provided essential or

      fundamental fact as to existence of jurisdiction is present."

</p><p id="p_80">             39. Another judgment of the Apex Court which need

reference is <a href="/doc/1494424/" id="a_29">Carona Ltd. v. Parvathy Swaminathan &amp; Sons</a>

[(2007) 8 SCC 559]. In the above case the Apex Court reiterated

that if jurisdictional     fact does not exist, a Court cannot             act.

Following was laid down in paragraphs 27 &amp; 28 as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">             "27. Stated simply, the fact or facts upon which the

      jurisdiction of a Court, a Tribunal or an Authority depends

      can be said to be a 'jurisdictional fact'. If the jurisdictional

      fact exists, a Court, Tribunal or Authority has jurisdiction to

      decide other issues. If such fact does not exist, a Court,

      Tribunal or Authority cannot act. It is also well settled that a

      Court or a Tribunal cannot wrongly assume existence of

      jurisdictional fact and proceed to decide a matter. The

      underlying principle is that by erroneously assuming

      existence of a jurisdictional fact, a subordinate Court or an

      inferior Tribunal cannot confer upon itself jurisdiction which it

      otherwise does not posses.

      or Tribunal."
</p>
<p id="p_85">            40. Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed

reliance on a judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court

reported in <a href="/doc/113841191/" id="a_30">Harrisons Malayalam Ltd. v. State of Kerala</a> [2014

(4) KLT 371]. Learned Single Judge in the said case was

considering the writ petition where the petitioners have

challenged the Proceedings under the Kerala Land Conservancy

Act, 1957. Learned Single Judge held that proceedings under the

Land Conservancy Act can be initiated, if the persons are found in

occupation of the Government Land unauthorisedly. As observed

above, the existence of jurisdictional fact is thus sine qua non or

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                     -:56:-</span>


condition precedent for the exercise of power by a court of

limited jurisdiction.     Following was held by learned Single Judge

in paragraph 11 of the judgment :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">             "11.    The jurisdictional facts in the context of Land

      Conservancy Act, has to be decided with reference to two

      facts. Firstly, whether the land in question can be categorised

      as Government land in terms of S.3 of the Land Conservancy

      Act. Secondly, whether the Government is in legal possession

      of the land referred in S.3 of the Land Conservancy Act. It is to

      be noted that the proceedings under the Land Conservancy

      Act can be initiated if the persons are found in occupation of

      the Government land. There is a distinction between

      occupation and possession in law. The occupation denotes

      actual use and possession denotes control and interest in the

      land. If a person is in legal possession of a land, without

      determining the legal possession, proceedings under the Land

      Conservancy Act cannot be initiated. The determination of

      legal possession cannot be done invoking the provisions

      under the Land Conservancy Act. The Land Conservancy Act

      only provides summary procedure for evicting illegal or

      unauthorised occupation. Therefore, after categorising the

      property as a Government land, the Special Officer must

      address to the fact that whether the Government is in legal

      possession of the property. Thus the Special Officer has to

      bear in mind the distinction between occupation and

challenged the order of resumption passed by the District Collector

accordance with the Kuthakapattom Rules, 1947, petitioner's

Dossibai N. B. Jeejeebhoy</a> [AIR 1971 SC 2355]. In the above

case the Court was considering the doctrine of res judicata in

respect of two proceedings pertaining to Bombay Rents, Hotel

and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947. The Apex Court in

the said case has laid down that earlier decision shall not be res

judicata with a decision related to jurisdiction of the Court which

could try the earlier proceedings and when a question is purely of

question of law and jurisdiction of Court or decision of the Court,

principle of res judicata is not attracted. It is useful to quote the

following observations made in paragraphs 5, 6, 9 and 11:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">             "5. But the doctrine of res judicata belongs to the

      domain of procedure, it cannot be exalted to the status of a

      legislative direction between the parties so as to determine

      the question relating to the interpretation of enactment

      affecting the jurisdiction of a Court finally between them, even

      though no question of fact or mixed question of law and fact

      and relating to the right in dispute between the parties has

      been determined thereby. A decision of a competent Court on

      a matter in issue may be res judicata in another proceeding

      between the same parties: the ''matter in issue'' may be an

      issue of fact, an issue of law, or one of mixed law and fact. An

      issue of fact or an issue of mixed law and fact decided by a

      competent court is finally determined between the parties and

      cannot be reopened between them in another proceeding.

      The previous decision on a matter in issue alone is res

      judicata: the reasons for the decision are not res judicata. A

      matter in issue between the parties is the right claimed by

      one party and denied by the other, and the claim of right from

      its very nature depends upon proof of facts and application of

      the relevant law thereto. A pure question of law unrelated to

      facts which give rise to a right, cannot be deemed to be a

      matter in issue. When it is said that a previous decision is res

      judicata, it is meant that the right claimed has been

      adjudicated upon and cannot again be placed in contest

      between the same parties. A previous decision of a

      competent Court on facts which are the foundation of the

      right and the relevant law applicable to the determination of

      the transaction which is the source of the right is res judicata.</blockquote><p id="p_94">

</p><p id="p_95">      A previous decision on a matter in issue is a composite

      decision: the decision on law cannot be dissociated from the

      proceeding between the same parties, if the cause of action

      of the subsequent proceeding be the same as in the previous

      subsequent     proceeding     between    the     same    parties:

      Mahendra Singh</a>, (1901) ILR 23 All 5 held that a decision on

      Bhattacharjee's case, ILR 53 Cal 723 = (AIR 1928 Cal 777).

      "The object of the doctrine of res judicata is not to fasten
      upon parties special principles of law as applicable to them

      these rights directly and substantially depend; and to prevent

<p id="p_100">      A question relating to the jurisdiction of a Court cannot be

      would not, in our judgment operate as res judicata, Similarly

      by an erroneous decision if the Court assumes jurisdiction

      which it does not possess under the statute the question

      cannot operate as res judicata between the same parties,

view that the proceedings under the Land Conservancy Act, 1957

unauthorised possession of the leased land, the lease having not

been renewed and he having violated the conditions of lease by

planting rubber trees, were without jurisdiction. The petitioner's

possession did not become unauthorised after the death of his

no requirement of renewal of lease and no proceedings were

of the Kuthakapattom Rules, 1947. Form D contains various

conditions of Kuthakappattam grant in which condition No.18 of

Form D provides as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">            "18. That on the expiry of the lease or in the event of the

      cancellation of the lease or in the event of resumption of the

to determine the lease after three months' notice as provided in

Rule 26 (b)(iii) of the Kuthakappattom Rules, 1947. The purpose

of notice for termination of the lease is clearly with the intention

to give opportunity to the lessee to remove his improvements.

The condition No.18 of Form D as quoted above clearly indicates

that the lessee is entitled to remove his improvements.         The

removal of the improvements by the lessee is thus a statutory

right granted to him. Present is a case where the lease was not

terminated by giving three months notice nor petitioner could get

any opportunity to remove the improvements.           As has been

noted above, the State Government had issued a Government

Order dated 27.05.1995 providing that the possession of private

lands including the land in Survey No.745/1 for resettlement of

Vamanapuram Irrigation Project, shall be resumed by the

Government by personal negotiation and valuation fixed by the

Revenue Authorities.    In pursuance of the above Government

Order, a High Power meeting was held on 01.03.1996 wherein it

was decided to resume the land (Survey No.745/1) after paying

the value of improvements in the 94 Acres.

<p id="p_109">            51. The Government have agreed to pay the value of

improvements with the object of resettlement of 'Kani' families.

The Government thus wanted to take the land after paying the

value of improvements as was decided on 01.03.1996.        The

Government clearly intended not to give an opportunity to the

petitioner to remove the improvements. As noted above even

after the proceedings under the Land Conservancy Act, the

possession was never taken from the petitioner and the State

Government itself has granted an interim order staying the

eviction of the petitioner which interim order continued from

1974 till 1989 and after 1989, petitioner's application for

assignment of land was recommended by the Collector vide its

land of the petitioner was resumed by giving a notice dated

01.08.1997(Ext.P6). It is claimed to be served on the staff of the

petitioner on 02.08.1997 at 9 p.m., wherein the petitioner was

directed to appear on 04.08.1997 to handover the possession.

The aforesaid clearly indicate that the petitioner was never given

any opportunity to remove his improvements.

were initiated in the High Court where the High Court directed

that the proceedings can be      continued against the occupants

only after giving opportunity to them. The District Collector

directed the petitioners to vacate the land.       The matter was

respondent approached the High Court by filing Original Petition.

The Original Petition was disposed of directing the authority to

issue notice to the petitioners if the Kuthakappatom has to be

cancelled, secondly, the petitioners have to vacate the land and

thirdly, the authorities shall pass orders with regard to

compensation.       Writ Appeal was          filed against the judgment.

After disposal of the Original Petition, the Tahsildar issued notice

to the petitioners and rejected their objection.             Original Petition

was again filed in the High Court which was dismissed against

which Writ Appeals were filed and decided.                In the above case

the Division Bench had occasion to consider as to whether the

occupants were entitled to            value of improvements.                In

paragraph 4 the Division Bench noted the issues. The Division

Bench in the said case considered Kuthakapattom Rules 1935 and

1947 and held that although the lessee is not entitled to value of

improvements, he can remove the improvements before he is

evicted. The following was laid down in paragraphs 7 and 8:

</p><p id="p_111">            " 7. Thus substantially, there is no difference in Form C of

      the Rules of 1935 and Form D of Rules of 1947. It means that, the

      lessee is not entitled for value of improvements at the time of

      eviction. But he can remove those improvements before he is

      evicted. Thus we are of the view that the learned Single Judge

      was not correct in holding that the occupants are entitled to value

      of improvements.
</p>
<p id="p_112">             8. Hence, we modify the judgment of the learned Single

      Judge by deleting the direction to pay compensation to the

      petitioners for value of improvements. But, we make it clear that

      even though the respondents are not entitled to value of

      improvements they will be free to demolish the structures put up

      by them and to carry away the materials used for the construction.

      Hence, we dispose of the W. As. by entitling the respondents to

      demolish the structures put up by them in the land in question

      before they are evicted, and the judgment of the learned Single

      Judge is modified to the above extent."

<p id="p_113">The Division Bench judgment thus clearly establishes that the

lessee is entitled to remove the improvements.

improvements on the land. The learned Single Judge himself has

observed that the judgment will have no bearing on the rights of

v. State of Kerala [AIR 1973 SC 2498] by which judgment the

judgment of High Court was affirmed. It is useful to refer to the

aforesaid two judgments in detail.
</p>
<p id="p_117">            55. In    1965 KLT 666, an appeal was filed by the

Plaintiff arising out of a Suit for recovery of Rs.2 lakhs with

interest from State of Kerala for the damages for the value of

improvements said to have been lost to the plaintiff when he was

evicted from 160 acres of land. The petitioner claims to have

taken possession of the land belonging to the State. Plaintiff's

case was that he effected improvements bonafide on the property

and he was entitled to the value thereof. The plaintiff did not

claim any permission or lease from the State who was the owner

of the property. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff was a

mere trespasser and he was not entitled for any value of

improvements. The Division Bench of the High Court found that

the plaintiff could not prove that he has any bonafide claim. The

Division Bench thus proceeded to discuss the question as to

whether a mere trespasser has any right after dispossession in

respect of the improvements he had effected, during the currency

of his trespass is noticed in paragraph 10 of the judgment. After

noticing various cases High Court held that there is no principle of

law or equity which requires the payment of compensation in

respect of trees, the ownership of which was all along, or at any

rate from the date of the trespasser's dispossession, vested in the

State. The relevant portion in paragraph 10 is quoted below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">             "The position of a trespasser - whether he be a mere trespasser

      or a trespasser under a bona fide claim of title - cannot be better than

      that of a tenant. If what is stated above is correct, then the appeal has

      to be dismissed on the short ground that there is no principle of law or

      equity which requires the payment of compensation in respect of trees,

      the ownership of which was all along, or at any rate from the date of the

      trespasser's dispossession vested in the State."

</blockquote><p id="p_118">The plaintiff- Rev. Fr. K.C. Alexander           has filed an appeal before

the Apex Court challenging the judgment of High Court. The Apex

Court in paragraphs 1 &amp; 2 noted the facts of the case and in

paragraph 9 it is held that the claim of plaintiff that his possession

was bonafide and he was a bonafide trespasser has no legs to

stand. The Apex Court in the said judgment had held by quoting a

maxim of English Law, the relevant portion of paragraph 13 of AIR

1973 SC 2498 reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_119">O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                     -:76:-</span>


            "It is true that the maxim of the English law "quicquid

      plantatur solo solo cedit", i.e. whatever is affixed to the soil

      belongs to the soil, is not applicable in India but that is not to

      say that a wrongful trespasser can plant tress on some one

      else's land and claim a right to those trees after he is evicted."

</p><p id="p_120">            56. One of the submissions raised before the Apex Court

was that the plaintiff in that case did not get an opportunity to

remove his improvements, but for the reasons given in paragraph

14 the Apex Court did not permit the plaintiff to raise the above

contention.    It is useful to quote paragraph 14 which is to the

following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_64">            "14. In any case, as the High Court rightly observed, the

      position of a trespasser cannot be better than that of a lawful

      tenant who having lost his possession cannot claim

      compensation or damages for anything erected on the land or

      any improvements made therein The appellant's claim after he

      was evicted cannot. on the same parity of reasoning, be held

      to be valid. Once the appellant's counsel was confronted with

      this proposition, he tried to raise an entirely new point, namely,

      that no notice of eviction was given to the appellant, and if

      such a notice had been given to him under<a href="/doc/1521476/" id="a_37"> S. 9</a>, he would

      have cut the trees and taken them away within the time

      allowed for him to vacate the lands. In support of this

      contention he has referred us to the pleadings contained in

      paragraph-3 of the plaint in which it is stated :

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">              "The improvements effected by the plaintiff have a value of

      Rs. 2 lakhs as per the accounts shown below. In his helplessness

      the plaintiff had even applied to Government to give him the land in

      which he had effected improvements, on kuthakapattom. But out of

      the said land 160 acres were taken out of my possession and given

      to the 2nd defendant even without giving me the opportunity to

      remove the movable improvements, such as cultivation, cattle,

      machines, utensils, houses, stocked crops, ripe crops etc.,

      belonging to me." These averments in the above paragraph do not

      clearly allege that he was evicted without notice, nor has any

      allegation been made that he was forcibly evicted from the lands

      with the help of the police etc. as it has now been contended before

      us. On the other hand what the plaintiff (appellant stated snows that

      no opportunity was given to him to remove the movable

      improvements such as cultivation' cattle, machines, utensils,

      houses, stocked crops, ripe crops etc. which belonged to 1-him.</blockquote><p id="p_121">

</p><p id="p_122">      There is nothing stated by him that he had no opportunity to cut

      trees and take them away. Even in paragraph-4 of the plaint where

      he complains that no notice of forfeiture was given to him, he

      mentions only the items referred to in paragraph-3. It is in this

      connection he says, that no legal procedure had been followed by

      Government for taking them into possession which only implies that

      it is in respect of the items mentioned in paragraph-3. It is again

      stated in paragraph-4 that "It was irregular on the part of

      Government to take possession of the above items',. The

      respondent did not understand the averments in the plaint as

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                      -:78:-</span>


      alleging that no notice to quit was given to him is evident from the

      written statement of the respondent in paragraph 7 where it is

      stated thus:
</p>
<p id="p_123">             "This defendant submits that after due notice an order of

      forfeiture has been passed in Poramboke Case 112 of 1100

      and the plaintiff is therefore not entitled to claim any value of

      improvements or value of any building." The issues that had

      been framed by the Trial Court also do not refer to this aspect.

      No doubt in the evidence of the plaintiff P.W. 1 he states that

      he was evicted from the lands without giving him an

      opportunity to remove the improvements, and in cross-

      examination he was asked whether he was not given any

      notice prior to the dispossession and he said that certainly no

      notice was received. P.W. 4 the Manager was asked in cross-

      examination whether he had been given any prior information

      or notice about eviction and this witness also said that are was

      no prior information or notice. While these passages might

      show that no notice of eviction was given, even at that stage

      there was no application for an issue being framed, nor has

      such an application been made in the appea1 before the High

      Court, nor even before this Court. When it has been held that

      the appellant was not a mere trespasser and had deliberately

      entered upon the lands knowing fully well that he had no right'

      claim or title to the lands or had in any manner a right to enter

      the land end has been rightly evicted as a trespasser, he

      cannot now be permitted to raise this contention before us."

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                -:79:-</span>


</p><p id="p_124">            57. The ratio of the judgment of High Court as well as

the      Apex Court is that the trespasser who has made

improvements in the land belonging to someone else cannot

claim value of improvements but his right to remove the

improvement was not denied. The case before the High Court in

1965 KLT 666 was not a case of Kuthakapattam lease where

certain statutory conditions and requirements are prescribed.

Thus on the basis of above judgment, the contention of learned

Special Government Pleader, that the petitioner cannot claim

value of improvements, cannot be accepted. As observed above,

the State Government intended to take the land along with

improvements after paying        compensation which was clearly

recorded in Ext.P9 Government Order and proceedings dated

01.03.1996.        In the Government Order dated 27.05.1995

(Ext.P9) it has been recorded that "the Kannies are agreeable for

shifting to the new location...".      The above indicates that

rehabilitation of Kannies on the selected site which includes Sy

No.945/1(94 acres) was proposed with all facilities and

improvement on the land hence the State could not have

O.P. No. 13433 of 1997
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                 -:80:-</span>


permitted the petitioner to remove the improvement.                 This

circumstance clearly proves that the petitioner was entitled for

value of improvements. It has to be accepted that petitioner had

no opportunity to remove the improvements.              Thus he was

entitled for the value of improvements, as has already been

determined by the State Government. Issue No.VII is answered

in the following manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">      "Issue No.VII. The State having intended to resume the land

      in Survey No.745/1 along with the improvements and the

      petitioner having not given an opportunity to remove the

      improvements, the petitioner is clearly entitled for value of

      improvements."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">      Issue No.VIII :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_68">            58. One of the submissions which has been pressed by

learned counsel for the petitioner is the submission based on the

'promissory estoppel'. It is submitted that the State has issued a

Government        Order dated    27.05.1995     and    have    initiated

proceedings dated 01.03.1996 that the land in Survey No.745/1

shall be resumed after paying the value of improvements, the

State cannot go back from its promise and is estopped by the

doctrine of promissory estoppel. It is relevant to recaptulate the

facts and the ground on which the above submission is made.</blockquote><p id="p_125">

</p><p id="p_126">            59. As noted above though the Land Conservancy

proceedings were initiated in the year 1971 and orders were

passed by the authorities in 1972-1974, the State directed that

the petitioner need not be evicted in the year 1974 and said

interim order continued till 1989. The petitioner's application for

assignment of land was also recommended by the Collector on

24.10.1994 which were pending active consideration before the

State Government.            The State issued the Government Order

dated 27.05.1995. It is useful to refer to the Government Order

      improvement for the balance registered land. The balance land

      required for the resettlement may be acquired urgently. Tahsildar,

</p><p id="p_137">            9. The Irrigation Department and Forest Department are

      and take follow up action for the implementation of the project."

</p><p id="p_138">             61. Pursuant to the decision taken on 01.03.1996 the

Tahsildar submitted a report dated 03.04.1996 where value of

improvements was assessed at Rs.1,70,94,000/-.                      There was

some objection to the report on which a further report was

submitted by the Tahsildar on 11.04.1997 reiterating the earlier

assessment of the improvements.
</p>
<p id="p_139">             62. The State thus has clearly represented that the

land of the petitioner shall be taken after paying the value of

improvements.         It is relevant to note that the petitioner's

application for assignment which was pending was rejected on

28.07.1997 and notice dated 01.08.1997 was issued to take

possession of the land, in pursuance of which possession was

taken on 04.08.1997. State thus by its order dated 27.05.1995

and proceedings dated 01.03.1996 clearly represented that the

petitioner will be paid the value of improvements. But suddenly

without any notice or information State went back from its

promise and issued notice on 01.08.1997 to take possession.

</p><p id="p_140">            63. The District Collector, Kollam in his counter

affidavit to the Original Petition has pleaded that the decision to

take possession of the land was taken under the orders of the

State Government. Paragraph 12 of the counter affidavit of the

District Collector stated as follows(relevant portion):

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_70">            "The Government thereafter rejected the application for

      assignment vide letter No.83775/U2/92/RD dated 28.7.97. On the

      same day the 1st respondent directed me to resume the land in

      question and also to recover the likely loss to the Government that

      occurred due to continued illegal occupation of the land by the

      applicant."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">            64. Thus the possession was taken under the order of

the State Government as stated by the Collector. Whether the

doctrine of promissory estoppel shall stop the State Government

from going back from its promise to pay value of improvements

is the question to be answered.              The doctrine of promissory

estoppel has been clearly explained in the Apex Court judgment

reported in <a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_38">M/s.Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. The

State of Uttar Pradesh and others</a> [AIR 1979 SC 621]. In the

above case the Apex Court held that the doctrine of Promissory

Estoppel is a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice. In the

above case the question was whether the assurance given by the

State Authorities on behalf of the State Government that they

had decided to give exemption from payment of sales tax for a

period of three years from the date of commencement of the

production and the State Government is bound to honour such

assurance by invoking the provisions of promissory estoppel. The

Apex Court referred to the English law, the American Law and the

Indian law and held that the Government was bound on the

principle of promissory estoppel to make good the representation

made by it. It is useful to refer to the observations made by the

Apex Court in paragraphs 7 and 19 which is to the following

effect:
</blockquote>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">      130.This doctrine has been variously called 'promissory estoppel',

      'equitable estoppel', 'quasi estoppel' and 'new estoppel'. It is a

      principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice and though commonly

      named 'promissory estoppel', it is, as we shell presently point out,

      neither in the realm of contract nor in the realm of estoppel. It is

      interesting to trace the evolution of this doctrine in England and to

      refer to some of the English decisions in order to appreciate the true

      scope and ambit of the doctrine particularly because it has been the

      subject of considerable recent development and is steadily

      expanding. The basis of this doctrine is the interposition of equity.

      Equity has always, true to form, stepped in to mitigate the rigours of

      strict law.The early cases did not speak of this doctrine as estoppel.

      They spoke of it as 'raising an equity'. Lord Cairns stated          the

      doctrine in its earliest form - it has undergone considerable

      development since then - in the following words in Hughes v.

      Metropolitan Rly. Co. (Supra):</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">

      certain legal results ....... afterwards by their own act or with their

      own consent enter upon a course of negotiation which has the

      effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights

      have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce them

      heartening to find that in India not only has the doctrine of

      promissory estoppel been adopted in its fullness but it has been

      recognized as affording a cause of action to the person to whom the

      promise is made. The requirement of consideration has not been

      allowed to stand in the way of enforcement of such promise. The

      doctrine of promissory estoppel has also been applied against the

      Government and the defence based on executive necessity has

      been categorically negatived. It is remarkable that as far back as

      1880, long before the doctrine of promissory estoppel was

      formulated by Denning, J., in England, a Division Bench of two

      English Judges in the Calcutta High Court applied the doctrine of

      promissory estoppel and recognised a cause of action founded

      upon it in the Ganges Mfg. C. V. Sourujumull, (1880) ILR 5 Cal 669.

      The doctrine of promissory estoppel was also applied against the

      Government in a case subsequently decided by the Bombay High

      Court in <a href="/doc/1880129/" id="a_39">Municipal Corporation of Bombay v. Secy. of State</a>, (1905)

      Govt. would be held bound by the promise and the promise would

      be enforceable against the Govt. at the instance of the promisee,

      notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and

      the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as

      required by <a href="/doc/1084525/" id="a_40">Art. 299</a> of the Constitution. It is elementary that in a

      republic governed by the rule of law, no one, howsoever high or low,

      is above the law. Every one is subject to the law as fully and

      completely as any other and the Government is no exception. It is

      indeed the pride of constitutional democracy and rule of law that the

      Government stands on the same footing as a private individual so

      far as the obligation of the law is concerned : the former is equally

      bound as the latter."

the above case it is clear that there was a failure of promise on

behalf of the State to the petitioner that he shall be paid the

value of improvements.              The decision to pay the value of

improvements was taken due to the reasons as has been

disclosed from the pleadings of the parties and noted above while

deciding issue No.VII.          The Government Order Ext.P9 clearly

provided that the State required the land for resettlement of Kani

families who were ousted from the reservoir area of the

Vamanapuram Irrigation Project. The State Government decided

Order, Survey No.745/1 of the petitioner's land was also

included. As observed above, the Government wanted the entire

land    and    intended  to  obtain  the   land  along with   its

improvements.        Item No.8 of the High Power meeting dated

01.03.1996 as extracted above clearly indicate that the said

decision was taken even when the Joint Secretary told in the

meeting that the petitioner is an unauthorised occupant of the

land, since the lease granted to him was over and since the

period of lease was not extended, although the stand taken by

the Joint Secretary was incorrect, even after that Government

took the decision to resume the land of petitioner after paying

the value of improvements, if any, to the petitioner for his 94

Acres of land.      Thus the decision of the State was clear and

unequivocal representation was there to pay the value of

improvements. The land has been resumed for a purpose by the

State Government.       But now the State Government has gone

back from its promise to deny the value of improvements. We

thus conclude that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is fully

having already been determined, which has been deposited by

the State before the Registrar General and after the decision of
