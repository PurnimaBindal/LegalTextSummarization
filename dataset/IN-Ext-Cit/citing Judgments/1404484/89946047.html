 proceedings thereto passed by the Court of District and Sessions Judge

(West), Tis Hazari, Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.     Brief facts of the case are that FIR No. 89/2018 dated 03.04.2018 was

registered at PS - Makhi, District Unnao for the offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_2">Sections 323</a>/<a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_3">504</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_4">506</a> of Indian Penal Code, 1860 („<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>‟) read with <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_6">Sections

3</a>/<a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_7">25</a> Arms Act against Surender Singh @ Pappu on the complaint of Tinku.

Another FIR bearing No. 90/2018 dated 04.04.2018 was registered at

aforementioned Police Station - Makhi for the offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_8">Sections 147</a>/<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_9">323</a>/<a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_10">504</a> IPC against Vineet Mishra @ Vinay Mishra, Birender

Singh @ Bauwa Singh, Ram Sharam Singh @ Sonu Singh, Jaideep Singh @

Atul Singh Senger, Shashi Pratap Singh @ Suman Singh.

</p><p id="p_11">3.     Later on, FIR No. 89/2018 was converted into RC-9S/2018 and FIR

No. 90/2018 was converted in RC-10S/2018. Since Surender Singh @

Pappu expired in judicial custody on 09.04.2018, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_11">Section 302</a> IPC was

added by CBI in RC-10S/2018. The petitioner herein arraigned as accused in

RC-9S/2018.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.     Mr. Hari Haran, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the

petitioner submits that as per the investigation of the CBI in RC-9S/2018,

Surender Singh @ Pappu was implicated in a false case. It is an admitted

 case of the petitioner, being a duty officer and also a wireless operator on

03.04.2018 at Police Station - Makhi that he never left the Police Station

and has only prepared the seizure memo being part of his official duties.

Petitioner was not in touch with other police officer who proceeded towards

the spot, on the instructions of SP Unnao, through any mode of

communication including mobile phone. Thus, petitioner has nothing to do

with the beatings given to Surender Singh @ Pappu. This was the reason

that the petitioner was not even arrested by CBI and without arrest,

chargesheet was filed against him in RC-9S/2018, which relates to the

falsification of records only.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.     It is submitted that on 13.04.2018, charges under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_12">Sections

Vineet Mishra @ Vinay Mishra, Birendra Singh @ Bauwa Singh, Ram

Sharan Singh @ Sonu Singh, Jai Deep Singh @ Atul Singh Sengar, Shashi

Pratap Singh @ Suman Singh and Shailender Singh @ Shalu by the Court of

Special Judge, CBI Lucknow. In other words, trial commenced in the RC-

10S/2018. However, due to certain factors, both the above RCs alongwith

other matters were transferred to Delhi in the Court of Sh. Dharmesh

Sharma, District and Sessions Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi. On 13.08.2019,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CRL.REV.P. 865/2019                                              Page 3 of 22</span>
 impugned orders were passed, whereby joint charges were framed in RC-

9S/2018 and RC-10S/2018 by the aforementioned Court.

</p><p id="p_14">6.     Learned Senior Advocate submits that the petitioner is aggrieved by

the charges which were not even contemplated by the investigating agency

i.e. CBI. The illegal nature of charges especially under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_19">Section 302</a> IPC is

evident from the fact that petitioner was not part of RC-10S/2018 and still

murder charges have been framed against him.
</p>
<p id="p_15">7.     Mr. Hari Haran also submits that the contents of the charges framed

against petitioner under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_20">Section 302</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_21">Section 120</a> IPC shows

that the petitioner alongwith other police officials sent Surender Singh @

Pappu to judicial custody fully knowing that injuries were dangerous. In

other words, it has been alleged that petitioner failed in providing adequate

medical treatment to Surender Singh @ Pappu. However, learned Trial

Court has overlooked the relevant record that as per GD No. 52/19.05,

Surender Singh @ Pappu had six injuries and was immediately sent to

District Hospital by the petitioner under the care of constable Pankaj Kumar

and SI Sushil Kumar.
</p>
<p id="p_16">8.     It is argued that chargesheet in RC-10S/2018, categorically reveals

that timely treatment was provided to Surender Singh @ Pappu. From




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CRL.REV.P. 865/2019                                               Page 4 of 22</span>
 03.04.2018 till his death, Surender Singh @ Pappu was medically examined

by Senior Doctors available at District Hospital, Unnao and Jail Hospital.

The factum that Surender Singh @ Pappu died owing to the negligence of

doctors is corroborated by the statement of Dr. Sushil Prakash Chaudhary

who was examined as witness PW-41 by CBI. The abovenamed doctor was

the head of the committee constituted by the then D.M. Unnao, namely, Sh.

Ravi Kumar, who conducted inquiry in respect of the treatment administered

to Surender Singh @ Pappu.
</p>
<p id="p_17">9.     Learned senior counsel for petitioner further submits that the seizure

memo alleged to be falsely prepared by the petitioner, is a wrong argument.

The seizure memo is based on a pre-written document (tehrir) and no

falsification can be attributed to petitioner. Further, being the duty officer,

since an illegal weapon was seized, the petitioner was duty bound to prepare

seizure memo in terms of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_22">Section 102</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

(„<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_23">Cr.P.C</a>‟). He further argued that even if for the sake of argument, it is

admitted that there was a false implication, even then the petitioner came

into picture only after the object of conspiracy for false implication of

Surender Singh @ Pappu was achieved. Investigation of the CBI shows that

tehrir was prepared at the house of SI Kanta Prasad which is situated outside




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CRL.REV.P. 865/2019                                                 Page 5 of 22</span>
 the Police Station and the alleged illegal weapon/ katta was already

recovered and then only tehrir alongwith katta and Surender Singh @ Pappu

was produced before the petitioner for further proceedings. Further,

petitioner was not the part of the proceedings which were conducted

thereafter i.e. taking Surender Singh @ Pappu to hospital or to produce him

before the ACJM-III, Unnao. The framing of joint charges and arraigning of

the petitioner in RC-10S/2018 caused irreparable loss and severe prejudice

to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_18">10.    Mr. Hari Haran further submits that it is evident that petitioner was

never interrogated by CBI on the point of charge under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_24">Section 302</a> IPC and

also was not given opportunity to explain his stand on the said charge.

Moreover, no opportunity was given to the petitioner to lead arguments on

charge regarding the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_25">Section 302</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_26">Section 120B</a>

IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_19">11.    Learned senior counsel also submitted that undisputedly the petitioner

was not arrested by the CBI during investigation but due to framing of joint

charges and arraigning of the petitioner in RC-10S/2018, he has been sent to

judicial custody. Petitioner is being tried for serious offences like conspiracy

and murder without an adequate opportunity of defending himself.

</p><p id="p_20"> 12.    To strengthen his arguments, learned senior counsel has relied upon

the case of <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_27">State of Andhra Pradesh vs. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao and

Another</a>, (1964) 3 SCR 297, whereby full bench of Hon‟ble Supreme Court

held as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "25. According to Mr Chari Section 235(1) cannot be
           construed as having an overriding effect on Section239
           because whereas it contemplates acts so connected
           together as to from the same transaction resulting in
           more offences than one, Section 239(d) contemplates
           offences committed in the course of the same transaction
           and nothing more. The question is whether for purposes
           of Section 239(d) it is necessary to ascertain anything
           more than this that the different offences were committed
           in the course of the same transaction or whether it must
           further be ascertained whether the acts are intrinsically
           connected with one another. Under Section 235(1) what
           has to be ascertained is whether the offences arise out of
           acts so connected together as to form the same
           transaction, but the words "so connected together as to
           form the same transaction, but the words "so connected
           together as to form" are not repeated after the words
           "same transaction" in Section 239. What has to be
           ascertained then is whether these words are also to be
           read in all the clauses of Section 39 which refer to the
           same transaction. Section 235(1), while providing for the
           joint trial for more than one offence, indicates that there
           must be connection between the acts and the transaction.
           According to this provision there must thus be a
           connection between a series of acts before they could be
           regarded as forming the same transaction. What is meant
           by "same transaction" is not defined anywhere in the
           Code. Indeed, it would always be difficult to define
           precisely what the expression means. Whether a
           transaction can be regarded as the same would




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CRL.REV.P. 865/2019                                                 Page 7 of 22</span>
            necessarily depend upon the particular facts of each case
           and it seems to us to be a difficult task to undertake a
           definition of that which the Legislature has deliberately
           left undefined. We have not come across a single decision
           of any Court which has embarked upon the difficult task
           of defining the expression. But it is generally thought that
           where there is proximity of time or place or unity of
           purpose and design or continuity of action in respect of a
           series of acts, it may be possible to inder that they form
           part of the same transaction. It is, however, not necessary
           that every one of these elements should co-exist for a
           transaction to be regarded as the same. But if several
           acts committed by a person show a unity of purpose or
           design that would be a, strong circumstance to indicate
           that those acts form part of the same transaction. The
           connection between a series of acts seems to us to be an
           essential ingredient for those acts to constitute the same
           transaction and, therefore, the mere absence of the words
           "so connected together as to form" in clauses (a), (c) and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (d) of Section 239 would make little difference. Now a
           transaction may consist of an isolated act or may consist
           of a series of acts. The series of acts which constitute a
           transaction must of necessity be connected with one
           another and if some of them stand out independently they
           would not form part of the same transaction but would
           constitute a different transaction or transactions.
           Therefore, even if the expression "same transaction"
           alone had been used in Section 235(1) it would have
           meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of
           a series of connected acts. The expression "same
           transaction" occurring in clauses (a), (c) and (d) of
           Section 239 as well as that occurring in Section 235(1)
           ought to be given the same meaning according to the
           normal rule of construction of statutes. Looking at the
           matter in that way, it is pointless to inquire further
           whether the provisions of Section 239 are subject to those
           of Section 236(1). The provisions of sub-sections (2) and
           (3) of Section 235 are enabling provisions and quite

             plainly can have no overriding effect. But it would be
            open to the court to resort to those provisions even in the
            case of a joint trial of several person permissible under
            Section 239."

           offence or of different offences "committed in the course
           of the same transaction". The expression advisedly used
           is "in the course of the same transaction". That
           expression is not akin to saying "in respect of the same
           subject-matter". It is pertinent to point out that the same
           expression is employed in <a href="/doc/218156/" id="a_37">Section 220(1)</a> of the Code also
           [corresponding to <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_38">Section 235(1)</a> of the old Code]. The
           meaning of the expression "in the course of the same
           transaction" used in <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_39">Section 223</a> is not materially
           different from that expression used in <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_40">Section 223(1)</a> [sic

              "The series of acts which constitute a transaction must
           of necessity be connected with one another and if some of
           them stand out independently. They would not form part

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">           12. For several offences to be part of the same
           transaction, the test which has to be applied is whether
           they are so related to one another in point of purpose or
           of cause and effect, or as principal and subsidiary, so as
           to result in one continuous action. Thus, where there is a
           commonality of purpose or design, where there is a
           continuity of action, than all those persons involved can
           be accused of the same or different offences "committed
           in the course of the same transaction"

           a person without any junction with the accused in the
           other case, then it cannot be treated as the same offence
           or even different offences "committed in the course of the
           same transaction". If such two diametrically opposite
           versions are put to joint trial the confusion which it can
           cause in the trial would be incalculable. It would then be
           a mess and then there would be no scope for a fair trial.

           umbrella of <a href="/doc/1419576/" id="a_45">Section 233</a> of the Code has only to be foiled

charges against the petitioner in RC-9S/2018 is to be tried by the Magistrate

and in RC-10S/2018, wherein the petitioner is not an accused is to be tried

by the Court of Sessions. Thus, ordering joint trial of both the

aforementioned cases will cause prejudice to the defence of the petitioner,

thus, he will lose his right to appeal, if convicted, by the Court of Sessions.

 Moreover, since no beatings were given to Surender Singh @ Pappu in the

to 18.00 hours, Surender Singh @ Pappu alongwith Kishore were beaten by

Atul Singh and his aides viz. Bauwa Singh, Vineet, Suman Singh and Sonu

village Makhi, Unnao. On 03.04.2018, between 17.17 hours to 21.43 hours,

the accused MLA called the SP Unnao, through phone, through phone, to

register a complaint against deceased for causing nuisance as a drunkard

person. The SP passed this information to Ashok Bhaduria [accused 1 (A-1)

in RC-9S/2018, who alongwith S.I. K.P. Singh reached at the spot of

incident [SI K.P. Singh is accused (A-2) in RC-9S/2018]. The distance

between the Police Station and place of incident is 800 meters, which is

evident from document D-1 in RC-9S/2018. Despite the deceased being

badly injured, he was brought to the Police Station and A-1 and A-2 were in

direct mobile contact with the accused MLA till 21.43 hours. The statement

 of PW-1 recorded under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_48">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. on 03.04.2018 shows that the

deceased was beaten and despite that, A-1 and A-2, (police officers) threw

him in the car and brought to the Police Station. At the same time, A-6

(Bauwa in RC-10S/2018) was exhorting that the deceased should be further

beaten up. PW-1 also states that her version of the case was not recorded by

the police though she was at the Police Station at the same time when the

deceased was being branded as accused. PW-9, Raja Pratap Singh in RC-

9S/2018 stated in his statement dated 03.04.2018 that he wrote the FIR at the

dictation of SI K.P. Singh (A-2) and another accused Tinku Singh.

Statement dated 03.04.2018 of PW-10 establishes that after the registration

of FIR by the petitioner, the accused had contacted him to inflict surgical

injuries so as to justify the record in GD Entry No. 52. This shows that

petitioner had concocted GD Entry on which heavy reliance is placed.

</p><p id="p_25">17.    Learned counsel for the CBI further submits that other part of GD

Entry, namely, recovery of Gun etc. from the deceased is also found to be

false. On 03.04.2018, local police registered FIR against Surender Singh @

Pappu under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_49">Sections 323</a>/<a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_50">504</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_51">506</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_52">Sections 3</a>/<a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_53">25</a> Arms Act on the

persons alongwith Country Made Pistol with 4 Live Cartridges, allegedly

belonging to the deceased. Accordingly, Surender Singh @ Pappu was sent

for treatment to District Hospital, Unnao alongwith SI Sushil Kumar and

Constable Pankaj Kumar. It is further argued that D-4 was the document

created by accused - Amir Khan (petitioner in the present case) to show

recovery of arms from the deceased. These arms were actually recovered

from the house of A-2 i.e. SI K.P. Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_26">18.    Learned counsel for CBI argued that Recovery Memo D-4 dated

03.04.2018 from the point of view of defence of the petitioner and testimony

of PW-23 is not helpful because the arguments advanced by the learned

counsel for petitioner is that Police Officer (PW-23) had also signed the

recovery memo and was not made an accused. The argument of the learned

counsel for petitioner is incorrect because document D-9 in RC-9S/2018 is

the GD Entry recorded by the petitioner. The charge sheet has allegation of

falsification of document. Even this document is falsified, as is clear from

the evidence of PW-10 and Para viii of charge sheet mentioned above.

Therefore, the fact that it was a part of conspiracy which involved death of

the deceased, is something, which can only be tested during the trial.

Surender Singh @ Pappu was conducted on 03.04.2018 at 9.15 PM at

District Hospital, Unnao by Dr. Prashant Upadhyay, EMO (PW-31 in RC-

10S/2018). This was done three hours after the police saw the injuries on

the deceased. 19 grave injuries were mentioned in the MLC. These were

grave with regard to the size of the injuries and some of the injuries were

sized at as deep as 15 cms to 31 cms. The MLC also recorded requirements

of emergency stitches and immediate admission of the deceased in the

hospital. On 03.04.2018 at 11.20 PM, Surender Singh @ Pappu was

admitted in the District Hospital, Unnao.

before Ld. ACJM-IV, Unnao, as IO requested him to send Surender Singh to

judicial custody for 14 days which was allowed. After production of

Surender Singh @ Pappu before the aforesaid Court, he was again brought

back to District Hospital, Unnao where he was formally discharged at 6.30

PM. On 05.04.2018 at 4 PM, District Jail, Unnao sent requisition to Chief

Medical Superintendent of District Hospital, Unnao for sending physician

and surgeon to District Jail, Unnao for providing treatment to Surender

Singh @ Pappu. Accordingly, Dr. Alok Pandey, Physician and Dr. S.N.

Gupta, Surgeon were sent for the aforesaid purpose. On 08.04.2018 at 9.05

his family members by resorting to violence executed in a planned manner

by forming an unlawful assembly, and then committing series of acts in a

planned manner with continuity of action intricately connected by proximity

to the place of occurrence, time and unity or community of purpose or

design". Thus, there is no illegality and perversity in the impugned order and

therefore, the present petition deserves to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_30">22.    I have heard the learned counsel for the parties in length and perused

the material on record. Statement of PW-1, which is document 20 in RC-

9S/2018 establishes that the deceased was badly beaten and despite that A-1

and A2, police officers threw him into the car and took to the Police Station.

At the same time, A-6 in RC-10S/2018 was exhorting that deceased should

be further beaten up. The said PW also states that her version of case was

not recorded by the police though she was at the Police Station at the same

time when the deceased was branded as accused. PW-9, Raja Pratap Singh

states that he wrote the FIR at the dictation of SI K.P. Singh (A-2) and

another accused Tinku Singh. Accordingly, the FIR was registered.

 person of Surender Singh @ Pappu (deceased) so as to justify what was

recorded in GD Entry No. 52. This shows that petitioner knowingly

concocted GD Entry No. 52. Consequently, the other part of GD Entry,

namely, recovery of Gun etc. from the deceased is also found to be false.

</p><p id="p_32">24.    It is pertinent to mention here that D-4 is the document created by the

petitioner to show recovery of arms from the deceased, whereas, these arms

were actually recovered from house of accused - SI K.P. Singh as is evident

from Para viii of charge sheet in RC-9S/2018. It is pertinent to mention here

that D-9 in RC-9S/2018 is the GD Entry 52 recorded by the petitioner. Even

this document is falsified, as is clear from the evidence of PW-10 and Para

viii of charge sheet. Thus, it creates doubt on the intention of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_33">25.    In my considered opinion, had petitioner given the correct picture in

G.D. Entry 52 by mentioning that police officers including the S.H.O

concerned brought Surender Singh, in police vehicle, in injured condition,

said Surender would not have been booked in criminal case and his family

members would be in position to get better treatment. In that situation,

Surender Singh might survive and would not have died. Thus, the case of

Surender Singh is height of planting the innocent person in a criminal case.

him very casually and discharging him from the Hospital within no time and

without giving proper treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_35">27.    In view of the above discussion, whether it was a part of conspiracy

which involved death of the deceased or not is something which can only be

tested at trial. In addition to above, Case Crime No. 90/2018 under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_57">Sections

147</a>/<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_58">323</a>/<a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_59">504</a> IPC was registered at PS - Makhi against Bauwa Singh, Vineet

Mishra, Shailu Singh, Sonu Singh and others on the complaint of Smt. Asha

Singh. Whereas, this case should have been registered by the petitioner since

PW-1 - Asha Singh stated that she was present on the previous day at the

Police Station at the time when Surender Singh @ Pappu (deceased) was

branded as accused, and she tried to given her version of the incident which

was not recorded by the petitioner who was the duty officer at that time.

</p><p id="p_36">28.    On perusal of impugned order, the learned trial Court is of the view

that "there is prima facie case that a conspiracy was hatched by the accused

that the "the policemen A-1, A-2 &amp; A-9 knowingly or deliberately became

accessory to the crime thereby joining in the series of acts whereby they

prepared and registered a false FIR and prepared other relevant documents

in order to frame the father of the prosecutrix, in furtherance of achieving

the common purpose of teaching the victim party a lesson for daring to rise

up against the might of the accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar (A-3) and his

family."
</p>
<p id="p_38">30.    In Para 23, the learned Judge held that "it was prima facie a case of

turning a blind eye to whatever that was happening to the deceased and his

family, and as per the prosecution of the policemen knowingly or

deliberately delayed their intervention at the behest of the other accused

person and failed to protect the victim party; and it was rightly canvassed by

the CBl, that it was no part of their duties to entertain a false complaint and

frame an innocent person. The plea that A-9 acted under the command of his

superior can only be tested during the course of trial."

       that conspiracy is an agreement between two or more
       persons to do an illegal act or an act which is not illegal
       by illegal means. The object behind the conspiracy is to
       achieve the ultimate aim of conspiracy. For a charge of
       conspiracy means knowledge about indulgence in either
       an illegal act or a legal act by illegal means is
       necessary. In some cases, intent of unlawful use being
       made of the goods or services in question may be
       inferred from the knowledge itself. This apart, the
       prosecution has not to establish that a particular
       unlawful use was intended, so long as the goods or
       services in question could not be put to any lawful use.
       Finally, when the ultimate offence consists of a chain of
       actions, it would not be necessary for the prosecution to

Hon‟ble Supreme Court and the petitioner, without suffering any protracted

trial, has full opportunity to argue and for placing the defence evidence to
