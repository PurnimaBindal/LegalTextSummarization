:ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Order of the Court is delivered by S. MANIKUMAR)

	Father of the detenu, Venkatesh @ Maangai, has sought for a  Writ of
Habeas Corpus, to call for the records pertaining to the proceedings of the
1st respondent in M.H.S.Confdl No.01/2014 dated 02.01.2014, quash the same,
and set his son aged about 24 years, at liberty.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.Assailing the correctness of the order of detention, Mr.Malaikani,
learned counsel for the petitioner made the following submissions:-	
	The detenu has come to adverse notice of the police in three cases. The
first adverse case has been registered in Cr.No.203/2013,  under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_2">Sections
341</a>, <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_3">294(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_4">506(ii)</a> IPC on the file of Tirunelveli City Town Police
Station.  The second adverse case has been  registered in Cr.No.172/2013,
under <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_5">Sections 294(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_6">506</a> (ii) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> on the file of Thevarkulam Police
Station and the third adverse case has been registered in Cr.No.440/2013,
under <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_8">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_9">307</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_10">506(ii)</a> IPC on the file of Manur Police
Station. The ground case has been registered in Cr.No.320/2013 under <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_11">Sections
294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/1688284/" id="a_12">387</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_13">506(ii)</a> IPC on the file of Thalaiyuthu Police Station.
</p>	
<p id="p_3">	3.The Secretary to the Government, Home, Prohibition and Excise
Department, Chennai, Second respondent herein, has failed to consider the
representation, dated 22.01.2014 sent by the petitioner, in time.  The
District Collector and District Magistrate, Tirunelveli, Detaining Authority,
1st respondent, without any material, has mechanically arrived at the
subjective satisfaction and passed the detention order.  There is a delay in
considering the representation.  Facts of similar cases referred in the
detention order, particularly Cr.M.P.No.4141 of 2011 and Cr.M.P.No.7150 of
2013, considered by the Detaining Authority, are totally different to the
ground case of the detenu.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4.Though this ground has not been raised in the affidavit, learned
counsel for the petitioner submitted that the detenu has been arrested on
23.11.2013, in connection with the ground case.  He has been produced before
the learned Judicial Magistrate, No.III, Tirunelveli and remanded.  His
remand period was due to expire on 03.01.2014.  When the live link between
the arrest on 23.11.2013 and commission of any prejudicial activity no longer
existed, and when there was no need to detain him, after a long delay, ie.,
on 02.01.2014, detention order has been passed.  According to the learned
counsel, no explanation has been offered by the detaining authority either in
the grounds of detention nor in the affidavit and hence the order of
detention is vitiated on the ground of delay in passing the said detention
order. For the abovesaid reasons, learned counsel prayed to set aside the
Detention Order.
</p>	
<p id="p_5">	5.On the other hand, based the counter affidavit filed by the Detaining
Authority, Mr.C.Ramesh, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing for
the respondents, submitted that the impugned Detention Order has been passed
after following the  procedure and after arriving at the subjective
satisfaction that there was compelling necessity, and in order to prevent the
detenue, from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of Public
Order.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6.Learned Additional Public Prosecutor further submitted that there is
no delay in considering the representation sent on behalf of the detenu, as
contended by the petitioner. Further, copies of 161(3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">Cr.P.C</a>. statement
enclosed at pages 147 to 157 and FIR at page nos.135 and 137 of the booklet,
would reveal that the detenu had acted in a manner prejudicial to the
maintenance of the public order.
</p><p id="p_7">	7.Learned Additional Public Prosecutor further submitted that the facts
relating to the adverse cases and the ground case are sufficient to arrive at
the conclusion that if the detenu is allowed to remain at large, he would
indulge in further activities in future, which would be prejudicial to the
maintenance of the public order.  He further submitted that when the
petitioner has not raised any ground of delay in passing the order, either in
the representation or in the supporting affidavit, oral submissions on that
aspect, need not be considered.  However, he submitted that the delay has
occasioned due to the time consumed by the sponsoring authority in collecting
all the documents from different police stations, and placing it before the
detaining authority.  He also submitted that no sooner, the sponsoring
authority placed all the materials, without any delay, the detaining
authority has passed the order.  On the aspect of bail, he relied on
Reddiah's case.  He prayed for dismissal of the present petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	8.Mr.S.Malaikani, for Mr.P.Rajkumar and Mr.C.Ramesh, learned counsel
for the parties made elaborate submissions, placing reliance on many
decisions.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	9.The object of detention and the detention laws, is not to punish,
but, to prevent commission of certain offences.  If the detaining authority
is satisfied that with a view to prevent such person, from indulging in acts
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, in future, then an order of
detention is passed.  Satisfaction of the detaining authority is based on
material documents.  There must be likelihood of a person indulging in such
activities and inference of such likelihood, has to be drawn from the
materials placed for his consideration.
</p>	
<p id="p_10">	10.It is for the detaining authority to consider, on the basis of
antecedents and arrive at a conclusion, whether the detenu, had come to
adverse notice, whether he would continue to indulge in prejudicial
activities, if he remains at large.  It is also obligatory on the part of the
detaining authority to arrive at the subjective satisfaction, on the
materials placed before him, as to whether, recourse to normal criminal law
did not have the desired effect of preventing him, from indulging in such
activities, which are prejudicial to the maintenance of public order in
future, whether there is compelling necessity.  Satisfaction of the detaining
authority consists of two parts;
</p><p id="p_11">	1) The detenu in judicial custody and if enlarged on bail, whether,
there is likelihood of indulging in such activities in future; and
</p><p id="p_12">	2) Whether the detaining authority can arrive at the subjective
satisfaction, on the basis of the materials while in custody.  Compelling
necessity is one of the factors to be taken into consideration by the
detaining authority, in order to prevent a person, from indulging acts, which
are prejudicial.
</p>	
<p id="p_13">	11.When the detenu does not file a bail application, then there are
decisions, where the courts have come to the conclusion that there is no
possibility of the detenu, coming out on bail, and therefore, the subjective
satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority, has been found fault
with.  In cases, where the bail application is pending, which the detaining
authority takes note of the same, while arriving at the subjective
satisfaction, again, he is found fault, for prejudging the issue, as regards
grant of of bail.  If the bail application is dismissed, then also, there are
instances, where court also says that, since the bail application is
dismissed, then there is no real possibility of the detenu coming out on
bail.  Thus at all stages of bail (i.e) (i) application not filed, (ii)
application pending and (iii) application dismissed, courts have found fault
with the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, on  the aspect
of coming out on bail, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each
case.	
</p>
<p id="p_14">	12.Jail or bail, the detaining authority is still empowered to consider
the past antecedents of a person and arrive at a conclusion, as to whether
such person should be allowed to remain at large and that he would indulge in
activities in future, which are prejudicial to the maintenance of public
order.  At the same time, considering the most cherishable right of freedom
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, the detaining
authority has to act with all due care and caution, and with the sense of
responsibility, when the liberty of the citizen is deprived of without trial.
While arriving at the subjective satisfaction, the detaining authority should
satisfy himself as to whether the detenu is in judicial custody or on bail,
in respect of the cases, considered by the detaining authority, where the
acts alleged are prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and whether
he is likely to be released on bail.
</p>	
<p id="p_15">	13.Although the Apex Court in various decisions, has restricted the
scope of judicial review, on the subjective satisfaction of the detaining
authority and held that the Court cannot sit in appeal over the subjective
satisfaction, yet challenge, as to the adequacy or sufficiency of the
material considered by the detaining authority, is frequently raised in many
Habeas Corpus Petitions, particularly, on the aspect of subjective
satisfaction of the detaining authority, regarding the possibility of the
detenue, coming out on bail.
</p>

<p id="p_16">	14.In the light of the decisions of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/173882436/" id="a_16">Rekha vs. State
of Tamil Nadu</a>, reported in 2011 (5) SCC 244, <a href="/doc/1255245/" id="a_17">G.Reddeiah v. Government of
A.P</a>., reported in 2012 (2) SCC 389 and <a href="/doc/84095427/" id="a_18">Huidrom Konungjao Singh vs. State of
Manipur and others</a>, reported in 2012 (3) MLJ Crl 794 (SC) = 2012 (7) SCC 181,
the question calls up for consideration is whether the powers of the
detaining authority  can be circumscribed only to the aspect of bail, to
arrive at the subjective satisfaction.  Let us consider some of the
decisions, on the aspect of detention, scope of judicial review, on
subjective satisfaction.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	15.In Re: Jayantilal Nathubhai reported in (1949) 51 Bom.L.R. 653, a
Full Bench of the Bombay High Court, observed as follows:
	?.......whenever words like "satisfaction" or "it appears" have been
used in an enactment or a regulation, the interpretation which has now been
established is that the "satisfaction" is undoubtedly a condition precedent
to the exercise of powers under the section. But all the same, what the
Courts have got to see, when subsequently an application is made challenging
the existence of that satisfaction, is whether there was the subjective
satisfaction of the authority which made the order and not whether there were
grounds upon which a reasonable person could be satisfied that it was
necessary to make the order; such being at times called an objective test of
the satisfaction. But even though that view may be taken to have been
established, as it has been pointed out frequently, the satisfaction of the
mind is just as much a state of fact as, for example, the state of digestion,
of the person who makes the order, and consequently if any one challenges
that the authority which made the order had not the state of mind which could
be described as a state of "satisfaction", it is open to the Court to say
that it must be satisfied as to the state of the mind of the person who made
the order and to take evidence as to the existence of the state of mind. But
all the same, even though it is open to the Court when the bona fides of the
authority which made the order are challenged to take evidence with regard to
the state of the mind, one must not approach the order, the validity of which
is challenged, with prejudice which may possibly have been derived from past
experience.?
</p>
<p id="p_18">	16.In the Constitutional Bench Judgment, State of Bombay vs. Atma Ram
Shridhar Vaidya, reported in AIR 1951 SC 157, comprising of six Hon'ble
Judges, The Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kania, the Then Chief Justice of India, on
behalf of Himself and Three other learned Judges, on the aspect of subjective
satisfaction, at paragraph 5 of the judgment, held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_19">	5. It has to be borne in mind that the legislation in question is not
an emergency legislation. The powers of preventive detention under this Act
of 1950 are in addition to those contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>,
where preventive detention is followed by an inquiry or trial. By its very
nature, preventive detention is aimed at preventing the commission of an
offence or preventing the detained person from achieving a certain end. The
authority making the order therefore cannot always be in possession of full
detailed information when it passes the order and the information in its
possession may fall far short of legal proof of any specific offence,
although it may be indicative of strong probability of the impending
commission of a prejudicial act. Section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act
therefore requires that the Central Government or the State Government must
be satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him
from acting in any manner prejudicial to (1) the defence of India, the
relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India, or (2) the
security of the State or the maintenance of public order, or (3) the
maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community ... it is
necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained.
According to the wording of <a href="/doc/1507082/" id="a_20">Section 3</a> therefore before the Government can
pass an order of preventive detention it must be satisfied with respect to
the individual person that his activities are directed against one or other
of the three objects mentioned in the section, and that the detaining
authority was satisfied that it was necessary to prevent him from acting in
such a manner. The wording of the section thus clearly shows that it is the
satisfaction of the Central Government or the State Government on the point
which alone is necessary to be established. It is significant that while the
objects intended to be defeated are mentioned, the different methods, acts or
omissions by which that can be done are not mentioned, as it is not humanly
possible to give such an exhaustive list. The satisfaction of the Government
however must be based on some grounds. There can be no satisfaction if there
are no grounds for the same. There may be a divergence of opinion as to
whether certain grounds are sufficient to bring about the satisfaction
required by the section.  One person may think one way, another the other
way. If, therefore, the grounds on which it is stated that the Central
Government or the State Government was satisfied are such as a rational human
being can consider connected in some manner with the objects which were to be
prevented from being attained, the question of satisfaction except on the
ground of mala fides cannot be challenged in a court. Whether in a particular
case the grounds are sufficient or not, according to the opinion of any
person or body other than the Central Government or the State Government, is
ruled out by the wording of the section. It is not for the court to sit in
the place of the Central Government or the State Government and try to
determine if it would have come to the same conclusion as the Central or the
State Government. As has been generally observed, this is a matter for the
subjective decision of the Government and that cannot be substituted by an
objective test in a Court of law. Such detention orders are passed on
information and materials which may not be strictly admissible as evidence
under the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_21">Evidence Act</a> in a court, but which the law, taking into
consideration the needs and exigencies of administration, has allowed to be
considered sufficient for the subjective decision of the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	17.The Hon'ble Mr.Justice Patanjali Sastri, in his separate judgment,
after considering another Constitution Bench judgment in A.K.Gopalan's case,
comprising of six Hon'ble Judges reported in AIR 1950 SC 27 = 1950 SCR 88, at
paragraphs 23 and 24, held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_21">  23. When the power to issue a detention order has thus been made to depend
upon the existence of state of mind in the detaining authority, that is, its
?satisfaction?, which is a purely subjective condition, so as to exclude a
judicial enquiry into the sufficiency of the grounds to justify the
detention, it seems to me to be wholly inconsistent with that scheme to hold
that it is open to the court to examine the sufficiency of the same grounds
to enable the person detained to make a representation, for, be it noted, the
grounds to be communicated to the person detained are the ?grounds on which
the order has been made?. Indeed, the logical result of the argument advanced
by the respondent's counsel would be to invalidate <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_22">Section 3</a> of the Act
insofar as it purports to make the satisfaction of the Government the sole
condition of a lawful detention, for, if clause (5) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_23">Article 22</a> were to be
construed as impliedly authorising a judicial review of the grounds of
detention to see if they contain sufficient particulars for making a
representation, then, the subjective condition prescribed in <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_24">Section 3</a> would
be inconsistent with that clause and therefore void. When this was pointed
out to counsel he submitted that the decision in Gopalan case( AIR 1950 SC 27
= 1950 SCR 88) as to the constitutionality of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_25">Section 3</a> required
reconsideration in the light of his arguments based on <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_26">Article 22</a>, clause
(5). Although the clause was not then considered from this point of view, it
came in for a good deal of discussion in connection with <a href="/doc/1352526/" id="a_27">Section 14</a> of the
Act and the present argument must, in my opinion, be rejected because it runs
counter to that decision.
</p><p id="p_22">  24. Apart from this aspect of the matter, I am not much impressed with the
merits of the argument. While granting, in view of the structure and wording
of clause (5), that the grounds communicated to the person detained are to
form the basis of his representation against the order, I am unable to agree
with what appears to be the major premise of the argument, namely, that
clause (5) contemplates an inquiry where the person detained is to be
formally charged with specific acts or omissions of a culpable nature and
called upon to answer them. As pointed out by Lord Atkinson in Rex v.
Halliday (1917 A.C. 260 at p.275 = 86 L.J.K.B 1119) preventive detention
being a precautionary measure, ?it must necessarily proceed in all cases to
some extent on suspicion or anticipation as distinct from proof?, and it must
be capable of being employed by the executive government in sudden
emergencies on unverified information supplied to them by their police or
intelligence officers. If the Government, acting honestly and in good faith
make an order being ?satisfied? on such information, however lacking in
particulars, that a person should be detained in the public interest, as they
have been empowered by Parliament to do, then all that <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_28">Article 22(5)</a> requires
of them is to communicate as soon as may be the grounds which led to the
making of the order, to the person concerned, and to give him the earliest
opportunity of making any representation which he may wish to make on the
basis of what is communicated to him. If such communication is made and such
opportunity is given the detaining authority will have complied with the
procedure prescribed by the Constitution, and the person under detention
cannot complain that he has been deprived of his personal liberty otherwise
than in accordance with the procedure established by law. I can find nothing
in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_29">Article 22</a>, clause (5), to warrant the view that the grounds on which the
order of detention has been made must be such that, when communicated to the
person detained they are found by a court of law to be sufficient to enable
him to make what the court considers to be an adequate representation. The
right to be produced before a Magistrate and to consult and be defended by a
legal practitioner is expressly denied by the Constitution itself to a person
under preventive detention [vide Articles 22(1), (2) and (3) and this Court
held in Gopalan case ( AIR 1950 SC 27 = 1950 SCR 88)  that there was nothing
in the Constitution to entitle him to a hearing even before the detaining
authority. All this underlines the executive character of the function
exercised by the authority which does not in any way embark on a judicial or
quasi-judicial inquiry. In such circumstances the representation which the
person detained is allowed to make to the Government, which is constituted
the Judge in its own cause,  cannot be assumed to be similar in scope or
purpose to a defence against a formulated charge in a court of law. The
argument, therefore, that the right of making a representation should be made
effective in the sense that such person should be enabled to defend himself
successfully if possible, and, for that purpose, the detaining authority
should communicate to him the necessary particulars on pain of having the
order quashed if such particulars are not furnished, proceeds on a
misconception of the true position.
</p>
<p id="p_23">At paragraph 45, it is further held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_24">	?45. .......  Before the Constitution came into force there were laws
for the maintenance of public security in almost all the provinces and in
those laws there were provisions similar to the provisions of Section 3 of
the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. It was held in many cases that in the
absence of bad faith, and provided the grounds on which the authority founded
its satisfaction had a reasonable relation or relevancy to the object which
the legislation in question had in view, the satisfaction of the authority
was purely subjective and could not be questioned in any court of law.  The
decision of the Federal Court in Machindar Shivaji Mahar v. King is one of
such decisions. Vagueness of the grounds on which satisfaction of the
authority is founded cannot be treated as on the same footing as the
irrelevancy of the grounds, unless the vagueness be such as may by itself, be
cogent evidence in proof of bad faith. If the grounds are relevant to the
objects of the legislation and if there is no proof of bad faith, then mere
vagueness of the grounds cannot vitiate the satisfaction founded on them. The
satisfaction being subjective, the court cannot arrogate to itself the
responsibility of judging the sufficiency or otherwise of the grounds. It is
true that at the time those decisions were given the Constitution had not
come into force and there were no fundamental rights, but these well
established principles were recognised and adopted by all members of this
Court in Gopalan case ( AIR 1950 SC 27 = 1950 SCR 88)  which came up for
consideration after the Constitution had come into force. In that case it was
held unanimously that under Section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950,
the satisfaction of the authority was purely subjective and could not, in the
absence of proof of bad faith, be questioned at all and that <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_30">Section 3</a> was
not unconstitutional. It is true that the arguments now advanced were not
advanced in exactly the same form on that occasion but that fact makes no
difference, for the arguments have no force as they are founded on the
assumption that the grounds on which an order may be made must be such as
will, when communicated, be sufficiently full and precise so as to enable the
detenu to make a representation. I find no warrant for such an assumption.
Indeed, the fact that this Court has held that <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_31">Section 3</a> of the Act which
makes the satisfaction of the authority a purely subjective matter is not
unconstitutional clearly destroys the cogency of the argument formulated as
hereinbefore stated. The decision in Gopalan case ( AIR 1950 SC 27 = 1950 SCR
</p><p id="p_25">88)  as to the validity of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_32">Section 3</a> of the Act makes it impossible to accept
this argument.
</p><p id="p_26">	37. It is next urged that even if the initial order was not invalid
when made because satisfaction was a purely subjective matter for the
authority alone and the court cannot consider or pronounce upon the
sufficiency of the grounds on which the satisfaction was based, nevertheless,
the continuance of the detention becomes unlawful if the same grounds when
communicated, be found to be vague and devoid of particulars so as to render
the making of a representation by the detenu somewhat difficult.

<p id="p_27">	18.<a href="/doc/1528958/" id="a_33">In Shibban Lal v. State of U.P</a>., reported in AIR 1954 SC 179 = 1954
Cri LJ 456, it was held that a detention order depends entirely upon the
satisfaction of the appropriate authority and the sufficiency of the grounds
upon which such satisfaction purports to be based, cannot be challenged in a
Court of law except on the ground of mala fides, provided they have a
rational probative value and are not extraneous to the scope or purpose of
the Legislative provision. The Court said at para 8, "A Court of law is not
even competent to enquire into the truth or otherwise of the facts which are
mentioned as grounds of detention in the communication to the detenu under<a href="/doc/681440/" id="a_34"> S.

	?11 ???The second difficulty is that under the Act the subjective
satisfaction, which is the basis for an order under it, is that of the
relevant District Magistrate and not of a Court of law, and for that reason
the court is precluded from going into the question as to the adequacy or
otherwise of the materials on which such satisfaction has been reached.
Besides, the District Magistrate, who issued the order, is not the only and
exclusive authority under the Act who has to be satisfied as to the necessity
of the order of detention. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_36">The Act</a> requires him to report the case to the
Government, who in its turn has to be satisfied, on consideration of all
relevant materials before it, that the order is both valid and proper. There
is next the Advisory Board which has to consider once again all the relevant
materials including the representation made by a detenu and has to give a
personal hearing to him, if he so desires.?

the detaining authority. If the detaining authority is of opinion on grounds
which are germane and relevant, that it is necessary to detain a person from
acting prejudicially as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_39">Section 3</a> of the Act then it is not
for the Supreme Court to consider objectively how imminent is the likelihood
of the detenu indulging in these activities.
</p><p id="p_31">		6. .......No doubt, this decision does suggest that the order of
detention can be served on the person concerned if and after he is acquitted
in the said criminal proceedings but in our view merely because the person
concerned has been served while in custody when it is expected that he would
soon be released that service cannot invalidate the order of detention. The
real hurdle in making an order of detention against a person already in
custody is based on the view that is futile to keep a person in dual custody
under two different orders but this objection cannot hold good if the earlier
custody is without doubt likely to cease very soon and the detention order is
made merely with the object of rendering it operative when the previous
custody is about to cease. It has also been pointed out that the grounds
relate to a period more than a year prior to the order of detention. This
according to the submission also renders the order mala fide. In our opinion,
this contention is without merit. It has to be borne, in mind that it is
always the past conduct, activities or the antecedent history of a person
which the detaining authority takes into account in making a detention order.
No doubt the past conduct, activities or antecedent history should ordinarily
be proximate, in point of time and should have a rational connection with the
conclusion that the detention of the person is necessary but it is for the
detaining authority who has to arrive at a subjective satisfaction in
considering the past activities and coming to his conclusion if on the the
basis of those activities he is satisfied that the activities of the person
concerned are such that he is likely to indulge in prejudicial activities
necessitating his detention. As observed in <a href="/doc/186059/" id="a_40">Ujjagar Singh v. State of Punjab</a>
reported in [1952] S.C.R. 757, it is largely from prior events or past
conduct and antecedent history of a person showing tendencies or inclinations
of a person concerned that an inference can be drawn whether he is likely
even in the future to act in a manner prejudicial to the public order. If the
authority is satisfied that in view of the past conduct of the person there
is need for detention then it could not be said that the order of detention
is not justified.?

<p id="p_32">	21.<a href="/doc/679149/" id="a_41">In Khudiram Das vs. The State of West Bengal and others</a>, reported in
1975 (2) SCC 81, in a Four Judges Bench judgment,  at paragraphs 9 and 10 ,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_33">	9.	But that does not mean that the subjective satisfaction of the
detaining authority is wholly immune from judicial reviewability. The Courts
have by judicial decisions carved out an area, limited though it be, within
which the validity of the subjective satisfaction can yet be subjected to
judicial scrutiny. The basic postulate on which the courts have proceeded is
that the subjective satisfaction being a condition precedent for the exercise
of the power conferred on the executive, the court can always examine whether
the requisite satisfaction is arrived at by the authority: if it is not, the
condition precedent to the exercise of the power would not be fulfilled and
the exercise of the power would be bad. There are several grounds evolved by
judicial decisions for saying that no subjective satisfaction is arrived at
by the authority as required under the statute. The simplest case is whether
the authority has not applied its mind at all; in such a case the authority
could not possibly be satisfied as regards the fact in respect of which it is
required to be satisfied. Emperor v. Shibnath Bannerji [AIR 1943 FC 75], is a
case in point. Then there may be a case where the power is exercised
dishonestly or for an improper purpose : such a case would also negative the
existence of satisfaction on the part of the authority. The existence of
'improper purpose', that is, a purpose not contemplated by the statute, has
been recognised as an independent ground of control in several decided
cases....... The satisfaction said to have been arrived at by the authority
would also be bad where it is based on the application of a wrong test or the
misconstruction of a statute. Where this happens, the satisfaction of the
authority would not be in respect of the thing in regard to which it is
required to be satisfied. Then again the satisfaction must be grounded on
materials which are of rationally probative value'. Machindar v. King [AIR
1950 FC 129] The grounds on which the satisfaction is based must be, such as
a rational human being can consider connected with the fact in respect of
which the satisfaction is to be reached. They must be relevant to the subject
matter of the inquiry and must not be extraneous to the scope and purpose of
the statute. If the authority has taken into account, it may even be with the
best of intention, as a relevant factor something which it could not properly
take into account in deciding whether or not to exercise the power or the
manner or extent to which it should be exercised, the exercise of the power
would be bad. <a href="/doc/802267/" id="a_42">Pratap Singh v. State of Punjab</a> [AIR 1964 SC 72]. If there are
to be found in the statute expressly or by implication matters which the
authority ought to have regard to, then, in exercising the power, the
authority must have regard to those matters. The authority must call its
attention to the matters which it is bound to consider.
</p><p id="p_34">	10.	There is also one other ground on which the subjective
satisfaction reached by an authority can successfully be challenged and it is
of late becoming increasingly important. The genesis of this ground is to be
found in the famous words of lord Halsbury in Sharp v. Wakefield [1891 AC
173, 179],
	"..... when it is said that something is to be done within the
discretion of the authorities-that something is to be done according to the
rules of reason and justice, not according to private, opinion-according to
law and not humour. It is to be, not arbitrary, vague, fanciful, but legal
and regular."
</p><p id="p_35">So far as this ground is concerned', the courts in the United States have
gone much further than courts in England or in this country. The United
States courts are prepared to review administrative findings which are not
supported by substantial evidence, that is by "such relevant findings as a
reasonable man may accept adequate to support a conclusion". But in England
and in India, the courts stop- short at merely inquiring whether the grounds
on which the authority has reached its subjective satisfaction are such that
any reasonable person could possibly arrive at such satisfaction. "If", to
use the words of Lord Greene, M. R., in Associated Provincial Picture Houses
Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [(1948) 1 KB 223], words which have found
approval of the House of Lords in Smith v. East Eilor Rural District Council
[1956 AC 736] and Fswcoit Properties Ltd. v. Buckingham County Council [1961
AC 546] - the authority has "come. to a conclusion on so unreasonable that no
reasonable authority could ever have come to it, then the courts can
interfere". In such a case, a legitimate inference may fairly be drawn either
that the authority "did not honestly form that view or that in forming it, he
could not have applied his mind to the relevant facts". Ross v. Papadopollos
[(1958) 1 WLR 546]. The power of the court to interfere in such a case is not
as an appellate authority to override a decision taken by the statutory
authority, but as a judicial authority. which is concerned, and concerned
only to see. whether the statutory authority has contravened the law by
acting in excess of the power which the legislature has confided in it.?

<p id="p_36">	22. After referring to <a href="/doc/353578/" id="a_43">Debu Mahto v. State of West Bengal</a> reported in
1974 (4) SCC 135, a case of solitary incident, the Apex Court in the same
judgment, (i.e) Khudiram Das's case, further observed thus,	
	?This Court did not go into the adequacy of or sufficiency of the
grounds on which the order of detention was based, but merely examined
whether on the grounds given to the. detenu, any reasonable authority could
possibly come to the conclusion to which the District Magistrate did. It is
true that this ground in a sense tends to blur the dividing line between
subjective satisfaction and objective determination but the dividing line is
very much there howsoever faint or delicate it may be, and courts have never
failed to recognise it.

<p id="p_37">	23.On the aspect of Judicial Review, the Apex Court, at Paragraph 11,
held as follows:	
</p><p id="p_38">	?11. This discussion is sufficient to show that there is nothing like
unfettered discretion immune from judicial review ability. The truth is that
in a Government under law, there can be no such thing as unreviewable
discretion. "Law has reached its finest moments", said Justice Douglas, "when
it has freed man from the unlimited discretion of some ruler, some official,
some bureaucrat-Absolute discretion is a ruthless master. It is more
destructive of freedom than any of man's other inventions". United States v.
Wunderlick.(6) And this is much more so in a case Where personal liberty is
involved. That is why the Courts have devised various methods of judicial
control so that power in the hands of an individual officer or authority is
not misused or abused or exercised arbitrarily or without any justifiable
grounds.?

what is enough for the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authorities
with which interference could be justified only if it is clear that no
reasonable person could possibly be satisfied about the need to detain on the
grounds given in which case the detention would be in excess of the power to
detain. The required satisfaction must have reference to a need to prevent
what is anticipated from the detenu. The past conduct or activity is only
relevant in sofaras it furnishes reasonable grounds for an apprehension.
Prevention and punishment have some common ultimate aims but their immediate
objectives and modes of action are distinguishable.?

been painted in all these incidents as the prime-mover of the gear which
resulted in disturbances accompanied by violence, looting and mischief on a
wide scale. These particulars are neither vague, nor are they irrelevant to

jurisdiction possessed by the High Court was to examine whether the
subjective satisfaction reached by the District Magistrate was based on no

have to be made against a person already confined to jail or detained. But in
such a situation as held by this Court it must be present to the mind of the
detaining authority that keeping in view the fact that the person is already
detained a preventive detention order is still necessary. The subjective
satisfaction of the detaining authority must comprehend the very fact that
the person sought to be detained is already in jail or under detention and
yet a preventive detention order is a compelling necessity. If the subjective
satisfaction is reached without the awareness of this very relevant fact the
detention order is likely to be vitiated. But as stated by this Court it will
depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.?

is, as noted and observed in Vijay Narain Singh case, 1984 (3) SCC 14 = 1984
SCC (Crl) 361 a hard law but, it is a necessary evil in the modern society
and must be pragmatically construed, so that it works. That is how law serves
the society but does not become an impotent agent. Anti-social elements
creating havoc have to be taken care of by law. Lawless multitude bring
democracy and constitution into disrepute. Bad facts bring hard laws ? but
these should be properly and legally applied. It should be so construed that
it does not endanger social defence or the defence of the community, at the
same time does not infringe the liberties of the citizens. A balance should
always be struck.

for the court to put itself in the position of the detaining authority and to
satisfy itself that untested facts reveal a path of crime provided these

</p><p id="p_50">	14. It has long been established that the subjective satisfaction of
the detaining authority as regards the factual existence of the condition on
which the order of detention can be made i.e. the grounds of detention
constitutes the foundation for the exercise of the power of detention and the
court cannot be invited to consider the propriety or sufficiency of the
grounds on which the satisfaction of the detaining authority is based. Nor
can the court, on a review of the grounds, substitute its own opinion for
that of the authority. But this does not imply that the subjective
satisfaction of the detaining authority is wholly immune from the power of
judicial review. It inferentially follows that the subjective satisfaction
being a condition precedent for the exercise of the power conferred on the
executive, the court can always examine whether the requisite satisfaction
was arrived at by the authority; if it is not, the condition precedent to the
exercise of the power would not be fulfilled and the exercise of the power
would be bad. The simplest case is where the authority has not applied its
mind at all; in such a case, the authority could not possibly be satisfied as
regards the fact in respect of which it is required to be satisfied. See:

</p>	
<p id="p_51">	31.Explaining the intention behind the detention laws, the Apex Court,
at Paragraph 31, held as follows:
</p><p id="p_52">	?31. In addition to the reasons given therein we may add the following
by way of supplementary material. Though the element of detention is a common
factor in cases of preventive detention as well as punitive detention, there
is a vast difference in their objective. Punitive detention follows a
sentence awarded to an offender for proven charges in a trial by way of
punishment and has in it the elements of retribution, deterrence,
correctional factor and institutional treatment in varying degrees. On the
contrary preventive detention is an extraordinary measure resorted to by the
State on account of compulsive factors pertaining to maintenance of public
order, safety of public life and the welfare of the economy of the country.
The need for this extraordinary measure i.e. detention without trial was
realised by the founding fathers of the Constitution as an inevitable
necessity for safeguarding the interests of the public and the country and
hence a specific provision has been made in clause (3) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_54">Article 22</a>
providing for preventive detention being imposed in appropriate cases
notwithstanding the fundamental right of freedom and liberty guaranteed to
the citizens by the Constitution. The entire scheme of preventive detention
is based on the bounden duty of the State to safeguard the interests of the
country and the welfare of the people from the canker of anti-national
activities by anti-social elements affecting the maintenance of public order
or the economic welfare of the country. Placing the interests of the nation
above the individual liberty of the anti-social and dangerous elements who
constitute a grave menace to society by their unlawful acts, the preventive
detention laws have been made for effectively keeping out of circulation the
detenus during a prescribed period by means of preventive detention.?

reported in 1988 (1) SCC 296 = 1988 SCC (Criminal) 116, on the aspect of
subjective satisfaction, at paragraphs 8 and 11, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held as follows:-	
</p><p id="p_54">	?The sufficiency of the materials available to the detaining authority
is not to be examined by the court.  While considering the writ petition of
or on behalf of the detenu, the Supreme Court or the High Court does not sit
in appeal over the detention order, and it is not for the court to go into
and assess the probative value of the evidence available to the detaining
authority.  Of course, a detention order not supported by any evidence may
have to be quashed, but that is not the position here.  There was clearly
sufficient material before the District Magistrate to justify the forming of
his opinion.  It was not therefore possible to accept the contention that the
ground mentioned for the detention was non-existent.
</p><p id="p_55">	The subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority as regards the
factual existence of the condition on which the order of detention can be
made, namely, the grounds of detention constitute the foundation for the
exercise of the power of detention and the court cannot be incited to
consider the propriety or sufficiency of the grounds on which the

<p id="p_56">	33.<a href="/doc/212274/" id="a_56">In Kamarunnissa v. Union of India</a> reported in 1991 (1) SCC 128, in a
Two Judges Bench judgment, a contention has been made that there was no
compelling reason for the detaining authority to pass the impugned orders of
detention, as the detenus were already in custody, on the date of the passing
of the detention order. Reliance was placed on many decisions to the effect
that, if a person is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his
being released therefrom, the power of detention should not ordinarily be
exercised.  Relying on contra decisions, Union of India has contended that
detention can still be exercised, if before passing a detention order, in
respect of the person, who is in jail, the concerned authority satisfied
himself, and that the satisfaction had been reached, on the basis of cogent
materials that there was a real possibility of the detenu being released on
bail, and further if released on bail, the material on record, justify that
he would indulge in prejudicial activity if not detained. After considering a
catena of decisions, the Apex Court held, as follows:
</p><p id="p_57">	?the mere fact that the detenu was in custody was not sufficient to
invalidate a detention order and the decision must depend on the facts of
each case. Since the law of preventive detention was intended to prevent a
detenu from acting in any manner considered prejudicial under the law.
ordinarily it need not be resorted to if the detenu is in custody unless the
detaining authority has reason to believe that the subsisting custody of the
detenu may soon terminate by his being released on bail and having regard to
his recent antecedents he is likely to indulge in similar prejudicial
activity unless he is prevented from doing so by an appropriate order of
preventive detention.?
</p>
<p id="p_58">	34.In Kamarunnissa's case (cited supra), reliance was also placed in
<a href="/doc/1316604/" id="a_57">Shashi Aggarwal v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, [1988] SCC 436, wherein, the
Supreme Court held that the possibility of the court granting bail is not
sufficient, nor is a bald statement that the detenu would repeat his criminal
activities enough to pass an order of detention, unless there is credible
information and cogent reason apparent on the record that the detenu, if
enlarged on bail, would act prejudicially.  In Kamarunnissa's case, the
Supreme Court also considered the views expressed in <a href="/doc/1348215/" id="a_58">Anand Prakash v. State
of Uttar Pradesh</a> reported in [1990] 1 SCC 291 and <a href="/doc/1258899/" id="a_59">Dharmendra Sunganchand
Chelawat v. Union of India</a> reported in [1990] 1 SCC 746. After considering
the decisions, as to when an order of detention, could be passed, the Supreme
Court in Kamarunnissa's case,  at Paragraph 13, held as follows:
	?From the catena of decisions referred to above it seems clear to us
that even in the case of a person in custody a detention order can validly be
passed (1) if the authority passing the order is aware of the fact that he is
actually in custody; (2) if he has reason to believe on the basis of reliable
material placed before him (a) that there is a real possibility of his being
released on bail, and (b) that on being so released he would in all
probability indulge in prejudicial activity and (3) if it is felt essential
to detain him to prevent him from so doing. If the authority passes an order
after recording his satisfaction in this behalf, such an order cannot be
struck down on the ground that the proper course for the authority was to
oppose the bail and if bail is granted notwithstanding such opposition, to
question it before a higher court. What this court stated in the case of
<a href="/doc/1894967/" id="a_60">Ramesh Yadav v. District Magistrate, Etah</a> reported in 1985 (4) SCC 232, was
that ordinarily a detention order should not be passed merely to pre-empt or
circumvent enlargement on bail in cases which are essentially criminal in
nature and can be dealt with under the ordinary law. It seems to us well
settled that even in a case where a person is in custody, if the facts and
circumstances of the case so demand. resort can be had to the law of
preventive detention. This seems to be quite clear from the case law
discussed above and there is no need to refer to the High Court decisions to
which our attention was drawn since they do not hold otherwise. We,
therefore. find it difficult to accept the contention of the counsel for the
petitioners that there was no valid and compelling reason for passing the
impugned orders of detention because the, detenus were in custody.?

CRI.L.J 2209 (FB), at paragraph, a Full Bench of this Court has held as
follows:-
</p><p id="p_60">		20. We are unable to agree with the view taken by the Division
Bench in that case. Our reasoning is as follows :- <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_62">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 14 of 1982
is a preventive detention statute and is based upon principles entirely
different from the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937, which is an enactment
governed by the Criminal Jurisprudence. While a preventive detention Act is
for the purpose of preventing the commission of crime, in the best interest
of the society, a punitive enactment is for the purpose of punishing the
persons who have committed the crime. While one deals with the stage anterior
to the commission of the offence, the other deals with the stage posterior to
it. The basis for the one is totally different from the other. While the rule
of Criminal Jurisprudence is that the guilt of an accused must be proved
beyond all reasonable doubt, for the purpose of preventive detention, there
is no question of deciding whether the detenu is guilty of an offence. The
dichotomy between the two branches of law has always been recognised and
maintained as evident from the various rulings of the Supreme Court. An order
of preventive detention is to be made on the subjective satisfaction of the
concerned authority in accordance with the provisions contained in the
relevant enactment. If the procedure prescribed in the enactment is complied
with, the order of detention cannot be interfered with by a Court. The only
grounds on which the Court can set aside an order of detention are : (1) if
it is vitiated by mala fides, (2) such an order could not have been passed by
any reasonable person and (3) there is a violation of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_63">Art. 22(5)</a> of the
Constitution of India. The provisions of any enactment belonging to the
Criminal Jurisprudence cannot be telescoped unto the preventive detention
Acts and the failure of the concerned authorities to adhere strictly to the
procedure prescribed in such enactment will not vitiate the orders of
detention, if the requirements of the detention Acts have been satisfied. In
fact in the passage quoted above, the Division Bench has recognised the
distinction between Criminal cases and preventive detention cases. In order
to distinguish the cases cited by the Additional Public Prosecutor, the Bench
said, "But the citations referred to above by the learned Additional Public
Prosecutor are in relation to criminal proceedings and it cannot be applied
to a case of preventive detention." However, the Bench did not apply the
principle while deciding the question before it.

held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_62">	?37. In this backdrop of the constitutional scheme, the Preamble as
also the Objects and Reasons of COFEPOSA we have to scrutinize and test the
justiciability of the acts of every statutory functionary performing
statutory obligations under the Act. It is well settled that whenever there
are two possible interpretations of a statute, the one that subserves the
objective of an enactment is to be accepted. The same principle shall with
equal force apply in testing the credibility of the acts of a statutory
functionary performing its statutory obligations. Such authorities, while
performing their obligations under the preventive detention law must perform
it on one hand with promptness, as not to further lengthen the detenu?s
detention through their casual conduct, neglect, lethargy, etc., on the other
hand all what is required to be done by it if it has been done then in
construing its conduct, conclusions etc. If there be two possible
interpretations then the one that subserve the objective of the statute
should be accepted.
</p><p id="p_63">	38. Next, returning to the issue under consideration, as to what should
be the measure to test the legality of the subjective satisfaction of the
detaining authority when he records, ?there is likelihood of detenu being
released on bail?. Even for judging this we have to keep in mind the
aforesaid conspectus of the Constitution, the preamble, Objects and Reasons
of the Act. When one?s liberty is to be curtailed on the subjective
satisfaction of the detaining authority with the area of interference by the
court being limited, then within this limitation, the court must see, in this
authority?s privileged area that the detaining authority does not stretch
itself illegitimately in the exercise of its jurisdiction.?

Court observed as follows:
</p><p id="p_65">	?Preventive detention measure is a harsh, but it becomes necessary in
larger interest of society. It is in the nature of a precautionary measure
taken for preservation of public order. The power is to be used with caution
and circumspection. For the purpose of exercise of the power it is not
necessary to prove to the hilt that the person concerned had committed any of
the offences as stated in the Act. It is sufficient if from the material
available on record the detaining authority could reasonably feel satisfied
about the necessity for detention of the person concerned in order to prevent
him from indulging in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public
order. In the absence of any provision specifying the type of material which
may or may not be taken into consideration by the detaining authority and
keeping in view the purpose the statute is intended to achieve the power
vested in the detaining authority should not be unduly restricted. It is
neither possible nor advisable to catalogue the types of materials which can
form the basis of a detention order under the Act. That will depend on the
facts and situation of a case. Presumably, that is why the Parliament did not
make any provision in the Act in that regard and left the matter to the
discretion of the detaining authority. However, the facts stated in the
materials relied upon should be true and should have a reasonable nexus with
the purpose for which the order is passed.?

in a Two Judges Bench judgment, on the aspect of subjective satisfaction, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, at paragraph 4 held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_67">	4. The High Court has virtually decided the matter as if it was sitting
in appeal on the order passed by the detaining authority. The action by way
of preventive detention is largely based on suspicion and the court is not an
appropriate forum to investigate the question whether the circumstances of
suspicion exist warranting the restraint on a person. The language of <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_67">Section
3</a> clearly indicates that the responsibility for making a detention order
rests upon the detaining authority which alone is entrusted with the duty in
that regard and it will be a serious derogation from that responsibility if
the court substitutes its judgment for the satisfaction of that authority on
an investigation undertaken regarding sufficiency of the materials on which
such satisfaction was grounded. The court can only examine the grounds
disclosed by the Government in order to see whether they are relevant to the
object which the legislation has in view, that is, to prevent the detenu from
engaging in smuggling activity. The said satisfaction is subjective in nature
and such a satisfaction, if based on relevant grounds, cannot be stated to be
invalid. The authorities concerned have to take note of the various facts
including the fact that this was a solitary incident in the case of the
detenu and that he had been granted bail earlier in respect of which the
application for cancellation of the same was made but was rejected by the
Court. In this case, there has been due application of mind by the authority
concerned to that aspect of the matter as we have indicated in the course of
narration of facts. Therefore, the view taken by the High Court in the
circumstances of the case cannot be sustained.

<p id="p_68">	39.<a href="/doc/170679023/" id="a_68">In Union of India v. Paul Manickam</a>, reported in (2003) 8 SCC 342, in
a two judges Bench judgment, the Supreme Court, at paragraph 14 held as
follows:-	
</p><p id="p_69">	?14. So far as this question relating to the procedure to be adopted in
case the detenu is already in custody is concerned, the matter has been dealt
with in several cases. Where detention orders are passed in relation to
persons who are already in jail under some other laws, the detaining
authorities should apply their mind and show their awareness in this regard
in the grounds of detention, the chances of release of such persons on bail.
The necessity of keeping such persons in detention under the preventive
detention laws has to be clearly indicated. Subsisting custody of the detenu
by itself does not invalidate an order of his preventive detention, and the
decision in this regard must depend on the facts of the particular case.
Preventive detention being necessary to prevent the detenu from acting in any
manner prejudicial to the security of the State or to the maintenance of
public order or economic stability etc. ordinarily, it is not needed when the
detenu is already in custody. The detaining authority must show its awareness
to the fact of subsisting custody of the detenu and take that factor into
account while making the order. If the detaining authority is reasonably
satisfied with cogent materials that there is likelihood of his release and
in view of his antecedent activities which are proximate in point of time, he
must be detained in order to prevent him from indulging in such prejudicial
activities, the detention order can be validly made. Where the detention
order in respect of a person already in custody does not indicate that the
detenu was likely to be released on bail, the order would be vitiated. (<a href="/doc/328748/" id="a_69">See
N. Meera Rani v. Govt. of T.N</a>. 1989 (4) SCC 418 and <a href="/doc/1258899/" id="a_70">Dharmendra Suganchand

in <a href="/doc/212274/" id="a_71">Kamarunnissa v. Union of India</a>, 1991 (1) SCC 128.  The principles were set
out as follows: even in the case of a person in custody, a detention order
can be validly passed: (1) if the authority passing the order is aware of the
fact that he is actually in custody; (2) if he has a reason to believe on the
basis of reliable material placed before him (a) that there is a real
possibility of his release on bail, and (b) that on being released, he would
in all probability indulge in prejudicial activities; and (3) if it is felt
essential to detain him to prevent him from so doing. If an order is passed
after recording satisfaction in that regard, the order would be valid. In the
case at hand the order of detention and grounds of detention show an
awareness of custody and/or a possibility of release on bail.?

<p id="p_70">	40.<a href="/doc/1870380/" id="a_72">In Hare Ram Pandey vs. State of Bihar and others</a>, reported in 2004
(3) SCC 289, in a two judges Bench judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court at
paragraph 6, explained the purpose and intention of preventive detention:-
	"6.Before dealing with rival submissions, it would be appropriate to
deal with the purpose and intent of preventive detention. Preventive
detention is an anticipatory measure and does not relate to an offence, while
the criminal proceedings are to punish a person for an offence committed by
him. They are not parallel proceedings. The object of the law of preventive
detention is not punitive but only preventive. It is resorted to when the
executive is convinced that such detention is necessary in order to prevent
the person detained from acting in a manner prejudicial to certain objects
which are specified by the law concerned. The action of the executive in
detaining a person being only precautionary, the matter has necessarily to be
left to the discretion of the executive authority. It is not practicable to
lay down objective rules of conduct in an exhaustive manner, the failure to
conform to which should lead to detention. The satisfaction of the detaining
authority, therefore, is a purely subjective affair. The detaining authority
may act on any material and on any information that it may have before it.
Such material and information may merely afford basis for a sufficiently
strong suspicion to take action, but may not satisfy the tests of legal proof
on which alone a conviction for offence will be tenable. The compulsions of
the primordial need to maintain order in society without which the enjoyment
of all rights, including the right to personal liberty would lose all their
meanings are the true justification for the laws of preventive detention. The
pressures of the day in regard to the imperatives of the security of the
State and of public order might require the sacrifice of the personal liberty
of individuals. Laws that provide for preventive detention posit that an
individual?s conduct prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or to the
security of State or corroding financial base provides grounds for
satisfaction for a reasonable prognostication of possible future
manifestations of similar propensities on the part of the offender. This
jurisdiction has been called a jurisdiction of suspicion.  The compulsions of
the very preservation of the values of freedom of democratic society and of
social order might compel a curtailment of individual liberty. ?To lose our
country by a scrupulous adherence to the written law? said Thomas Jefferson
?would be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty and all those who are
enjoying with us, thus absurdly sacrificing the end to the needs.? This, no
doubt, is the theoretical jurisdiction for the law enabling preventive
detention. But the actual manner of administration of the law of preventive
detention is of utmost importance. The law has to be justified by the genius
of its administration so as to strike the right balance between individual
liberty on the one hand and the needs of an orderly society on the other."

Judges Bench Judgment, the Supreme Court, at Paragraph 8, held as follows:
	?The satisfaction of the Detaining Authority, therefore, is considered
to be of primary importance, with great latitude in the exercise of its
discretion. The Detaining Authority may act on any material and on any
information that it may have before it. Such material and information may
merely afford basis for a sufficiently strong suspicion to take action, but
may not satisfy the tests of legal proof on which alone a conviction for
offence will be tenable. The compulsions of the primordial need to maintain
order in society without which the enjoyment of all rights, including the
right to personal liberty of citizens would loose all their meanings provide
the justification for the laws of prevention detention. Laws that provide for
preventive detention posit that an individual's conduct prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order or to the security of State or corroding
financial base provides grounds for satisfaction for a reasonable
prognostication of possible future manifestations of similar propensities on
the part of the offender. This jurisdiction has at times been even called a
jurisdiction of suspicion. The compulsions of the very preservation of the

absurdly sacrificing the end to the needs". This, no doubt, is the
theoretical jurisdictional justification for the law enabling prevention
detention. But the actual manner of administration of the law of preventive
detention is of utmost importance. The law has to be justified by striking
the right balance between individual liberty on the one hand and the needs of

there is likelihood of the detenu being released on bail. That is his
subjective satisfaction based on materials. Normally, such satisfaction is

that there was no scope for observing that there was likelihood of release.
Contention of the State was that it is the impact of an act and not the
number of acts which determine whether the act can be relatable to public
order or not.  The Apex Court on the facts and circumstances of the case,
observed that in the instant case, the scenario as described in the grounds
of detention clearly shows that the acts committed by the detenu were of such
intensity that the moral fibre of the community was disturbed.  Prostitution
with the likelihood of spread of sexual diseases on a huge scale was
imminent.  Therefore, according to the Apex Court, the detenu has rightly
been detained.  At paragraph 10, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:-

observed that the petitioner has moved a bail application before the III
Metropolitan Magistrate Court, George Town, Chennai, in Crl.M.P.No.140/2005
and that the same was dismissed.  He also observed that he was aware that
there is imminent possibility of his coming out on bail, by filing another
bail application in the abovesaid case, before the Principal Sessions Court
or the High Court, since in similar cases, bail orders were granted by the
Sessions Court or the High Court, after the lapse of time.  Following

Though bail application was dismissed, without any cogent material, the

</p><p id="p_82">	Proper application of mind on the part of the detaining authority must,
therefore, be borne out from the order of detention. In cases where the
detenu is in custody, the detaining authority not only should be aware of the

32, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has explained what preventive detention means:-
</p><p id="p_84">	32.There is no authoritative definition of ?preventive detention?
either in the Constitution or in any other statute. The expression, however,
is used in contradistinction to the word ?punitive?. It is not a punitive or
penal provision but is in the nature of preventive action or precautionary
measure. The primary object of preventive detention is not to punish a person
for having done something but to intercept him before he does it. To put it
differently, it is not a penalty for past activities of an individual but is
intended to pre-empt the person from indulging in future activities sought to
be prohibited by a relevant law and with a view to preventing him from doing
harm in future.
</p>	
<p id="p_85">	49.On the aspect of subjective satisfaction and scope of judicial
review at paragraphs 38 and 39, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:-
Subjective satisfaction: scope of judicial review:-
</p><p id="p_86">	38. Subjective satisfaction being a condition precedent for the
exercise of the power of preventive detention conferred on the executive, the
court can always examine whether the requisite satisfaction is arrived at by
the authority; if it is not, the condition precedent to the exercise of the
power would not be fulfilled and the exercise of the power would be bad.
</p><p id="p_87">	39. A court cannot go into correctness or otherwise of the facts stated
or allegations levelled in the grounds in support of detention. A court of
law is ?the last appropriate tribunal to investigate into circumstances of
suspicion on which such anticipatory action must be largely based?. That,
however, does not mean that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining
authority is wholly immune from judicial reviewability. By judicial
decisions, courts have carved out areas, though limited, within which the
validity of subjective satisfaction can be tested judicially.

non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority in passing the

</p><p id="p_91">	?7.The second submission of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the petitioner, is that the subjective satisfaction expressed by the
detaining authority, with regard to the real possibility of the detenu coming
out on bail in the ground case, in which he was in remand, is not based on
cogent material and the said satisfaction was expressed on the basis of bail
orders passed in similar cases by the concerned Court or High Court, and the
particulars of the bail orders passed in similar cases, are not mentioned
anywhere in the grounds of detention and the copies of those orders were also
not furnished to the detenu and the subjective satisfaction expressed, can
only be termed as ipse dixit of the detaining authority and it is vitiated.
Reliance was placed by the learned Senior Counsel on the latest decision of
the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/173882436/" id="a_83">Rekha v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> reported in  (2011 (3) CTC
222 = (2011) 5 SCC 244), in this regard. Learned Public Prosecutor submits
that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority with regard to
the real possibility of the detenu coming out on bail, is expressed on the
basis of bail orders granted in similar cases and the fact being that the
bail petition filed by the detenu, was pending disposal, the detaining
authority has expressed satisfaction about the possibility of his coming out
on bail in the ground case.?
</p>
<p id="p_92">	52.<a href="/doc/173882436/" id="a_84">In Rekha v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> reported in 2011 (5) SCC 244, in a
Three Judges Bench judgment, the detenue was already in jail.  The Detaining
Authority, in the grounds of detention, has stated as follows:
	?4. I am aware that Thiru. Ramakrishnan, is in remand in P.6,
Kodungaiyur Police Station Crime No. 132/2010 and he has not moved any bail
application so far. The sponsoring authority has stated that the relatives of
Thiru.Ramakrishnan are taking action to take him on bail in the above case by
filing bail applications before the Higher courts since in similar cases
bails were granted by the Courts after a lapse of time. Hence, there is real
possibility of his coming out on bail in the above case by filing a bail
application before the higher courts. If he comes out on bail he will indulge
in further activities, which will be prejudicial to the maintenance of public
health and order. Further the recourse to normal criminal law would not have
the desired effect of effectively preventing him from indulging in such
activities, which are prejudicial to the maintenance of public health and
order.?
</p><p id="p_93">	53.Challenge to the order of detention failed in High Court.  On
appeal, one of the grounds raised before the Apex Court was that when the
Detaining Authority came to the conclusion that in similar cases, bails were
granted,  after a lapse of time and therefore, there was a real possibility
of coming out on bail, it was a ipsi dixit statement of the Detaining
Authority, for the reason that, no details were given about the alleged
similar cases, in which, bail was allegedly granted by the concerned court.
Neither the date of the alleged bail orders have been mentioned therein, nor
the bail application numbers, whether the bail orders were passed in respect
of the co-accused, in the same case, whether the bail orders were passed in
respect of other co- accused in cases, on the same footing, as the case of
the accused, were furnished.  On the above grounds, at Paragraph 7, the
Supreme Court opined that in the absence of details, the statement made by
the detaining authority was mere ipse dixit, and cannot be relied upon.  It
was further opined that the above reason by itself, is sufficient to vitiate
the detention order.
</p>
<p id="p_94">	54.In Rekha's case (cited supra), at Paragraph 9, the Supreme Court,
also took note of the decisions made in A.Geetha Vs. State of T.N. And Anr.
[(2006) 7 SCC 603] and Ibrahim Nazeer Vs. State of T.N. and Anr., [(2006) 6
SCC 64], wherein, the Apex Court held that even if no bail application of the
petitioner was pending, but if in similar cases, bail has been granted, then,
this is a good ground for the subjective satisfaction of the detaining
authority to pass the detention order.  Therefore, it is discernible from the
abovesaid two decisions of the year 2006, emanated from this Court, the
Hon'ble Apex Court was of the view that, even if no bail application of the
detenue, was pending, but in similar cases, if bail had been granted, then,
there was a ground for the Detaining Authority to arrive at the subjective
satisfaction of the Detaining Authority, to pass an order of detention.
</p>
<p id="p_95">	55.The difference that could be deduced from the reading of the
judgments of the Supreme Court, rendered in 2006 and in 2011 in Rekha's case,
is that even if the Detaining Authority has made a statement that in similar
cases, bails are granted that mere statement alone is not sufficient, while
arriving at the subjective satisfaction, to pass an order of detention, but
that statement of the Detaining Authority, should be supported with details,
such as, date of the bail order, bail application number, in similar cases.
The Supreme Court in Rekha's case, at Paragraph 10, held as follows:
	?10. In our opinion, if details are given by the respondent authority
about the alleged bail orders in similar cases mentioning the date of the
orders, the bail application number, whether the bail order was passed in
respect of co-accused in the same case, and whether the case of the co-
accused was on the same footing as the case of the petitioner, then, of
course, it could be argued that there is likelihood of the accused being
released on bail, because it is the normal practice of most courts that if a
co-accused has been granted bail and his case is on the same footing as that
of the petitioner, then the petitioner is ordinarily granted bail. However,
the respondent authority should have given details about the alleged bail
order in similar cases, which has not been done in the present case. A mere
ipse dixit statement in the grounds of detention cannot sustain the detention
order and has to be ignored.?
</p>
<p id="p_96">	56.At Paragraph 12, the Supreme Court further observed that, ?more
over, even if a bail application, relating to the cases, was pending in
criminal cases, the detention order can still be challenged on various
grounds e.g. that the act in question related to law and order and not public
order, that there was no relevant material on which the detention order was
passed, that there was mala fides, that the order was not passed by a
competent authority, that the condition precedent for exercise of the power
did not exist, that the subjective satisfaction was irrational, that there
was non-application of mind, that the grounds are vague, indefinite,
irrelevant, extraneous, non-existent or stale, that there was delay in
passing the detention order or delay in executing it or delay in deciding the
representation of the detenu, that the order was not approved by the
government, that there was failure to refer the case to the Advisory Board or
that the reference was belated, etc.?
</p>
<p id="p_97">	57.At Paragraph 27, while arriving at the conclusion, the Supreme Court
opined as follows:
</p><p id="p_98">	?In our opinion, there is a real possibility of release of a person on
bail who is already in custody provided he has moved a bail application which
is pending. It follows logically that if no bail application is pending, then
there is no likelihood of the person in custody being released on bail, and
hence the detention order will be illegal. However, there can be an exception
to this rule, that is, where a co-accused whose case stands on the same
footing had been granted bail. In such cases, the detaining authority can
reasonably conclude that there is likelihood of the detenu being released on
bail even though no bail application of his is pending, since most courts
normally grant bail on this ground. However, details of such alleged similar
cases must be given, otherwise the bald statement of the authority cannot be
believed.?
</p>
<p id="p_99">	58.At Paragraph 26, the Supreme Court has taken note of a decision in
<a href="/doc/170679023/" id="a_85">Union of India v. Paul Manickam and Another</a> [2003 (8) SCC 342], wherein, the
Apex Court held that if the detaining authority is aware of the fact that the
detenu is in custody and the detaining authority is reasonably satisfied with
cogent material that, there is likelihood of his release and in view of his
antecedent activities, he must be detained to prevent him from indulging in
such prejudicial activities, the detention order can validly be made.
</p>
<p id="p_100">	59.Paragraph 27 of Rekha's case, the Supreme Court makes it clear that
firstly, if any bail application is pending, then there is real possibility
of release on bail.  Secondly, if no bail application is pending, then the
Supreme Court observed that it follows logically, there is no likelihood of
the person in custody being released on bail and then, the detention order is
illegal.  As per the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in a case, where,
no bail application was filed and pending, then there can be an exception to
the rule, that is, where a co-accused whose case stands on the same footing,
had been granted bail, in such cases, the detaining authority can reasonably
conclude that there is likelihood of the detenu being released on bail, even
though no bail application was pending, since most courts normally grant bail
on this ground. In respect of similar cases, details of such alleged similar
cases must be given, otherwise, the bald statement of the authority, cannot
be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_101">	60.Thus, a combined reading of Paragraphs 7, 10 and 27 of the judgment
made in Rekha's case, makes it clear that,	
</p><p id="p_102">	(i) there is real possibility of release of a person on bail, who is
already in custody, provided he has moved a bail application, which is
pending and in such cases, the detaining authority may arrive at a
conclusion, that there is likelihood of release.
</p><p id="p_103">	(ii) If no bail application is pending filed, still the detaining
authority can arrive at a subjective satisfaction for detaining him, if on
the basis of the materials on record, the authority arrives at the conclusion
that a co-accused, who stands on the same footing, had already been released
and thus, there is every likelihood of the detenue being released, taking
note of the fact that most Courts, would normally grant bail, on the above
grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_104">	61.Likelihood of real possibility of release of a person on bail, when
the bail application was pending, is the view of the Supreme Court in Rekha's
case.
</p>

<p id="p_105">	62.From the close scrutiny of the abovesaid paragraphs, it is
discernible that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered two distinct cases
(1) similar cases and (2) same case.  In sofar as ?same case? is concerned,
the Supreme Court has observed that the detaining authority may arrive at the
subjective satisfaction, on the aspect of bail, if a co- accused, on the same
footing, in the same case, has been enlarged on bail.  However, the detaining
authority has to furnish cogent materials, such as, bail application number,
bail application and orders passed thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_106">	63.In respect of ?similar cases?, the Supreme Court has observed that
in the absence of details, such as, bail application number, bail order,
there cannot be any ipse dixit statement that a person is likely to be
released.  Therefore, in a given case, where an application for bail is filed
and pending, and if the detaining authority has arrived at the subjective
satisfaction, considering the possibility of release, after taking note of
the materials, like the bail application number, orders passed on bail
application, in similar cases, then, as per the judgment of the Apex Court,
the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority cannot be found fault
with, as the materials considered by the authority, cannot be said to be
wholly irrelevant nor the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the authority
is illogical and irrational.  Therefore, we are of the view that what is
required to be considered by the court is whether the materials taken into
consideration are relevant, to arrive at a reasonable conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_107">	64.From the judgment in Rekha's case, it is discernible that  it cannot
be said that consideration of the detaining authority to the bail orders,
granted in similar cases, with the details, such as,   the date of bail,
nature of offences, similar to which, the detenue is accused of, are wholly
irrelevant, or materials not pertinent with no probative value, to arrive at
the reasonable conclusion, as to whether, there is likelihood of release of a
person, against whom, detention order is passed.  At this juncture, it should
be noted that while passing an order of detention, the detaining authority
has to be aware of the fact, that the bail application filed by the detenue,
is pending.  Then, there is a clear nexus and rationality, in arriving at the
subjective satisfaction, as to the likelihood of release.
</p>
<p id="p_108">	65.When justification of the detaining authority is primarily decided
on his subjective satisfaction of the potentiality of the person, sought to
be detained and to prevent him from engaging in future prejudicial
activities, primarily, the detaining authority, has to consider the past
antecedents, recurrence of crime, and when the said authority comes to the
conclusion that recourse to normal law, does not have the desired result of
preventing him from indulging in such activities and therefore, he was
compelled to take recourse to the law of prevention, such action should not
normally be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_109">	66.However, in such cases, if the detenue was already in judicial
custody, the detaining authority is also obligated to consider that if the
prisoner comes out on bail, whether, he would indulge in such future
activities, which is also another important factor, for invoking preventive
detention. Subjective satisfaction arrived at by the Detaining Authority, in
relation to past antecedents is the foundation, and if the detaining
authority has taken into consideration materials, which are pertinent, with
probative value and also takes into consideration, bail orders, passed in
similar cases, with details, such as, date of orders, passed in similar
offences, then, in the humble opinion of this Court, the subjective
satisfaction arrived at by the Detaining Authority should not be found fault
with, in the light of the views expressed by the Supreme Court, at Paragraphs
7 and 27 of Rekha's case (cited supra).
</p>	

<p id="p_110">	67.At this juncture, this Court is also conscious of the fact that if
no bail application is pending, the Supreme Court in Rekha's case, has
observed that there is no likelihood of coming out on bail.  But the Apex
Court has carved out of an exception of the abovesaid situation, that if a
co-accused, on the same footing, is enlarged on bail, in the same case, then,
there is likelihood of another co-accused against whom, detention order is
passed, is also likely to come out on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_111">	68.In a given case, there may be only one accused, who may be
repeatedly committing offences, prejudicial to the maintenance of public
health and public order, and in such cases, if he had not filed any bail
application, it cannot be said that he would never come out on bail, by
filing a bail application and rather prefer to be in jail, till trial.  There
is every likelihood of filing a bail application by him, after some time.  In
such circumstances, the detaining authority may be posed with a situation, to
consider, as to whether, there is any likelihood of coming out on bail, as
done in similar cases, and take into consideration, the antecedents of the
sole accused and whether there is any possibility of the detenu indulging in
acts in future, prejudicial to the maintenance of public health and public
order, if he is allowed to remain at large.  Therefore, when the detaining
authority takes into consideration of the overall materials, including bail
orders granted in similar cases, and arrives at a conclusion of clamping a
person, under the preventive laws, he cannot be wholly found fault with, but
such a detention order is subject to judicial review, that is open to the
detenue, as explained at Paragraph 12 of Rekha's case.   At the risk of
repetition, Paragraph 12 is reproduced hereunder:
</p><p id="p_112">	?Moreover, even if a bail application of the petitioner relating to the
same case was pending in a criminal case the detention order can still be
challenged on various grounds e.g. that the act in question related to law
and order and not public order, that there was no relevant material on which
the detention order was passed, that there was mala fides, that the order was
not passed by a competent authority, that the condition precedent for
exercise of the power did not exist, that the subjective satisfaction was
irrational, that there was non-application of mind, that the grounds are
vague, indefinite, irrelevant, extraneous, non-existent or stale, that there
was delay in passing the detention order or delay in executing it or delay in
deciding the representation of the detenu, that the order was not approved by
the government, that there was failure to refer the case to the Advisory
Board or that the reference was belated, etc.?
</p>
<p id="p_113">	69.Yet another situation also may come up for consideration, by the
detaining authority, where the co-accused does not file any bail application,
then, it cannot be said that the detaining authority cannot exercise his
powers at all, in respect of another co-accused, in the same case, whose
antecedent is bad.  The former may not have bad antecedents and therefore,
there may not be any need to detain him.  But the case of the latter may be
different, warranting detention.
</p>
<p id="p_114">	70.In Rekha's case, the Apex Court observed that there can be an
exception to the rule, where no bail application was pending, and in such
cases where a co-accused, whose case stands on same footing, had been granted
bail, then the detaining authority can arrive at a satisfaction on the aspect
of possibility of bail.  But in the reported case, no details about the
similar cases, in which bail was granted by the court concerned, were
available in the grounds of detention and that paved the mind of the Apex
Court to hold that the statement of the detaining authority was a mere ipse
dixit.  But in a given case, if the detaining authority furnishes the details
of bail granted in similar offences, with the copies of the bail
applications, orders granted in similar offences, then, can it be said that
those materials are irrelevant for the purpose of arriving at the subjective
satisfaction, about the possibility of getting bail in similar cases?  The
answer is found in the judgment itself.
</p>

<p id="p_115">	71.While considering reasonableness of the detaining authority to
arrive at the subjective satisfaction on the aspect of bail, we are of the
view that the detaining authority can apply only rule of logic and
reasonableness.
</p>	
<p id="p_116">	72.Though the detaining authority has used the expression, "similar
cases?, the court is conscious of the fact that there cannot be similarity or
same set of facts.  Similar cases, therefore in the humble opinion of this
court, should be meant, ?similar offences?, and it cannot be expected to have
the same set of facts, with same overtacts against the accused involved.
</p>
<p id="p_117">	73.Similar, in the meaning given in Oxford English Dictionary, Vol.9,
reads as ?Having a marked resemblance of likeness, of a nature or kind.  In
Words and Phrases, Vol.39, this word has been defined as, ?Similar?, means
nearly corresponding, resembling in many respects; somewhat like; having a
general likeliness. [Royer v. Brown, NE 93 A 2d 667, Pg.668] [1998 (1) SCC

[Decided on 09.09.2011], in a two Judges Bench judgment,  the detenue therein
was involved in offences, under the Andra Pradesh Act, 1967, A.P. Sandal Wood
and Red Sanders Transit Rules, 1969  and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_87"> Indian Penal Code</a>.  Recourse  to
normal penal laws, did not have the desired effect.  On 10.11.2010, he was
released on bail.  Immediately, thereafter, he was arrested and detention
order was served on 12.11.2009,  by the District Collector and District
Magistrate, Kadapa, Y.S.R. District under <a href="/doc/188392346/" id="a_88">Sections 3(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_89">2</a> (a) and (b) of
the Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Boot Leggers,
Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Land Grabbers
Act, 1986 (in short "the 1986 Act") stating that the activities of the
detenue were dangerous to forest wealth and forest eco-system and thus, are
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The order of detention was
approved and later on, confirmed.  Writ Petition for issuance of Habeas
Corpus was dismissed.  One of the contentions raised by the learned counsel
for the detenue, before the Supreme Court was that on even though the detenue
was arrested on 09.10.2010 and released on bail on 10.11.2010, the aspect
that the detenue was in custody till 10.11.2010 was neither specifically
adverted and considered in the detention order, nor the Sponsoring Authority,
placed any material, regarding the same.  Adverting to the abovesaid
contention, the Apex Court considered the decision in <a href="/doc/170679023/" id="a_90">Union of India v. Paul
Manickam and Another</a> [2003 (8) SCC 342], wherein, at Paragraph 14, the Apex
Court, held as follows:
</p><p id="p_119">	?14.....Where detention orders are passed in relation to persons who
are already in jail under some other laws, the detaining authorities should
apply their mind and show their awareness in this regard in the grounds of
detention, the chances of release of such persons on bail. The necessity of
keeping such persons in detention under the preventive detention laws has to
be clearly indicated. Subsisting custody of the detenue by itself does not
invalidate an order of his preventive detention, and the decision in this
regard must depend on the facts of the particular case. Preventive detention
being necessary to prevent the detenue from acting in any manner prejudicial
to the security of the State or to the maintenance of public order or
economic stability etc. ordinarily, it is not needed when the detenue is
already in custody. The detaining authority must show its awareness to the
fact of subsisting custody of the detenue and take that factor into account
while making the order. If the detaining authority is reasonably satisfied
with cogent materials that there is likelihood of his release and in view of
his antecedent activities which are proximate in point of time, he must be
detained in order to prevent him from indulging in such prejudicial
activities, the detention order can be validly made. Where the detention
order in respect of a person already in custody does not indicate that the
detenue was likely to be released on bail, the order would be vitiated. The
point was gone into detail in <a href="/doc/212274/" id="a_91">Kamarunnissa v. Union of India</a> [1991 (1) SCC
128].  The Principles were set out as follows: even in the case of a person
in custody, a detention order can be validly passed: (1) if the authority
passing the order is aware of the fact that he is actually in custody; (2) if
he has a reason to believe on the basis of reliable material placed before
him (a) that there is a real possibility of his release on bail, and (b) that
on being released, he would in all probability indulge in prejudicial
activities; and (3) if it is felt essential to detain him to prevent him from
so doing. If an order is passed after recording satisfaction in that regard,
the order would be valid. In the case at hand the order of detention and
grounds of detention show an awareness of custody and/or a possibility of
release on bail."
</p>
<p id="p_120">	75.At Paragraph 17, in G.Reddeiah's case, on the facts and
circumstances, the Supreme Court, further held that it is clear that if the
Detaining Authority was aware of the relevant fact that the detenue was under
the custody from 09.10.2010 and he would be released or likelihood of release
or as in this case, released on 10.11.2010 and if an order is passed, after
due satisfaction in this regard, undoubtedly, the order would be valid.
However, upon consideration of the material on record, the Apex Court
observed that the said contention was not raised anywhere.
</p><p id="p_121">	76.<a href="/doc/1448468/" id="a_92">In Subramanian vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others</a>, reported in 2012
(4) SCC 699, in a two Judges Bench judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
explained as to whether the Court can substitute its opinion for that of the
detaining authority.  The High Court observed that the bail application in
respect of ground case was pending before the Sessions Judge,
Tiruchirappalli.  The detaining authority came to the conclusion that the
detenu was likely to be released on bail and if he comes out on bail, he
would indulge in future activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public
order.  The order of detention was upheld. While the detenu preferred an
appeal, after considering the facts of the case, and the pendency of the bail
application, at paragraphs 14 and 20 held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_122">	14.	It is well settled that the court does not interfere with the
subjective satisfaction reached by the Detaining Authority except in
exceptional and extremely limited grounds. The court cannot substitute its
own opinion for that of the Detaining Authority when the grounds of detention
are precise, pertinent, proximate and relevant, that sufficiency of grounds
is not for the Court but for the Detaining Authority for the formation of
subjective satisfaction that the detention of a person with a view to
preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to public order is
required and that such satisfaction is subjective and not objective. The
object of the law of preventive detention is not punitive but only preventive
and further that the action of the executive in detaining a person being only
precautionary, normally, the matter has necessarily to be left to the
discretion of the executive authority. It is not practicable to lay down
objective rules of conduct in an exhaustive manner. The satisfaction of the
Detaining Authority, therefore, is considered to be of primary importance
with certain latitude in the exercise of its discretion.
</p><p id="p_123">	20........ The High Court has rightly observed that the bail petition
in respect of the ground case was pending before the Sessions Judge,
Tiruchirappalli and he was very likely to be released on bail and if he comes
out on bail, he would indulge in future activities which will be prejudicial
to the maintenance of public order."
</p>
<p id="p_124">	77.<a href="/doc/84095427/" id="a_93">In Huidrom Konungjao Singh vs. State of Manipur and others</a>, reported
in 2012 (3) MLJ Crl 794 (SC) = 2012 (7) SCC 181,  in a two Judges Bench
judgment, the detenue therein was arrested on 19.06.2011 under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_94">Section 302</a>
IPC, read with <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_95">Section 25</a>(1-C) of the Arms Act, 1959.  He was detained on
02.07.2011.  The detaining authority relied on a copy of the FIR No.254(12)
2010 under <a href="/doc/1781202/" id="a_96">Section 17</a>/<a href="/doc/1561699/" id="a_97">20</a> of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967,
and a copy of the FIR in 210 (5) 2011, under <a href="/doc/1561699/" id="a_98">Sections 20</a> of the same Act and
the bail orders in those cases dated 13.12.2010 and 01.06.2011 respectively.
In such circumstances, the Apex Court at Paragraph 10, observed as follows:
	?10. The present case requires to be examined in the light of aforesaid
settled legal proposition. Learned counsel for the appellant Shri L. Roshmani
has submitted that the detenu had never moved the bail application after his
arrest and he had not been involved in any criminal case earlier. Reliance
had been placed upon two bail orders. They are related to different FIRs and
not to the same case. The bail had been granted to the accused in those cases
and none of them had been co-accused with the detenu in this case. Therefore,
it was not permissible for the detaining authority to rely upon those bail
orders and there was no material before the detaining authority on the basis
of which the subjective satisfaction could be arrived that the detenu in the
instant case was likely to be released on bail and after being released on
bail he would indulge in the activities detrimental to the society at large
and would cause the problem of public order.?
</p>
<p id="p_125">	78.In the reported case, FIR has been registered against unknown
persons and the detenue was arrested.  In the said case, first of all, no
details were mentioned by the detaining authority, as to whether others have
been arrested, in the same case.  Secondly, the FIRs and bail orders, relate
to some other offences.  In the reported case, the detenue has been arrested
under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_99">Section 302</a> IPC read with <a href="/doc/140344306/" id="a_100">Section 25</a>(1-<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_101">A) of the Arms Act</a>, whereas, the
FIR and bail orders relied on by the detaining authority, for arriving at the
subjective satisfaction related to offences under <a href="/doc/1781202/" id="a_102">Sections 17</a>/<a href="/doc/1561699/" id="a_103">20</a> of the
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and <a href="/doc/1561699/" id="a_104">Section 20</a> of same Act.  Thus it is
evident from the judgment of the Apex Court, the offences for which, FIRs
were registered against some other persons, though observed by the Apex Court
that may appear to be similar.  At this juncture, we wish to add that they
are not the same offences.  Huidrom Konungjao Sing's case proceeded on the
basis that had the co-accused in the same case been released on bail, then,
there would be a likelihood of the detenue being released.
</p>
<p id="p_126">	79.In the reported case, it was a solitary act.  Excepting the above,
there were no other materials, and when the materials relied on by the
detaining authority related to some other case, not concerned with the
reported case, the Hon'ble Apex Court, set aside the detention.  At paragraph
14, the Apex Court has observed that, ?merely because  somebody else in
similar cases had been granted bail, there could be no presumption that in
the instant case, had the detenu applied for bail, he would have been
released on bail.?
</p>

<p id="p_127">	80.With great respect to Their Lordships, the said view, in our humble
opinion, appears to be different than the earlier view of the Larger Bench,
comprising of Three Judges, in Rekha's case, wherein, Their Lordship's held
that if the person in judicial custody has filed a bail application, and it
is pending there is a real possibility of his coming out on bail, provided
the detaining authority furnishes the details of bails granted in similar
cases.
</p>
<p id="p_128">	81.The view expressed in Huidrom's case also poses a question, that if
the bail application of the person in judicial custody, against whom,
detention is proposed is earlier in point of time, than that of the co-
accused, whether the detaining authority is precluded from passing an order
of detention, taking into consideration the likelihood of coming out on bail,
by considering orders passed in similar cases, or the detaining authority has
to wait, till the co-accused files a bail application and gets an order in
his favour or not, and only in such circumstances, the detaining authority
can come to a conclusion on the aspect of bail, and pass an order of
detention, if the acts committed by one of the co-accused in the same case,
is not prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
</p>
<p id="p_129">	82.The role of the detenu and that of the co-accused in the commission
of acts prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, may depend upon the
facts and circumstances of each case.  They may not be identical, warranting
detention of all the accused, involved in the same case.  The detaining
authority has to consider the propensity and the potentiality of the acts,
committed by each of the accused, in the same case and arrive at the
subjective satisfaction, as to whether all the accused in the same case, have
to be detained or suffice to clamp, any one or other accused or all, under
the detention laws.  No uniform decision can be taken against all the
accused.
</p>	
<p id="p_130">	83.One of the important factors to be considered by the detaining
authority, under the detention laws, is that, recourse to normal law, did not
have the desired result of preventing a person from committing acts
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, and such satisfaction should
be arrived at, on the basis of antecedents and in such circumstances, the
detaining authority should be aware, as to whether, the detenue is on bail or
in jail.  If he is in custody, then there is a necessity to consider, as to
whether there is any likelihood of bail, and the subjective satisfaction
should be, as to whether, he would continue to act in a prejudicial manner,
in future, if he is allowed to remain at large.
</p>

<p id="p_131">	84.Merely because there was pending prosecution and the detenu is
already in jail, there is no impediment for his being detained, if the
detaining authority is satisfied that, if he is allowed to remain at large,
he would indulge in prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.  While
testing the aspect of subjective satisfaction, arrived at, by the Detaining
Authority, Court has to examine, as to whether, the grounds, on which, the
Detaining Authority, has reached the subjective satisfaction, are reasonable.
</p>	
<p id="p_132">	85.Thus while examining, as to whether, the subjective satisfaction,
arrived at, by the Detaining Authority, is proper, what is required to be
considered, by the Court is, whether, the subjective satisfaction, is based
on any pertinent material, existence of which are relevant, for any
reasonable person, to arrive at the conclusion, on the aspect of bail also.
</p>
<p id="p_133">	86.On the aspect of bail, when the Detaining Authority considers orders
of bail, granted in similar cases, then, the order of detention satisfies the
test, that the subjective satisfaction arrived at, by the detaining authority
is what a reasonable person, could possibly arrive at, on the basis of the
materials.  Courts cannot substitute its opinion for that of the Detaining
Authority.  Court can only consider, as to whether the requisite satisfaction
arrived at by the detaining authority, is reasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_134">	87.Reasonableness is the course, which reason dictates.  It may be
construed as converse of unreasonableness, the mind of what an ordinary
prudent and reasonable man would reach, with regard to the materials.  What
the Court feels reasonable, while considering an application for bail, either
to release a person or not, may not be the same, as what the executive
thinks.  In the case of detention, the Detaining Authority, being an
executive authority, is not expected to test every material placed before
him, with a high degree of evidence, with judicial standards, not only on the
aspect of bail, but with respect to all materials placed before him, to
arrive at a subjective satisfaction.  Purpose of relying on a material, is to
arrive at a conclusion, as to whether, the detenu would indulge in acts,
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, and if allowed to  remain at
large, he would continue to do so.  In that context, awareness of the
detaining authority, as to whether, the detenu is on bail or in custody, is
relevant.  Conclusion of likelihood of release, on the basis of relevant
material, is a state of mind, as to what a reasonable man, would reach.  His
satisfaction on the above aspect, should be reasonable, rational and just.
</p>
<p id="p_135">	88.If the detaining authority arrives at a satisfaction, on the aspect
of possibility of release, on such bona fide satisfaction, the court has to
examine as to whether there was any material to arrive at a legitimate and
reasonable conclusion.  As regards satisfaction, it is only, if the material
considered by the detaining authority is that, no reasonable person could be
satisfied that the detenue is likely to be released, then, there can be an
inference that, irrelevant material has been considered.  It is well settled
that the test applied to the word, ?reasonable?, in the context of detention
laws, should be reasonable satisfaction, with reference to all the materials
considered.  Reasonable conclusion is arrived at on a definite fact, which is
sufficient in the mind of the detaining authority, and it should not be the
ipse dixit.
</p>
<p id="p_136">	89.Court has to consider, as to whether, the detaining authority has
relied on any, inchoate material, while arriving at the subjective
satisfaction.  While examining as to whether subjective satisfaction has been
arrived at, on the basis of rationality, materials that existed, relevancy of
the same, can be tested only on the anvil of reasonableness.  Propensity and
potentiality of the person to indulge in activities prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order in future, is the primary consideration, for
detaining a person under the detention laws.
</p>
<p id="p_137">	90.The conclusion of the Detaining Authority that if the detenu is
allowed to remain at large would continue to indulge in acts, prejudicial to
the maintenance of public order and recourse to normal law, did not have the
desired effect of preventing him from doing such acts, is the foundation of
basic facts and therefore, the Detaining Authority is obligated to consider
the possibility of the detenue, coming out on bail and continue to indulge in
such acts.  Such a satisfaction is based on the materials considered.
</p>
<p id="p_138">	91.Proximity of the antecedent activities, effect on the detenue, when
recourse to normal law was taken and ultimately, the decision to prevent him
from doing acts prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order, is the
foundation.
</p>
<p id="p_139">	92.Courts can only examine the grounds disclosed by the detaining
authority, as to whether they are relevant to the object, for which, the
detention is made (i.e) to prevent him, in future from indulging prejudicial
activities.  Satisfaction is subjective in nature, and such satisfaction, if
based on relevant grounds or facts, cannot be said to be irrational.  When
detention is passed to prevent a person from indulging in prejudicial
activities, jail or bail, is certainly a factor, for arriving at the
subjective satisfaction.  The subjective satisfaction mainly rests on the
antecedents and as to how recourse to penal law, did not have the desired
effect, for preventing him, in future from indulging prejudicial activities.
</p>	
	
<p id="p_140">	93.At paragraph 40 in <a href="/doc/1918784/" id="a_105">State of Maharashtra and others vs. Bhaurao
Punjabrao Gawande</a>, reported in 2008 (3) SCC 613, the Supreme Court held that
an order of detention can be challenged on certain grounds, which is
reproduced hereunder:-
</p><p id="p_141">	?40. An order of detention can be challenged on certain grounds, such
as, the order is not passed by the competent authority; condition precedent
for the exercise of power does not exist; subjective satisfaction arrived at
by the detaining authority is irrational; the order is mala fide; there is
non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority in passing the
order; the grounds are, or one of the grounds is, vague, indefinite,
irrelevant, extraneous, non-existent or stale; the order is belated; the
person against whom an order is passed is already in jail; the order is
punitive in nature; the order is not approved by the State/Central Government
as required by law; failure to refer the case of the detenu to the Board
constituted under the statute; the order was quashed/revoked and again a
fresh order of detention was made without new facts, etc.?
</p>	
<p id="p_142">	94.It is to be accepted that while arriving at the subjective
satisfaction of possibility of bail, there should be cogent material before
the detaining authority.  Inference should be drawn  from the available
material on record and it should not be the ipse dixit of the detaining
authority.  Mere making a statement of likelihood of moving an application
for bail and thus, arriving at a satisfaction that there is a possibility of
bail, is certainly, different from considering some materials, when a bail
application is not filed, filed and pending or dismissed.  In this regard, it
is the duty of the detaining authority, to apply his mind to the materials
considered, as to whether they are relevant, to arrive at the subjective
satisfaction.	
</p>	
<p id="p_143">	95.For arriving at the subjective satisfaction, antecedents and nature
of the activities carried out by the person, are required to be taken into
consideration and it is also well settled that an order of preventive
detention is founded on  reasonable prognosis of the future behaviour of the
person, based on his past conduct, judged in the light of the surrounding
circumstances.  At the same time, the court is bound to protect the citizen's
personal  liberty, which is guaranteed under the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_144">	96.Court is not to consider objectively, as to how imminent is the
likelihood of the detenu, in indulging in activities prejudicial to the
maintenance of the public order.  It is the subjective satisfaction of the
Detaining Authority, to arrive at the conclusion.  When the overall materials
are considered by the detaining authority, then, the Court has to consider,
as to whether, detention has been validly made.  Whether the materials taken
into consideration by the detaining authority, are sufficient or not, to
arrive at the conclusion, is not for the court, to decide, by applying an
objective test, as it is a matter for subjective satisfaction of the
detaining authority.  If an investigation is undertaken by the court to
examine the sufficiency of the material, for arriving at the subjective
satisfaction, then, in our humble view, it would be amounting to substitution
of satisfaction, arrived at by the detaining authority.  What is required to
be considered by the courts is whether the subjective satisfaction, is duly
supported by any material.  Relevancy can be tested.
</p>
<p id="p_145">	97.It is suffice that the detaining authority is satisfied about the
genuineness of the documents, relevant for the purpose of arriving at the
satisfaction.  He should not consider extraneous matters, and that his
decision, should not be unlawful, mala fide, excess of jurisdiction and
contrary to the procedure established by law.  Subjective satisfaction,
should be on the basis of materials, by which a person with a clear mind,
would arrive at a reasonable conclusion, as to whether a person should be
detained.
</p>
<p id="p_146">	98.Subjective satisfaction to prevent a person from indulging in future
prejudicial activities inferred from antecedents, is of higher degree, in the
matter of enforcement of preventive laws, and which is the basic foundation
and foremost requirement, to pass an order of detention.  In that context,
bail or jail, is another factor to be considered, in relation to the above.
Aspect of bail, only supplements the paramount basic conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_147">	99.When prevention laws are based on jurisdiction of suspicion, with
reference to the reasonability that is arrived at, on the basis of
antecedents, the detaining authority should be given a latitude to consider
the possibility of coming out on bail, on the basis of materials, which are
relevant.
</p>
<p id="p_148">	100.Purpose of considering bail orders, passed in similar cases, is
only to arrive at the conclusion, as to whether there is any possibility of
the person in custody, be released on bail.  At this juncture, we are
conscious of the fact that there cannot be any absolute immunity, to the
order passed by the detaining authority, but we only to wish reiterate that
the limitations imposed, should be, to find out, as to whether, materials
considered by the Detaining Authority, are relevant or not.  If the detaining
authority is precluded from considering the possibility of the person coming
out on bail, by taking note of the bail orders passed in similar cases (i.e)
in respect of similar offences, then we wish to state that, his wings would
be clipped. The question is not sufficiency or adequacy, of the material, but
relevancy.  If relevancy has to be considered as, ?sufficiency or adequacy?,
by closer scrutiny, with judicial approach and by applying judicial
standards, when an application for bail is normally considered by Courts,
vis-a-vis, the detaining authority, who exercises executive functions, and in
exercise of judicial review, if the grounds of subjective satisfaction is
tested with judicial standards, then, in our humble view, it may lead to
substitution, which the Courts have consistently avoided.
</p>
<p id="p_149">	101.Subjective satisfaction should be based on the existing material,
relevant, to arrive at a satisfaction. If the Detaining Authority, with a
clear application of mind to the documents, without any mala fide intention,
without reference to any extraneous matters, takes into consideration
materials, which have a bearing and passes an order of detention, then the
materials considered by the detaining authority, cannot be wholly excluded.
</p>
<p id="p_150">	102.When preventive laws are based on ?jurisdiction of suspicion? and
when subjective satisfaction is arrived at, with reference to reasonability,
on the basis of antecedents and when the Detaining Authority has bonafidely
intended to prevent a person, from indulging in acts, prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order, then the detaining authority should be given a
latitude to consider the materials, which are relevant, to assess the
possibility of the detenue, coming out on bail.  But such materials should
germane, relevant, not vague, extraneous, indefinite, and non-existent.  The
jurisdiction to interfere with the subjective satisfaction of the Detaining
Authority,  should be limited and it should not, in effect convert,
?relevancy of the material considered by him?, into ?sufficiency or
adequacy?.
</p>
<p id="p_151">	103.It is one thing to state that the detaining authority has
considered a material, which is totally irrelevant, and another, to observe
that the material considered by him, is not sufficient to arrive at the
conclusion.  Material considered, may not be adequate or sufficient, but
still, it could be relevant.  Court cannot predict, as to what material, the
detaining authority is expected to consider, as relevant.  But that can be
tested.
</p>
<p id="p_152">	104.When the detaining authority has considered the issue, as to
whether there is a possibility of the detenue of release, by considering the
previous orders passed in similar cases, then, the same cannot be discarded,
by holding that the detaining authority has prejudged or predetermined the
issue, on bail.  Detention order is the final outcome of considering all the
materials placed before the detaining authority and when the order is
questioned, then the limitation on the Court, should be with reference to the
reasonableness, real and genuine satisfaction.
</p>
<p id="p_153">	105.In a given case, if bail application is pending, there can also be
a contention that the said bail application can be opposed and therefore,
there is no need to pass an order of detention.
</p>
<p id="p_154">	106.In yet another case, even if bail is granted still, it could be
still argued that the Investigating Officer, may seek for cancellation of
bail, instead of invoking the preventive law.  But the point to be considered
before detaining a person, is whether the detaining authority was aware, as
to whether, the person against whom detention order is passed, is in judicial
custody or not, whether the acts committed by him, are prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order and whether such a person, if allowed to be
remain at large would continue to commit such acts, in future, whether there
was any compelling necessity and therefore, he must be prevented.
</p>
<p id="p_155">	107.Therefore, the first and foremost consideration in the two parts of
the subjective satisfaction is, (1) prevention of crime, and (2) the
detaining authority should be aware, as to whether, the person against whom,
detention is passed, is in judicial custody or not.  Power to pass an order,
stem from the satisfaction of the detaining authority, with respect to a
person, with a view to prevent him, from indulging in activities, prejudicial
to the maintenance of public order.  Therefore, it is not for the Court to
sit in judgment over the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority
and to consider whether the materials are sufficient or adequate, for making
an order of detention.
</p>
<p id="p_156">	108.Scrutiny should be restricted, as to whether, material exists and
whether they are relevant, for a reasonable man, to take into consideration
and arrive at a reasonable conclusion.  While examining the correctness of
the detention, the paramount consideration should be to test whether the
decision taken by the detaining authority is to achieve the object and that
the same should not be ignored, limiting the scrutiny only to the aspect of
bail.  Likelihood for bail, without there being any material would certainly
be a sweeping bald statement, or in other words, a ipsi dixit statement.
When relevant materials are considered, then, in the humble opinion of this
Court, it cannot be said that, interference drawn by the detaining authority
is extraneous.  When the object of the Act, being to prevent a person from
indulging in activities, prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, and
the authority, is only an executive, then, the standards applied to test
relevancy, should be limited only to subjective standards, to which a
reasonable man, could arrive at, on the basis of materials.
</p>	
<p id="p_157">	109.A document can be said to be relevant and material in a given case,
when it is likely to bear an opinion on the detaining authority, in one way
or another.   What is relevant is decided by logical and experience.
Standard and degree of test is different, if sufficiency has to be
considered.  Relevant in detention laws, should be construed to mean,
logically connected and having a tendency in the mind of the detaining
authority to take into consideration, for invoking detention.  That which
persuades a reasonable man to think about the probability or possibility or
both, as to whether the detenu would indulge in prejudicial activities, if he
is allowed to remain at large.  Adequacy or sufficiency of reasons, are
distinct from relevancy.  Relevancy must relate to the standards of belief of
a reasonable man.
</p>	
<p id="p_158">	110.Determination on the aspect of bail, in our humble opinion, should
not, outweigh the subjective satisfaction on the possibility of recurrence of
crime, if the person is allowed to remain at large.  Judicial review should
be restricted to consider, as to whether, there are relevant materials, to
support a decision.  When preventive law is invoked, the test should be
reasonableness, and Courts have to address, as to whether, there is a
reasonable nexus, to the grounds, and the material considered, by the
detaining authority.  An order of detention can be set aside, if there are no
materials, but if materials are considered, then the sufficiency or adequacy,
should not be gone into by the Court.  If the subjective satisfaction arrived
at, by the detaining authority, satisfy rationality, logic, reasonableness,
nexus, to the ground and documents, then, in the light of the object, sought
to be achieved under the Preventive Laws, interference with the subjective
satisfaction, should be limited.

<p id="p_159">	111.The Larger Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/903323/" id="a_106">Masood Alam vs. Union of
India</a>, reported in AIR 1973 SC 897 (Three Judges Bench), held that, if the
detaining authority is of the opinion on grounds, which are germane and
relevant that it is necessary to detain a person from acting prejudicially,
then, it is not for the Supreme Court to consider objectively, how imminent
is the likelihood of the detenu indulging in prejudicial activities.  When
contentions were raised regarding detaining a person in custody, the Apex
Court held that it is without merit.  The Larger Bench of the Apex Court
further observed that it has to be borne in mind, that it is always the past
conduct, activities or the antecedent history of a person, which the
detaining authority takes into account in making detention order.
</p>	
<p id="p_160">	112.<a href="/doc/679149/" id="a_107">In Khudiram Das vs. The State of West Bengal and others</a>, reported
in 1975 (2) SCC 81, (Four Judges Bench), the decision in Machindar vs. King,
reported in AIR 1950 SC 129, was considered and the Apex Court observed that
the grounds, on which, the satisfaction is based must be, such a rational
human being can consider with the fact, in respect of which, the satisfaction
is reached.  They must be relevant to the subject matter of enquiry and must
not be extraneous to the scope and purpose of the statute.  After considering
the comparative scope of judicial review, on the grounds of satisfaction, in
America, England and India, the Apex Court observed that in England and
India, Courts Stop ? Short, at merely inquiring, whether the grounds, on
which, the detaining authority has reached the subjective satisfaction, are
such that any reasonable person could arrive at such satisfaction.  In yet
another Three Judges Bench judgment, in <a href="/doc/1623857/" id="a_108">Ram Bali Rajbhar vs. State of West
Bengal</a>, reported in 1975 (4) SCC 47, the Apex Court, reiterated that the
courts have to carefully avoid, substituting our own view about what is
enough for the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authorities, with
which, inference could be justified, only, if it is clear that no reasonable
person could possibly be, satisfied about the need to detain, on the grounds
given, in which case, the detention would be in excess of the power to
detain.

material at all, or was such no reasonable person would arrive at, on the

been passed on any materials before it. If it is found that the order has
been based by the detaining authority on materials on record, then the Court
cannot go further and examine whether the material was adequate or not, which
is the function of an appellate authority or Court. It can examine the
material on record only for the purpose of seeing whether the order of
detention has been based on no material. The satisfaction mentioned in

Gadia</a>,  reported in 1992 Supp (1) SCC 496, at paragraphs 12 and 13, a Three
Judge Bench of the Apex Court, held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_164">	"12. This is not to say that the jurisdiction of the High Court and the
Supreme Court under Articles 226 and 32 respectively has no role to play once
the detention ? punitive or preventive ? is shown to have been made under the
law so made for the purpose. This is to point out the limitations which the
High Court and the Supreme Court have to observe while exercising their
respective jurisdiction in such cases. These limitations are normal and well
known, and are self-imposed as a matter of prudence, propriety, policy and
practice and are observed while dealing with cases under all laws. Though the
Constitution does not place any restriction on these powers, the judicial
decisions have evolved them over a period of years taking into consideration
the nature of the right infringed or threatened to be infringed, the scope
and object of the legislation or of the order or decision complained of, the
need to balance the rights and interests of the individual as against those
of the society, the circumstances under which and the persons by whom the
jurisdiction is invoked, the nature of relief sought etc. To illustrate these
limitations: (i) in the exercise of their discretionary jurisdiction the High
Court and the Supreme Court do not, as courts of appeal or revision, correct
mere errors of law or of facts; (ii) the resort to the said jurisdiction is
not permitted as an alternative remedy for relief which may be obtained by
suit or other mode prescribed by statute. Where it is open to the aggrieved
person to move another tribunal or even itself in another jurisdiction for
obtaining redress in the manner provided in the statute, the Court does not,
by exercising the writ jurisdiction, permit the machinery created by the
statute to be by-passed; (iii) it does not generally enter upon the
determination of questions which demand an elaborate examination of evidence
to establish the right to enforce which, the writ is claimed; (iv) it does
not interfere on the merits with the determination of the issues made by the
authority invested with statutory power, particularly when they relate to
matters calling for expertise, unless there are exceptional circumstances
calling for judicial intervention, such as, where the determination is mala
fide or is prompted by extraneous considerations or is made in contravention
of the principles of natural justice or any constitutional provision; (v) the
Court may also intervene where (a) the authority acting under the concerned
law does not have the requisite authority or the order which is purported to
have been passed under the law is not warranted or is in breach of the
provisions of the concerned law or the person against whom the action is
taken is not the person against whom the order is directed; or (b) where the
authority has exceeded its powers or jurisdiction or has failed or refused to
exercise jurisdiction vested in it; or (c) where the authority has not
applied its mind at all or has exercised its power dishonestly or for an
improper purpose; (vi) where the Court cannot grant a final relief, the Court
does not entertain petition only for giving interim relief. If the Court is
of opinion that there is no other convenient or efficacious remedy open to
the petitioner, it will proceed to investigate the case on its merits and if
the Court finds that there is an infringement of the petitioner?s legal
rights, it will grant final relief but will not dispose of the petition only
by granting interim relief; (vii) where the satisfaction of the authority is
subjective, the Court intervenes when the authority has acted under the
dictates of another body or when the conclusion is arrived at by the
application of a wrong test or misconstruction of a statute or it is not
based on material which is of a rationally probative value and relevant to
the subject matter in respect of which the authority is to satisfy itself. If
again the satisfaction is arrived at by taking into consideration material
which the authority properly could not, or by omitting to consider matters
which it ought to have, the Court interferes with the resultant order; (viii)
In proper cases the Court also intervenes when some legal or fundamental
right of the individual is seriously threatened, though not actually invaded.
</p><p id="p_165">  13. These limitations are not only equally observed by the High Court and
the Supreme Court while exercising their writ jurisdiction in preventive
detention matters, but in view of the object for which the detention law is
enacted and is permitted by the Constitution to be enacted, the courts are
more circumspect in observing them while exercising their said extraordinary
equitable and discretionary power in these cases. While explaining the nature
of the detention law and of the orders passed under it and the scope of the
powers of the Court in these matters, this Court has often emphasised the
distinction between the existence of its wide powers and the propriety and
desirability of using them."

<p id="p_166">	116.On the aspect of satisfaction, The Hon'ble Mr.Justice Krishna Iyer,
in <a href="/doc/237638/" id="a_114">Sadhu Roy vs. State of West Bengal</a>, reported in 1975 (1) SCC 660, states
that the satisfaction though attenuated by ?subjectivity?, it must be real
and rational, not random, must flow from an advertence to relevant factors,
not be a mock recital or mechanical chant of statutorily sanctioned phrases.
His Lordship has further said that one test to check upon the colourable
nature or mindless mood of the alleged satisfaction of the authority is to
see, if the articulated grounds are too groundless to induce credence in any
reasonable man or too frivolous to be brushed aside as fictitious by a
responsible instrumentality.
</p>	

<p id="p_167">	117.As regards judicial precedents, in <a href="/doc/478730/" id="a_115">Union of India v.
K.S.Subramanian</a>, reported in AIR 1976 SC 2433, the Supreme Court, held as
follows:
</p><p id="p_168">	"The proper course for a High Court is to try to find out and follow
the opinions expressed by larger benches of the Supreme Court in reference to
those expressed by smaller benches of the Court.  That is the practice
followed by the Supreme Court itself.  The practice has now crystallized into
a rule of law declared by the Supreme Court."

SCC 52, the Supreme Court, at Paragraph 22, held as follows:
	"It is also to be borne in mind that even in cases where a High Court
finds any conflict between the views expressed by larger and smaller benches
of this Court, it cannot disregard or skirt the views expressed by the larger
benches. The proper course for a High Court in such a case, as observed by
this Court in <a href="/doc/478730/" id="a_117">Union of India and Anr. v. K.S. Subramanian</a> [(1977) I LLJ 5
(SC)] to which one of us was a party, is to try to find out and follow the
opinion expressed by larger benches of this Court in preference to those
expressed by smaller benches of the Court which practice, hardened as it has
into a rule of law is followed by this Court itself."

<p id="p_170">	119.It is also to be noted that when the validity of detention orders
were tested in A.K.Gopalan vs. State of Madras, (Six Judges Bench Judgment)
reported in 1950 AIR (SC) 27, and Dr.N.B.Khare vs. State of Delhi, (Five
Judges Bench Judgment) reported in 1950 AIR (SC) 211, the Constitutional
Benches of the Apex Court tested the validity of the legislation and
detention orders, on the principles of reasonable restrictions and
reasonableness.  In our humble opinion, the principle equally applies, when a
detention order is tested on the aspect of subjective satisfaction.	
</p>
<p id="p_171">	120.In the light of the discussion and decisions considered, we are of
the humble opinion that the detaining authority cannot be found fault with,
if he had considered bail orders passed in similar cases, to arrive at the
subjective satisfaction.  But the relevancy of the said orders can be
examined, on facts and circumstances of each case.
</p>	
<p id="p_172">	121.Reverting back to the case on hand, admittedly, the detenu has come
to adverse notice of the police in three cases. The detenu has been arrested
on 23.11.2013 and Detention Order has been passed on 02.01.2014.  Thus, there
is a delay of  40 days, in between the date of arrest and passing of the said
detention order.  As regards delay in passing the order of detention, this
Court deems it fit to consider the following judgments
</p><p id="p_173">	122.<a href="/doc/1070364/" id="a_118">In K.Aruna Kumari vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh and others</a>,
reported in 1988 (1) SCC 296 = 1988 SCC (Criminal) 116, delay in passing the
detention order, was one of the grounds.  While addressing the said issue, at
paragraph 11, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the delay, cannot by
itself, be a vitiating factor, to quash the order of detention.  The Hon'ble
Supreme Court, relied on the decision, in <a href="/doc/825217/" id="a_119">Rajendra Prashad vs. State of U.P</a>,
reported in 1981 (4) SCC 558 = 1981 SCC (Cri) 870, wherein, the order of

detenu was absconding.  He was arrested on 18th March 1987.  Materials were
collected and placed, before the detaining authority, on 14.05.1987, and that
the detention order was passed, on 15.05.1987.  Having regard to the above
facts, the Hon'ble Apex Court, observed that the respondent has

was passed only in December but it is not right to assume that an order of
detention has to be mechanically struck down if passed after some delay. (<a href="/doc/1070364/" id="a_126">See
K. Aruna Kumari v. Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> and the cases mentioned
there.) It is necessary to consider the circumstances in each individual case
to find out whether the delay has been satisfactorily explained or not. In
the present case the petitioner was in custody and there could not be any
apprehension of his indulging in illegal activities requiring his detention
until the grant of bail by the criminal court became imminent. Besides,
enquiry was also proceeding. This aspect has been explained in the detention
order itself as also by the District Magistrate in his affidavit and it is
clear that there has been no undue delay on his part in taking action.
Besides, the distinction between such delay and the delay in complying with
the procedural safeguards of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_127">Article 22(5)</a> of the Constitution as pointed out
in <a href="/doc/1150170/" id="a_128">Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah v. State of Gujarat</a> is also relevant here
especially because of the background of the petitioner?s antecedents taken
into account by the detaining authority showing his propensity for acts which
were likely to disturb public order. We do not see any objection to the
District Magistrate referring the first two incidents in this context,
specially when the first incident related to disturbance of public order.?
</p>	
<p id="p_176">	124.From the above judgment, it could be deduced that though the
Hon'ble Apex Court has made a distinction, between the delay in passing the
order of detention and the delay in complying with the procedural safeguards
of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_129">Article 22(5)</a> of the Constitution of India.  In the above reported case,
an affidavit has been filed explaining the delay in passing the order of
detention.
</p>
<p id="p_177">	125.<a href="/doc/1712028/" id="a_130">In M.Ahamedkutty vs. Union of India and another</a>, reported in 1990
(2) SCC 01, there was a delay in passing the order of execution.  In the said
case, the detenu himself was absconding.  The authorities were collecting
materials, to place it, before the detaining authority, for his
consideration.  It was a case under the <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_131">COFEPOSA Act</a>.  Considering the
explanation offered, by the State, the Supreme Court, at paragraphs 13 and
17, held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_178">	?Where after passing of the detention order the passage of time is
caused by the detenu himself by absconding, the satisfaction of the detaining
authority cannot be doubted and the detention cannot be held to be bad on
ground of delay in execution of the order.  In the facts and circumstances of
the present case there was no inordinate and unexplained delay of 38 days
between the detention order and its execution so as to snap the nexus between
the two or to render the grounds stale or to indicate that the detaining
authority was not satisfied as to the genuine need for detention of the
detenu.  However, the circumstances in the present case seem to indicate a
certain degree of lack of coordination between the detaining authorities and
those entrusted with the execution of the detention order.  The State should
ensure that such delays do not occur as apart from giving the detenu a ground
for attacking the detention order, such delay really tends to frustrate and
defeat the very purpose of preventive detention.?
</p>
<p id="p_179">	126.<a href="/doc/108243572/" id="a_132">In K.Mayilammal vs. State of Tamil Nadu, (HCP.No</a>.996/2011, Dated
12.01.2012), one of the points, raised by the detenu was that though he was
arrested, on 22.07.2011 and the remand expired, on 13.08.2011, detention
order came to be passed only, on 24.08.2011, and that there was a delay of 33
days, in passing the order of detention, from the date of arrest.  While
challenging the correctness of the detention order, reliance has been made to
a decision in <a href="/doc/96697450/" id="a_133">M.Kakkammal v. The Commissioner of Police, Madurai</a>, reported in
2009 (2) TNLR 121 (Mad), wherein, at paragraph 6 of the judgment, in
M.Kakkammal's case, the Hon'ble Division Bench, held that the chain between
the ground of criminal activity, alleged by the detaining authority, for the
purpose of detention is snapped, if there is a long and unexplained delay,
between offending criminal act and order of detention.  In the said case, the
delay in passing the order of detention was between 01.06.2007 to 19.08.2008.
Finding that there was a long delay, without there being any proper
explanation, the Hon'ble Division Bench in M.Kakkammal's case, quashed the
order of detention.  On the facts and circumstances in K.Mayilammal's case,
the Hon'ble Division Bench found that there was no explanation, in the
counter affidavit, for the delay of 33 days, in passing the order of
detention, from the date of arrest, and accordingly, quashed the order of
detention.
</p>	
<p id="p_180">	127.Reverting back to the case on hand before us, the learned counsel
for the petitioner, has raised a new point that there was a delay in passing
the order of detention, during the course of arguments, which is opposed by
the learned Additional Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_181">	128.Licil Antony vs. State of Kerala, (Criminal Appeal No.872/2014 and
Special Leave Petition (Criminal)No.988 of 2014, decided on 15.04.2014.  It
was a case of <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_134">COFEPOSA Act</a>, involving in smuggling of red sanders, in India
and abroad.  Detenu therein, was arrested and lateron, released on bail, on
November 2012.  Detention order came to be passed, on 06.05.2013 and served
on the detenu on 11.06.2013.   One of the main grounds of challenge, was the
delay in passing the order of detention.  The materials ran over 1000 pages.
While addressing the challenge, as to whether, mere delay itself would be
sufficient, to hold the order of detention, as illegal, the Hon'ble Apex
Court, at paragraph 8 held as follows:-	
</p><p id="p_182">	?We have given our thoughtful  consideration to the rival submissions
and we have no doubt in our mind that there has to be live link between the
prejudicial activity and the order of detention. COFEPOSA intends to deal
with persons engaged in smuggling activities who pose a serious threat to the
economy and thereby security of the nation.  Such persons by virtue of their
large resources and influence cause delay in making of an order of detention.
While dealing with the question of delay in making an order of detention, the
court is required to be circumspect and has to take a pragmatic view.  No
hard and fast formula is possible to be laid or has been laid in this regard.
However, one thing is clear that in case of delay, that has to be
satisfactorily explained. After all, the purpose of preventive detention is
to take immediate steps for preventing the detenu from indulging in
prejudicial activity. If there is undue and long delay between the
prejudicial activity and making of the order of detention and the delay has
not been explained, the order of detention becomes vulnerable. Delay in
issuing the order of detention, if not satisfactorily explained, itself is a
ground to quash the order of detention. No rule with precision has been
formulated in this regard. The test of proximity is not a rigid or a
mechanical test. In case of undue and long delay the court has to investigate
whether the link has been broken in the circumstances of each case.?
</p>
<p id="p_183">	129.It is also worthwhile to consider the decisions relied on by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in Licil Antony's case,	
	<a href="/doc/1785615/" id="a_135">In Rajinder Arora v. Union of India</a>, (2006) 4 SCC 796, it has been held
as follows:
</p><p id="p_184">	21. The question as regards delay in issuing the order of detention has
been held to be a valid ground for quashing an order of detention by this
Court in <a href="/doc/678597/" id="a_136">T.A. Abdul Rahman v. State of Kerala</a> (1989) 4 SCC 741 stating: (SCC
pp. 748-49, paras 10-11)
	?10. The conspectus of the above decisions can be summarised thus: The
question whether the prejudicial activities of a person necessitating to pass
an order of detention is proximate to the time when the order is made or the
live-link between the prejudicial activities and the purpose of detention is
snapped depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. No hard-and-fast
rule can be precisely formulated that would be- applicable under all
circumstances and no exhaustive guidelines can be laid down in that behalf.
It follows that the test of proximity is not a rigid or mechanical test by
merely counting number of months between the offending acts and the order of
detention. However, when there is undue and long delay between the
prejudicial activities and the passing of detention order, the court has to
scrutinise whether the detaining authority has satisfactorily examined such a
delay and afforded a tenable and reasonable explanation as to why such a
delay has occasioned, when called upon to answer and further the court has to
investigate whether the causal connection has been broken in the
circumstances of each case.
</p><p id="p_185">	11. Similarly when there is unsatisfactory and unexplained delay
between the date of order of detention and the date of securing the arrest of
the detenu, such a delay would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of
the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority leading to a
legitimate inference that the detaining authority was not really and
genuinely satisfied as regards the necessity for detaining the detenu with a
view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner.?
</p><p id="p_186">	22. The delay caused in this case in issuing the order of detention has
not been explained. In fact, no reason in that behalf whatsoever has been
assigned at all.?
</p>	


<p id="p_187">	130.As observed by the Supreme Court, there cannot be any hard and fast
formula, on the aspect of delay in passing the order of detention.  What is
required to be considered is, (1)whether there is a livelink between the
prejudicial activity and the order of detention, (2)whether the delay in
passing the order of detention, has been reasonably explained.  Though the
Apex Court held that the test of proximity, is neither rigid nor mechanical,
yet the Apex Court observed that the court has to investigate, whether the
livelink has been broken, depending upon the circumstances of each case.
</p>
<p id="p_188">	131.In the case on hand, it could be seen from the materials on record
that in connection with the ground case, the detenu has been arrested, on
23.11.2013 and remanded.  The remand period was extended, upto 03.01.2014.
Just one day, prior to the expiry of the remand, an order of detention has
been passed on 02.01.2014.  The detenu has been in custody for nearly 40
days, between the date of arrest in the ground case, and the order of
detention.
</p>
<p id="p_189">	132.Though the learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the
sponsoring authority, has to collect, all the particulars, regarding the
adverse and ground cases, registered against the detenu, bail orders, if any,
from the concerned Courts and thus the delay had occasioned, we are not
inclined to accept the said explanation, for the reason that all the
materials required, could have been collected, within a reasonable time, if
the sponsoring authority, was of the view that immediate steps have to be
taken, to prevent the detenu, from indulging in acts, prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order.  Of course, it is not for the courts, to
examine, how imminent, the detenu would indulge, in acts prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order, but certainly, it is the duty of the Court, to
investigate as to whether the livelink, between the prejudicial activity and
order of detention, is snapped or likely to continue.  Moreover, as observed
by the Hon'ble Apex Court, had the explanation been offered, by way of an
affidavit, setting out the details, it could be a good ground, to argue that
there was due diligence on the part of the authorities.  In the case on hand,
though the detenu was in custody from 23.11.2013 until 03.01.2014, the delay
of 40 days in passing the order of detention, has not been explained.
Explanation offered by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor is not
convincing.  Moreover, the detention order has been passed just one day,
prior to the expiry of remand.
</p>
<p id="p_190">	133.In the light of the discussion and decisions, on the facts and
circumstances of the case, though, on principle, we are in agreement with the
contentions of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor that there is a
difference, in considering the delay in passing the order, execution of the
order, and the delay in considering the representation, as expeditiously as
possible, and on other aspects like, placing the materials, before the
Advisory Board, within the time stipulated, under the <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_137">Tamil Nadu Act</a> 14 of
1982, yet, for the reasons stated supra, we are of the view that there is a
delay in passing the order of detention, and that the explanation offered is
not acceptable.
</p>
<p id="p_191">	134.On the issue as to whether during the course of arguments, the
detenue could be allowed to raise a new plea that there is a delay in passing
the order of detention, courts have to make a distinction between the
violation of any civil right claimed, and sought to be established, on the
basis of pleadings and evidence, with that of violation of the most cherished
right in the Constitution of India, personal liberty, for which, there are
constitutional safeguards.
</p>
<p id="p_192">	135.Considering the effect of the legislation, preventive nature of
right infringed, need to balance the rights and interest of the individual,
as against those of the society, circumstances under which, restrictions are
placed, on the constitutional right of personal liberty, we are of the humble
view that the detenu should not be restricted from raising any new point,
during the course of arguments.  If any new plea is raised, on the basis of
the materials, already in existence, the order should fall or succeed, for
the reasons contained in it.  Therefore, in appropriate cases, though the
detenu, has not made any representation to the competent authorities, on any
point, relevant for testing the correctness of a detention order or any
proceedings in relation to the detention order, or raised any grounds, in the
supporting affidavit to the writ of Habeas Corpus Petition, still, he should
be allowed to raise any point, which are favourable to him, on the materials
available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_193">	136.While testing the validity of the detention orders, and keeping in
mind, the nature and effect of infringement to the constitutional right,
personal liberty, we are of the humble view that restriction on the exercise
of the constitutional powers, should not be limited only to the pleadings.
If an order is per se void, that is without jurisdiction, then, there is no
need for the respondents, even to file a counter affidavit, unless the same
is disputed.  Facts disputed require counter affidavit, otherwise, an order
of detention, can be tested, on the grounds contained in it, or on the
materials furnished, in support of the same.  Mala fides, if alleged requires
a counter affidavit.  Courts can examine the merits of each case, on the
basis of the material on record, and if it finds that there is an
infringement of the constitutional right, it can grant the relief, even
without a pleading.  Therefore, we are not inclined to subscribe to the
objections, raised by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor, on the aspect
of raising a new plea (i.e) delay in passing the order of detention.	
</p>
<p id="p_194">	137.Right to liberty is a fundamental right and if it is restricted
with an order of detention, then the detenu should be allowed to raise all
the points that are available to him, even if not pleaded.  He cannot be made
to suffer, for lack of sufficient or no pleadings.  While exercising powers
of judicial review, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_138">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,
challenging an order passed by the authority amenable to writ jurisdiction,
High Court is concerned with illegality, irrationality and procedural
impropriety of an order passed by such authority.  Therefore, while testing
the validity of an order on the available materials, courts can extend its
arm, and reach justice, and moreso, when a person approaches the
Constitutional Court with a grievance that he has been illegally detained.
</p>
<p id="p_195">	138.Decisions relied on by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor
relate to either COFEPOSA ACT or NSA Act.  Even the facts in Aruna Kumari's
case (cited supra), are inapposite to the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_196">	139.For the reasons, stated supra, this Court is of the view that the
impugned Detention Order has to be set aside.  Accordingly, the impugned
Detention Order in No.M.H.S. Confdl.No.01/2014, dated 02.01.2014, by the
first respondent detaining the detenu namely Venkatesh alias Maangai,
S/o.Mariappan, is quashed and the Habeas Corpus Petition is allowed. The
detenu is ordered to be set at liberty forthwith, unless his custody is
required in connection with any other case.
