7.4.     The plaintiffs came to know in January 2003 that the

defendants were using the trademark Mountain Dew in relation to

packaged drinking water under the name / trade mark &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27; which was identical to the plaintiffs&#x27; trademark. Apart from

adopting an identical mark, the defendants also adopted a similar

label and manner of the same trademark as that of the plaintiffs

Aquafina. A mere comparison of the defendants&#x27; packaged

drinking water under the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; and the &#x27;Aquafina&#x27;

bottle of the plaintiffs would reveal the similarities between the two

products. The various common features between the defendants

product viz., Mountain Dew and Aquafina of the plaintiffs product

were as under:

consumers/ prospective consumers were likely to be confused that

the product of the defendant originated from or had connection with

that of the Plaintiffs. The use by the defendant of the name/mark

Mountain Dew, which was identical to the trade mark of the

plaintiffs Mountain Dew would constitute infringement of the

rights of the plaintiffs in the said mark. The plaintiffs were the

owners of the trade mark Mountain Dew and also owned the

copyright in the label of the product Aquafina that was an original

artistic work as per the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_2">Copyright Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_88">
7.6.   The mark Mountain Dew due to extensive use and

advertising was exclusively associated with the plaintiffs and their

business. The goodwill and reputation of the trademark &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27; transcended beyond the geographical boundaries of any

particular country. The Mountain Dew soda had been advertised in

renowned magazines, which had circulation in India. The same had

also been widely publicized in electronic media. In fact in recent

times, the plaintiffs had issued television advertisements which

have attracted enormous response among the viewing public in

India. It was inexplicable as to how the defendant came to adopt a

mark, which was exactly identical to the plaintiffs&#x27; trademark. The

trademark mountain dew being an arbitrary and fanciful mark

adopted by the plaintiffs, it was entitled to a highest degree of

protection. It was extremely distinctive of the plaintiffs throughout

the world. The use of the said mark or any other mark similar to

that of the plaintiffs by any other party without the permission or

authorization of the plaintiffs would constitute passing off of such

goods or business as that of the plaintiffs or which was connected

with the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
7.7.    The defendants were apparently engaged in the sale of

purified water under the mark/name &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;. This came to

the knowledge of the plaintiffs when the plaintiffs&#x27; marketing

department came across the product of the defendants in June 2003.

Immediately, the plaintiffs took steps to file a suit in the High Court

at New Delhi for perpetual injunction along with an application for

interim injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 and for

appointment of local commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_90">
7.8.    The adoption of the registered mark of the Plaintiffs,

&#x27;Mountain Dew&quot;, by the defendant was completely illegal and

unlawful. The fact that a mark which was exactly identical to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  14</span>

                                                     CCCA Nos.20 of 2021 &amp; Batch




Plaintiffs&#x27; mark had been adopted for bottled purified water with

identical colour scheme as that of Plaintiffs&#x27; bottled purified water,

&#x27;Aquafina&#x27; itself would establish that the defendants intention was

to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs&#x27; mark.

The manner in which the defendants had written the word

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; with the beginning letter &quot;M&quot; of the word

&#x27;Mountain&#x27; in a slightly bigger size than the other letters and all

letters written as capital letters itself would establish that the

copying was not restricted merely to the mark but also to the

manner of writing so that consumers were clearly led to believe that

the defendants product was connected with the plaintiffs or

originated from the plaintiffs. The said use of an identical logo also

would constitute infringement of copyright. The defendants had

used the same colour for their Label i.e. the colour blue as used for

the Plaintiffs&#x27; &#x27;Aquafina&#x27; bottled purified water, which further

would affirm that the intention of the defendant was completely

malafide. The whole purpose of the defendant in adopting an

identical mark and logo as that of the plaintiffs was to give an

impression that the product of the defendant originated from and/or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                  15</span>

                                                    CCCA Nos.20 of 2021 &amp; Batch




had connection with the plaintiffs. Any person who saw the product

of the defendant would be confused into believing the same.


7.9.    It was further submitted that the use of the word &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27; by the defendants led to confusion and deception. The same

was completely unlawful and impinged upon the rights of the

plaintiffs. The mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; was a registered trademark of

the Plaintiffs. The adoption of the said mark or other similar mark

by any party was not accidental or incidental but was a deliberate

attempt to benefit illegally using the same. The defendant could

not be allowed to misuse the plaintiffs&#x27; mark in that manner. The

use of the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; was not only in violation of the

plaintiffs rights but could also be harmful to the public in as much

as innocent consumers might be lured to buy the said purified water

under a mistaken impression that it was as pure as the plaintiffs&#x27;

products and might in fact endanger public health and safety.


7.10.   The use of the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; for purified water

which might not live up to the standards of the plaintiffs products

would in fact result in dilution of the plaintiffs&#x27; mark. Such use of

the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; by the defendant was nothing but a

                                                           PNR,J &amp; Dr.GRR,J
                                                   CCCA Nos.20 of 2021 &amp; Batch




misrepresentation in the course of customers/prospective customers

that their product was the plaintiffs&#x27; product and such conduct was

calculated to injure the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiffs.

The acts of the defendant would constitute passing off of its

product and business as that of the plaintiffs.


7.11.   The use of the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; by the Defendant

might also lead to initial interest confusion. The plaintiffs were

world renowned players in the field of beverages. The Plaintiffs

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; soda was extremely famous. The Plaintiffs also

were selling bottled purified water under the trademark &#x27;Aquafina&#x27;

in India and abroad. The Defendants&#x27; &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; mark with a

colour scheme similar to that of the Plaintiffs&#x27; Aquafina used for

bottled purified water might evince an initial interest from the

purchaser who might think that it was another product of the

Plaintiffs.   Hence, the acts of the defendants would constitute

infringement of registered trademark, infringement of copy right,

passing off, unfair competition and dilution. The confusion was

worsened by the fact that the plaintiffs were also in the same

business i.e. packaged drinking water and consumers might be

confused into believing that the product of the defendants also

originated from the plaintiffs. Such use constituted acts of passing

off and unfair competition. The nature of the product was such that

the same would be picked up off-the-shelf without much

deliberation. The decision to purchase a product was made at the

point of purchase and was almost instantaneous. The plaintiffs&#x27; and

the defendants&#x27; products were being kept together at the same

counters and shelfs. The chances of confusion were thus worsened

&amp; almost unavoidable. It was a case of triple identity:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (i) Identical mark;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      (ii) Identical channel of purchase;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (iii) Identical customers, hence, passing off was
            inevitable.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_91">8.     Six months after filing of the suit by the plaintiffs, in

January 2004, the defendants filed O.S. No.19 of 2004 inter alia

seeking damages and permanent injunction against the plaintiffs for

passing off their packaged drinking water by using the trademark

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; by the plaintiffs.       The defendants also made

year 1997-98 he wanted to commence his own business. After

making necessary enquiries in the field and after conducting

extensive research, the 1st defendant decided to enter the business

of packaged drinking water. The 1st defendant had conceived an

idea and in fact had discussed the idea with Sri V.Kishore Gupta of

M/s S.K. Graphics, the Artist who prepared the label.              While

discussing the matter, the 1st defendant had desired that he would

like to have the label/Trade name to contain the natural source of

water, suggesting purity and coolness. It was with the said

intention, he conceived and developed the label of &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27;. Before deciding the trademark, the defendant had

meticulously searched the website which provided a list of 400

brand-names of the companies which produced bottled packaged

drinking water either domestically or otherwise. In the said

extensive enquiry the first defendant did not come across the name

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; being used by any manufacturers.


11.1.   After making further enquiries as to the nature of the

business, he prepared project report and approached his bankers

M/s. Central Bank of India. On necessary verification, his bankers

approved the proposal for loan to install the requisite plant and

machinery and commencement of production in 2000. Thereafter

the defendants got it registered as small scale unit with the

Directors of Industries Government of A.P. in 2001. The product

was launched on 8.11.2000 with much fanfare and advertisement in

most widely circulated Urdu news paper &#x27;Siasat Daily&#x27;. The said

news paper had a large circulation not only in India but also in

countries like U.S.A., U.K. Qatar, U.A.E. Germany, Japan etc. The

defendant started manufacturing the said product in 1 liter, 5 liters

and 20 liters bottles. Over the years, the defendant developed its

market and reputation due to excellent quality of product. The

defendants&#x27; unit was registered with the sales tax authorities and

was also issued a certificate in that respect. The defendant had been

an income tax assessee and had been filing returns regularly. The

unit run by the defendants also held necessary license from the

MCH as well as other concerned authorities of Government of A.P.

The water manufactured by the defendants had been certified to

confirm to the Bureau of Indian Standards and International

Business   Standards    Organization     (IBSO)    Standards.           The

defendants applied for registration with ISI authorities in 2001 and

the same was granted by Bureau of India Standards at Hyderabad.

The licences were being renewed from time to time. Over the last 3

years, the defendants were able to establish themselves in the

market and were supplying packaged drinking water to five star

hotels, Government departments, apart from being official suppliers

of packaged drinking water in National Games held in Hyderabad

Even in February 2003, the authorities of Pollution Monitoring

defendants was absolutely pure confirming to the required

standards. The defendants also held certificates from BIS and other

State and Central Government authorities. Due to the quality of

product and due to the hard work put in by the defendants, the

Trade mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; had become closely associated with

the product of the defendant and had acquired a secondary

meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_97">
11.2.   While the matter stood thus the defendants were surprised

to receive a notice from the court commissioner said to have been

appointed as per the orders passed by the High Court at New Delhi.

The defendants came to know that the plaintiffs filed O.S.No. 1332

of 2003 on 19.7.2003. The representatives of the plaintiffs who

were accompanying the court commissioner had created a scene at

the plant of the defendants. The court commissioner prepared an

inventory and seizure panchnama of the ready stocks available

within the premises, of packaged drinking water under the label

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;. Though the defendants raised a protest, as they

were told that the same was being done under the orders obtained

from a competent court of law, as such, on legal advice decided to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                     23</span>
                                                                 PNR,J &amp; Dr.GRR,J

seek redressal before the concerned court, so the defendant

remained silent. The concerned officials of the plaintiffs threatened

the defendant that he should immediately stop his business.


11.3. The defendants further stated that the plaintiffs claimed to

have registration for the label/Trademark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; for their

citric soda but admittedly not manufactured/sold the said product in

India till January, 2003. Admittedly, the plaintiffs did not have any

packaged drinking water under the label of &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;

anywhere in the world even till date.              The plaintiffs were

manufacturing and marketing packaged drinking water under the

label &#x27;Aquafina&#x27; which was totally a different label. Neither was it

phonetically similar or otherwise bearing any similarity to the label

of the defendants&#x27; &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;. The packaged drinking water

brought in by the plaintiffs under the label &#x27;Aquafina&#x27; was totally

different than that of the &#x27;Mountain dew&#x27; label brought in by the

plaintiffs and was being sold in one litre bottles only, whereas the

defendants product was being sold in packages i.e. one litre, 2

litres, five litres, twenty litres. Mere registration for totally different

goods without manufacture or sale of the said product in India was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                   24</span>
                                                               PNR,J &amp; Dr.GRR,J

of no consequence and the same would not create any right in

respect of the said label for the plaintiffs or otherwise curtail rights

of a honest concurrent user like that of the defendants. The

plaintiffs did not have any right to use the label &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;

for category product of packaged drinking water as admittedly the

defendants were the prior users of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
11.4. The defendants further submitted that when Pepsi&#x27;s products

were tested, they were found to contain pesticides and any

use/passing off by the plaintiffs label &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; could bring

further disrepute to his business. The plaintiffs applied for a

separate registration for &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; mineral and aerated water

and were in the process of introducing the same in the market. The

same was apparent from the search report obtained by him. The

plaintiffs were apparently doing so, so as to pass off their product

as that of the defendants.         Admittedly the defendants had

commenced their business openly and after good publicity in the

year 2000 and were carrying on the business of manufacture and

sale of &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; packaged drinking water to the knowledge

of one and all. The plaintiffs did not raise any objection to the

manufacture and marketing of &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; packaged drinking

water since 2000. For the first time, the plaintiffs brought in their

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; citric soda into market in India in January, 2003.

In the said circumstances, admittedly, the defendants were prior

users of the label &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; in India. Their rights as prior

users as well as honest concurrent users were substantial rights and

the plaintiffs would have no right to seek or to curtail the same.


11.5. While contesting the claim put forth by the plaintiffs, the

defendants realized that there was gross misrepresentation and

suppression of material facts indulged into by the plaintiffs about

passing of information to the newspapers i.e. defendants 3 and 4 in

O.S No.19 of 2004 about the orders passed by the High Court of

Delhi, as such claimed damages for a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- with

interest @ 18% per annum and claimed permanent injunction

prior user than PepsiCo, which started using the mark &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27; in India only in January, 2003. Since Magfast established that

it was a prior user of the mark Mountain Dew, the claim of PepsiCo

that it had got transborder reputation becomes obscured.

</p><p id="p_114">      (v) PepsiCo cannot stop Magfast from using the trade mark

in India as Magfast was the prior user of the mark in India and

hence entitled to the benefit of <a href="/doc/876933/" id="a_3">Section 34</a> of the 1999 Act,

</p><p id="p_116">17.    While dismissing the suit filed by the defendants, the trial

separate class and hence question of confusion would not arise,

whereas, the defendants in its own suit had taken an opposite stand

and contended that since the products of the parties fall in the same

class, confusion amongst consumers was bound to arise, and hence

declined to grant relief of injunction. The trial court also observed

that the defendants admitted in their cross examination that the

plaintiffs were the prior users and adopters of the trademark, as

such also not entitled for the relief. It also dismissed the defendants

claim for damages for defamation.
</p>
<p id="p_117">
</p><p id="p_118">18.    Aggrieved by the dismissal of the said suits, the plaintiffs

preferred the present appeals contending that the trial court

committed grave error in interpreting <a href="/doc/876933/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> of the Act that if a

manufacturer was found to be prior user of a mark, irrespective of

whether he had registration or not for his mark, the registered

proprietor could not interfere with the use of the similar mark. The

interpretation of the trial court was contrary to the settled law. To

avail the defence of prior use, the defendant must prove about its

use before the plaintiffs&#x27; use or registration, whichever was earlier.

The defendants&#x27; use of the mark should have been before the

registration of PepsiCo&#x27;s Trade Mark. The trial court proceeded on

an erroneous basis in holding that the plaintiff&#x27;s did not hold the

title of &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; exclusively (with no limitation or

disclaimer). The defendants had not denied that PepsiCo Inc. had

prior registration and his application seeking cancellation of the

registered Trade mark of PepsiCo Inc. had been dismissed, hence

there was absolutely no basis for the findings of the trial court to

the contrary.
</p>
<p id="p_119">
18.1.   The trial court failed to appreciate that the plaintiffs had

beyond reasonable doubt established their transborder reputation in

the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; and that it had spilled over to India

much before the defendants&#x27; alleged use of an identical Mark

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in the year 2000. The trial court had misdirected

itself in failing to appreciate the plethora of documents exhibited by

the plaintiffs in respect of their claim.
</p>
<p id="p_120">
18.2. As per <a href="/doc/759423/" id="a_5">Section 124</a> (4) of the Act, the findings of Intellectual

Property Appellate Board (IPAB) were binding on the civil court.

The trial court disregarded the findings of the IPAB solely on the

ground that they were challenged before the Madras High Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                       31</span>

which was impermissible. IPAB gave its findings after considering

the pleadings and evidence filed by both the parties. The IPAB was

an expert quasi-judicial body presided over by a retired High Court

Judge; IPAB did not hold summary enquiry under <a href="/doc/395727/" id="a_6">Section 92</a> of the

Act. IPAB had been conferred powers to receive and scrutinise

evidence and examine witnesses like a civil court.              It was the

defendant who approached the IPAB in the hope of getting a

favourable outcome, but once IPAB&#x27;s ruling came adverse to it, the

defendant completely avoided it. <a href="/doc/759423/" id="a_7">Section 124</a> (4) of the Act would

require the trial court to dispose of the suit in confirmity with

IPAB&#x27;s order.          Instead of adopting the findings, the trial court

conducted a de novo examination of all the issues which were

subject matter before IPAB; the same was contrary to the ruling of

the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/38601623/" id="a_8">Patel Field Marshal Agencies v. PM

Diesels Ltd</a>.1 case. The defendant could not have raised the issues

already decided by IPAB by virtue of doctrine of issue estoppel.

The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court had categorically held that estoppel

bars parties from raising the same dispute in a different proceeding.

18.3.   The trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in holding that

registrations for the Mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in favour of the

plaintiffs were not absolute and would not confer exclusive rights

in India.       The plaintiffs had unconditional and unqualified

registration in India. The trial court erred in looking at the U.S.

Trade Mark registration of 1948 but not of the Indian Trade Mark

registration. If the trial court was looking at the U.S. Trade Mark

register, it ought to have looked at the plaintiff&#x27;s registration of

1966 having no disclaimer at all and not the 1948 Hartman&#x27;s

registration. From 1966 onwards, the U.S. Trade Mark register

would show the plaintiff as exclusive owner without any

disclaimer.
</p>
<p id="p_121">
18.4.   The trial court wrongly held that since the mark &quot;Mountain

Dew&quot; was used in all walks of life, plaintiff&#x27;s had no exclusive

right over the mark. Once registration for &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; Trade

Mark was granted after an elaborate process, it had to be presumed

that the Trade Mark had become distinctive and was not customary

to the trade.     The only remedy for defendant to challenge the

registration was by filing a rectification application. The defendant

was estopped from challenging the distinctiveness of the mark

when he himself had sought for registration of the mark.


18.5.   Trade Mark holders were not required to go after all the

infringers who might not be affecting their business.                  Even

otherwise, use of plaintiff&#x27;s Trade Mark by other third-parties

would not give a right to the defendant to use the plaintiff&#x27;s mark

without authorisation. When the other entities had infringed the

plaintiff&#x27;s mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; on a commercial scale and

harmed its business, the plaintiff successfully restrained them. The

trial court wrongly held that defendant was a prior user, placing

reliance on Exs.B.1 to B.4. However, Exs.B.1 to B.4 would not

show the use of defendant from the year 2000. The evidence would

show that the defendant admittedly obtained license for its

beverages in the year 2002. Its illegal sales could not form the

basis to assert its prior use. The defendant had not produced any

document to establish the use of the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; for the

Financial Years 2000-01 and 2001-02.          Admittedly, defendant

failed to produce Income Tax Returns, Sales Tax Returns, VAT

Returns, Balance-Sheet, etc. for the said financial years. &#x27;Prior use&#x27;

must be substantial prior use and not sporadic prior use. Small

amounts of sale in the market should not be treated as &#x27;prior use&#x27;.

In view of IPAB orders, the plaintiffs were not required to adduce

additional evidence over and above the IPAB order.             The trial

court&#x27;s findings were inconsistent. The trial court dismissed the

defendant&#x27;s passing off action on the ground that plaintiff was the

prior user and adopter and dismissed the plaintiff&#x27;s suit by holding

that defendant was the &#x27;prior user&#x27;. The said findings of the trial

court would contradict one another.

<p id="p_122">
</p><p id="p_123">19.    Though O.S.No.19 of 2004 filed by the defendants was

dismissed, plaintiffs contended that the trial court erroneously held

Issue No.1 in favour of the defendants that they were prior users of

the mark and fell in grave error of law in holding that the

defendants were prior users of the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in

complete ignorance of the prior statutory rights of the plaintiffs.

Much prior to the filing of the above suits, Courts in India had

acknowledged the goodwill and reputation of plaintiffs in the mark

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in India. Besides, the plaintiffs held Trade Mark

registration for the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in over 100 countries

world-wide. The mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; had been aggressively

marketed and received unsolicited media attention world-wide in

newspapers having circulation in India, besides being available on

the internet which would clearly evidence that the mark &quot;Mountain

Dew&quot; was selling not only intentionally but also in India prior to

the defendants alleged adoption and use in the year 2000.


19.1.   The trial court erred in not taking into consideration several

news articles published in reputed newspapers and magazines such

as Business Standard, Financial Times, Time Magazine, Business

Week, The Economic Times and USA Today, which reported the

plaintiff&#x27;s growing sales, success and popularity for decades and

reputation in the well-known mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot;. The trial

court erred in accepting the defendants claim for use of the mark

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; since 2000, as they did not start manufacturing

packaged drinking water since 2000 and were supplying bulk water

by tankers and not in packaged bottles. The trial court failed to

appreciate that the cross-examination of DW.1 would reveal that

receipt from the supply of water was purportedly Rs.3,75,000/-

compared to receipt of Rs.17,15,206/- from supply through lorries.

It was evident that principle business of defendant was supply of

water through lorries rather than packaged drinking water

throughout. As per the admissions of DW.1 he was not in the

business of packaged drinking water until March, 2003, whereas

the plaintiffs launched their products in India on 17.01.2003. The

invoices exhibited by the defendant pertain to supply of bulk water

presumably through lorries. The invoices for the years 2000-02

would not even mention the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in the product

description. Hence, it could not be said that defendant commenced

use of the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; prior to plaintiff&#x27;s Trade Mark

registration.

the undisputed facts are that the trade mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; was

coined by M/s.Hartman Beverages in the year 1948 and was

assigned to the plaintiffs Pepsi Co Incorporation in the year 1964

and had been continuously used by Pepsi Co since then. In India

Pepsi Co Incorporation registered the word mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;

under Trade Mark No.436257 on 09.04.1985 in Class 32 covering

&quot;soft drinks, beverages and syrups and concentrates for the

preparation thereof&quot; and registered &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; Logo under

Trade Mark No.444078 on 08.10.1985 in Class 32 covering &quot;non-

alcoholic syrups, concentrates and bases used in the preparations of

such beverages&quot;. Pepsi Co introduced &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in India in

January, 2003. Pepsi Co commenced production of their product

&#x27;Aqua Fina&#x27; in India in October 2002. Magfast commenced its

business and production of packaged drinking water under the mark

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; in the year 2000.
</p>
<p id="p_132">
</p><p id="p_133">24.    Learned counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs contended that

Pepsi Co had unconditional and unqualified registration in India.

There were no disclaimers entered in the register at the time of

registration of the trade mark in India. The Trial Court did not

consider the binding nature of the Intellectual Property Appellate

Board (IPAB) order. The findings of IPAB were        binding on the

Civil Court. The Trial Court erred in not considering the same. The

observations of the Trial Court in dismissing both the suits filed by

Pepsi Co and Magfast holding that the other party was the prior

user was diametrically opposite to each other and one would strike

out the other. The Trial Court wrongly held that Magfast was a

prior user. The finding of the Trial Court that Magfast was

protected under Section 34 of the Trade Mark Act, 1999, was

erroneous. The trade mark was available for allied and cognate

goods which would flow through the same trade channels. The

Trial Court failed to recognize the transborder reputation of Pepsi

Co trade mark of &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in India and failed to observe

the dishonest adoption of mark by Magfast. The Court ought to

have granted injunction when a trade mark was dishonestly adopted

and prayed to allow the appeals filed by them.


</p><p id="p_134">25.    The main contention of the learned counsel for the

respondents/defendants was that Pepsi Co never claimed the mark

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; to be a creation or invention by themselves.

Admittedly, Hartman Beverages was the erstwhile owner of the

mark and predecessors in interest of Pepsi Co. Even they never

claimed to have created the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot;. But, infact

made a disclaimer at the time of registration of the trade mark in

USA to the effect that &quot;exclusive use of the words &quot;Mountain Dew&quot;

was not claimed apart from the rest of the mark&quot;. When Hartman

Beverages had not claimed any exclusive use of the mark, Pepsi Co

could not have acquired anything more than the rights held by their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                   42</span>

predecessors. Admittedly, there were innumerable users of the

mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in various walks of life in USA even in

1940 and today, as such Hartman beverages being conscious of the

said fact had specifically given the said disclaimer. Pepsi Co, who

registered the mark in 1985 admittedly never manufactured the

product &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; or sold the same in India till January

2003. Even the manufacturing of the product &quot;Aqua Fina&quot; relating

to which infringement of copy right was claimed by Pepsi Co, on

the basis of alleged similarities in the label by use of the colours

white and blue and depiction of &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; was not

commenced until October, 2002. As such Magfast, who

commenced its business and production of packaged drinking water

under the mark Mountain Dew in the year 2000 itself was a prior

user and hence entitled to the relief of passing off.

Thus a trade mark can be registered subject to any conditions or

limitations as laid down under <a href="/doc/24182/" id="a_18">Section 30(i)(a)</a> of the Act.


</p><p id="p_151">30.        Under <a href="/doc/1697073/" id="a_19">Section 17</a> of the Act, the Registrar can enter a

disclaimer in the register if the trade mark contains any matter

was in use since 1948 and was coined by their predecessors in title.

The Hartman&#x27;s 1948 registration expired long ago. Hartman&#x27;s

registration was not even in the US Trade Mark register. Infact,

even in USA Pepsi Co holds registration for the trademark

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; under Trade Mark No.820362, dated 13.12.1966

without any disclaimer or conditions. As such, the mark &quot;Mountain

Dew&quot; acquired distinctiveness since it was used from 1948

onwards. Pepsi Co has got word mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; registration

without any disclaimer. Once the concerned US authorities granted

registration without any disclaimer, it was admitted that the

concerned authorities were satisfied with the requirements of

distinctiveness of the mark. Magfast cannot challenge the US

registration in the present proceedings and seek evidence to

produce before the US Trade Marks Office about distinctiveness.

Pepsi Co filed suit based on Magfast&#x27;s infringement of Pepsi Co

Trade Mark No.436257 registered in India, which registration does

not have any disclaimer or conditions attached thereto. Therefore,

the Trial Court ought not to have gone into the disclaimer of the

Hartman&#x27;s registration.

</p><p id="p_158">32.         This Court also agrees with the argument of the learned

counsel for the appellants i.e., Pepsi Co, as the registration of the

Trade Mark No.436257 was not having any disclaimer. Though

<a href="/doc/1697073/" id="a_20">Section 17</a> of the Act gives power to the Registrar to record a

disclaimer, no such disclaimer was recorded by the Registrar while

registering the trade mark of Pepsi Co in India. There is no such

thing as an implied disclaimer and this Court cannot read a

disclaimer which was not recorded in the register. It is a settled law

that absence of disclaimer means exclusive use. <a href="/doc/536420/" id="a_21">In Skol Breweries

           produced by the Defendants along with the further Affidavit of the
           said Kolambe dated 10th January, 2005 in respect of Application
           No.941704 in respect of &quot;Haywards 5000&quot; advertised before
           acceptance. The Registrar had suggested disclaimer in respect of

      numeral &quot;5000&quot;. Thus, whenever there is a disclaimer in respect of a
      numeral the reference is specifically made. In the instant case i.e.
      the mark which is registered, there is no such disclaimer in respect
      of the numeral &quot;5000&quot; and disclaimer is for descriptive words which
      obviously are &quot;strong beer&quot;. In any event, the plaintiffs have by their
      letters dated 20-3-2003 objected to the disclaimer in the matter of
      the Plaintiffs&#x27; another application No.940878 in class 32 which are
      to be found at page 9 of the Affidavit of Sonali Chanda dated 20-1-

<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      13. Now, if in the light of these rival submissions the record of the
      case is perused, it becomes clear that the trade-mark of the
      Petitioner &quot;HAYWARDS 5000&quot; is a registered trade-mark. Perusal
      of the registration show that numeral 5000&quot; is not disclaimed. What
      is disclaimed is the descriptive material on the label. Whenever
      numeral in the label or trade mark is disclaimed, it is clear from the
      material available on record that it was specifically so mentioned
      and. therefore, in my opinion, it is clear from the material available
      on record that so far as the registration of the label of
      &quot;HAYWARDS 5000&quot; is concerned, the numeral has not been
      disclaimed and, therefore, in view of the registration of the trade-
      mark and the label, the plaintiffs will have a statutory right to
      prevent the Defendants from using a deceptively similar mark. In so
      far as the question whether the numeral is an essential part of the
      label is concerned, perusal of the judgment of this Court in Notice
      of Motion No.1259 of 1994 in the case of Shaw Wallace &amp;
      Company Ltd. vs. Castle Douglas Industries Ltd. and anr., dated 20-
      6-1996 shows that in that case the rade-mark involved was
      &quot;HAYWARDS 2000&quot;. In that case the numeral &quot;2000&quot; was
      specifically disclaimed, still the court held that the said numeral was
      an essential part of the trade mark of the Plaintiff. In view of the
      judgment of this court referred to above, in my opinion, it cannot be
      said in the present case that the numeral &quot;&quot;5000&quot; is not an essential
      part of the trade-mark of the Plaintiff and is not associated
      exclusively with the Plaintiffs.&quot;

therefore Pepsi Co did not have exclusive rights over it. &quot;Mountain

Dew&quot; trade mark was common to the trade and therefore any one

could use it and Pepsi Co did not have exclusivity. IPAB had not

accepted the said contentions raised by Magfast and held that

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; trade mark was a distinctive trade mark. The

liberal meaning of &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; had nothing to do with the

products for which it was used. Therefore, it was not descriptive of

the products being sold thereunder. Distinctiveness of the mark

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; was beyond doubt since it was used throughout

the world over a long period of time, since 1940. &quot;Mountain Dew&quot;

was a unique combination of words that had gained popularity.

already decided by IPAB order, the Civil Court i.e., District Court

ought to have accepted the reasoning of IPAB that Pepsi Co was

exclusive owner of the trade mark Mountain Dew and Magfast had

no right to use the same for their business. But the Trial Court went

wrong in holding that registration of the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in

favour of Pepsi Co was not absolute and did not confer exclusive

rights in India. <a href="/doc/1758115/" id="a_30">Section 124(4)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999,

</p><p id="p_173">40.   The learned counsel for the defendants contended that the

IPAB order had not become final as a writ petition was filed

challenging the same and it was pending before the Madras High

Court, but the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_32">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 does not

provide for an appeal against IPAB order. Just because a writ

petition was filed by Magfast, which was pending since 2005, it

could not be a reason for Magfast to urge that till the time the writ

petition is decided, Pepsi Co cannot claim exclusivity. <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_33">Section 124</a>

of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 does not stipulate that the Trial Court

had to wait till all the remedies against the IPAB order were

exhausted. Therefore Magfast could not assert that since the writ

petition was pending against the IPAB order, Pepsi Co could not

rely upon the findings of the IPAB. Magfast could not argue in

these proceedings about the correctness of the IPAB order, as it

itself raised all the issues regarding validity of Pepsi Cos. trade

that Magfast had filed an application in January 2003, to register

the trade mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot;, but the Registrar objected to

register the same as the mark proposed was identical or deceptively

similar with previously registered marks of Pepsi Co and Magfast

failed to state so in its written statement in the Suit which would

amount to suppression of material facts. He further contended that

when Magfast itself sought for registration of the mark, it was

was apparent that the mark &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; had been in public

domain since 16th century as Irish whisky, Korean Tea etc., as

beverages. The lame attempt on the part of Pepsi Co on the basis of

their 1966 registration under Clause 2(f) of the Trade Mark

applicable in USA could not lead to a conclusion that the effect of

disclaimer stood waived especially in view of the settled legal

principle that in the absence of pleadings any amount of evidence

was no evidence in law; PW2 admitted reference of Winchester and

West Jefferson producing the same product &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; citrus

soda and &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; being used in every walk of life for

whisky, tea as beverages and other business entities.

</p><p id="p_180">45.   But PW2, the Pespsi Co&#x27;s Legal Attorney since 1986 and its

Assistant Secretary since 2000 and Global Beverage Intellectual

Property Counsel denied the suggestion of Magfast that in USA,

the word &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; was being used in all walks of life. She

stated that she was not aware of any third party using &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27; as trade name or a product name in USA. She stated that

Pepsi Co investigated several such instances, for example,

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; cottages and similar unrelated goods and services

and had not elected to sue them as they were not worth it.


</p><p id="p_181">46.   Learned counsel for the defendants argued that both PWs.1

and 2 admitted Winchester and Jefferson using &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;

trade mark in US. Hence Pepsi Co did not have an exclusive right

even in US. But the learned counsel for the appellants submitted

that Winchester and West Jefferson were merely bottlers and

distributors of Pepsi Co&#x27;s, &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;, citrus soda, they were

not manufacturing their own citrus soda and they had absolutely no

rights over the &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; mark; as Magfast had not taken the

said plea in its written statement there was no occasion for Pepsi Co

to produce the agreements or deals with the said Companies before

the trial court and their use of mark was not against the interest of

the Pepsi Co; mere fact that Pepsi Co trade mark was being used in

other walks of life (whisky, Korean tea, etc.,) would not take away

its distinctive character or bar Pepsi Co from seeking injunction

against infringers; use of Pepsi Co trade mark by third parties

would not give right to the Magfast to use the Pepsi Co&#x27;s mark

without authorization; Trade mark holders were not required to go

after all the infringers, who might not be affecting their business;

none of the above examples pertain to drinking water or other

goods which were allied and cognate to &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; citrus

soda; no evidence was adduced by the defendants to prove that

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; had been put to extensive use by any of these

users or that their products were being used on a commercial scale.


</p><p id="p_182">47.   DW1 in his cross examination admitted that packaged

drinking water and soft drinks were sold in the same shops. Both

soft drinks and packaged drinking water are allied and cognate

goods. The consumer base and trade channels for soft drinks and

packaged drinking water are also the same. These products are sold

across the same counter and placed on the same shelfs in several

retail outlets. Thus, if soft drinks of the plaintiffs and packaged

drinking water of the defendants were sold under an identical mark

such as &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;, an unwary customer with average

intelligence is likely to consider that both the products were coming

from the same source i.e., Pepsi Co. The trial court dismissed the

suit filed by Magfast i.e., the defendants on the ground that Magfast

could not be allowed to approbate and reprobate as Magfast

contended in Pepsi Co suit that the products manufactured by Pepsi

Co and Magfast would fall in separate class and hence question of

confusion would not arise, whereas, in its own suit had taken an

opposite stand and contended that since the products of the parties

fell in the same class 32, confusion amongst consumers was bound

to arise.

that though Pepsi Company had registered the trade mark in 1985,

registration of trade mark without use was of no value.

</p><p id="p_221">62.    Learned counsel for the appellants on the other hand

contended that &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; trade mark was in use globally and

became popular since long time, it was having transborder

reputation; the goodwill or reputation could not be extinguished

merely because the goods were not available in the country. While

deciding prior use, global use had to be taken into account. Pepsi

Co&#x27;s global advertisement, sales and registration over 100 countries

under &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; mark were sufficient to establish its prior

use.

the trade mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; since the year 2000, the onus is on

Magfast to show that he was a prior user. Magfast had to

demonstrate sales from the year 2000 by showing sales figures for

each year in the name of &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; and such sales should be

substantial and not sporadic. DW1 had relied upon Ex.B1 to B4 to

show that Magfast was a prior user. Ex.B1 is a news article dated

08.11.2000 from &#x27;Siyasat&#x27; urdu daily newspaper. Ex.B1 would only

in part of Hyderabad and had no electronic presence prior to the

year 2004. Ex.B2 was a certificate given by the Manager of Central

Bank of India, Chatta Bazar, Hyderabad, dated 29.07.2003. Ex.B2

would only show that Magfast was availing credit facility. It is also

not proof of prior sales. The said certificate is dated July, 2003 i.e.,

after filing of the suit and much after Pepsi Co had commenced its

sales. It would not prove actual use of the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; in

relation to packaged drinking water. Ex.B3 was a certificate of

registration as a Small Scale Industry issued by the General

Manager, District Industries Center, Hyderabad, dated 14.06.2001.

There was no reference of &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; in the said certificate

</p><p id="p_226">64.    DW1 in his cross examination admitted that he obtained

Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) license in the year 2002. Learned

counsel for the appellants contended that under Rule 49(28) of the

Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1958, framed under

<a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_49">Prevention of Food Adulteration Act</a>, 1957, obtaining the BIS

license for manufacturing packaged drinking water is mandatory.

Magfast did not obtain license under the <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_50">Prevention of Food

Adulteration Act</a> in the year 2000, even though the same was

mandatory. Infact the BIS license was obtained by Magfast only on

11.06.2002. Any sales of packaged drinking water prior to 2002

without BIS registration was violative of Prevention of Food

Adulteration Rules, 1955. Under Prevention of Food Adulteration

Rules, Magfast was required to not only register the name of

manufacturer but also the brand. However, 2002 BIS registration

filed by Magfast would not reflect the registration of any brand. In

the absence of registration of the brand name Magfast could not

have legally sold drinking water under the &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; brand.

As such the claim of Magfast that they were selling &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27; packaged drinking water from 2000 is belied and secondly

stated the details of the sales of its products and its expenditure in

its business for the said years in any of its pleadings or evidence.

Magfast filed sales figures only for the financial year 2002-2003

showing an amount of Rs.3.75 lakhs of sales. Out of total sales of

Rs.20,00,000/- sale of water through lorry tankers was shown as

Rs.17,15,206/-   and    sale   of    packaged   drinking      water         as

Rs.3,75,000/-. Thus over 85% of the sale of water by Magfast is

through lorry tankers and not through packaged drinking water. The

invoices provided by Magfast only prove sale of drinking water

through lorries and not &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; branded packaged drinking

water. The same was evident from the quantity of water supplied

and the rate/price thereof mentioned in the invoices. Some of the

invoices would show sale of packaged drinking water by Magfast

during May 2000, whereas Magfast&#x27;s own case was that it launched

was prior user and adopter of trade mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; globally.

Pepsi Co contended that the public were well aware that the mark

Mountain Dew belonged to Pepsi Co. The total sales under the said

mark would run into billions of dollars and Pepsi Co. would spend

approximately 15 million US dollars per annum on the

advertisement and promotion of &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; brand. The global

annual sales of the trade mark was approximately 7 billion dollars.

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; represented nearly 10% of Pepsi world wide sales

and almost 17% of the sales in United States. The Mountain Dew

drink ranked sixth only next to Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, Diet Coke,

Dr.Pepper and Diet Pepsi in its world wide sales in United States.

The plaintiffs &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; soda enjoyed almost 90% of the

citrus flavored carbonated soda market. The Trade Mark &#x27;Mountain

Dew&#x27; was registered in more than 100 countries including

Afghanistan, Bahrain, Gaza, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, West Bank,

Yemen, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Benelux, Botswana, Brazil,

Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,

magazines such as Business Standards, Financial Times, Time

Magazine, Business Week, the Economist, and USA Today. These

articles were published much before Magfast&#x27;s alleged use of mark

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; in 2000. They would refer to Pepsi Cos growing

sales, success and popularity for decades and reputation in the well-

known mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;. Online editions of these newspapers,

magazines etc. were accessible on the Internet. Besides, print

editions of the papers, magazines had also been in circulation in

India. The Trial Court erred in facts and law in not taking into

consideration the several news articles published in the reputed

newspapers and magazines and failed to take judicial notice of the

fact that India witnessed and continued to see the inflow and

outflow of expats and Indians travelling &#x27;to and from&#x27; other

countries. Such travellers were bound to be exposed to goods sold

under reputed trademarks and would carry such reputation back to

India.

PepsiCo&#x27;s reputation along with them. Infact DW1 admitted that

Hyderabad was a hub for IT Industry with several multinational

companies. Naturally, through visitors, Hyderabad would be

exposed to the product &quot;Mountain Dew.&quot; Magfast&#x27;s contention that

international newspapers were not circulated in India was palpably

false. It was only due to this global reputation that Pepsi was able to

generate sales of Rs.36 crores within four months of its launch of

dishonestly adopted.

<p id="p_246">
</p><p id="p_247">73.    Learned counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs contended that

Magfast had dishonestly adopted &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; trade mark of the

plaintiffs and the dishonesty in adoption of the mark was apparent

as there was no plausible explanation for Magfast to use the mark

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; which was identical to the well-known mark of

Pepsi Co except to gain from the appellants international

reputation. Magfast had alleged that it had coined and adopted the

word &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; in its additional evidence dated 22.04.2015.

However, the story about how Magfast had allegedly coined the

name &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; was false and merely an after thought; the

above plea of coining the trade mark was never set up in the plaint

in O.S.No.19 of 2004 filed by Magfast or Written Statement in

O.S.No.95 of 2004 or even in its first evidence affidavit dated

31.03.2011. Magfast had given no explanation in the said pleadings

as to how and why it adopted the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;. The Trial

Court even in its interim injunction order dated 04.10.2004

observed that Magfast had not come forth with any explanation as

to how and why it had adopted the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;. As an

attempt to overcome the above observation and as an after thought

without any pleading Magfast had set up a false story in its

additional evidence for adoption of its mark. It was settled law that

no evidence could be led on a fact or averment which had not been

pleaded. Therefore, the said part of Magfast evidence was liable to

be rejected and discarded. There was no explanation whatsoever as

to why the same was not pleaded by Magfast prior to filing the

additional evidence dated 22.04.2015.

raised the issue of non-distinctiveness. As IPAB had already

adjudicated on the said issue and gave its finding, hence even

though there was no response to the same, the same would not

affect the case of the plaintiffs.

<p id="p_252">
</p><p id="p_253">76.     Though Magfast claimed that it had coined the term

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; in the year 1999 as per Para 4 of the additional

evidence, the same was never pleaded for a period of 10 years since

the suit was filed. Though Magfast stated that it became aware of

the plaintiffs mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; only after filing the suit, from

the website of the Indian Trademark registry, Magfast being

informed about the plaintiffs registration on 03.04.2003 by the

Registry itself would disclose that it was a false claim made by the

defendants. Though DW1 claimed to have searched internet

meticulously to ensure that he did not copy any other brand or

search the record of the Registrar to find out whether the mark

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; subsisted on the register in someone else name.

Magfast could not be permitted to take advantage of their

negligence in not looking at the most relevant document to find out

whether the mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; was even available to them. It

was also inconceivable that Magfast&#x27;s alleged meticulous searches

would not have picked up the internationally well known mark

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; belonging to Pepsi Co.

admitted in his cross examination that before its commencement of

manufacturing the packaged drinking water under the mark

Mountain Dew in India, DW1 worked with Multi National

time; being an internationally famous mark which was available in

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; and use of the essential features of Aqua Fina

coincidence and evidences its malafide intention to mislead the

public and trade that its product was associated with the appellants

dishonestly adopted. He relied upon the judgment of the High

Court of Delhi in Tata sons limited vs. Manoj Dodia and others45,

launched). In his cross examination, DW1 took a stand that the said

advertisement was not even issued by him but by its distributor and

that he did not know the guest attending the inauguration ceremony

mentioned in the advertisement. All these would show the

dishonest adoption of mark by Magfast as such they were not

entitled to the relief of injunction in the suit filed by them.

false statements given by him as pointed above would prove that

Magfast had knowledge about the plaintiffs mark Mountain Dew

and DW1&#x27;s allegation that he became aware of Pepsi Co&#x27;s trade

mark Mountain Dew after filing of the suit by Pepsi Co is belied.

DW1 in his cross examination admitted that Pepsi Co was prior

user of the &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; mark. The said admission also would

prove the foremost ingredient of passing off i.e., prior use by Pepsi

Co. Magfast could not claim any right over the mark Mountain

Dew by its subsequent use, since Pepsi Co admittedly was the prior

user globally and were registered proprietors of the said trade mark

must be either prior to the registered holders use or prior to

registration in India since 1985 which was prior to the Magfast&#x27;s

alleged adoption of the mark Mountain Dew in 2000. Thus,

Magfast&#x27;s alleged use of Mountain Dew was 15 years after Pepsi

Co&#x27;s registration of Mountain Dew in India in 1985. In several

judgments it was held that if the use was prior to the registration

only then the benefit of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_69">Section 34</a> would be available to the prior

elongated manner. Moreover, the defendants had used identical

defendants use of the essential features of the Aqua Fina label and

label of the defendants which was different from that of plaintiffs

infringement of their copy rights on the ground that the defendants

could not have adopted the label of the plaintiffs in the year 2000,

when the plaintiffs had launched Aqua Fina in the year 2000. But

this observation appears to be erroneous, as the defendants failed to

place on record any label of their packaged drinking water

pertaining to the period 2000-2002. The bottles on record were

pertaining to June/July-2003 filed by the plaintiffs along with the

suit. Though Aqua Fina was launched in India in 2002, the product

was in global use by the date of its launch. Hence the observation

of the trial court that the defendants could not have adopted the

label of the plaintiffs is palpably wrong.

</p><p id="p_281">88.   As per Section 2(m) of the Copy Right Act, 1957, copy right

exists in relation to artistic work of the label also. The manner

of writing and the expressions used for describing the product are

also copied by the defendants without the permission of the owner

of the copy right. The reproduction of the work in any material

form or adopting the work would also fall under the ambit of

infringement of copy right in the work, within the meaning of

Section 51 of the Copy Right Act. A perusal of Section 51 of the

Copy Right Act would show that it shall be deemed that there shall

be infringement of the copy right when any person does anything,

when the exclusive right to do is conferred upon the owner of copy

right or any person makes sale of copies of such work by

infringement of the copy right in the said work. It is therefore

clear that the infringement shall be deemed when an exclusive

right as conferred upon the owner of the copy right was copied by

the infringers. Hence, the trial court went wrong in declining the

relief sought by the plaintiffs for infringement of their copy right.

<p id="p_283">      As the use of an identical mark or similar label is likely to

create confusion as to source and origin of the defendants product

&#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27;, such adoption and use would constitute a

misrepresentation in the course of trade to consumers, which was

likely to result in loss of goodwill and reputation of the plaintiffs.

As both the plaintiffs and defendants were also in the same

business of packaged water, the consumers might be confused into

believing that the product of the defendants also originated from the

plaintiffs. Such use would constitute acts of passing off and unfair

competition. The nature of the product was such that the same

would be picked up off the shelf without much deliberation. The

decision to purchase a product would be made at the point of

purchase and would be almost instantaneous. When the plaintiffs

and defendants products are kept together at the same counters and

shelves, the chances of confusion would be almost unavoidable as

it would be the case of triple identity pertaining to identical mark,

identical channel of purchase and identical customers, hence

passing off is inevitable.

manufactured both by the plaintiffs and defendants are for human

consumption and have a direct bearing on public health and

tarnishment of the image of the plaintiffs and as the consumers

might purchase the product of the defendants under the mistaken

impression, and if not satisfied with the quality, they would be

dissuaded from purchasing the plaintiffs other products also and

the use of an identical trade mark also constitutes blurring, it

amounts to dilution. Thus, the plaintiffs are also entitled for

permanent injunction restraining the defendants from passing off

their products as that of the plaintiffs, causing unfair competition

to them and diluting their image. In the result, point No.3 is also

they are also entitled for damages from the defendants for the

      As point No.5 is answered against the defendants, they are

not entitled for any damages as claimed by them. Hence point No.6

is also answered against the defendants.

<p id="p_292">94.    Point No.7: Whether the Trial Court committed any

error in dismissing the suits filed by both the parties?

</p><p id="p_293">      As the findings of the Trial Court are inconsistent and

dismissed both the suits filed by the plaintiffs as well as the

defendants holding that the other party was prior user, which is

basically wrong and the Trial Court committed error in considering

the unqualified and unconditional registration of the plaintiffs in

India and failed to consider the binding nature of the Intellectual

Property Appellate Board order under Section 124(4) of the Trade

Mark Act, 1999 and failed to appreciate the global popularity of the

registered Trade Mark &#x27;Mountain Dew&#x27; pertaining to the plaintiffs

in various countries and dismissed the suit filed by them seeking

permanent injunction by wrong appreciation of law and facts, it is

considered fit to set aside the judgment and decree passed by the

Trial Court in O.S.No.95 of 2004 and the findings of the Trial

Court on issue No.1 in O.S.No.19 of 2004 against the plaintiffs
