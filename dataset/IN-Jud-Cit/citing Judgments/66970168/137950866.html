Impugned Order


</pre><p id="p_10">3.            The Tribunal by the impugned Order herein, dated 17.01.2020,

allowed both the Original Applications and held that the procedure adopted

by Respondent UPSC and the Empanelment Committee for preparation of

the panel for the purpose of selection and appointment of DGP (HoPF) for

the State of Punjab is patently opposed to and is violative of the procedure

stipulated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its judgment dated 22.09.2006

titled "<a href="/doc/1090328/" id="a_2">Prakash Singh &amp; others v. Union of India &amp; others</a>" (2006) 8

SCC 1 and as a consequence of such findings, the recommendations dated

04.02.2019 of the Empanelment Committee and order dated 07.02.2019,

appointing Dinkar Gupta, IPS of the 1987 Batch, as DGP (HoPF) have been

set aside. The Respondent UPSC and the Empanelment Committee were

directed to prepare a panel of three senior-most officers, strictly in

accordance with the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Prakash

Singh's case (supra) with further directions to complete the exercise in this

behalf within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment.

In nutshell, the findings of the Tribunal in the Order dated 17.01.2020 (P-1)

are as under:

                Court in Prakash Singh's case (supra), the selection of DGP
                (HoPF) has to be made based on the three factors - the
                length of service; very good record and range of experience

the Hon'ble Supreme Court through its various orders in Parkash Singh's

case (supra) as well as UPSC Guidelines, the zone of consideration is of

officers

sending the list for dossier of officers eligible as per the Draft Guidelines

2009 for the empanelment of officers for post of DGP (HoPF), the UPSC

has responded that the State Governments are mandatorily asked by UPSC

zone of consideration and it is mandatory for the State Government to

recommend the name of all officers who fulfill the requirement of eligibility

(supra). In this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated

03.07.2018 directed merit &amp; seniority both to be given due weightage

and the said order was amended vide Hon'ble Supreme Court order

dated 13.03.2019, wherein, it was directed that recommendation of

appointment to the post of DGP (HoPF) by UPSC should be purely on

the basis of merit. The eligible officers recommended for empanelment as

DGP (HoPF) are arranged in the panel as per inter-se seniority in the IPS

Cadre. All eligible officers are considered by UPSC/ Empanelment

Committee to eliminate abuse of discrimination and to ensure that no officer

in the zone of consideration is excluded. The range of experience is

consequently enlarged to have the widest pool of talent available for the

selection in order to avoid retracting from judgment of Prakash Singh's

case (supra) and subsequent orders dated 03.07.2018 &amp; 13.03.2019.

<p id="p_79">15.             Union Public Service Commission


         i.     The impugned order dated 17.01.2020 is structured by the
                false assumptions that Draft Guidelines 2009 issued by
                UPSC pursuant to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
                Court in Parkash Singh's case (supra) are non-est being in
                contravention of the judgment. In this regard, submission is
                supported by the fact that Supreme Court has adverted to
                these guidelines in its orders and UPSC has enforced these
                guidelines uniformly in all appointments of DGP across the
                country in last 11 years.

                sources and different backgrounds from relevant field.
         iii.   As per the UPSC, the Tribunal has passed the impugned
                decision dated 17.01.2020 on complete misreading of
                judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Parkash Singh's case

              Assessment Sheets are the internal working sheets where
              such deliberations are made. It is argued that the argument
              that there are no reasons given for the assessment /
              empanelment of officers is also flawed as no reasons are
              required to be given towards the assessment and
              empanelment of one officer over the other officer.
      viii.   It is argued that the Draft Guidelines-2009 are 'sui generis'
              as the same are the modalities framed towards
              implementing the broad parameters laid by the Hon'ble
              Supreme Court in Prakash Singh's case (supra) in the
              directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court under

              empanelling the officers for the post of DGP (HoPF) and
              checks and balances have been created in the Draft
              Guidelines -2009.
</p><p id="p_84">      ix.     Mr Aman Lekhi, the Ld Senior Counsel has argued that it is
              nobody's case that the Draft Guidelines are bad, rather a
              comparison is drawn by the Private Respondents /
              Applicants in OAs that as per the Draft Guidelines 2009 and
              the Core Policing Areas, they are better in comparison to the
              empanelled Officers and are projecting the arguments as it
              suits them as per the situation for and against the Draft
              Guidelines.
</p><p id="p_85">      x.      The findings of the Tribunal are also flawed on the ground
              that the Tribunal assumed that 'seniority' is the genesis for
              empanelment of Officers for appointment as DGP (HoPF)
              whereas the judgment in Prakash Singh's case (supra) read
              with the various orders in the IA therein shows the stress on
              'merit' with due regard to 'seniority'.
</p><p id="p_86">      xi.     The Tribunal has completely ignored the Order dated
              16.01.2019 passed in the IA filed by the State of Punjab in
              Prakash Singh's case (supra) wherein satisfaction regarding
              the procedure for empanelment through the Committee
              adopted by the UPSC is recorded by the Hon'ble Supreme
              Court.
</p><p id="p_87">      xii.    It is held by the Tribunal also that no malafides is pleaded or
              made out in the case and there is no foundation and basis
              for bias made out or pleaded in the case.
</p><p id="p_88">      xiii.   There is no basis or foundation that the criteria adopted by
              way of Core Policing Areas so adopted by the Empanelment
              Committee are tailor made and that the SIT report so relied
              has no relevance and concern with the Empanelment
              Committee meeting.
</p><p id="p_89">      xiv.    It is lastly contended that there are inherent contradictions in
              the impugned judgment dated 17.01.2020 which leaves to
              the conclusion that proper reasoning is missing in the
              judgment and conclusions have been reached without any

             Government or the Central Government running counter to
             the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court are kept in
             abeyance. In view of the above, the Punjab Police Act, 2007
             and / or the DOPT Rules &amp; Regulations were not be
             applicable in context of appointment of DGP (HoPF).
      ii.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Parkash Singh's case (supra)
             has observed that it has power to exercise jurisdiction under
             <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_10">Article 32</a> read with <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_11">Article 142</a> <a href="/doc/1799967/" id="a_12">&amp; 144</a> of the Constitution of

             the new legislation is enacted by the State Governments. In
             this regard, reliance is placed on Para 29 of Parkash Singh's
             judgment (2006) 8 SCC 1.

             performed by UPSC or the State PSC as respects the
             service of the Union or the State. It was in this context
             reference is made to the UPSC Guidelines as no enactment

</p><p id="p_93">      v.     In the background of the aforestated legal submissions, the
             State of Punjab has contended that they have strictly
             complied with the guidelines of the UPSC and in reference
             thereto the State of Punjab has sent information with respect
             to all officers falling within the zone of consideration as
             defined in Para 2 of the UPSC Guidelines without leaving
             any eligible candidate. It is submitted by the State of Punjab
             that the finding of the tribunal that 12 names were forwarded
             with anticipation of a panel of 06 names is completely
             erroneous and relies on letter dated 19.01.2019 sent by
             State of Punjab to the UPSC demonstrating that the State
             had sent the names, Bio-data, ACRs of all such officers who
             were fulfilling the rank criteria being working in the rank of
             DGP/ ADGP, completed 30 years of service as per the
             seniority and gradation list of 01.01.2019. Regarding the
             argument in respect of panel of 06 officers sought by the
             State of Punjab it has been contended that the request for
             panel of 06 officers to be returned was made on the premise
             that since there were two sanctioned DGP Posts in Punjab,
             therefore, a panel of 06 names would be required. It is the
             stand of State of Punjab that there was no connection
             between the number of officers in the zone of consideration
             and the size of the panel and the same was only the
             presumption of the State that the size of the panel would be

             Ground XII and Para 8(Relief Sought) in OA
             No.60/199/CH/2019. In this regard, it is submitted that the

             affidavit before CAT that no criteria in nature of "Core
             Policing Areas" was at all considered by UPSC while on the
             other hand it is contended that the suitability of the

               alone has been appointed as President. On that premise, it
               is contended that it is extremely false to say that the UPSC

               procedure &amp; method adopted by UPSC. It is submitted that

                fit but thereafter on the parameters formulated by the
                Committee which are alien to the directions of the Hon'ble
                Supreme Court, the Respondent No.5 is declared unfit to be
                empanelled. Thus, it is contended that the criteria for
                assessment is alien to the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme
                Court which is formulated by the Empanelment Committee

                order, administration, investigation &amp; security is not borne

                and in any case before the dossiers of candidates are
                brought before the selection committee in order to eliminate

                committee on 19.01.2019 while only on 04.02.2019 the

                even in the short listing core policing areas, wherein, it is
                claimed that the Respondent No.5 is having much larger &amp;

Gupta are having links with drugs mafia and having benami properties that

the then DGP Suresh Arora became biased against Siddhartha

Chattopadhyay. In this context, Suresh Arora being member of

Empanelment Committee and having participated in empanelment of

Officers for DGP (HoPF) for State of Punjab in question caused prejudice to

Siddhartha Chattopadhyay.

<p id="p_105">19.2.       It is argued that the Punjab Specific Criteria was framed after

the dossiers were made available to the Empanelment Committee and have

been seen by them, whereas, the same is in contravention in law as the

criteria has to be framed prior to the last date for submission of application

for consideration by the Selection Committee. On the above basis it is

argued that the criteria laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Parkash

Singh's case (supra) has to be followed without any addition, wherein, the

merit &amp; seniority were to be given due weightage and if at all additional

criteria was to be framed, the same could be done before receipt of dossiers

of the 12 candidates and the said criteria has to be for all the states and

could not be applicable to the State of Punjab alone.

19.3.       It is argued that in case any criteria of Core Policing Areas had

been formulated the same was required to be mentioned in the Minutes of

19.4.       Another argument raised was that there are no reasons

forthcoming from the minutes for the rejection of Respondent No.5

the assessment sheets and the records of the meeting of the empanelment

committee to the Hon'ble Chairman of the CAT, are incorrect &amp; false and

as per the UPSC Guidelines and as per the letter dated 24.01.2019 issued by

Empanelment Committee pursuant to which the State Government directed

the DGP (HOPF) to be available for Empanelment Committee by the

favourable report, and had failed, he was estopped from raising the plea of

<p id="p_118">22.           Before adverting to the merit of the impugned Judgment dated

17.01.2020 passed by the Tribunal, it is necessary to consider the law settled

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court regarding the scope of judicial review under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_39">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_40">/227</a> of the Constitution of India for the issuance of the Writ of

      (b)    exceed their jurisdiction or

      (c)     fail to exercise their jurisdiction or

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">      " 7.   The question about the limits of the jurisdiction of High
      Courts in issuing a writ of certiorari under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_42">Article 226</a> has been
      frequently considered by this Court and the true legal position in
      that behalf is no longer in doubt. A writ of certiorari can be issued
      for correcting errors of jurisdiction committed by inferior courts
      or Tribunals: these are cases where orders are passed by inferior
      courts or tribunals without jurisdiction, or is in excess of it, or as
      a result of failure to exercise jurisdiction. A writ can similarly be
      issued where in exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it, the
      Court or Tribunal acts illegally or properly, as for instance, it
      decides a question without giving an opportunity, be heard to the
      party affected by the order, or where the procedure adopted in
      dealing with the dispute is opposed to principles of natural justice.
      There is, however, no doubt that the jurisdiction to issue a writ of
      certiorari is a supervisory jurisdiction and the Court exercising it is
      not entitled to act as an appellate Court. This limitation necessarily
      means that findings of fact reached by the inferior Court or Tribunal
      as result of the appreciation of evidence cannot be reopened or
      questioned in writ proceedings. An error of law which is apparent
      on the face of the record can be corrected by a writ, but not an
      error of fact, however grave it may appear to be. In regard to a
      finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal, a writ of certiorari can
      be issued if it is shown that in recording the said finding, the
      Tribunal had erroneously refused to admit admissible and
      material evidence, or had erroneously admitted inadmissible
      evidence     which    has    influenced   the    impugned     finding.</blockquote><p id="p_120">

      recorded by the Tribunal cannot be challenged in proceedings for a
      writ of certiorari on the ground that the relevant and material
      evidence adduced before the Tribunal was insufficient or
      inadequate to sustain the impugned finding. The adequacy or
      sufficiency of evidence led on a point and the inference of fact to be
      drawn from the said finding are within the exclusive jurisdiction of
      the Tribunal, and the said points cannot be agitated before a writ
      Court. It is within these limits that the jurisdiction conferred on the
      High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_43">Article 226</a> to issue a writ of certiorari can be
      legitimately exercised (vide <a href="/doc/1450722/" id="a_44">Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad
      Ishaque</a>[(1955) 1 SCR 1104] <a href="/doc/568069/" id="a_45">Nagandra Nath Bora v. Commissioner

                                               Emphasis supplied

It was thus laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the jurisdiction to issue a

writ of certiorari is a supervisory one and in exercising it, the High Court is

not entitled to act as a Court of Appeal. An error of law apparent on the face

of the record could be corrected by a writ of certiorari, but not an error of

fact, unless it is shown that in recording the said finding, the Tribunal had

erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence or had

erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence which has influenced the

impugned finding or where a finding of fact is based on no evidence. In the

above circumstances, the error of fact will be regarded as an error of law

which can be corrected by a writ of certiorari.
</p>
<p id="p_122">             It is in this context that that difference between an "Appeal"

and "Judicial Review" assumes significance wherein an 'appeal' is

continuation of the original proceedings and is concerned with the merits of

the case and requires examination of the correctness of the findings of both

fact and law while 'Judicial review' is concerned with the validity of the

order than the merits of the case.</p><pre id="pre_11">

</pre><p id="p_123">22.2.       The grounds on which interference by the High Court is

available in writ petitions have by now been well established. <a href="/doc/1959866/" id="a_47">In Basappa v.

Nagappa</a>, 1955 SCR 250, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has

observed that a writ of certiorari is generally granted when a Court has acted

without or in excess of its jurisdiction. It is available in those cases where

a tribunal, though competent to enter upon an enquiry, acts in flagrant

disregard of the rules of procedure or violates the principles of natural

justice where no particular procedure is prescribed. But a mere wrong

decision cannot be corrected by a writ of certiorari as that would be using it

as the cloak of an appeal in disguise but a manifest error apparent on the

face of the proceedings based on a clear ignorance or disregard of the

provisions of law or absence of or excess of jurisdiction, when shown,

can be so corrected.

        it could be issued. The question has been considered by this

        correcting errors of jurisdiction, as when an inferior Court
        or Tribunal acts without jurisdiction or in excess of it, or
        fails to exercise it. (2) 'Certiorari' will also be issued when the

     choose to confer a right of appeal against that decision, it
     would be defeating its purpose and policy if a superior Court
     were to re-hear the case on the evidence, and substitute its
     own findings in 'certiorari." These propositions are well settled
     and and not in dispute.
</p><p id="p_129">     (4)    The further question on which there has been some
     controversy is whether a writ can be issued, when the decision of
     the inferior Court or Tribunal is erroneous in law. This question
     came    up   for   consideration        in-   'Rex   v.   Northumberland
     Compensation Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Shaw', 1951-1 KB711
     , and it was held that when a Tribunal made a "speaking order" and
     the reasons given in that order in support of the decision were bad
     in law, 'certiorari' could be granted. It was pointed out by Lord
     Goddard, C. J. that that had always been understood to be the true
     scope of the power. (1878) 4 AC 30, and - 'Rex v. Nat Bell
     Liquors Ld', 1922-2 AC 128 , were quoted in support of this view.
     In 1878-4 AC 30, Lord Cairns L. C. observed as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">            " If there was upon the face of the order of the court of
            quarter sessions anything which showed that that order was
            erroneous, the Court of Queen's Bench might be asked to
            have the order brought into it, and to look at the order, and
            view it upon the face of it, and if the court found error upon
            the face of it, to put an end to its existence by quashing it "
</blockquote><p id="p_130">     In 1922-2 AC 128, Lord Summer said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">            " That supervision goes to two points; one is the area of the
            inferior jurisdiction and the qualifications and conditions of its
            exercise; the other is the observance of the law in the course
            of its exercise ".
</blockquote><p id="p_131">     The decision in 1951-1 KB 711, was taken in appeal, and was
     affirmed by the Court of Appeal in -'Rex v. Northumberland
     Compensation Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Shaw', 952-1 KB 338. In
     laying down that an error of law was a ground for granting certiorari'
     the learned Judges emphasised that it must be apparent on the
     face of the record. Denning, L. J. who stated the power in broad
     and general terms observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">            "It will have been seen that throughout all the cases there is

           the record."
</blockquote><p id="p_132">     The position was thus summed up by, Morris, L. J. :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_67">           " It is plain that certiorari' will not issue as the cloak of an
           appeal in disguise. It does not lie in order to bring an order or
           decision for rehearing of the issue raised in the proceedings.
           It exists to correct error of law 'where revealed on the face of
           an order or decision', or irregularity, or absence of, or excess
           of, jurisdiction where shown."
</blockquote><p id="p_133">     In AIR 1952 Supreme Court 192, it was observed by this Court that under
     <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_56">Article 226</a> the writ should be issued,
           " in grave cases where the subordinate tribunals or bodies
           or officers act wholly without jurisdiction, or in excess of it, or
           violation of the principles of natural justice, or refuse to
           exercise a jurisdiction vested in them, or there is 'an error
           apparent on the face of the record'."
</p>
<p id="p_134">     In 'AIR 1954 Supreme Court 440 ', the law was thus stated :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_68">           " An error in the decision or determination itself may also be
           amenable to a writ of 'certiorari' but it must be a 'manifest
           error apparent on the face of the proceedings', e. g., when it
           is based on clear ignorance or disregard of the provisions of
           law. In other words, it is a patent error which can be
           corrected by 'certiorari' but not a mere wrong decision."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_69">           23. It may therefore be taken as settled that a writ of
           'certiorari' could be issued to correct an error of law. But it is
           essential that it should be something more than a mere
           error; it must be one which must be manifest on the face of
           the record. The real difficulty with reference to this matter
           however, is not so much in the statement of the principle as
           in its application to the facts of a particular case. When does
           an error cease to be mere error, and become an error
           apparent on the face of the record? Learned Counsel on
           either side were unable to suggest any clear-cut rule by
           which the boundary between the two classes of errors could
           be demarcated.</blockquote><p id="p_135">

        issue regarding scope of writ jurisdiction to interfere with the
        orders of Tribunals. The relevant observations made by the
        Hon'ble division bench reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_70">              8. Before adverting to the respective arguments, we
              consider, it necessary to observe that a writ of certiorari can
              be issued for correcting errors of jurisdiction committed by
              inferior Courts or Tribunals. A writ can also be issued where
              in exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it, the Court or the
              Tribunal acts illegally or improperly i.e. it decides a question
              without giving an opportunity to be heard to the party
              affected by the order or where the procedure adopted by it is
              opposed to the principles of natural justice. However, it must
              be remembered that the jurisdiction of the High Court to
              issue a writ of certiorari is a supervisory jurisdiction and not
              appellate one. This necessarily means that the finding of fact
              reached by the inferior Court or Tribunal, as a result of the
              appreciation of evidence, cannot be reopened or questioned
              in writ proceedings except when the judgment, order or
              award suffers from an error of law apparent on the face of
              the record. A finding of fact recorded by an inferior Court of
              Tribunal can be corrected only if it is shown that in recording
              the said finding the Court or the Tribunal had erroneously
              refused to admit admissible and material evidence or had
              erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence and the same
              has influenced the impugned finding. Similarly, a finding of
              fact based on no evidence would be regarded as an error of
              law which can be corrected by a writ of certiorari.

Hon'ble Supreme Court makes reference to the National Police Commission

Reports wherein in the Second Report it was noticed that the crux of the

Police Reform is to secure professional independence for the Police to

function truly and efficiently as an impartial agent of the law of the land

and at the same time, to enable the government to oversee the police

performance to ensure its conformity to the law. It is in this context, the

Report observed that a supervisory mechanism without scope for illegal,

irregular or malafide interference with police function has to be devised.

         reform is to secure professional independence for the police to
         function truly and efficiently as an impartial agent of the law of
         the land and, at the same time, to enable the Government to

         law. A supervisory mechanism without scope for illegal, irregular or
         mala fide interference with police functions has to be devised. It
         was earnestly hoped that the Government would examine and
         publish the report expeditiously so that the process for
         implementation of various recommendations made therein could
         start right away. The report, inter alia, noticed the phenomenon of
         frequent and indiscriminate transfers ordered on political
         considerations as also other unhealthy influences and pressures
         brought to bear on police and, inter alia, recommended for the
         Chief of Police in a State, statutory tenure of office by
         including it in a specific provision in the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_77">Police Act</a> itself and
         also recommended the preparation of a panel of IPS officers
         for posting as Chiefs of Police in the States. The report also
         recommended the constitution of the Statutory Commission in each
         State the function of which shall include laying down broad policy
         guidelines and directions for the performance of preventive task
         and service-oriented functions by the police and also functioning as
         a forum of appeal for disposing of representations from any police
         officer of the rank of Superintendent of Police and above, regarding
         his being subjected to illegal or irregular orders in the performance
         of his duties.                                                 "

Police towards its commitment, devotion and accountability has been

referred to mention in Para 12 of judgment in Prakash Singh's case as

under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_78">         " 12. The commitment, devotion and accountability of the police

         has to be only to the rule of law. The supervision and control has to

         any regard, whatsoever, to the status and position of any person

         while investigating a crime or taking preventive measures. Its

         approach has to be service oriented, its role has to be defined so

         that in appropriate cases, where on account of acts of omission

         and commission of police, the rule of law becomes a casualty, the

         guilty police officers are brought to book and appropriate action

criteria to be followed viz. length of service, very good record, range of

make the said assessment purely in the domain of the UPSC who have

framed the Draft Guidelines incorporating the said parameters uniformly in

a transparent manner.</p><pre id="pre_18">

proceed to deal the arguments of the Private Respondents Mohd Mustafa

and Siddhartha Chattopadhyay.
</p>
<p id="p_224">27.3.1.     It is argued and submitted that the appointment of DGP (HoPF)

made by the UPSC has not been made in exercise of its powers &amp; functions

under <a href="/doc/1723820/" id="a_83">Article 320</a> of the Constitution of India and in the Empanelment

Committee there is only one members of UPSC who has been appointed as

President, therefore the recommendation &amp; assessment cannot be said to be

made by UPSC and does not have the stamp of approval from the Hon'ble

Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_225">            The above argument is unsustainable as the UPSC is

conducting the exercise of empanelment of Officers for appointment as

DGP (HoPF) based on the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in Prakash Singh's case (supra) under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_84">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of

India and same cannot be related to and sought to be based on exercise of

power under <a href="/doc/1723820/" id="a_85">Article 320</a> of the Constitution of India.

27.3.2.     It is argued by the Respondent No.5 that the dispute is

regarding the procedure &amp; method adopted by the Empanelment Committee

wherein once the committee on the basis of length of service, very good

record range of experience, residual service has found the Respondent No.5

to be fit then it could not declare him unfit subsequently on the basis of

procedure to be observed by them. In this regard the counsel for Mohd

Mustafa is assuming the eligibility to fall in the zone of consideration and

the assessment of suitability, inter-alia, on the parameters of 'range of

experience' delineated through 'Core Policing Areas' on State to State basis

as synonymous. The candidate / Officers may be eligible in the zone of

consideration to be considered but their empanelment is based on their

suitability assessed by Empanelment Committee on relevant parameters to

be assessed to find then 'fit' or 'unfit' for empanelment. The eligibility to

fall in the zone of consideration and the assessment of suitability being at

variance having its own consequences of "consideration" in earlier case and

"empanelment" in latter case as well as this court having found the

procedure and method adopted for assessment of suitability based on the

core Policing areas leaves no strength in the argument.

</p><p id="p_226">            The criteria on the aforestated 5 parameters of Core Policing

Areas alleged to be tailor made to suit a particular candidate have no basis

nd foundation as the same is chosen unanimously in the present case by the

Committee of experts having varied backgrounds and not prone to

influence, connivance or interference which has neither been pleaded nor

proved in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_227">27.3.3.     Even the argument that the criteria of selection to be formulated

prior to the selection process and in any case before the dossiers of

candidates are brought before the selection committee in order to eliminate

bias &amp; malafides. It is nobody's case attributing any bias or malafides to a

multi-member body of high ranking officers not this court found any bias or

malafides in the present case. The dossiers of the candidates were

processed, wherever required, the additional information was sought for and

supplied to the UPSC by the State of Punjab well in advance before

04.02.2019 based on scrutiny of record. The Empanelment Committee based

on the adoption of its own method and procedure unanimously chose the

Core Policing Areas to assess the suitability of Officers to head the Police

Force for the State of Punjab on the range of experience which is an

attribute of 'merit' and has to be assessed accordingly. We don't find any

error in such procedure and reject the argument.

27.3.4.     The argument of the Core Policing Areas consisting 20

parameters out of which the Empanelment Committee which was having

dossiers of the candidates, picked up five Core Policing Areas which have

no nexus with the work profile of the DGP of the State of Punjab to be tailor

made qua the selected candidates vitiating the empanelment is also without

merit because infact, there are 20 Policing Areas from which the Core

Policing Areas are chosen by the Committee by collective decision on state

to state basis based on the state specific requirements, the situations and

circumstances existing in each state where a insurgency infested state, a

drug infested state or a state with communal or ethnic disturbances may

have varies requirements needed for in the incumbent cannot be the same

and sacrosanct for all the States and needs flexibility towards adoption for

assessment. The flexibility is provided through the liberty to adopt its own

method and procedure by the Empanelment Committee. The arguing

respondents have no case that the entire Committee was in connivance and

having some vested interest against the Respondent No. 5 and 6 or some

favour for Respondent Dinkar Gupta.
</p>
<p id="p_228">27.3.5.     The argument that the list of 12 Officers was forwarded by

State of Punjab with request to UPSC to send list of 6 officers for it to pick

up two DGPs, while the Empanelment Committee considered the said 12

officers for selecting a panel of only 3 for appointment of DGP (HoPF) only

would pale into insignificance in view of the provisions of Clause -2

providing for the 'zone of consideration' in the Draft Guidelines -2009

which requires that all cadre Officers having 30 years of service and not

below the rank of ADGP are to be considered.</p><pre id="pre_22">

<p id="p_230">27.3.7.      Sh Rajiv Atma Ram Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of

Siddhartha Chattopadhyay has taken additional grounds of bias which

affected the consideration before the Empanelment Committee. Said

argument of bias raised before the Tribunal has been rejected. Infact, in the

given facts and circumstances discussed in the previous paragraphs, the

detailed process involving many members of the Committee belonging to

the high ranks and from multiple agencies, there cannot be any scope or

chance of bias. In this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/92047254/" id="a_86">Union of India

v. S.P. Nayyar</a>, (2014) 14 SCC 370, has held that :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_131">      13. The bias and mala fide acts can be adjudged only on
      the basis of evidence. The assessment of character roll by
      one or the other officer, giving a general grade such as
      "Good" cannot be the sole ground to hold that the officer
      was biased against the person whose character roll is
      assessed. In the instant case, there is nothing on record to
      suggest that Appellant 3, E.N. Ram Mohan was biased against
      the respondent. Merely because he assessed the ACR of the
      respondent as "Good" as against assessment of "Very Good"
      made by IO it cannot be said that he was biased against the
      respondent.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_132">      14. The Departmental Promotion Committee consists of a
      Chairman and the members. Even if bias is alleged against the
      Chairperson, it cannot be presumed that all the members of
      the Committee were biased. No ground has been made out
      by the respondent to show as to why the assessment made
      by the DPC is not to be accepted. The High Court failed to
      notice the aforesaid fact and wrongly discarded the assessment
      made by the DPC.

Petitioner, the principles enunciated in "<a href="/doc/80596/" id="a_87">Manak Lal vs. Dr. Prem Chand

Singhvi</a>" 1957 AIR (SC) 425, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, lays that once

the aggrieved person knew the material facts and must he deem to have been

conscious of his legal right in the matter, his failure to take the plea of bias

at the earlier stage of the proceedings creates an effective bar of waiver

against him. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Manak Lal's case (supra) held

that, "it seems clear that the Appellant wanted to take a chance to secure a

favorable report from the Tribunal which was constituted and when he

found that he was confronted with an unfavorable report, he adopted the

device of raising the present technical point."

Association &amp; Another vs. Union of India" (Recusal Matter</a>) (2016) 5

SCC 808 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is well established

principle of law that an objection based on bias of the adjudicator can be

waived and the Courts generally do not entertain such objection raised

belatedly by the aggrieved party. In the said judgment, while placing

reliance on "Wakefield Local Board of Health vs. West Riding &amp; Grimsby

Railway Co." (1865) LR1 QB 84 and "R v. Byles, Xpholiidge, (1912) 77 JP

40 and others", it has been held that the right to object to a disqualified

adjudicator may be waived, and this may be so even where the

disqualification is statutory. It was held that the Court normally insists that

the objection shall be taken as soon as the party prejudiced knows the facts

which entitle him to object. If, after he or his advisors know of the

disqualification, they let the proceedings continue without protest, they are

held to have waived their objection and the determination cannot be

challenged. The said principles of the doctrine of waiver are supported by

      this Court considered the question whether the decision taken

      levelled against the appellant was vitiated due to bias of the
      Chairman of the Tribunal constituted for holding inquiry into
      the allegation. The appellant alleged that the Chairman had

      he was disqualified to judge his conduct. This Court held that

           some other member instead of Shri Chhangani and yet
           did not adopt that course, it may well be that he
           deliberately took a chance to obtain a report in his
           favour from the Tribunal and when he came to know
           that the report had gone against him he thought better

</p><p id="p_238">           9.     From the record it is clear that the appellant
           never raised this point before the Tribunal and the
           manner in which this point was raised by him even
           before the High Court is somewhat significant. The first
           ground of objection filed by the appellant against the
           Tribunal's report was that Shri Chhangani had
           pecuniary and personal interest in the complainant Dr
           Prem Chand. The learned Judges of the High Court
           have found that the allegations about the pecuniary
           interest of Shri Chhangani in the present proceedings
           are wholly unfounded and this finding has not been
           challenged before us by Shri Daphtary. The learned
           Judges of the High Court have also found that the
           objection was raised by the appellant before them only
           to obtain an order for a fresh enquiry and thus gain
           time. ... Since we have no doubt that the appellant knew
           the material facts and must be deemed to have been
           conscious of his legal rights in that matter, his failure to
           take the present plea at the earlier stage of the
           proceedings creates an effective bar of waiver against
           him. It seems clear that the appellant wanted to take a

and also qualified the range of experience to be assessed and evaluated for

heading the Police Force. It is, no doubt, reasonable to claim that each state

has its own peculiar situations and circumstances and accordingly certain

attributes of Core Policing Areas will have precedence and prominence over

others in the Police Administration in that particular state and it is the

domain of the experts to cull out the Core Policing Areas which have more

prominence / precedence than others in respect of that particular state to be

evaluated for empanelling the Officers for appointment as DGP for heading

the Police Force.

made is to quash the Order dated 07.02.2019 in view of the fact that he is

more qualified and senior to Dinkar Gupta and fulfills the conditions as

prescribed by the Supreme Court as well as the parameters laid by the

Empanelment Committee.            The private respondents / Applicants in

Original Applications before the Tribunal have sought consideration and

review of issue on comparative merit on the parameters laid by the

Empanelment Committee on one hand while on the other hand have raised

the plea that the parameters set by the Empanelment Committee were tailor-

made to suit Dinkar Gupta.

<p id="p_253">29.6.        In addition, argument has been raised that the Punjab Specific

Criteria was framed after the dossiers were made available to the

Empanelment Committee and have been seen by them. It is argued that the

choosing of Punjab specific criteria after having seen the dossiers is in

contravention of law as the criteria has to be framed prior to the last date for

submission of application for consideration by the Empanelment

Committee. On the above basis, it is argued that the criteria laid by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Parkash Singh's case (supra) has to be followed

without any addition, wherein, the merit &amp; seniority were to be given due

weightage and if at all additional criteria was to be framed, the same could

be done before receipt of dossiers of the 12 candidates and the said criteria

has to be for all the states and could not be applicable to the State of Punjab

Parkash Singh's case (supra) and in case any criteria of Core Policing

Areas had been formulated the same was required to be mentioned in the

Minutes of Meeting dated 04.02.2019 but the same has not been done.

29.7.        The argument raised regarding tailor made criteria attributed to

the Empanelment Committee has no basis and foundation being pleaded or

proved before this Court and is rather a bald statement of fact which when

pleaded needs, in normal course of pleadings, a strict standard of proof. It is

settled law that the Courts have to be slow in drawing conclusions when it

comes to holding allegations of mala fides to be proved and only in cases

where based on the material placed before the Court or facts that are

admitted leading to inevitable inferences supporting the charge of mala

fides that the Court should record a finding of malafides. The argument is

thus rejected on this score alone.

<p id="p_255">             Further, the argument that Punjab specific criteria has been

formulated after receiving the dossiers of the Officers in the zone of the

consideration for the post of DGP (HoPF) for the State of Punjab in

question is also without any force. On that basis, no allegation of bias or

malafides is raised against the Empanelment Committee consisting of

multiple members and such allegation on the members of the Empanelment

Committee i.e. the then Chief Secretary, Punjab and the DGP Chief of

Police Punjab is also without force as these Officers being head of the

administrative set up of the State Administration and Police Administration

respectively based on their position always have access to and are aware of

the dossiers of the officers under their supervision, command and control.

policing areas not mentioned in the Minutes of Meeting dated 04.02.2019

regarding the empanelment of DGP (HoPF) for the State of Punjab in

question is without any force of law, any rule or regulation. In this regard

we are in agreement with Sh. Aman Lekhi, Se Counsel for UPSC that there

is no requirement in the Rules, regulations, Draft Guidelines-2009, or any

other law on the subject or judgment that the assessment made by the

Selection (Empanelment) Committee has to be recorded in the Minutes of

the Meeting. This argument is also consequently, rejected.

29.8.       An agreement with the plea of tailor made criteria, Punjab

specific criteria after receipt of dossiers, non mentioning of the assessment

on Core Policing Areas in Minutes of Meeting would amount to the

acceptance that there were malafides, collusion and concert among the

members of the Empanelment Committee, which has neither been pleaded

nor proved but has been raised as an argument without any basis or

foundation. This court deprecates such plea raised in the arguments on the

sole factor that we are dealing with the UPSC and its Empanelment

Committee wherein the high ranking officers connected with Police

Administration are involved who are independent of each other and no

instance / effect of collusion even in arguments have been shown that all the

high ranking senior members of the Committee have joined hands and

worked commonly towards ousting the claim of Mohd Mustafa / Siddharth

      the context of selection. Besides, the Tribunal has also
      committed an error in taking the view that the law enjoined the
      Selection Committee to record the reasons and failure to do so
      would vitiate the selection. It appears that the Tribunal did not
      properly realise the effect of the relevant provision having been

            power. The machinery designed for preparation of select
            list under the regulations for promotion to all-India

            Selection Committee is constituted by high-ranking
            responsible officers presided over by Chairman or a
            member of the Union Public Service Commission.
            There is no reason to hold that they would not act in

            Commission is under a legal obligation to consider the
            views expressed by the State Government along with the
            records of officers, before approving the select list. The
            Selection Committee and the Commission both include
            persons having requisite knowledge, experience and
            expertise to assess the service records and ability to

     The courts have very limited scope of judicial review in such
     matters.
</p><p id="p_272">     18.   We are conscious of the fact that the expert body's
     opinion may not deserve acceptance in all circumstances
     and hence it may not be proper to say that the expert
     body's opinion is not subject to judicial review in all
     circumstances. In our constitutional scheme, the decision of
     the Selection Committee/Board of Appointment cannot be said
     to be final and absolute. Any other view will have a very
     dangerous consequence and one must remind oneself of the
     famous words of Lord Acton "Power tends to corrupt, and
     absolute power corrupts absolutely". The aforementioned
     principle has to be kept in mind while deciding such cases.
     However, in the matter on hand, it is abundantly clear from the
     affidavit filed by UPSC that the Selection Committee which is
     nothing but an expert body had carefully examined and
     scrutinised the experience, Annual Confidential Reports and
     other relevant factors which were required to be considered
     before selecting the eligible candidates for IPS. The Selection
     Committee had in fact scrutinised the merits and demerits of
     each candidate taking into consideration the various factors as
     required, and its recommendations were sent to UPSC. It is the
     settled legal position that the courts have to show deference
     and consideration to the recommendations of an Expert
     Committee consisting of members with expertise in the field, if
     malice or arbitrariness in the Committee's decision is not
     forthcoming.     The    doctrine    of    fairness,   evolved     in
     administrative law, was not supposed to convert tribunals and
     courts into appellate authorities over the decision of experts.
     The     constraints--self-imposed,        undoubtedly--of         writ
     jurisdiction still remain. Ignoring them would lead to confusion
     and uncertainty. The jurisdiction may become rudderless.</p><pre id="pre_26">

     Court in UPSC v. K. Rajaiah [UPSC v. K. Rajaiah, (2005) 10
     SCC 15 : 2005 SCC (L&amp;S) 738] , the power to classify as
     "Outstanding", "Very Good", "Good" and "Unfit" is vested
     with the Selection Committee. That is a function incidental to
     the selection process. The classification given by the State
     Authorities in the Annual Confidential Reports is not binding
     on the Selection Committee. Such classification is within the
     prerogative of the Selection Committee and no reasons need be
     recorded, though it is desirable that in a case of grading at
     variance with that of the State Government, reasons be
     recorded. But having regard to the nature of the function and
     the power confined to the Selection Committee under
     Regulation 5(4), it is not a legal requirement that reasons
     should be recorded for classifying an officer at variance with
     the State Government's decision. It is relevant to note that no

      assessment made by the DPC. If the assessment made by the

      be adjudged by the Selection Committee on appreciation of
      their character roll. In absence of the character roll of other

        'outstanding', 'very good', 'good' and 'unfit' is vested with the

        selection process. The classification given by the State
        Government authorities in the ACRs is not binding on the

        the classification adopted by the State Government but, for
        good reasons, the Selection Committee can evolve its own
        classification which may be at variance with the gradation
        given in the ACRs. That is what has been done in the instant
        case in respect of the year 1993-1994. Such classification is
        within the prerogative of the Selection Committee and no
        reasons need be recorded, though it is desirable that in a
        case of gradation at variance with that of the State
        Government, it would be desirable to record reasons. But
        having regard to the nature of the function and the power
        confided to the Selection Committee under Regulation 5(4), it

Supreme Court in similar circumstances observed in Para 15 as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_154">      " 15. The guidelines give a certain amount of play in the joints
      to DPC by providing that it need not be guided by the overall
      grading recorded in CRs, but may make its own assessment

      overall assessment of the performance of each candidate
      separately, but by adopting the same standards, yardsticks
      and norms. It is only when the process of assessment is
      vitiated either on the ground of bias, mala fides or arbitrariness,
      that the selection calls for interference. Where DPC has
      proceeded in a fair, impartial and reasonable manner, by
      applying the same yardstick and norms to all candidates
      and there is no arbitrariness in the process of assessment by
      DPC, the court will not interfere (vide SBI v. Mohd.

bias by one of the members, it has been held that the allegations of bias

the UPSC while considering Issue (2) and have concluded based on the

empanelment of DGP (HoPF) for the State of Punjab in January 2019, based

on the composition given in Para 1 of the Draft Guidelines 2009. The

members of the Empanelment Committee reached a consensus regarding the

norms to be applied for assessing the suitability of the officers in the light of

circumstances and situations peculiar to the State of Punjab and are essential

for heading the Police Force in the State of Punjab. As claimed by the UPSC

in a comprehensive rejoinder-affidavit dated 16.03.2020 filed in CWP

4618 of 2020, the said Committee assessed the suitability of the officers

based on the criteria of length of service, very good service record, residual

service and range of experience for heading the police force on the

assessment sheets which are the working sheets and are an internal

confidential record. The assessment sheets/working sheets are signed by all

<p id="p_289">40.         Another aspect that deserves consideration in the present case

is that the officers, forming part of the zone of consideration, have earned

their respective promotion upto the rank of DGP/ADGP. For empanelment /

appointment as DGP (HoPF), they are eligible to be considered in a

selection process undertaken by the UPSC through the Empanelment

Committee. The officers of the rank of DGP / ADGP who have 30 years of

service, having very good record and residual minimum service of 6 months

are included in such selection process where they are assessed on the chosen

/ adopted core policing areas for the 'range of experience' towards their

suitability to be empanelled for appointment as Head of the Police Force for

a particular State. The Tribunal has held that any exercise beyond the

consideration of the Officers on their length of service, residual service,

very good record and even in respect of the range of experience to head the

Police Force is bad and illegal. Such a narrow and pedantic approach itself

implies that if the Officer who is senior with length of service at his side,

having requisite residual service, very good record will have to be accepted

and empanelled and there is no scope with the UPSC / Empanelment

Committee to objectively assess that such an officer is having the range of

experience to head the Police Force and whether on all parameters and the

Core Policing Areas required for that State, such an Officer is more suitable

and more adequate to be empanelled. Thus, in this regard the findings of the

Tribunal that there is no other consideration allowed and any other

<p id="p_290">             In an assessment towards the suitability on a selection post as

head the Police Force, the evaluation is to be made by the experts keeping in

consideration the requirement of the particular state and in their expert

domain, vision and wisdom may prefer one candidate over the other and

such assessment is beyond the purview and scope of interference by the

Courts. This selection of empanelment is based on objective assessment

made by the Empanelment Committee on the method &amp; procedure adopted

by the Empanelment Committee itself in terms of Clause 6.1 of the Draft

Guidelines-2009, by reaching a consensus and without there being any

scope of collusion or conspiracy in a multi-member body with members

who are very high ranking officers from different organizations. The

empanelment of an officer for appointment as DGP (HoPF) is not an

individual decision but a collective decision by the Empanelment

Committee. In the present case, there is no basis, foundation or pleading that

the Empanelment Committee was having any malafides against the Private

Respondents Mohd. Mustafa or Siddharth Chattopadhyay or have colluded

to oust these candidates from the selection process.               The Tribunal

harbouring a notion and giving a finding in the impugned Order dated

17.01.2020 that once the Officer is fulfilling the parameters i.e. the length of

service, residual service, very good record and range of experience, then any

other consideration is blocked is also unfounded and liable to be set aside.

07.02.2019. It is settled that the comparative merit of the candidates is not

to be gone into but by venturing into the basis and foundation of assessment

on the Core Policing areas and questioning Clause 6.1 of the Draft

to their assessment pointing towards the empanelled or the non-empanelled

Officers which was an exercise completely internal to the Empanelment

Committee and is not even required to be recorded in the Minutes of

Meeting. The Private Respondents Mohd. Mustafa or Siddharth

Chattopadhyay have neither pleaded nor proved a case to venture in the

domain of the experts and such an exercise by the Tribunal and on this

score, the findings of the Tribunal in Para 63 of the impugned judgment

dated 17.01.2020, that the reasons mentioned by UPSC for selecting the

empanelled candidates or superceding the seniors are not in accord with the

absence of such challenge, the procedure under Clause 6.1 and on that basis

Advocate and from the perusal of the pleadings, there is no challenge to the

dated 16.01.2019 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in an IA filed by

the State of Punjab against the Order dated 03.07.2018, refers to the

procedure of assessment through the Empanelment Committee of UPSC and

the Hon'ble Supreme Court recorded its satisfaction towards the procedure

adopted towards empanelment for DGP (HoPF). But, in the impugned

judgment dated 17.01.2020 passed by the Tribunal though reference is made

affidavit dated 16.03.2020, affirming that while minutes of meeting are

shared / disclosed in the public domain, the Assessment Sheets are an

unpublished record of the UPSC which is not shared/disclosed in the public

domain. However, the assessment of all the 12 officers has been recorded by

the Empanelment Committee on the basis of length of service, very good

record, range of experience for Heading the Police Force and residual

service. The committee has recorded assessment on the range of experience

of the eligible offices on core policing areas in the last 10 years and relied

on the judgement wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court upholding the norms

the light of relevant records, which is a function of the selection committee.</p><pre id="pre_28">
