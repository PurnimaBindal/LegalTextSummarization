<p id="p_1">A.K. SIKRI, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE

</p><p id="p_2">1.        This Letters Patent Appeal is filed against the interim order dated 30 th

April, 2012 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court in W.P.(C)

No.2511/2012. The said writ petition has been filed by the respondent no.1

challenging the order dated 23rd April, 2012 of the appellant terminating his

services w.e.f. 30th April, 2012. As per the appellant, the respondent no.1

was employed as Co-Pilot and was put on probation; he was still on

probation when the order terminating his services has been passed. The

respondent no.1 filed the writ petition inter alia alleging that the order


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">LPA No.379/2012                                                         Page 1 of 12</span>
 terminating his service is totally arbitrary and in violation of principles of

natural justice as before passing the order no show cause notice was given to

the respondent no.1. On 30 th April, 2012 the matter came up before the

learned Single Judge for the first time when the counsel for the appellant

also appeared on advance notice. The matter was argued at some length and

whereafter notice of the writ petition was issued by the learned Single Judge

and on the stay application filed by the respondent no.1 herein, following

order has been passed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "Operation of the order dated 23.04. 2012 passed by the
                  respondent no.1 (appellant in this appeal) shall remain stayed
                  till the next date of hearing."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">2.        It is stated that Capt. N.K. Beri is the father of the respondent no.1

who misused his position to get the respondent no.1 absorbed in the

appellant. It is further stated that in the vigilance investigation conducted by

the appellant it was found that induction of the respondent no.1 was not in

accordance with the laid down procedures of the appellant and because of

that reason the respondent no.1 who was still on probation, his services were

terminated by an innocuous order. The order dated 23rd April, 2012 is of

termination simplicitor and does not impose any stigma. Apart from the

above, the main argument on which stress has been put by Mr. Bhasin


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">LPA No.379/2012                                                       Page 2 of 12</span>
 learned counsel for the appellant, is that at the stage when the appellant was

yet to file the counter affidavit, such an order staying the operation of the

termination order dated 23rd April, 2012 could not have been passed. In

support of his submission the learned counsel for the appellant has referred

to the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/305039/" id="a_1">State of Haryana v. Suman Dutta</a>

(2000) 10 SCC 311 wherein the Court had held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  "2. This appeal by the State of Haryana is directed against
                  an interim order passed by the High Court of Punjab &amp;
                  Haryana at Chandigarh in CWP No.10493 of 1998, staying the
                  order of termination. The positive case of the State is that the
                  respondent did not pass the necessary examination in
                  shorthand and typing. We are not expressing any opinion as
                  to whether the services of an employee could be terminated for
                  not passing the shorthand and typewriting test, but we are
                  clearly of the opinion that the High Court erred in law in
                  staying the order of termination as an interim measure in the
                  pending writ petition. By such interim order if an employee is
                  allowed to continue in service and then ultimately the writ
                  petition is dismissed, then it would tantamount to usurpation of
                  public office without any right to the same. We, therefore, set
                  aside the impugned order of the High Court staying the order of
                  termination. Needless to mention, the High Court will decide
                  the writ petition on its own merits without being in any way
                  influenced by our interfering with the impugned order".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_4">3.        He has also relied upon another judgment of the Apex Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/30394/" id="a_2">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Sandeep Kumar Balmiki</a> (2009) 17 SCC

555 where the court held that interim order staying the termination could not

 be passed and giving such a relief would amount to allowing the writ

petition itself. This was so stated in the following terms by the Apex Court

in the said judgment:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  "In our view, the interim order granted by the High Court
                  staying the order of termination could not be passed at this
                  stage in view of the fact that if such relief is granted at this
                  stage, the writ petition shall stand automatically allowed
                  without permitting the parties to place their respective cases at
                  the time of final hearing of the writ petition. In this case also,
                  the appellants have not yet filed counter affidavit to the writ
                  petition of the respondents."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">4.        Another judgment to which reference is made is <a href="/doc/1820269/" id="a_3">State of U.P. v. Ram

Sukhi Devi</a> (2005) 9 SCC 733 where the court denounced the practice of

granting such interim orders in the following manner:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  "8. To say the least, approach of the learned Single Judge
                  and the Division Bench is judicially unsustainable and
                  indefensible. The final relief sought for in the writ petition has
                  been granted as an interim measure. There was no reason
                  indicated by learned Single Judge as to why the government
                  order dated 26-10-1998 was to be ignored. Whether the writ
                  petitioner was entitled to any relief in the writ petition has to be
                  adjudicated at the time of final disposal of the writ petition.
                  This Court has on numerous occasions observed that the final
                  relief sought for should not be granted at an interim stage. The
                  position is worsened if the interim direction has been passed
                  with stipulation that the applicable government order has to be
                  ignored. Time and again this Court has deprecated the practice
                  of granting interim orders which practically give the
                  principal relief sought in the petition for no better reason
                  than that of a prima facie case having been made out,
                  without being concerned about the balance of convenience,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">LPA No.379/2012                                                            Page 4 of 12</span>
                   the public interest and a host of other considerations".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">5.        Ms. Nandni Sahni, Advocate appearing for the respondent no.1 on the

other hand has submitted that ex facie the order of termination is bad in law

and the appellant has not been able to give any justification for the said

order. It is argued that in these circumstances, the interim relief granted by

the learned Single Judge has been correctly granted. She contends that the

alleged inquiry conducted by the appellant pertains to the father of the

respondent no.1 and on the basis of that inquiry the respondent no.1 could

not be punished that too without even following the principles of natural

justice. It is further submitted that the least that was required in such a case

was to give a show cause notice to the respondent no.1on the basis of which

the respondent no.1 could have placed sufficient material before the

appellant to show that his induction in the appellant was not contrary to any

rules or laid down procedures. She even tried to make out a case that the

CMD had the necessary powers to make such an appointment without

inviting the applications from public at large. The learned counsel, on the

basis of aforesaid averments, has referred to the following judgments in

support of her plea that interim protection can be granted by the court:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                   "11. The Courts and Tribunals seized of the proceedings
                  within their jurisdiction take a reasonable time in disposing of
                  the same. This is on account of fair-procedure requirement
                  which involves delay intervening between the previous and the
                  next procedural steps leading towards preparation of case for
                  hearing. Then, the Courts are also over burdened and their
                  hands are full. As the conclusion of hearing on merits is likely
                  to take some time, the parties press for interim relief being
                  granted in the interregnum. An order of interim relief may or
                  may not be a reasoned one but the factors of prima facie
                  case, irreparable injury and balance of convenience do
                  work at the back of the mind of the one who passes an
                  order of interim nature. Ordinarily, the Court is inclined to
                  maintain status quo as obtaining on the date of the
                  commencement of the proceedings. However, there are a few
                  cases which call for the Court's leaning not in favour of
                  maintaining the status quo and still lesser in percentage are the
                  cases when an order tantamounting to a mandamus is required
                  to be issued even at an interim stage. There are matters of
                  significance and of moment posing themselves as moment of
                  truth. Such cases do cause dilemma and put the wits of any
                  Judge to test.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                  12. Situations emerge where the granting of an interim relief
                  would tantamount to granting the final relief itself. And then
                  there may be converse cases where withholding of an interim
                  relief would tantamount to dismissal of main petition itself; for,
                  by the time the main matter comes up for hearing there would
                  be nothing left to be allowed as relief to the petitioner though
                  all the findings may be in his favour. In such cases the
                  availability of a very strong prima facie case -- of a standard
                  much higher than just prima facie case, the considerations of
                  balance of convenience and irreparable injury forcefully
                  tilting the balance of case totally in favour of the applicant
                  may persuade the Court to grant an interim relief though it
                  amounts to granting the final relief itself. Of course, such
                  would be rare and exceptional cases. The Court would grant
                  such an interim relief only if satisfied that withholding of it


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">LPA No.379/2012                                                          Page 6 of 12</span>
                   would prick the conscience of the Court and do violence to the
                  sense of justice, resulting in injustice being perpetuated
                  throughout the hearing, and at the end the Court would not be
                  able to vindicate the cause of justice. Obviously such would be
                  rare cases accompanied by compelling circumstances, where
                  the injury complained of is immediate and pressing and would
                  cause extreme hardship. The conduct of the parties shall also
                  have to be seen and the Court may put the parties on such terms
                  as may be prudent;"

                  not one of compulsion. In an appropriate case, in spite of
                  availability of the alternative remedy, the High Court may still
                  exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least three contingencies: (i)
                  where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any of the
                  fundamental rights; (ii) where there is failure of principles of

<p id="p_7">6.        The last judgment cited is in response to the argument of the learned

counsel for the appellant that there is an alternative efficacious remedy by

way of raising industrial dispute within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_13">Section 10</a> of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It is submitted by Mr. Bhasin that in the

counter affidavit to be filed, this point would be taken as to the

 maintainability of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.        We have considered the aforesaid submission. It is not in dispute that

the courts have power to grant interim relief. The Supreme Court in the case

of Deoraj (supra) has discussed those cases where interim relief may also

tantamount to the final relief and the circumstances in which such a relief

can be granted. It is therefore, categorically observed that even while

deciding such cases the triple tests i.e. strong prima facie case, balance of

convenience and irreparable injury are the parameters which have to be kept

in mind by the court. It is further observed that when the interim relief

tantamounts to granting the final relief, a person claiming such a relief has

to make out a very strong prima facie case and it should be done in rare and

exceptional cases. Likewise in Zenit Mataplast Pvt. Ltd. (supra) cited by the

learned counsel for the respondent no.1 herself, the court observed that such

an order making temporary arrangement is to be made "to preserve the

status quo till the matter is decided finally, to ensure that the matter does not

become either infructuous or a fait accompli before the final hearing".

Again the three tests for grant of interim injunction are spelled out and it is

observed that grant of an interim relief would depend upon the facts and

circumstances of each case and no straightjacket formula can be laid down.

 The court also made subsequent observations namely that interim relief of

this nature should be granted only in those cases where "the respondent-

defendant may use the suit property in such a manner that the situation

becomes irretrievable".

<p id="p_9">8.        In view of the facts of the present case we are of the opinion that such

an ex parte injunction was not called for. None of the aforesaid cases cited

by the respondent no.1 pertains to service matter. On the other hand, the

learned counsel for the appellant has referred to those judgments which are

directly related to the case at hand where the services of a person are

terminated and the question arises as to whether such termination should be

stayed as an interim measure. In all these cases the consistent approach of

the Supreme Court is that normally there should not be any stay of

termination. As recorded above, the Supreme Court laid down that such a

relief which tantamounts to final relief has to be granted in exceptional

cases and where the situation becomes irretrievable and the subject matter of

the petition would become infructuous or fait accompli before the final

hearing that would depend on the position in the instant case. Even if the

termination is held to be illegal and unjustified at the time of passing the

final order the respondent no.1 can always be compensated by directing

 payment of full salary during the period he remained out of employment.

Therefore, it would not be a case where the situation would be irretrievable.

</p><p id="p_10">9.        We may, in all fairness to counsel for the respondent no.1 record that

our attention was also drawn to the provisions relating to "requirement for

renewal of expired licences" wherein it is mentioned that the pilots are

supposed to undergo normal refresher and extended refresher courses and

also there have to be specific route checks. It was argued that if the

respondent no.1 remains out of service and is not able to fly, the renewal of

his licence may also be put in jeopardy. This aspect can be taken care of by

ensuring that the petition is itself decided finally at an early date.

</p><p id="p_11">10.       As mentioned above, the impugned order was passed on the very first

date and there was no occasion to file counter affidavit. While issuing notice

in the writ petition the learned Single Judge has granted four weeks' time to

the appellant herein, to file the counter affidavit; that shall be positively

filed within four weeks from 30 th April, 2012 as directed by the learned

Single Judge. The respondent no.1 shall also adhere to schedule by filing

rejoinder within two weeks thereafter as per the direction given in that

order. In this manner the pleadings shall be completed by the end of June,

2012 and the learned Single Judge has fixed the matter on 9 th July, 2012. It

 is hoped and expected that on that date matter shall be finally heard by the

learned Single Judge so that the judgment is also pronounced immediately

thereafter. We further clarify that in case the termination is held to be

illegal, the learned Single Judge may grant relief of not only reinstatement

but full salary for the intervening period to the respondent no.1. It shall

adequately take care of the interest of the respondent no.1.

2012 passed by the learned Single Judge in the stay application is set aside.
