                      ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner is seeking cancellation of bail

granted by this Court in Crl.P.No.2653/2020 to the

second respondent in Crime No.108/2018 of Dabaspet

Police Station.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. The second respondent was accused No.1 in

Crime No.108/2018 of Dabaspet Police Station.       The

second respondent and 7 others were charge sheeted in

the said case for the offences punishable under Sections

143, 364, 302 read with <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_1">Section 149</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/42436223/" id="a_2">Section

</p><p id="p_5">        3. Petitioner was the brother of deceased Naveen

Kumar.      Respondent No.2 was the brother, Accused

No.8 was the husband of CW.2.            Accused No.8 and

CW.2 were having two children out of their wedlock.

The deceased indulged into illicit relationship with CW.2

despite admonition by the petitioner, accused No.8 and

others. Being frustrated by that it was alleged that on

13.05.2018 at 9.45 p.m. accused kidnapped Naveen

Kumar from the house of accused No.8 in Bagalkunte

and assaulted him with cricket bat, clubs etc and

committed his murder.

<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">        4. On 07.08.2019 this Court rejected the first bail

petition      of     the      second      respondent       in

Crl.P.No.2516/2019. Thereafter, on 23.09.2019, this

Court      granted     bail    to      accused    No.8     in

Crl.P.No.2123/2019. The second respondent again filed

Crl.P.No.2653/2020 which came to be allowed on

04.08.2020 on the ground that the allegation of causing

injuries leading to the death were against accused No.8,

since he was granted bail, the second respondent was

entitled to extension of parity.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      5. Petitioner is seeking cancellation of the said

bail order in the above petition on the following

grounds:

<p id="p_10">      (i)     Against an order of rejection of bail in the

case involving the offences under SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_5">ST Act</a>, as per

<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_6">Section 14A</a> of the said Act an appeal lies. Therefore,

Crl.P.No.2516/2018 was not maintainable;

</p><p id="p_11">      (ii)    Notice of the petition was served on the

petitioner on 04.08.2020 itself without mentioning the

hearing date. The copies of the petition and other

annexures were not served on him. Therefore, the order

in   Crl.P.No.2653/2020       was   passed   without    giving

sufficient opportunity of hearing to the petitioner;

</p><p id="p_12">      (iii)   There     was   overwhelming      incriminating

material      against   the   second   respondent.      While

extending parity to the second respondent, this Court

ignored the observations made against the second
                                                    Crl.P.No.4155/2020

grounds:
</p>
<p id="p_19">         (i)     The remedy of the petitioner against grant

the order in the hands of this Court only;

can be cancelled only if there are any supervening

circumstances like petitioner abusing the bail granted to

him, tampering the witnesses or absconding. Petitioner

has made out none of these circumstances to cancel the

bail.

</p><p id="p_23">       11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Salimbhai's

case referred to supra in para 9 of the judgment held

that while canceling the bail, the Court does not

examine the merits of the order granting the bail.

are only the supervening circumstances like accused

abusing the bail granted in his favour.


</p><p id="p_25">      13. In Rathinam's case (supra) at para 5 of the

judgment it was held that against the order of the

learned Single Judge granting bail, an appeal lies to the

Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_13">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.


</p><p id="p_26">      14. In Basit's case referred to supra, it was held

that once the Court grants bail, it becomes funtus

officio. Unless that order is set aside, the Court granting

bail cannot review that. It is relevant to extract

paragraphs 21 and 26 of the said judgment.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "It is an accepted principle of law that when a
      matter has been finally disposed of by a court, the
      court is, in the absence of a direct statutory
      provision, functus officio and cannot entertain a
      fresh prayer for relief in the matter unless and until
      the previous order of final disposal has been set
      aside or modified to that extent. It is also settled
      law that the judgment and order granting bail
      cannot be reviewed by the court passing such
      judgment and order in the absence of any express
      provision in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14"> the Code</a> for the same. <a href="/doc/390542/" id="a_15">Section 362</a> of
      the Code operates as a bar to any alteration or
      review of the cases disposed of by the court. The

     singular exception to the said statutory bar is
     correction of clerical or arithmetical error by the
     court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     26.          In the instant case, the order for bail in the
     bail         application   preferred       by      the     accused-
     petitioners herein finally disposes of the issue in
     consideration and grants relief of bail to the
     applicants therein. Since, no express provision for
     review of order granting bail exists under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16"> the
     Code</a>, the High Court becomes functus officio and
     <a href="/doc/390542/" id="a_17">Section 362</a> of the Code applies herein barring the
     review         of    judgment   and       order    of    the   Court
     granting bail to the petitioner-accused.                         Even
     though         the    cancellation   of    bail    rides    on    the
     satisfaction and discretion of the court under
     <a href="/doc/1667941/" id="a_18">Section 439(2)</a> of the Code, it does not vest the

     power of review in the court which granted bail.
     Even in the light of fact of misrepresentation by
     the petitioner-accused during the grant of bail, the
     High         Court    could   not    have       entertained       the
     respondent/informant's prayer by sitting in review
     of     its    judgment     by entertaining miscellaneous
     petition."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     15. In this case also, the bail order was passed

considering the material on record.                    Hence, this Court

has become funtus-officio.                Since the petitioner has

sought review of the order by way of cancellation of

Supreme Court in Basit's case. Therefore, the present

petition is not maintainable. Since the petition itself is

not maintainable, it is not necessary to go into the

other grounds urged by the petitioner.
