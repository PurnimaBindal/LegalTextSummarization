</pre>

<p id="p_1">Bhavadasan, J,

            The case from which these appeals arise reveals a

gruesome and horrendous murder by the guardian of law along

with four others, three of whom are mercenaries. Initially only

accused Nos.1 and 2 were available for trial. Their trial ended

in conviction and both of them were sentenced to suffer

imprisonment for life. They were also sentenced for some

other offences also. Later accused Nos. 3 and 4 surrendered

and they were also tried. The details of that case are not

relevant for the present purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            2. Crl.Appeal No.86 of 2006 is by the first accused

and Crl.Appeal 193 of 2006 is by the second accused against

their conviction and sentences. The State has come up in

appeal in Crl.Appeal No.1796 of 2007 seeking enhancement of

sentence. The State canvasses for capital punishment.

</p><p id="p_4">             3. The incident which gave rise to this case seems to

have occurred in the evening of 15.2.2005. Accused Nos.1 and 2

and the deceased were all related to P.W.1. Praveen, the victim,

was earlier employed in a bus operated by the wife of the first

accused, who was then working as the Deputy Superintendent of

Police. Some time in November, 2004, he left the employment

under first accused for certain reasons and took up employment

with a mattress shop functioning at Ettumanoor. Praveen was

working as driver for the shop. On 15.2.2005, as usual, Praveen

went for work. But he did not return home. Praveen's father,

namely, P.W.1, was employed at Trivandrum. He was informed

about the absence of Praveen. He made frantic enquiries and

search for his son, but did not succeed. Therefore, on 18.2.2005 he

went to Ettumanoor Police Station and lodged Ext.P2 First

Information Statement. P.W.69, the A.S.I. attached to the police

station recorded the same and registered Crime No.110 of 2005

under the caption 'man missing' under Ext.P2(a) FIR.         In the

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span><p id="p_5">

meanwhile, two human legs were found floating in the back waters

beneath Cheepumkal bridge. Police was informed about the same.

The first information statement regarding that incident was given

as Ext.P86       and was recorded by P.W.68, who was the Sub

Inspector of Kottayam West Police Station. He registered Crime

No. 103 of 2005 under Ext.P6(a) FIR.         The legs were retrieved

with the assistance of P.W.17 and Ext.P8 is the relevant report.

After the inquest report, the limbs were sent for postmortem

examination. Ext.P87 is the inquest report. Meanwhile, P.W.73,

the Scientific Assistant attached to District Mobile Laboratory

collected samples of hairs from the legs. P.W.1 was informed

about the said fact and he went to the Medical College and

identified the legs as those of his son, namely, Praveen. P.W.71

conducted postmortem examination of the lower limbs and Ext.P92

is his report. Three incised wounds were noticed by the Forensic

Surgeon. The opinion given was that they did not appear to be

antemortem injuries.        On 19.2.2005 information was received in

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

the Vaikom Police Station that a torso in a plastic sack was found

floating on the eastern side of the Vembanadu lake, which is north

to the Thanneermukkom bund. P.W.17, the Circle Inspector of

Police, Vaikom was informed and Crime No.99 of 2005 was

registered as per Ext.89 FIR. P.W.1 identified the torso as that of

his son. P.W.17 conducted inquest and Ext.P90 is the relevant

report. It so happened that P.W.17 happened to see two upper

limbs floating in the water nearby and he had them retrieved.

P.W.1 identified those limbs as that of Praveen. M.Os. 1 to 3 were

recovered from the torso retrieved from the lake. The Scientific

Assistant, who was assisting the Circle Inspector took various

samples. As per the directions issued by the Superintendent of

Police, Kottayam, by order No.7893/05 dated 19.2.2005, the three

crimes were consolidated and investigation was entrusted to

P.W.77, the Dy.S.P., Kottayam. His investigation revealed the

involvement of accused Nos. 1 and 2.        On 24.2.2005 he had

arrested them. During investigation, P.W.77 was informed that a

human head enclosed in a sack was floating in the back waters of

Cochin. P.W.77 rushed to the place and had the skull retrieved

from the water. P.W.1 identified the same. Inquest was conducted

and Ext.P15 is the report. The accused were produced before court

and their custody was obtained by the police.        Based on the

confession statements said to have been given by the first accused,

several articles were recovered. P.W.77 recorded statements of

witnesses and prepared the necessary documents.              After

completing the investigation, he laid charge before court.

</p><p id="p_8">             4. JFCM, Ettumanoor took cognizance of the offence.

At the time of taking cognizance accused Nos.3, 4 and 5 had made

themselves scarce. The court on appearance of accused Nos.1 ad 2

completed the legal formalities. The said court found that the

offences are triable exclusively by a court of Sessions and

therefore committed the case against those accused persons to

District Court, Kottayam. The said court on receipt of records

issued summons to the first and second accused. They entered

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

appearance.       After hearing both sides, charge was framed for

offences punishable under Sections 506(2), 466, 471, 302, 201 and

364 read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_1">Section 120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code as against the

first accused and for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_3">201</a>

and <a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_4">364</a> read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_5">Section 120B</a> as against the second accused.

Both accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and claimed to be

tried.   Prosecution therefore examined P.Ws. 1 to 77 and had

Exts.P1 to P140 marked. M.Os. 1 to 76(d) were identified and

marked. After the close of the prosecution evidence the accused

were questioned under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_6">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             5. They denied all the incriminating circumstances

brought out against them and maintained that they were innocent.

The first accused had stated that Praveen was employed in the bus

run by his wife. Since he committed dereliction of duty and also

misbehaved with his wife, Praveen was sacked.          The issue

regarding the misconduct with his wife was settled between the

two families.        On 18.2.2005 at about 10.30 p.m. P.W.77,

Dy.S.P.Muraleedharan,          P.W.74  C.I. Anto   and   Assistant

Commissioner of Police, Mattancherry Mr. Lailaram had come to

his house at Palluruthy and taken him into custody by force. He

was produced before the court on the next day. They did not allow

him to talk to anybody. He denied that he had given any statement

to the police. He also claimed that nothing had been recovered in

pursuance to the statements alleged to have been given by him. He

denied that he had taken P.W.77 to any place or shown him any

substance. He claims to be innocent and that he had not committed

an act which should constitute an offence.

<p id="p_12">             6. The second accused maintained that he had no land

phone in his house. M.O.19 mobile phone, while he was at home

was being used by others also. On 15.2.2005 about evening his

brother Aneesh had used the mobile phone several times. On

19.2.2005, according to him, he was picked up from his house by

the police and produced before the court only on 25.2.2005, till

then he was kept in illegal custody. He denied of having given any

under <a href="/doc/19163/" id="a_7">Section 232</a> Cr.P.C., after hearing both sides the District

Court asked the accused to enter on their defence. The defence

examined D.W. 1 and had Exts.D1 to D35 marked. After hearing

both sides, the court below on an evaluation of the materials before

it came to the conclusion that the accused are guilty of the

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1983271/" id="a_8">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/454689/" id="a_9">201</a> and <a href="/doc/470765/" id="a_10">364</a> read with

of Rs.1,00,000/-, in default of payment of which to undergo simple

imprisonment for one year for the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">Section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_16">Section 120B</a> IPC. The second accused was

would be entitled to set off as per law. First and the second

accused challenged the above conviction and sentence.

</p><p id="p_17">             8. The prosecution case is that Praveen, the deceased,

was initially employed with the first accused. Since he betrayed

the confidence and faith reposed in him by the first accused, in

that Praveen developed an illicit relationship with the wife of first

accused, he had to leave the services of first accused. First accused

nursed a grudge against him and finally it resulted in the murder of

Praveen by the first accused with the aid of accused Nos.2 to 5.

The facts are that on 15.2.2005, the second accused in furtherance

of the conspiracy by the accused persons managed to take deceased

Praveen along with him from Ettumanoor to Kottayam. Thereafter

they had food in the hotel and then went for a movie. While on the

way back from Kottayam to Ettumanoor at the place called

Arpookkara, in furtherance of the conspiracy accused Nos. 3 to 5

took into their custody Praveen, who was brought on his motor

bike by accused No.2. Praveen was transported into a Maruti car

alleged to have been driven by the first accused. The further case

is that Praveen was strangulated to death and thereafter his body

was mutilated. The first accused is then said to have disposed off

various parts of the body of Praveen in different places.

</p><p id="p_19">             9. The challenges to the trial court judgment made by

the accused are mainly three fold. They are:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (i) There is nothing to show that the parts of the body

      retrieved are that of Praveen,;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (ii) The evidence of P.Ws. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13, on

      which the court below has placed considerable reliance,

      were not reliable and acceptable; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (iii) the various recoveries alleged to have been made

      based on the confession statement said to have been

      given by the first accused suffers from both legal and

      factual infirmities and is not acceptable in law.

      Therefore, those items of evidence will have to be

      eschewed.

</p><p id="p_22">            10. Before going into the issues agitated before this

court, it needs to be noticed that the case is built on circumstantial

evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_23">            11.       It is well settled that while appreciating

circumstantial evidence, it is stated that the courts must adopt a

very cautious approach and should record the conviction only if all

the links in the chain are complete, pointing to the guilt of the

accused and every hypothesis of innocence is capable of being

negatived on evidence. Great care must be taken in evaluating

circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably

capable of two inferences, the one in favour of the accused must

be accepted. The circumstances relied on must have been fully

established and must be consistent only with the hypothesis of

guilt. But it is not to say that the prosecution must meet each and

every hypothesis put forward by the defence, however far fetched

or fanciful it may be. The prosecution evidence must not be

rejected on the slightest doubt because law permits rejection, if the

doubt is reasonable and not otherwise.

decisions. It is unnecessary to refer to all of them. In the decision

reported in <a href="/doc/706731/" id="a_26">Chattar Singh v. State of Haryana</a> (AIR 2009 SC

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             "It has been consistently laid down by this Court

      that where a case rests squarely on circumstantial

      evidence, the inference of guilt can be justified only

      accused or the guilt of any other person. (<a href="/doc/102153/" id="a_27">See Hukam

<p id="p_44">             Sir Alfred Wills in his admirable book "Wills'

      Circumstantial Evidence" (Chapter VI) lays down the

      following rules specially to be observed in the case of

      circumstantial evidence: (1) the facts alleged as the

      basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and

      beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum

      probandum; (2) the burden of proof is always on the

      party who asserts the existence of any fact, which infers

      legal accountability; (3) in all cases, whether of direct

      or circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be

      adduced which the nature of the case admits; (4) in

      order to justify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory

      facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the

      accused and in capable of explanation, upon any other

      reasonable hypothesis that that of his guile, (5) if there

      be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, he

<p id="p_67">            15. The first of the issues agitated by the appellants is

regarding the identity of the parts of the body said to have been

retrieved by the investigating agency from various places. The

prosecution evidence is to the effect that Praveen was found

missing from 15.2.2005 onwards. Inspite of the best efforts on the

part of P.W.1 and his relatives, Praveen could not be located. A

complaint was, therefore,         laid before the Ettumanoor Police

Station on 18.2.2005. On 16.2.2005 police were informed about

two human legs floating in the back waters below the Cheepumkal

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                     22</span><p id="p_68">

bridge. One must notice here that the complaint by P.W.1 was laid

only on 18.2.2005. When the two lower limbs were retrieved by

the police, since they could not be identified, they kept it in the

Medical College Mortuary. After the complaint was received, it

appears that P.W.1 was taken to the Medical College Hospital

Mortuary and shown the legs. He identified those legs as that of

his son Praveen. P.W.71, the Forensic Surgeon had conducted

autopsy of the severed limbs and has furnished Ext.P92 report. It

discloses three incised wounds. However, P.W71 was of the view

that they were not antemortem injuries. On 19.2.2005 police were

informed about the torso in a plastic sack floating on the eastern

side of Vembanadu lake. P.W.17, the Circle Inspector of Police of

Vaikom Police Station retrieved the same from the lake. He

conducted inquest and Ext.P90 is the report. He also happened to

see two severed hands floating in the lake.      They were also

retrieved and conduced inquest over those limbs also. P.W.1, who

was called upon to have a look at the torso and upper limbs

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                     23</span><p id="p_69">

identified them as those of his son Praveen. P.W.71 conducted

postmortem examination of the two upper limbs retrieved by

P.W.17 and Ext.P94 is the report. P.W.71 co-related injury Nos. 2

and 3 in Ext.P94 report as complementary to injury Nos.1 and 2 in

Ext.P93 certificate. Such was the case of injury Nos. 4 and 5 in

Ext.P94 report with injury Nos.1 and 3 in Ext.P92.          He also

deposed before court that the torso must be of a person aged about

20 years and the upper and lower limbs are of the same person. He

has also stated that M.O.4 could be the weapon that could have

been used to severe the limbs. While P.W.77 had taken over

investigation, he was informed that the human head in a plastic

cover was seen near the ship dockyard of Cochin Naval Base. The

head was retrieved from the back waters and P.W.77 conducted

inquest. Ext.P15 is the report. On 25.2.2005 P.W.71 conducted

postmortem examination on the severed head and issued Ext.P95

certificate. From Ext.P95 certificate it can be seen that the horn of

hyoid bone got fractured by application of pressure on both sides

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                     24</span><p id="p_70">

of neck. The details of the finding by P.W.71 are contained in

Ext.P95 certificate. It is unnecessary to reproduce them here. The

opinion given by the doctor, who conducted autopsy, was that the

death must have been caused by the blunt force injury sustained to

the neck and that the neck could have been severed by using a

sharp cutting weapon. He placed the parts of the body at the

appropriate places and came to the conclusion that various parts of

the body belong to one and the same person and death was caused

by the blunt injury inflicted on the neck. Assuming that the body

belonged to Praveen, it is evident that death was a homicidal one.

</p><p id="p_71">            16. Though the parts of the body were prima facie

established as that of Praveen, prosecution went on to conduct

DNA test to prove and establish the identity. The evidence shows

that P.W.1 and his wife Ammini were taken to the Forensic

Science Laboratory at Chennai. P.W.76 conducted DNA analysis

and Ext.P4 is the report. Exts.P4(a) to P4(h) were blood samples

of the parents of Praveen. DNA was also extracted from the

portions of the limbs of late Praveen and they were examined. In

Ext.P4 report, conclusions are shown. It is seen that items 1 to 6

and 8 as shown in Ext.P4 belong to one and the same individual

and those items belonged to the Biological offspring of Pavithran

and Ammini. The couple had only two sons, namely, Jith and

Praveen. Jith is still alive. Obviously the mutilted body must be

that of their other son Praveen.
</p>
<p id="p_73">            17. Strong objection was taken to the DNA report and

the manner in which it was conducted. It was pointed out that

initially the body parts were taken to Rajiv Gandhi Centre for

Biotechnology       and     from there that it was forwarded to the

Forensic Science Laboratory at Chennai. There is no guarantee,

according to learned counsel for the appellants, that the parts of the

body forwarded to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Chennai

were the ones which were retrieved by the police from various

places as claimed by them. Therefore, according to the learned

counsel for the appellants, no sanctity can be attached to the report.

</p><p id="p_75">            18. Though the argument may look attractive, it is

without any substance whatsoever. There is nothing to indicate

that the articles forwarded to Rajiv Gandhi Centre for

Biotechnology were not properly sealed or packed. Nor is there

any evidence to show that they were indifferently handled. It was

kept in proper custody.           Initially the articles were sent for

examination to Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology from

JFCM, Ettumanoor to conduct DNA test based on the request

made by the Dy.S.P. Eight items were forwarded to the Institute.

Ext.P36 shows that all the items were received by the Rajiv Gandhi

Centre for Biotechnology. Thereafter the Dy.S.P. made a request

to JFCM, Ettumanoor that the articles may be recalled and

forwarded to Chennai Forensic Science Laboratory. The reason

given was that Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology was not a

fully Government owned concern and therefore to avoid any

controversy, he would like to have the DNA test conducted in the

Chennai Forensic Science Laboratory. After getting the articles

back from the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, they were

forwarded to the Chennai Forensic Science Laboratory. There is

nothing to indicate that the articles sent were not the ones

forwarded to Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology and also that

the articles forwarded to the Chennai Forensic Science Laboratory

were different or were not in proper condition.       The material

objects were properly packed and sealed. The relevant document

did not indicate that there had been any tampering at any point of

time by any person. Except for a bald allegation that it could have

been manipulated, there is not even an iota of evidence to justify

such a claim.        The evidence of P.W.76 guarantees that no

tampering had been done.
</p>
<p id="p_77">            19. In order to establish that the parts of the body

retrieved are that of Praveen, superimposition test was also

conducted. As already noticed, on retrieving the head from the

backwaters, P.W.71 had conducted autopsy and furnished Ext.P95

report. From Ext.P95 it could be seen that the skull and mandibles

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                     28</span><p id="p_78">

were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Trivandrum for

superimposition test.          Photographs of Praveen were also

forwarded.      M.O.75(a) is the skull and M.O.76 series are the

photographs. The Assistant Director( Biology) attached to FSL

furnished Ext.P54 report. The report says that for the reasons

mentioned in the report, the skull sent to the Laboratory is that of

Praveen.     True, some infirmities had been pointed out by the

defence regarding the report. But, Ext.P54 report gives all the

details. No serious defect or infirmity could be pointed out by the

defence regarding the superimposition technique adopted for

identifying the skull. The report is admissible under <a href="/doc/692331/" id="a_49">Section 293</a>

Cr.P.C. without the oral evidence of the expert. If as a matter of

fact the defence had any objection or had any disagreement with

the same, it was for them to have the witness concerned examined.

No such request seems to have been made by the accused. It is too

late to contend that superimposition technique is defective.

</p><p id="p_80">            20. Even assuming that the superimposition test is not

fully acceptable, a more clinching evidence is the DNA test

conducted. The report shows that it is almost fool proof.

</p><p id="p_81">            21. There is abundant      evidence in this case to show

that the limbs, torso and the skull retrieved by the police officers

from various places as already mentioned are that of late Praveen.

The court below was right in holding so. It also follows that the

death of Praveen was due to the inflicted injuries and it is a clear

case of homicide.

<p id="p_82">            22.     What next comes up for consideration is the

evidence of P.Ws. 7, 8, 9, 10 12 and 13, who identified the

accused persons and speak about the incident.

</p><p id="p_83">            23. The incident can be divided into two parts. The

first part at Ettumanoor and the second part at Kottayam. Festival

was going on in the temple at Ettumanoor. According to the

prosecution, the second accused picked up the victim, namely,

Praveen from Ettumanoor and went to Kottayam. He was later on

handed over to first accused, who did the objectionable acts.

Praveen was previously employed with the first accused. He was

thrown out from the job due to reasons which will be referred to

later, and thereafter Praveen joined a mattress company           at

Ettumanoor as a driver in that concern. He worked for first

accused till 24.11.2004. P.W.3 is his former colleague.

</p><p id="p_85">            24.        Before    dealing with   the  happenings   at

Ettumannoor, it will be useful to refer to certain relevant facts

which reveal the probable motive for the act committed by the first

accused. We will come back to the evidence of P.W.1, who is

none other than the father of the victim. P.W.2 is a close relative

of the victim and in fact P.W.1 is his father's brother. P.Ws. 1 and

2 are residing nearby to each other. They say that Praveen was

employed as a conductor of the bus owned by the first accused and

the driver of the car belonging to the first accused. Praveen was

staying in a lodge. First accused was residing with his family

there. Their evidence would show that accused Nos.1 and 2 are

related to them. P.W.1 was employed at Trivandrum. Two months

prior to the incident, P.W.1 says that he received a call from the

father of P.W.2.        He was informed that Praveen was in deep

trouble and he be brought home immediately from Palluruthy,

where he was employed with the first accused. The first accused

was then working in Malappuram. The information passed on was

that the first accused had come to know about some very

obtectionable act committed by Praveen and before he reaches

Palluruthy, Praveen should be removed from there. Since P.W.1

was unable to come down immediately, he requested the father of

P.W.2 to take such steps as are necessary. P.W.2 and two others

went to Palluruthy and brought back Praveen, that is on

25.11.2004. On the same day itself, P.W.2 says that they received a

call from the aunt of Praveen, namely, Vijayamma, about the threat

to Praveen and she asked them to remove him to a safe place. It

was due to these reasons they had gone and brought back Praveen.

In fact C.W.7 and C.W.4, the brother of P.W.2 and the brother of

the victim had gone to Palluruthy to bring back Praveen. Praveen

was told that his mother was very sick. As soon as they reached

their home, P.W.2 says that they received a call from the first

accused. He wanted Praveen to be taken to him immediately. He

mentioned about the unholy relationship Praveen had with his

wife. He had threatened that if gets Praveen, he will chop him.

The threat was followed by a tirade of abuses. P.W.2 sought the

advice of P.W.1 regarding the taking of Praveen to the first

accused. P.W.1 thought it fit and proper to send Praveen to first

accused. He advised P.W.2 to do so. P.W.2 says that he along

with his father C.W.5, Ammini C.W.3 and C.W.8, brother of

C.W.5 took Praveen in a car to Palluruthy, where first accused

resided. Initially P.W.2 and Praveen stood outside the door and

others went in. After about ten minutes when P.W.2 and Praveen

entered the house, first accused rushed at Praveen and thrashed

him. P.W.2 and others somehow managed to save Praveen. First

accused had stated that he will not let Praveen live. P.W.2 and

others then asked Praveen whether the allegations were true. He

initially denied and said that it was a scandal spread by Aji, the

Manager of the first accused for personal gains. Then Aji was

called and asked about the same. He said that on a particular day

when he had come to the office in the early morning he found

Praveen and the wife of first accused in a compromising position.

When Praveen was again asked about the said incident, he chose

not to reply. P.W.2 would say that then the persons who were

there asked Praveen to fall at the feet of first accused and

apologize for his acts and Praveen did so. Then first accused had

told Praveen that if he ever steps his feet in Ernakulam, that would

be his end. P.W.2 says that he and others returned with Praveen to

Ettumanoor.

<p id="p_89">            25. After two or three days P.W.1 returned home. He

found Praveen in a deplorable state.         He had taken him to

Trivandrum for treatment. It was after returning from Trivandrum

that Praveen had taken up the job with the mattress company at

Ettumanoor. Both P.Ws.1 and 2 says that P.W.1 and his family

were not invited for the betrothal ceremony of second accused,

which was held on 12.2.2005. First accused had attended the

function and had asked whether Praveen had come. P.W.2 has

also stated that the mother of second accused called him and told

him not to come for the function as first accused would be coming

for the same.        Though P.W.1 says that several other things

happened thereafter there is no corroborative evidence in that

regard.
</p>
<p id="p_91">            26. However, the fact remains that first accused had

animosity towards Praveen as the latter had done unpardonable

acts. One must here notice that first accused had absolute faith and

trust in Praveen and allowed him to reside in the lodge. He had

absolute freedom in the house of first accused also.

</p><p id="p_92">            27. There is serious challenge to the assault alleged to

have been made by first accused to Praveen and so also to the

declaration said to have been made by the first accused at his

residence as well as at the occasion of the betrothal of the second

accused. One must notice that the act committed by the victim was

grave, humiliating and agonizing as far as the first accused is

concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_94">            28. Coming back to the facts of the case, on the date of

the incident, that is, on 15.2.2005, it appears that the second

accused had persuaded Praveen to go with him in the evening.

Praveen had not informed those in his house that he was going to

Kottayam. The evidence of P.W.59 would show that on the said

date Praveen had left the firm at Ettumanoor, where he was

working, at about 3.30 p.m.. P.W.7 claims to know both Praveen

and second accused from his childhood. He resides near to the

house of second accused. At about 5 p.m. on the date of the

incident, that is, on 15.2.2005, while he was coming from the

KSRTC Bus Stand to the main road for going to the temple, he

claims to have seen the second accused coming on a motor bike.

He also saw Praveen standing in the northern varanda of the

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                     36</span><p id="p_95">

Textile shop nearby. He saw the second accused going towards

Praveen. After talking for sometime, Praveen mounted the motor

bike driven by the second accused and they went towards

Kottayam.
</p>
<p id="p_96">            29. The evidence of this witness is criticized mainly on

the ground that he had poor eye sight and his statement that he saw

Praveen standing on the northern varanda of the Textile shop is

incorrect. Objection was also taken to the act of P.W.7 identifying

Praveen on a photograph shown to him. It was pointed out by the

learned counsel appearing for the appellants that by his poor eye

sight, it is inconceivable that P.W.7 could have noticed Praveen

standing in the varanda of the Textile shop. P.W.7 had stated that

he saw Praveen standing on the northern varanda of the textile

shop. Referring to the sketch prepared in the case, it was argued

that the varanda is on the southern side of the textile shop. It was

also contended that it is rather inconceivable that P.W.7 could have

identified Praveen on a photograph shown to him.

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                     37</span><p id="p_97">

</p><p id="p_98">            30. None of the above contentions have any basis. The

evidence is clear to the effect that both the second accused and

Praveen were very familiar to P.W.7 from the childhood. So there

would have been no difficulty for P.W.7 to identify Praveen from a

photograph shown to him. The distance between the place where

P.W.7 was standing and where he saw Praveen                  is not

considerable. Ext.P56 prepared by the Village Officer shows the

location of the building, road etc. True, going by the sketch the

textile shop had a varenda on the southern side and further south is

the main road. It is on this basis that the contention is taken that

the claim of P.W.7 cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_99">            31.     The statement of P.W.7 regarding the varanda,

where Praveen was standing was a relative one. He was standing

on the southern side of the road, and viewed from there, the

varanda will be on the northern side. That probably is the reason

why he had stated that Praveen was seen standing on the northern

varanda of the textile shop. P.W.7 has also stated that he saw

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

second accused coming in a motor bike and going near Praveen

and after chatting for sometime, he would say that Praveen

mounted the motor bike of second accused and they went towards

Kottayam. There is nothing to show that P.W.7 was speaking

falsehood or that he had any ill-motive in speaking against second

accused. He has given a reasonable explanation for his presence

at Ettumanoor on the date of the incident. These aspects are not

challenged much in cross-examination. The evidence of P.W.7 in

this regard is consistent and is therefore acceptable.

</p><p id="p_101">            32. Before going further into the matter, it may be

useful to refer to the decision regarding the appreciation of

evidence. It is well settled that precedence are of no help in the

matter of appreciation of evidence adduced in a case. Each case

depends upon its own facts. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_50">The Evidence Act</a> does not laid down

any principle regarding the weight to be given on an item of

evidence, nor has it stipulated the minimum number of witnesses

that need to be examined for proving a fact.      One cannot expect

arithematic precision from a witness. Perfect proof is virtually

impossible in an imperfect world and the absolute certainty is

really a myth. Therefore the Evidence Act provides that a fact is

taken as proved if the court, after considering the matter before it,

either believes it to exist or it considers its existence so probable

that a prudent man in the circumstances of the case to act upon the

supposition that it exists. The approach laid down is that the court

should not start with the presumption that the testimony is a false

one, but whether there is sufficient probability or truth in it and

whether the statement given by the witnesses are satisfactory. The

faith of a court shall not depend upon the number of witnesses

examined, but that also does not mean that the          court should

readily accept the evidence of the witnesses.        The court must

ensure that the evidence brought before         is admissible.   The

testimony given by the witness shall not be taken in isolation. It

shall be considered along with the other circumstances and its

probability. The probable reasonable course that would be adopted

is to read the evidence as a whole and see if there is a ring of truth

in it. It will also be useful to notice whether there is uniformity

among the witnesses regarding the incident.          The mere non-

examination or non-production of a document need not always be

fatal. It must be borne in mind that mere suspicion cannot take the

place of proof.
</p>
<p id="p_104">             33. It is also useful to mention the principles regarding

'appreciation of evidence'. In the decision reported in <a href="/doc/1283418/" id="a_51">State of

      our opinion, reference to those authorities is rather

      misplaced. The fate of the present case like that of

      has primarily to be decided by referring to his evidence

      his evidence taken in the context of the other facts of the

      case. Criminal cases cannot be put in a straight jacket.

      Though there may be similarity between the fact of

      in one case and that produce in another. Decided cases

      can be of help if there be a question of law like the

</p><p id="p_108">            35. If the above principles are borne in mind, it can be

seen that there is no reason to suspect the evidence of P.W.7.

There is nothing to show that he had any reason to speak falsehood

against the second accused. His presence at the place is explained

by him. He seems to be a natural and probable witness.

</p><p id="p_109">            36. The scene now shifts to Kottayam. According to

the prosecution as a result of the conspiracy hatched between

accused Nos.1 and 2 to do away with Praveen, second accused had

to bring the deceased to Kottayam. Thereafter Praveen was to be

delivered to first accused, who would further deal with him. Both

of them knew that these acts could be done only late in the night

and also that Praveen should not suspect that any harm was

awaiting him. The act had to be done in a desolate place. Since

the second accused had collected Praveen by about 5.30 p.m. from

Ettumanoor, he had to spend some time in Kottayam before taking

Praveen to the first accused. This he had to do without giving

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

any room for suspicion. He had to play his cards well, and he did

it well.
</p>
<p id="p_111">            37. The prosecution case is that the second accused had

taken Paraveen to the Bar near the KSRTC Bus stand called

Arcadia Bar. Ext.P9 is the plan prepared by the Village Officer of

the Bar. It gives a clear picture of the place. The evidence is to the

effect that they reached the bar at about 6.30 p.m and remained

there till 8.30 p.m. P.W.9 was the person who served food and

drinks to second accused and the deceased. He had identified the

second accused in court. He also identified the photographs of

Praveen and stated before court that it was Praveen who had come

along with the second accused on the relevant day. He had also

stated that it was the second accused who had paid the bill and they

left the Bar at about 8.30 p.m..
</p>
<p id="p_112">            38. The evidence of this witness is attacked on several

grounds. It is pointed out that it is rather inconceivable that a bar

attender, who meets hundreds of people every day could identify

those persons at a later stage. According to the learned counsel for

the appellants the very suggestion itself on the face of it looks

absurd. It is stated that the evidence is clearly manipulated. It is

also pointed out that in the statement given before the learned

Magistrate under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_54">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. he had not specified the date

and time of the arrival of second accused and Praveen and they

left the Bar at 9 p.m. He was confronted with the earlier statement

given to the police.       Ext.D4, which is the statement given to the

police is claimed to be in contradiction with the one given in court.

In the statement given to the police he had stated that second

accused and Praveen had taken food from the hotel.

</p><p id="p_114">            39.      The question is whether the above socalled

inconsistencies and contradictions are sufficient to throw out the

evidence of P.W.9. The essential fact that is sought to be proved is

the presence of second accused and the deceased at the Bar till

8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m.. Whether it was actually 8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m.

makes little difference.       One must remember that the statement

given to the police is soon after the incident and the testimony in

court come thereafter. It may not be possible for a witness to

retain all the minute details so as to exactly reproduce them before

court. As regards the occasion for noting the persons, P.W.9 has

spoken about the unusual conduct of accused No.2 and Praveen

while they were taking food and drinks. There is absolutely no

reason to disbelieve this witness at all. It is significant to notice

that the postmortem of the torso of Praveen was done on

20.2.2005. The Forensic Surgeon was able to detect rice in the

stomach of Praveen.          It was P.W.71 who had conducted the

autopsy and preferred Ext.P94 report.        He had also collected

viscera for chemical examination. P.W.64, who conducted the

chemical examination of the viscera furnished Ext.P77 report.

That report shows that ethyl alcohol was detected in the sample.

Merely because there are some insignificant and minor omissions

or commissions in the evidence of P.W.9, that by itself is not a

ground to reject his evidence when there is nothing to show that

P.W.9 had any ill-will or ill-motive to falsely implicate accused

No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_117">            40. As per the prosecution case, after leaving the Bar

accused No.2 and the deceased were said to have moved towards a

'thattukada' (a mobile four wheel cart providing food, usually,

during night time). The business was owned by P.W.13 and P.W.8

was his employee. The evidence of P.W.13 shows that he had

identified accused Nos.1 and 2 in court. As per his evidence on

15.2.2005 at about 8.30 p.m. the second accused along with

Praveen had come to his unit. He was running his business at a

place, by the side of the road, opposite to the Arcadia Bar. P.W.8

is his employee. P.W.13 says that Praveen and accused No.2 had

taken bull's eye (half fried eggs) from his shop. Accused No.2

was familiar to P.W.8. Here one may at once refer to the evidence

of P.W.8. P.W.8 says that while first accused was working at

Kottayam, he was working in a hotel by name Suresh Hotel.

P.W.8 used to take food to the control room for the first accused.

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

He says about accused No.2 having come to the thattukada along

with another person. He says that then accused No.2 introduced

Praveen to him. He then asked where they were going. The reply

was that they were going to see a movie. P.W.8 says that accused

No.2 asked him for suggestion about a movie and he suggested the

movie "..........................". Thereafter the second accused and

Praveen left the place. Both P.W.8 and P.W.13 say that their

small unit functions from           8 p.m to    2 a.m. every day. On

15.2.2005 at about 11.45 p.m. both of them had occasion to see

the first accused arriving in a Maruti car and stopping near Arcadia

Bar. Three other persons got down from the van. P.Ws.8 and 13

would say that they had occasion to see the first accused walking

towards K.S.R.T.C. Bus stand. The other three persons came to

their cart and had black coffee. They say that the first accused

immediately returned to the van.            First accused occupied the

driver's seat. A short while thereafter they had occasion to see the

second accused and Praveen going in a motor bike. They also

lifted his hand and waived and thereafter the van was seen

following the motor bike.
</p>
<p id="p_120">            41. Severe criticisms were levelled against and strong

objections were taken against the testimony of P.Ws. 8 and 13. It

is contended that they are unreliable, tutored, manipulated and

planted witnesses.        According to the learned counsel for the

appellants, it is difficult to believe that if accused Nos. 1 and 2 had

a plan to do away with Praveen, accused No.2 would                have

ventured to introduce Praveen to P.W.8. It is also pointed out that

both P.Ws. 8 and 13 had deviated a lot from their earlier version

and there are significant omissions. They are unworthy of credit

and that their evidence should be ignored.
</p>
<p id="p_121">            42. It is difficult to accept the above contentions. True,

there are some inconsistencies and contradictions marked as

evidence of both P.W.8 and P.W.13 with reference to the

statements given by them to the Magistrate are not sufficient to

reject their evidence in toto.       The infirmities pointed are the

omission to mention the dates in the earlier statement and reference

is made to the paper report.
</p>
<p id="p_123">            43. It is significant to notice that the versions of P.Ws.8

and 13 are uniform and consistent. The contention that if the

allegations are true, accused No.2 would not have ventured to

introduce Praveen to P.W.8 does not appear to be very convincing.

P.W.8 had specifically stated that accused Nos. 1 and 2 are familiar

to him and he had previous acquaintance with him. There is no

reason to disbelieve the testimony of P.Ws.8 and 13, which is

supported by reasons. One must remember that accused No.2 had

to make sure that Praveen did not get any clue of the the plan

hatched by accused Nos. 1 and 2 and he had to be as cordial as

possible.       In such a situation, there is nothing wrong in the

conduct of accused No.2 introducing Praveen to P.W.8. At any

rate, usually an enquiring glance would have been shot at Praveen

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

by P.W.8 when he had come along with accused No.2 to take food

from the thattukada. In such circumstances it is only normal to

presume that accused No.2 would have introduced Praveen. There

is nothing unusual about it.        One has to again remember that

accused No.2 could not venture an unusual conduct as he had to

keep Praveen away from suspecting his intentions and moves.

Viewed from that angle, none of the grounds urged by the learned

counsel for the appellants to discard their evidence is sustainable.

</p><p id="p_125">            44. The next witness, who speaks in favour of the

prosecution is P.W.12. He is a resident of Kottayam and he has

been driving autorickshaw for the last several years.         He has

identified accused Nos.1 and 2. He says that he saw accused No.1

for the first time on 15.2.2005. As per his evidence a short while

after 12 in the night, he was hired to go from Baker Junction to

MCH at a short distance from Chemmanampady. He found a

motor bike and a Maruti van parked by the side of the road. He

claims to have seen two persons coming out of the Maruti van and

forcing the pillion rider on the motor bike into the van and he then

saw the van sped away. The motor bike followed the van. He also

followed them. He had stated that he was able to identify one of

the persons, who got out from the Maruti van and that was accused

No.1. He claims that the person, who was riding the motor bike

was accused No.2. He also identified before court the person who

was forced into the van. When Ext.P3 photograph of Praveen was

shown to him, he had stated it was the same person who was seen

being forced into the van. He had also given the registration

number of the van before court. He identified M.O.5 as the vehicle

seen by him. In cross-examination he stated that from the place

where he had seen the incident till MCH on one side and the police

station on the other side the road lies straight. On either side of the

road are paddy fields.

<p id="p_130">             46. Like in the case of earlier witness, severe criticism

is levelled against this witness also. It is pointed out that his

evidence shows that he had seen accused Nos.1 and 2 for the first

time on 15.2.2005 and so, they were total strangers to him. He

admitted that he had not mentioned this fact before the learned

Magistrate when examined under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_55">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. Some of the

contradictions between his earlier version to the police and his

statement before court have also been marked. It is also contended

that in the light of the fact that accused Nos.1 and 2 were strangers,

the investigating agency ought to have conducted an identification

parade.     Admittedly P.W.12 had no familiarity or previous

acquaintance with accused Nos.1 and 2. In the absence of any

identification parade at the investigation stage, his identification of

the accused and the deceased through his photograph has to be

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                     55</span><p id="p_131">

discarded. It was also contended that accused No.1 and others are

not so foolish to take the route as claimed by P.W.12 since they

must be credited with the knowledge that if they did the act on that

road, they could easily be noticed since that was the road leading to

the Medical College Hospital. They would have ensured that if at

all they wanted to do the act, that would have been in an isolated

place and they would not have been so stupid to do it below the

street light enabling passing vehicles to notice what they were

doing. Therefore, it is contended that the evidence of this witness

has to be eschewed.
</p>
<p id="p_132">             47.    Though the contention may appear to be well

founded and sound, on a closer scrutiny, it can be found to be

weak. One must remember that Praveen, the deceased had no idea

that accused No.2 was leading him to a trap. The deceased had to

return to Ettumanoor from Kottayam after seeing the movie. There

is nothing to show that after seeing the movie accused No.2 and

Praveen had any other program except to return home. Accused

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                     56</span><p id="p_133">

No.2 had to ensure that the route he took to return to Ettumannoor

and so also his conduct should not give rise to any suspicion in

Praveen, which would have alerted him. One shall not forget that

first accused was a seasoned police officer, who had worked in

Kottayam and well aware of the location and place. Therefore,

accused No.2 had to take a normal route to Ettumanoor. Keeping

this in mind, accused No.1 had to find a convenient route and

convenient place to take hold of Praveen. Viewed from that angle,

it can be easily seen that the only possible route was the route

chosen by accused Nos. 1 and 2. Though there is an easier route,

the route chosen on the ill-fated day by accused No. 2 was also an

alternative route. Accused No.2 must have given some reason to

take the slightly circuitous route. So, possibly Praveen did not

suspect any harm to him. Equally unacceptable is the contention

that when the road lay straight for a long distance on either side,

accused No.1 would not have ventured to carry out his dubious act.

One must notice that accused No.1 had no other choice. He had to

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

do it on that road. As already noticed, he had worked in Kottayam

and he knew the route well.              Accused No.2 belonged to

Ettumanoor.       He knew the route well.      They had selected a

convenient and relatively safe place without deviating much from

the regular road to Ettumanoor. One cannot omit to note that

Praveen the deceased was also familiar with the geography of

Kottayam and any unusual deviation from the regular route would

have alerted him and that would have aborted the attempt of the

accused persons. Viewed in this context accused Nos.1 and 2 had

to act at the given moment available to them and they did so and

dragged Praveen into the van. They could little worry about the

street light or the headlights of the vehicles passing by. Therefore

the criticism that the road was lying straight and the availability

of street light etc., are of no significance.
</p>
<p id="p_135">             48. The evidence of P.W.12 will clearly show that

traffic is very scarce on the road at the relevant time. Accused

Nos. 1 and 2 must be credited with sufficient knowledge that

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                     58</span><p id="p_136">

considering the various aspects, their best chance was to act on that

route, which accused No.2 had chosen on the date of the incident.

The contention based on the identification parade needs to be

considered. True, going by the evidence of P.W.12, accused Nos.

1 and 2 were unfamiliar to him and seeing them for the first time

going by the evidence in court. But to say that identification

parade at the investigation stage is a mandatory requirement may

not be correct in law. This aspect has come up for consideration in

several decisions. It is well settled that it is the identification in

court that forms substantive evidence and identification during

investigation is only to lend assurance to the investigating officer

that he is proceeding in the proper direction and certainly it will

corroborate the identification in court.           There may be

circumstances even when the persons who happened to see a

stranger is able to identify the stranger at a later stage. Several

factors will have to be taken into consideration before one can say

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

that P.W.12 would not be able to identify accused Nos.1 and 2 at a

later stage.
</p>
<p id="p_138">             49.     Probably the possibility of P.W.12 having

identified the man who was dragged into the van as Praveen may

not be capable of acceptance. Even if the first accused and his

companions noticed the approaching auto driven by P.W.12, they

had no choice but to go on with their objectionable act. One must

remember here that they could not take any risk because Praveen,

at the slightest opportunity will react violently and if Praveen had

an opportunity to notice the first accused earlier, he would have

smelt a rat and would have tried to escape. So the argument that

P.W.12 could not have seen the first accused at all cannot be

accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_139">             50.    But there may be some embellishments in his

evidence regarding the incident. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 would

have completed the act within a short span of time. It may not be

possible that P.W.12 could note the features of those persons. The

time available would not have been sufficient for him to keenly

watch accused Nos. 1 and 2 and the deceased.             The act of

identifying the victim from his passport size photograph seems to

be unconvincing. But that does not mean that his evidence in toto

has to be thrown out. The fact remains that atleast his evidence as

regards the act of accused Nos.1, 2 and others in forcing a person

from the motor bike into the van has to be accepted.

He too is an autorickshaw driver by profession. According to his

evidence, at about 12.30 - 1 in the night near Arpookara temple he

happened to see a Maruti van parked on the side of the road. He

saw one person standing near the front door of the vehicle. He

identified the vehicle as M.O.5, which was produced in court. The

criticism levelled against the evidence of this witness is that it is

highly artificial and he is a planted witness. According to the

learned counsel for the appellants, his evidence is unacceptable.

</p><p id="p_146">             53. There is no justification for the above criticism. All

that he has stated is that while he was returning from the Medical

College Hospital, he found the vehicle, M.O.5, parked by the side

of the road. He says that he thought that the vehicle had developed

some trouble and he might get a trip. Even assuming that the claim

made by him is one that the person, who was standing by the side

of the vehicle, had told him that someone has been sent up is not

acceptable, the fact remains that the vehicle was located at the

place during the odd hours of the night.           To that extent his

witnesses have been examined by the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_59">Section 164</a>

Cr.P.C. and those witnesses are before the court also. But their

statements under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_60">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. are not seen marked as

exhibits. A reading of the judgment of the court below show that

both sides referred to the same in detail and the court below has

also referred to the same in its judgment. It is well settled that the

statement under <a href="/doc/228024/" id="a_61">Section 164</a> can be used both for corroboration

and contradiction of the author of the statement.

</p><p id="p_160">             58. The crucial witnesses in this case as rightly pointed

out by the defence are autorickshaw drivers and people running

When a statement is taken under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_63">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C., it is a

voluntary statement given by the witnesses before the learned

none to put questions to him or extract answers from him. Of

course a court conscious of its duty can extract materials from him.

</p><p id="p_162">             59. In court, when these witnesses whose statements

under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_64">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. had been taken, were examined, they

were asked as to why they did not speak the details, the reply given

was interesting. It seems that the learned Magistrate asked the

witnesses to mount the box and oath was administered. Then they

were asked to state what they wanted. They had no clue as to

what they had to speak. Therefore they simply spoke what came to

their mind      at that point of time, whether it was relevant or

irrelevant. The witnesses cannot be deemed to carry so much of

wisdom to enable them to know what are the essential facts they

need to state before the learned Magistrate. It is significant to

notice that when the witnesses paused after giving few statements,

they were simply asked, 'have you finished, you can go'. It is very

significant to note that the learned Magistrate did not properly

conduct the proceedings and did only a mechanical work.             A

judicial officer conscious of his duty would have taken pains to get

relevant details from the witness before him.

certainly be the failure of administration of justice.

</p><p id="p_165">             61. It is significant to notice that in most of the cases,

the criticism was that the statement before the Magistrate is not as

clear as the one given before court and the evidence in court is a

subsequent embellishment. Compared to the statement recorded

under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_65">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C., it may be so. But it is significant to

notice that all these witnesses have given earlier statements before

the investigating officer, which is their earliest version. Except for

a few minor instances, the defence was not able to show any

material inconsistency or omission in the evidence given by the

witnesses to make their evidence unworthy of credit. It is not

intended to say that the court could seek corroboration from the

statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_66">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. But it is only to show that the

witnesses have been given a consistent version regarding what they

had seen and perceived. It is in the light of these circumstances the

statement given by them under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_67">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. will have to be

considered. Therefore, their evidence cannot be discarded on that

ground. It was then pointed out that most of the witnesses are on

the lower strata of the society like autorickshaw drivers and people

who run thattukada and the prosecution was not able to find any

witness who are engaged in decent avocations. The suggestion is

that the witnesses brought in by the prosecution were obliged to

the police officers for earning their livelihood.

witnesses as their presence is well accounted for.        It is also

significant to note that the claim of P.Ws. 8 and 13 that accused

Nos.1 and 2 were familiar to them seems highly probable. They

have given good reasons also for the same. One may recall here

that accused No.1 had worked in Kottayam and these people would

have certainly known him from then onwards.

one criminal case each. One has to keep in mind the place and the

time at which they were to work. Whether it is for the said fact the

prosecution evidence can be disbelieved? They can only present

what is available and possible. The point to be considered is

whether those witnesses, who are produced by the prosecution

could have been present at the relevant place at the relevant time

and their evidence stand scrutiny. The real test is to see whether

no suggestion to any of these witnesses that they had any specific

reason to speak against accused Nos. 1 and 2 or that they were ill-

motivated towards them.

15.2.2005 and the case came up for trial within six months. The

incident had rocked the whole State since a police officer was

involved and the act was abhorrent and gruesome. Incident had

blown out of proportion by media. Since trial was conducted very

soon, it is possible for the witnesses to remember many of the

things unlike in a case where trial takes place three or four years

after the incident. On a careful consideration, it can be seen that

the so called embellishments, inconsistencies, contradictions etc.,

do not affect the crux and substance of the prosecution case. They

need not be given undue importance and significance.

One must remember that crime is not committed on invitation,

more so in a case of horrendous crimes. One cannot omit to note

that people are reluctant to offer themselves as witnesses in any

case for several reasons. As far as the witnesses whose evidence

has been discussed, they have given reasons for their presence at

the relevant place and at the relevant time and there is n reason to

disbelieve them.       Even assuming that they can be labelled as

chance witnesses, their evidence can be relied on (See the

various recoveries made on the basis of the statements said to have

been given by the first accused. All the confession statements

alleged to have been given by the first accused relating to various

materials have something or other to do with the issue on hand.

Before going into that aspect, it has been pointed out that even

though the arrest of accused Nos.1 and 2 was seen recorded on

24.2.2005, in fact the first accused had been in custody from

18.2.2005 onwards.         According to the learned counsel for the

appellants there are several materials to prove this fact. Therefore

he was in illegal custody from 18.2.2005 till 24.2.2005. He had

complained to the Magistrate concerned when he was produced on

24.2.2005. Therefore the so called statements extracted and such

other materials which were discovered and recovered during the

period of illegal detention thereof cannot be accepted. This can be

seen from a perusal of M.O.13 mobile phone, which belonged to

the first accused. It was seized on 18.2.2005 and there was no call

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

made after 18.2.2005. It was also contended that soon after the

detention was made on 18.2.2005, statements were extracted from

him and therefore the recoveries said to have been made on the

basis of the statements alleged to have been given on 24.2.2005

cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_183">             72. Though the above argument may look attractive, it

seems to be without merit on a closer scrutiny. The police officers

unless they could have some materials could not proceed against

accused Nos.1 and 2. One has to keep in mind that accused No.1 is

a seasoned police officer. Until and unless some of the links were

identified and located, nobody had a clue about the involvement of

accused No.1. Therefore, though the police officers suspected the

involvement of the first accused, they still had to wait.      It is

possible that accused No.1 would have been under surveillance or

could have been called for questioning. May be also that accused

No.1 might have been asked to wait in the Police Club for

interrogation. But such acts on behalf of the investigating officers

and other police officers cannot be treated as being in custody or

that he has been arrested earlier. One cannot insist that unless and

until he is arrested, he shall not be interrogated.          Several

questioning sessions might have been necessary to ascertain

whether accused No.1 was actually involved in the incident. But

that is far from saying that he was arrested on 18.2.2005. So is the

case of accused No.2, who claims that he was arrested on

19.2.2005.

<p id="p_185">             73. The first of the recoveries related to M.O.5 Maruti

van. According to P.W.77, the investigating officer, on 24.2.2005

on the basis of Ext.P115(a) confession statement said to have been

given by the first accused, he had the van seized as per Ext.P114

mahazar. P.W.77 says that the seizure was at the behest of the first

accused himself. The said vehicle, infact, belonged to the brother-

in-law of P.W.6. Since the brother-in-law of P.W.6 did not have

space to park the vehicle in his house, the van was being parked in

the compound of P.W.6.            The evidence of P.W.6 shows that

accused No.1 was familiar to him. The colour of the van is green.

It was identified in court. On 15.2.2005, P.W.6 would say that, the

first accused had come to his house. It is stated by this witness that

the first accused had told him that his vehicle had developed some

trouble and he wanted to use the vehicle parked in the house of

P.W.6 for a day. P.W.6 then replied that he would get the consent

of the owner and let him know. Later in the day, according to

P.W.6, the van was taken by the first accused. P.W.6 has given

evidence to the effect that the police, after a few days, had brought

first accused to his house and there was another person along with

him. Accused No.1 went near the van and told the police officers

that he had used the said van on 15.2.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_187">             74. The evidence of P.W.6 shows that the vehicle was

returned by about 1.30 p.m on 16.2.2005. The evidence of P.W.6

is to the effect that it was subsequently used by its owner and

others. The defence had pointed out before the court below that

the van was returned on 16.2.2005 and the seizure was only on

24.2.2005. In the meanwhile it had been used by several persons.

So there is no proper recovery and that the evidence so obtained

cannot be used against the accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_189">             75. One has to immediately notice that the Assistant

Scientific Officer, who had assisted the police officer had collected

blood stains from the floor of the car and he was able to collect

hairs also. There is nothing to show that as claimed by the accused

persons, the confession statements were made before 24.2.2005.

The relevant portions of the confession statements clearly show

authorship of concealment and the factum of concealment. As per

Ext. P99 report M.Os. 24 to 37 were collected by the Scientific

Assistant. During investigation, the investigating officer had made

arrangements to procure hair samples from the body of Praveen.

The hairs so collected by him compared well with the hair

collected by the Scientific Officer from the Maruti van as per

Ext.P99 report. This clearly shows that the said van was used by

accused No.1 for his purpose. Even assuming that there is any

infirmity in the confession statements said to have been made by

the first accused, at any rate the recovery of the van at his instance

is a conduct, which is relevant under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_73">Section 8</a> of the Indian

Evidence Act.
</p>
<p id="p_191">             76.     P.W.77 has stated that, during interrogation,

accused No.1 had stated that he would show the place where the

body of Praveen was dismembered. Ext.P115(b) is the relevant

portion of the confession statement of first accused in this regard.

As stated by the first accused and as led by him P.W.77 and other

police officers along with first accused reached the property of one

Anandakkini, which is close to the tarawad house of first accused.

P.W.77 prepared Ext.P10 mahazar. The prosecution has examined

P.W.18, who is an independent witness to the said mahazar. He

too speaks about what had transpired at the spot. The Village

Officer has drawn up Ext.P19 plan.          P.W.77 collected blood

stained soil, blood stained leaves, hairs etc from the spot.

</p><p id="p_193">             77. Two fold contentions are raised against the above

item of evidence.        The first is that there is no authorship of

concealment and two, nothing is recovered from the spot.            A

perusal of the confession statement, namely, Ext.P115(a) would

show that there is no authorship of concealment. But to say that

there is no recovery as such, the evidence is of no worth cannot be

accepted. At any rate, at the instance of the first accused, the place

where the body was dismembered had been located. It is not

necessary in all cases that there should be an actual recovery of

materials for the statement to fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_74">Section 27</a> of

the Indian Evidence Act. Almost a similar issue was considered in

the decision reported in Abuthagir v. State Rep. By Inspector of

Police, Madurai (AIR 2009 SC 2797). In the said decision it was

held as follows:

Following the principle in the said decision, the place located by

piece of evidence. Even assuming that <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_77">Section 27</a> of the Indian

chopper. The prosecution has a case that the said weapon was got

crafted by P.W.5. The evidence of P.W.5 shows that the first

accused was familiar to him. P.W.5 resides at Palluruthy. The first

accused worked as C.I. of Police there. He knows him from 1998

onwards. P.W.5 has stated that the first accused used to visit him

for sharpening the knifes and choppers. The evidence of this

witness shows that by the end of December, 2004, first accused

had approached him and directed him to make a chopper for use in

his house. P.W.5 has stated that C.W.18 had also come along with

the first accused. According to P.W.5, the first accused had given

specifications of the chopper he needs to be made by P.W.5.

Thereafter P.W.5 claims that the first accused had handed over a

leaf plate to him for making a chopper and also a kitchen knife.

P.W.5 would depose that accordingly he made a chopper and the

knife and handed them over to first accused in early January, 2005.

</p><p id="p_201">             79.     According to the prosecution, when P.W.77

questioned the first accused on 24.2.2005 he is said to have given

Ext.P131 confession statement. Based on Ext.P131 as led by the

first accused M.O.4 chopper used for mutilation of Praveen's body

was recovered from near the Thanneermukkom bund back waters.

P.W.25, an independent witness speaks about the recovery.

Ext.P20 is the relevant mahazar. Later M.O.4 chopper was shown

to P.W.5, who identified it as the one crafted by him from the leaf

plate. P.W.5 has also given the basis for his identification.

</p><p id="p_202">             80. Several objections are taken with regard to the

above recovery. They are:
</p>
<p id="p_203">             i) there is no authorship of concealment,

</p><p id="p_204">             ii) the investigating officer had gone to Nadachira and

as could be seen from Ext.P5 photograph the weapon was easily

visible.
</p>
<p id="p_205">             iii) even going by the prosecution evidence     a hectic

search was made earlier and M.O.4 could not have been located.

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

</p><p id="p_207">             iv) it is evident that M.O.4 was planted at the place to

effect the recovery.
</p>
<p id="p_208">             v) a reading of the evidence of P.W.5 would reveal that

the recovery is a stage managed one.
</p>
<p id="p_209">             81. Though the above contentions may appear to have

considerable force, a close reading of the evidence would show

that there is not much substance in the above contentions.

</p><p id="p_210">             82. The first search was made on the northern side of

Thanneermukkom bund on the basis of the statement given by the

first accused. This would be clear from the evidence of P.W.16.

P.W.16 had stated that on 1.3.2005 the police had sought his help.

According to him for about three hours he along with a few others

had dived into the lake and searched for weapons. Their effort

turned out to be futile. The search was made on the northern side

of the Thanneermukkom bund as directed by the investigating

officer.   It needs to be noticed at once that M.O.4 was later

recovered from the southern side of the lake and that too at the

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                     84</span><p id="p_211">

behest of the first accused. The records clearly show that he had

exclusive knowledge about the place of concealment and the

evidence is to the effect that when he was taken to the place he got

into the water and retrieved the chopper from the water. The

argument that Ext.P5 photograph would show that anybody could

have easily see the weapon. Nobody knew that the weapon was

lying there and there is nothing to show that that was a place

frequented by the people.         As already noticed, this is within the

knowledge of the first accused. It will be imprudent to discard this

item of evidence solely based on Ext.P5 photograph. So many

factors will have to be taken into consideration while drawing a

conclusion on the basis of the photograph.
</p>
<p id="p_212">             83. However, it is true that P.W.5 had stated that on

1.3.2005 police men from the Palluruthy Police Station had

questioned him and recorded his statement. In his deposition he

had also stated that police men asked him to be present at

Thanneermukkom bund on 4.3.2005.             Learned counsel for the

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

appellants pointed out that it is clear that the investigating agency

had made all arrangements for a stage managed recovery on

4.3.2005. Otherwise according to the learned counsel how could

the police know that M.O.4 would be available on 4.3.2005 so as

to ask P.W.5 to be present there on that occasion.

</p><p id="p_214">             84. The argument proceeds on a misconception and

misreading of the evidence. There is nothing to show that on

1.3.2005 when for the first time P.W.5 was questioned, he was

directed to come over to Thanneermukkom bund on 4.3.2005. He

has stated that on 1.3.2005 he was questioned by the police and

that his statement was recorded. Then he says that police men

from Palluruthy Police Station came to his house and asked him to

reach Thanneermukkom bund. P.W.5 does not mention the date on

which the police had come to his house and asked him to go to

Thanneermukkom bund. In all probability when the confession

statement was given by the first accused, P.W.77 must have

inferred that it is probable that it will be somewhere near the

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                     86</span><p id="p_215">

Thanneermukkom bund and if he will be able to recover it from

there, by way of        caution he might have sent a messenger to

Palluruthy Police Station to ask P.W.5 to come there. Such a

possibility cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_216">             85. There is yet another clinching item of evidence.

When M.O.4 was recovered, P.W.73, the Scientific Assistant had

occasion to inspect the weapon. Ext.P20 is the mahazar. At the

time of inspection by P.W.73 the weapon had blood stains on it

and also hairs stuck on it. Those were collected by P.W.73 as

could be seen from his evidence. The hairs so found on M.O.4

chopper compared well with the hairs in the left and right thigh of

Praveen, which were collected by P.W.71 at the time of autopsy. It

is also significant to notice that according to P.W.71, the Forensic

Surgeon the marks of cut inflicted to severe the limbs and head

could have been caused by the use of a weapon like M.O.4.

</p><p id="p_217">             86. It could thus be seen that even assuming that there

is some deficiency in the confession statements, so that they do not

fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_79">Section 27</a> of the Act, at any rate the

recovery of those materials based on the statements given by the

first accused at his behest is a conduct relevant under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_80">Section 8</a> of

the Indian Evidence Act.
</p>
<p id="p_219">             87. Now comes the evidence regarding the recovery of

the skull of Praveen. In his confession statement, the first accused

had stated that he had buried the skull in the property of

Ananda Kini. Ext.P115(c) is the relevant statement. First accused

was taken to the place. The investigating officer dug up a few

places in the property, but could not locate the head buried by the

first accused. The mahazar prepared was Ext.P12. P.W.19 is an

independent witness, who had occasion to see the incident. The

Scientific Assistant was able to recover M.O.7 glove and M.O.10

plastic rope. This recovery will fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_81">Section 27</a>

of the Indian Evidence Act. Even if the head of Praveen, which is

said to have been buried there was not recovered, the fact that the

place was located is a relevant fact and therefore the confession

statement falls within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_82">Section 27</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_221">             88.    Of course, the lower court has     also placed

considerable reliance on those portions of confession statements

said to have been given by the first accused regarding the place

from where the limbs and other parts were thrown as also M.O.4.

Those items of evidence may not be very relevant for the present

purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_222">             89. A common ground of criticism against the recovery

is the delay in effecting the recoveries. According to the defence

even assuming that the first accused had given confession

statements which led to the various recoveries, the discoveries

were delayed by the investigating officer to manipulate the same.

It is pointed out that the confession statements were made on

18.2.2005, but the recoveries were effected on 24.2.2005 and the

following dates. The delay in effecting the recoveries, according

to the learned counsel for the accused, creates considerable

suspicion and doubt regarding the claim made by the prosecution.

First of all there is absolute want of evidence to show that

confession statements were given on 18.2.2005.

</p><p id="p_224">             90. The above criticism is baseless. The recoveries are

made on the basis of the statement given by the first accused and as

led by him and shown by him. For effecting the recoveries, it is

essential that the first accused should accompany the investigating

officer or the officer authorised by the investing officer to effect

the recoveries.       The confession statements made by the first

accused showed that the various acts committed were in various

places and therefore for each recovery or discovery, the

investigating officer had to go to different places.      It is also

virtually impossible to effect the recoveries on the very same day

itself. Viewed from that angle, it could be seen that there is no

delay at all. Even assuming that there is delay of one or two days,

since the defence had not been able to show that any prejudice

has been caused to them, it is of no significance. So also there is

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                                     90</span><p id="p_225">

no suggestion to P.W.77, the investigating officer, who made the

recoveries and discoveries to the effect that he had deliberately

delayed the recovery and discovery so as to enable him to

manipulate the recoveries.
</p>
<p id="p_226">             91. Considerable reliance is placed by the defence on

Ext.D34. Ext.D34 relates to calls made from the mobile phone

belonging to P.W.77. Various calls alleged to have been made by

P.W.77 on 24.2.2007 are discernible from Ext.D34, according to

the defence. Quite a few of the recoveries        based    on     the

confession statement given by the first accused are seen to be made

on that day. The time specified in the various recovery mahazars

cannot tally with the entries in Ext.D34. If one goes through the

entries in Ext.D34, it can be seen that it is virtually impossible for

P.W.77 to be present at the various places as claimed by him to

make the recoveries as alleged by the prosecution. Therefore,

according to the        defence, Ext.D34 strikes at the root of the

prosecution case and falsify the so called recoveries. The said

document exposes the hollowness of the prosecution case, it is

submitted.
</p>
<p id="p_228">             92. Unfortunately the above contention has no legs to

stand.     Ext.D34 was obtained from the BSNL office.          It is

significant to notice that the entries in Ext.D34 was never put to

P.W.77 or in other words he was never confronted with the time of

the calls as is discernible from Ext.D34. When the defence is

attacking the statements made by PW.77 in court and they

possessed documents to establish the case, it is mandatory that they

should bring the documents to the attention of the witness

concerned, draw his attention to the relevant entries and seek his

explanation.      In other words, P.W.77, the investigating officer

ought to have been given an opportunity to explain his actions by

confronting with him the call details as is discernible from

Ext.D34. There would be several possibilities or explanations that

could be offered by P.W.77 to clear the apparent incongruity.

Merely based on some entries in Ext.D34 one cannot jump to the

Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

conclusion that all recoveries are false and manipulated. It was the

duty of the defence to confront P.W.77 with the relevant details

and seek his explanation. Having not done so, it is too late in the

day for the defence to contend that Ext.D34 is sufficient to falsify

the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_230">             93. The law relating to appreciation of evidence has

already been referred to. It is only normal and natural that there

would be slight inconsistencies, contradictions, embellishments

and developments in the evidence given by the witnesses. Perfect

evidence is yet to be obtained in any case. The attempt of the

court should be to see whether the available evidence is sufficient

to point to the guilt of the accused. If minor inconsistencies etc.

are given undue importance, no case could be proved. One does

not start with the presumption that witnesses are prone to perjury

and that their evidence should be viewed with suspicion. It is

infact the other way round. One would start with the presumption

that the evidence given by a witness is true unless shown

otherwise. None of the so called inconsistencies or contradictions

pointed out by the defence was so clinching to create a significant

dent in the prosecution version of the incident. There is nothing to

show that the prosecution version is unworthy of credit or hollow.

</p><p id="p_232">             94. One may come back to the evidence of P.Ws. 8, 12

and 13. Going by the evidence of P.Ws.8 and 13, the victim was

last seen in the company of accused No.2. If one believes P.W.12,

he had occasion to see Praveen being dragged into the van by

accused No.1 and others. But for the reasons already stated it is

difficult to accept the identification made by P.W.12. However,

one cannot omit to note the evidence of P.Ws. 8 and 13 in this

regard. They had specifically stated that after the second accused

and Praveen had gone to see a movie, they had occasion to see a

Maruti van coming and halting before Arcadia Bar and the first

accused got out of the same. They have also stated that later three

other persons came out of the van and had black coffee from their

catering unit. They have also stated that subsequently the first

accused was seen occupying the driving seat of the Maruti van. As

already been noticed by the witnesses, namely, P.Ws. 8, 13 and 12

identified M.O.5 as the Maruti van seen by them.            It is also

identified by the witnesses that the said van was used for the

purpose of carrying away Praveen.       If that be so, the principle of

last seen theory comes into force. It is for accused Nos. 1 and 2 to

explain as to what had happened to Praveen after he was seen in

their company soon before the time of death.
</p>
<p id="p_234">             95. One aspect needs to be considered in this context.

It was pointed out by the defence counsel that there is absolutely

no evidence to suggest the time of death of Praveen. In the

absence of such evidence, last seen theory could not be invoked.

Merely because at some point of time Praveen was seen in the

company of the second accused or first accused, that by itself does

not lead to the conclusion that they are responsible for his death

or disappearance.

<p id="p_235">Crl.Appeal Nos.86 &amp; 193/06 &amp;1796/07.

</p><p id="p_237">             96. Though the argument may look formidable, the

evidence will clearly show that Praveen was seen in the company

of the second accused or first accused a short while before the

death of Praveen. While conducting the postmortem of the torso

P.W.71 had noticed that rice was found in the stomach of the

victim. One may now recall the evidence of P.W.9. He has stated

that accused No.2 and Praveen had food from Arcadia Hotel.

Normally it takes about six hours for the food to completely digest.

P.W.71 while examining the limbs of the victim had noticed

saponification.       He has given evidence to the effect that

saponification occurs when body lies in water for about three or

four days. The autopsy of the limbs was done on 20.2.2005. It

shows that the death should have occurred on 16.2.2005 or

thereafter. The prosecution case is that the death of Praveen was

occurred by the end of the night of 15.2.2005 or in the early hours

of 16.2.2005. The evidence given by P.W.71 and also as revealed

from the relevant documents would clearly show that the death of

Praveen was soon after he had been found with the first accused

and second accused. The non-explanation on behalf of the second

accused and first accused as to what happened to Praveen

thereafter leads to the irresistible conclusion that they alone are

responsible for his death.

</p><p id="p_244">             98. Learned counsel appearing for the second accused

in Crl.Appeal No.193 of 2006 pointed out that even assuming that

what the prosecution says is true, the role of second accused is

considerably limited. According to the learned counsel, after the

first accused had taken hold of Praveen as alleged by the

prosecution, the second accused had no role to play. If that be so,

liability cannot be fastened on him for the death of Praveen.

</p><p id="p_245">             99. The argument, it may be said that, is least attractive.

It is clear from the evidence that the second accused had visited the

first accused before and after the incident. The evidence of P.W.4,

the son of the first accused, clearly show that the second accused

was found in the house of first accused on 16.2.2005 and

17.2.2005 as well. It is also difficult to believe that the second

accused did not know what would have happened to Praveen and

what had happened to him. The second accused cannot simply

wash off his hands by saying that he did not know what the first

accused had in mind and he thought that no harm would come to

Praveen. After having aided the first accused in his effort, in

which he succeeded, the second accused would not say that he is

not responsible for the death of Praveen. The evidence is to the

effect that the second accused was hand in glove with the first

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_247">             100. Therefore, it could be seen that there is abundant

evidence in this case to come to the conclusion that the death of

Praveen was caused by the first accused as a result of the

conspiracy between the first accused and others. The court below

has also taken note of other minor items of evidence, which would

point out that it was accused Nos.1 and 2, who were responsible

for the death of Praveen. In fact the court below has analysed that

M.O.4, M.Os.27, 29 and 30 also contained human blood. True that

no grouping was done in this case because the quantity of blood

was insufficient. However, the fact that blood was noticed on

these items is certainly an incriminating circumstance. In fact the

court below has discussed in detail several items of evidence and

then it came to the conclusion that the prosecution had succeeded

in establishing the case against the accused persons. The finding

appears to be fully justified going by the available evidence on

record and does not call for any interference. The court below was

justified in convicting the accused for the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_87">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_88">201</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_89">364</a> read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_90">Section 120B</a> IPC.

chosen to impose the sentence of imprisonment for life on the two

deserve capital punishment. Emphasis was laid on the fact that the

first accused is a very senior police officer and his acts cannot be

viewed in a light manner. Attention was drawn to the fact that the

law has taken care to impose more severe sentence in case the

offence committed by persons like police officers etc. Emphasize

that the balance will be in favour of the accused persons.

persons pointed out that the dismembering was done after the death

had occurred and the death, going by the postmortem report, was

caused due to application of blunt force on the neck. Learned

counsel for the accused persons pointed out that even the act

committed by the first accused may not be justifiable in law, it

could not be said that it was totally without a reason. True that the

first accused is a police officer, but that by itself should not be a

reason for awarding capital punishment.
</p>
<p id="p_256">             105. Even though the learned Public Prosecutor made

an attempt to say that the dismembering was done while Praveen

was alive, he was unable to establish the said fact. The evidence of

P.W.71 the Forensic Surgeon and the postmortem report clearly

show that the injuries relating to the dismembering of limbs were

not ante mortem injuries. There is nothing to show that any of the

injuries caused by the weapon like M.O.4 chopper was to cause

death of Praveen. In fact the finding is clear to the effect that it

was the application of blunt force to the neck that had caused the

death of Praveen. The suggestion is that he was strangulated. So it

was not as horrendous as the learned Public Prosecutor tried to

picture it to be.

<p id="p_258">             106. Apart from the above fact, if one recapitulates the

facts though as rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the

accused persons, the act could not be justified, it could not be said

that there was no reason at all for the same. The evidence is clear

to the effect that the first accused had absolute, implicit faith, trust

and belief in Praveen. He was like a member of his family and had

absolute freedom in his family. He was related to the first and

second accused also. The first accused even in his dreams could

not doubt that Praveen would betray the confidence and trust

reposed in him and it came as a rude shock to him that his trust was

misplaced and that his family life was in danger. Even though the

principle     of    balancing      the  aggravating and     mitigating

circumstances had undergone slight dilution, the principle still

holds good. Viewed in the light of various decisions referred to

and the principles laid down therein, it is difficult to bring the case

on hand in the category of rarest of rare category. Even though

Praveen was dismembered, as already noticed, that was done after

the death of Praveen. This is not to justify the act committed by

the first accused. It is also true that he is a police officer and is the

guardian of law. Normally his acts will have to be viewed very

seriously and as rightly pointed out by the learned Public

Prosecutor his act should attract capital punishment. But in the

light of the evidence available in this case, and also the reasons,

which made the first accused to do such a gruesome act takes it out

of the category of rarest of rare cases.
