JUDGMENT:-
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.   This writ petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of

India calls in question the legality, propriety and correctness of

an order dated 30th December, 2020, passed by the Intellectual

Property Appellate Board, under <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_4">Section 57</a> of the Trade Marks

Act, 1999 (&quot;the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_5">Trade Marks Act</a>&quot;), on rectification application

preferred by respondent no.3 (AMPM Fashions) whereby the

Appellate Board ordered to remove the mark &#x27;AMPM Designs&#x27;

registered vide Registration No.4165852 in the name of the

petitioner and take an entry to that effect in the record of

Register of Trade Marks.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   The background facts leading to this petition can be stated

in brief as under:
</p>
<p id="p_4">     (a)     The petitioner (AMPM Designs) is a partnership firm,

registered in the year 2017. Respondent no.3 (AMPM Fashions)

is a private limited company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_6">Companies

Act</a>, 1956.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     (b)     The petitioner claims that AMPM Designs has been

initially carrying on business as a proprietorship firm since the

year 2014, as interior designers. Over time, the brand name

AMPM Designs attained distinctiveness and immense goodwill
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               2/42</span>
                                                  WPST4339-21.DOC

amongst its costumers and interior design industry. AMPM

Designs came to be registered as a partnership firm in the year

2017. During the period 2017 to 2020, the petitioner invested

substantial money to build the petitioner&#x27;s brand (AMPM

Designs), which resulted in huge increase in its revenue.

</p><p id="p_6">     (c)   On 3rd March, 2017, respondent no.3 filed an

application for registration of its mark under Class-99, being

Application No.3500631, in multiple classes, including Class-42,

in which the mark of the petitioner had subsequently been

registered. On 3rd May, 2010, the petitioner filed an application

for registration of Trade Mark (AMPM Designs) as a word and

also as a logo.   Respondent no.3&#x27;s above referred Application

No.3500631 was cited in the examination report of the

petitioner&#x27;s application. Thus, on 26th July, 2019, the petitioner

filed a reply to the examination report stating that the marks of

the petitioner and respondent no.3 are dissimilar.             The

Registrar, Trade Marks Registration - respondent no.2, issued

certificate of registration of the Trade Mark (AMPM Designs) on

3rd May, 2019, vide Registration No.4165852.

</p><p id="p_7">     (d)   In the meanwhile, respondent no.2 instituted Civil

Suit (Comm) No.272 of 2020, before the Delhi High Court

against the partners of the petitioner firm seeking, inter alia, an

order of permanent injunction restraining the defendants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3/42</span>

therein from providing any services with the use of the mark

(AMPM Designs) and allied reliefs. During the course of hearing

of the interim application taken out by respondent no.3 in the

said suit, it transpired that respondent no.3 had surreptitiously

taken out a rectification application without properly serving the

notice thereof on the petitioners. It further transpired that on

6th August, 2020, an order of stay of the operation of the

petitioner&#x27;s trade mark was obtained behind the back of the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      (e)     Being aggrieved, the petitioner preferred Writ Petition

(L) No.4329 of 2020.        A Division Bench of this Court, by an

order dated 13th October, 2020, set aside the said order as it was

bereft of reasons and directed Appellate Board to decide the

rectification application expeditiously.

</p><p id="p_9">      (f)     The petitioner filed a counter statement on 19 th

October, 2020 and pointed out various infirmities in the claim of

respondent no.3. In addition to the oral submissions, the

petitioner also tendered written submissions.

</p><p id="p_10">      (g)     By the impugned order, the Appellate Board was

persuaded to allow the application holding, inter alia, that in

order to maintain purity of the Register of Trade Marks, AMPM

Designs,      registered   in   the    name   of   the   petitioner   vide

Registration No.4165852, in Class-42, was required to be

removed from the register.     The board was of the view that

respondent no.3 has prior adopted and used the mark, the

mark of respondent no.3 and petitioner were similar and the

goods and services offered by the petitioner and respondent no.3

were allied and/or cognate to each other and thus the Registrar

was in error in accepting the petitioner&#x27;s application for

registration in Class-42.
</p>
<p id="p_11">3.   Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned

order, the petitioners have invoked the writ jurisdiction of this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.   The principal grounds of challenge are that the impugned

order suffers   from   manifest arbitrariness    and   a   blatant

disregard for the governing precedents, which were specifically

cited before the Board.     In particular, the judgments of the

Supreme Court in the cases of <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_7">Nandhini Deluxe vs. Karnataka

Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited1</a> and Vishnudas

Trading as <a href="/doc/1747781/" id="a_8">Vishnudas Kishendas vs. Vajir Sultan Tobacco Co.

Ltd., Hyderabad</a> and another2, were specifically relied upon. Yet

the Appellate Board chose not to refer, much less consult, the

said authoritative pronouncements. This constitutes a breach

of cardinal principle of judicial disposition.    The petitioner


1    (2018) 9 Supreme Court Cases 183.
</p><pre id="pre_2">2    (1997) 4 Supreme Court Cases 201.

</pre><p id="p_13">further assert that the Appellate Board fell in error in not

properly accounting for the voluminous evidence to demonstrate

that the petitioner has been carrying on the business under the

mark AMPM Designs since the year 2014. The Appellate Board

committed grave error in ignoring the fundamental distinction

between the spheres of the business activity of the petitioner

and respondent no.3. The petitioner has been carrying on the

business of providing interior design services.     In contrast,

respondent no.3 primarily deals in the business of sale of

fashion apparels. The reliance by the Appellate Board on the

judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/155500148/" id="a_9">M/s. Shree

Rajmoti Industries vs. M/s. Shri Vishwaprabha Food Products

Private Limited3</a>, to support the erroneous finding that the

goods and services provided by the petitioner and respondent

no.3 were allied and/or cognate, was wholly misplaced. On a

plain perusal, the marks of the petitioner and respondent no.3

were completely visually different and distinguishable and,

therefore, there was no scope for confusion in the minds of the

people. Lastly, the Appellate Board committed an error in law in

drawing an adverse inference against the petitioner for making a

statement in response to the examination report that the marks

of the petitioner and respondent no.3 were dissimilar and in

3    Civil Suit (Commercial) No.397/2018 and IA No.10672/2014.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              6/42</span>
</p><p id="p_14">                                                      WPST4339-21.DOC

further claiming that those marks were similar in opposing

respondent no.3&#x27;s application.
</p>
<p id="p_15">5.   An affidavit-in-reply is filed on behalf of respondent no.3;

followed by a rejoinder thereto by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_16">6.   I have heard Mr. Kamod, the learned Counsel for the

petitioner and Mr. Khandeparkar, the learned Counsel for

respondent no.3, at length. With the assistance of the learned

Counsels for the parties, I have carefully perused the pleadings

before this court and the statutory authorities and the material

on record.
</p>
<p id="p_17">7.   Before I advert to note the submissions canvassed across

the bar, it may be expedient to note few uncontroverted facts

which      would   facilitate   proper   appreciation   of   the   rival

submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     (a)     There is not much controversy over the fact that the

petitioner is dealing in the business of interior designing and

lightening solutions. From the averments in the application for

rectification, and the number of trademarks registered in the

name of respondent no.3, it becomes evident that respondent

no.3 ventured into the business of fashion designing under the

brand name &#x27;AMPM&#x27;. The particulars of the registration of the

various trademarks, as borne out by the classes in which the

trademarks have been registered, primarily indicate that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7/42</span>

respondent no.3 is dealing in the business of clothing, fashion

apparels, leather goods and accessories.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     (b)     Indisputably on 3rd March, 2019, respondent no.3

applied for registration of trademark vide application bearing

No.3500631 under Class-99 i.e. multi class. On 3 rd May, 2019,

the petitioner filed application for registration of the trade mark

(&quot;AMPM DESIGNS&quot;) as word and as logo with the user detail,

&quot;proposed to be used&quot;. In the petitioner&#x27;s application for the

registration, Application No.3500631 filed by respondent no.3

dated 3rd May, 2017, was cited in the examination report. On

26th July,    2019,   the   petitioner filed    a    response   to   the

examination report and claimed that the marks of the petitioner

and respondent no.3 were dissimilar.           On 14 th October, 2019,

the petitioner&#x27;s request was published in trademarks journal. It

went unopposed. Respondent no.2 issued the certificate of

registration of the trademark, &quot;AMPM DESIGNS&quot; on 3rd May,

2020.
</p>
<p id="p_20">     (c)     On 14th July, 2021, Respondent no.3 filed application

under <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_10">Section 57</a> of the Trade Marks Act seeking rectification,

removal and cancellation from the register of trade marks.

Indisputably on 8th August, 2020, the petitioner filed a notice of

opposition to the registration of mark of respondent no.3,

sought     vide   Application   No.3500631,         under   Clause-42.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                8/42</span>

Simultaneously, the petitioner filed an application for correction

of alleged clerical error in trade mark Application No.4165852

seeking rectification in the column of, &quot;User detail&quot; from

&quot;proposed to be used&quot; to 10th January, 2014.
</p>
<p id="p_22">8.     It may be apposite, at this juncture itself, to indicate the

representation of competing marks of the petitioner (which is

ordered to be removed) and that of respondent no.3 (applied

vide Application No.3500631, under Clause-99, and opposed to

</pre><p id="p_24">10.   At the outset, it may be advantageous to clarify that only

the   legality,         propriety     and    correctness     of    the   order    of

rectification crops up for consideration in this petition.                       The

Court is not required to delve into the issues relating to

infringement of trademark and/or defensive registration as

those issues do not present themselves for consideration. The

core question is whether the order for removal of the aforesaid

trademark of the petitioner is legally sustainable.

</p><p id="p_25">11.   Mr. Kamod, the learned Counsel for the petitioner, would

urge that the aforesaid question is required to be answered in

an empathetic affirmative. First and foremost, the nature of the

mark, &quot;AMPM&quot;, according to Mr. Kamod, indicates that it is of

generic nature and numerous trademarks have been registered

comprising of the letters                   &quot;AMPM&quot;.    The Appellate       Board,

according to Mr. Kamod, committed a manifest error in not

appreciating the fundamental difference between the businesses

in which the petitioner and respondent no.3 dealed in. In the

backdrop of the nature of the mark, there was no likelihood of

confusion regarding the person, who offered the goods/services,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                           10/42</span>
                                                  WPST4339-21.DOC

especially in the context of the completely diverse nature of the

businesses the petitioner and respondent no.3 dealed in. Mr.

Kamod further urged that the Appellate Board lost sight of the

very object of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_11">Trade Marks Act</a>, which is, &quot;to enlarge the field

of registrability&quot;. The registration of trade mark, in any event,

according to Mr. Kamod, cannot entail consequence of monopoly

over articles in respect of which the person, in whose name a

prior trademark is registered, does not deal in, even remotely.

</p><p id="p_26">12.   Elaborating   the   aforesaid   submissions,   Mr.   Kamod

mounted a strong criticism against the manner in which the

Appellate Board determined the application for rectification. It

was urged with a degree of vehemence that the petitioner had

specifically raised the aforesaid ground and relied upon the

judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases of Vazir Sultan

(supra) and Nandhini Deluxe (supra), wherein the aforesaid

principles were expounded. The Appellate Board committed a

grave error in simply ignoring the binding precedents. On this

singular count, according to Mr. Kamod, the impugned order

deserves to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_27">13.   Mr. Kamod further urged that the Appellate Board was in

error in not keeping in view the tests expounded in the case of

<a href="/doc/1283458/" id="a_12">Balkrishna Hatcheries vs. Nandos International Ltd</a> &amp; anr.4 to

4     2007 SCC Online Bom 449.

determine the aspect of similarity of the marks.             Mr. Kamod

would urge that the Appellate Board could not have taken refuge

in the alleged inconsistency in the stand of the petitioner about

the similarity of the marks as it is well recognized principle of

law that there can be no estoppel against the statute. Nor the

Appellate Board could have drawn support from the fact that in

the application against the column user detail, &quot;proposed to be

used&quot;, was mentioned inadvertently, in the face of voluminous

material on record to demonstrate that the petitioner has been

dealing in the business since the year 2014.                  Since the

impugned order suffers from a clear non-application of mind,

consideration of irrelevant material and complete disregard to

the principles which govern the determination of dispute as

regards trademarks, the order deserves to be interfered with,

urged Mr. Kamod.
</p>
<p id="p_30">14.   Per contra, Mr. Khandeparkar, the learned Counsel for

respondent no.3 would urge that none of the grounds sought to

be urged on behalf of the petitioner deserve countenance. Laying

emphasis on the application of the petitioner for registration,

especially   the     user   detail    (proposed    to   be   used),   Mr.

Khandeparkar submitted that the petitioner cannot be heard to

say that the petitioner had all along been carrying on the

business     since   the    year     2014.   The   application   seeking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   12/42</span>

rectification of the alleged error came to be filed only after

respondent no.3 filed rectification application and initiated

proceedings     to   restrain   the   petitioner   from   committing

infringement of respondent no.3&#x27;s trademark.

</p><p id="p_31">15.   Mr. Khandeparkar further submitted that the Appellate

Board was justified in recording a finding that the stand of the

petitioner regarding the similarity of the trademark was plainly

inconsistent.   Comparing and contrasting the response of the

petitioner to the objection raised by the Registry, as manifested

in the letter dated 25th July, 2019, wherein the petitioner

affirmed that there were multitude of differences in the two

trademarks, and the notice of opposition dated 7 th August,

2020, wherein the petitioner claimed that the trademark of

respondent no.3 was deceptively similar to the petitioner&#x27;s mark

and constituted a colourable imitation and closely resembled

the petitioner&#x27;s mark, Mr. Khandeparkar strenuously submitted

that the petitioner was rightly not allowed to aprobate and

reprobate.
</p>
<p id="p_32">16.   Mr. Khandeparkar would submit that the claim that the

businesses in which the petitioner and respondent no.3 have

been dealing in are of distinct nature, even if taken at par, does

not advance the cause of the submission on behalf of the

petitioner. Foray into interior designing from fashion designing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                13/42</span>
                                                  WPST4339-21.DOC

is a natural progression, in the industry.    The mere fact that

respondent no.3 had not been dealing in the business of interior

designing, is not sufficient to allow the petitioner to use the

trademark with impunity especially when respondent no.3&#x27;s

mark has attained the status of &#x27;well-known trade mark&#x27;.

Neither the defence of generic nature of the mark is sustainable.

Nor the fact that the businesses in which the petitioner and

respondent no.3 have been dealing in are different, even if

assumed to be so, is of decisive significance, urged Mr.

Khandeparkar.
</p>
<p id="p_33">17.   Lastly, Mr. Khandeparkar submitted that the impugned

order does not suffer from such illegality or material irregularity

which would warrant interference in exercise of extraordinary

writ jurisdiction.   In a given set of facts, if two views are

possible, the Writ Court would not be justified in interfering

with the order passed by the Statutory Authority for the reason

that the other view is more commendable.
</p>
<p id="p_34">18.   To bolster up the last submission, Mr. Khandeparkar

placed a strong reliance on a judgment of the Supreme Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/838254/" id="a_13">Khalil Ahmed Bashir Ahmed vs. Tufelhussein

Samasbhai Sarangpurwala</a>.5       In the said case, the Supreme

Court expounded the contours of writ jurisdiciton, as under:

</p><pre id="pre_4">5     (1988) 1 SCC 155.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                              14/42</span>

</pre><p id="p_35">       &quot;13. The intention here is manifest. In any event this is a
       possible view that could be taken. This Court in <a href="/doc/617692/" id="a_14">Venkatlal
       G. Pittie v. M/s. Bright Bros</a>. (Pvt) Ltd. [(1987) 3 SCC 558]

       SCC 693] held that where it cannot be said that there was
       no error apparent on the face of the record, the error if any
       has to be discovered by long process of reasoning, and the
       High Court should not exercise jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_16">Article
       227</a> of the Constitution. See in this connection the
       observations of this Court in Satyanarayan Laxminarayan
       Hegde v. Mallikarjun Bhavanappa Tirumale [(AIR 1960 SC
</p><p id="p_36">       137)]. Where two views are possible and the trial court has
       taken one view which is a possible and plausible view merely
       because another view is attractive, the High Court should
       not interfere and would be in error in interfering with the
       finding of the trial court or interfering under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_17">Article 227</a> of
       the Constitution over such decision.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_37">19.   There can be no duality of opinion as regards the scope of

interference in exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction.            A mere

erroneous finding of fact is not susceptible to interference in

exercise of the writ jurisdiction. An erroneous view on law that

vitiates the decision, however, furnishes a surer foundation for

exercise of the writ jurisdiction. The question which crops up for

consideration is whether, the impugned order suffers from such

infirmity as would warrant interference in exercise of writ

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_38">20.   To being with, the claim of the petitioner that the mark

AMPM has no distinctiveness. It is a generic mark essentially

being the acronym of respondent no.3&#x27;s principal directors

Ankur Modi and Priyanka Modi, [like the names of the partners

of the petitioner, Mr. Ankur Mehta and Poonam Mehta]. Thus,

respondent no.3 could not have claimed any distinctiveness.

</p><p id="p_40">21.   Per contra, Mr. Khandeparkar, the learned Counsel for

respondent no.3, would urge that the petitioner cannot be heard

to say that the mark is a generic word as the petitioner itself

had sought the registration of the said mark. In order to lend

support to this submission Mr. Khandeparkar placed a strong

reliance on the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/90123644/" id="a_18">H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB and ors vs. HM Megabrands Pvt.

Ltd. and ors</a>.6    In the said case the Delhi High Court, in the

backdrop of the controversy over the use of the mark H&amp;M by

the defendants therein, observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       &quot;24. &#x27;H&amp;M&#x27; or &#x27;HM&#x27; however are not generic or public juris
       to the trade or business for which they are being used by
       the plaintiffs and the defendants. The said alphabets are
       alien to the trade/business of clothing/garments/
       accessories and were applied thereto by the plaintiffs,
       admittedly much prior to the defendants, merely on account
       of being first alphabets of the originators of business of the
       plaintiffs As distinct therefrom, LIV 52 &amp; LIV-T were at
       interim stage found being used for medical preparations for
       treatment of Liver and were thus held to be generic and/or
       public juris. That is not so here. A word, even if generic, if
       applied to a business with which the word is unrelated, is
       indeed to be protected. Merely because it is alphabets or
       acronym, is immaterial. ...&quot;

<p id="p_41">22.   Mr. Khandeparkar invited the attention of the Court to

another judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       &quot;16. The defendants got their trade mark &quot;DIMMER DOT&quot;
       registered in Australia. The fact that the defendant itself has

       &quot;DIMMER DOT&quot;, it does not lie in their mouth to say that
       the word &quot;DIMMER&quot; is a generic expression. User of the
       word &quot;DIMMER&quot; by others cannot be a defense available to
       the defendants, if it could be shown that the same is being
       used in violation of the statutory right of the plaintiff. ....&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">23.   In the backdrop of the aforesaid position in law, the mere

fact that the mark (AMPM) is a acronym of the names of the

principal directors of respondent no.3 does not dis-entitle

respondent no.3 from claiming protection of its proprietary right

over the said mark. Mr. Khandeparkar is fully justified in

canvassing a submission that the petitioner itself having got the

mark registered, cannot urge that there is no distinctiveness in

the said mark. Thus, the submission on behalf of the petitioner

that the said mark being a generic expression, respondent no.3

cannot claim distinctiveness is unworthy of countenance.

</p><p id="p_44">24.   Mr. Kamod, the learned Counsel for the petitioner, urged

that the mark of the petitioner cannot be said to be similar with

respondent no.3&#x27;s mark as it is suffixed by the word &#x27;DESIGNS&#x27;.

The addition of the said word, according to Mr. Kamod, will rule

out confusion in the minds of the persons as regards the

petitioner&#x27;s mark.
</p>
<p id="p_45">25.   Mr. Khandeparkar joined the issue by canvassing a

submission that it is a well neigh settled principle of law that

the   marks     are    not   to   be   compared   by    placing   them

side by side and word for word. The exercise of ascertainment of

similarity rests upon consideration of the broad and essential

features of the two marks. The proper test is whether there is

likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of

marks, irrespective of addition or deletion of a letter or word,

urged Mr. Khandeparkar.
</p>
<p id="p_46">26.   The aforesaid submission of Mr. Khandeparkar appears

well merited.    It is settled by a long line of decisions that to

arrive at a finding as to whether one mark is deceptively similar

to another, the broad and essential features of the two marks

are to be considered. A profitable reference, in this context, can

be made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1300681/" id="a_20">Ruston &amp; Hornby Ltd. vs. The Zamindara Engineering Co</a>. 8 In

the said case, the appellant - plaintiff, Ruston &amp; Hornsby (India)

Repelling the contention that the addition of the word &#x27;INDIA&#x27; to

RUSTAM,      [&quot;which     deceptively     resembled      with    the     word

&#x27;RUSTON&#x27; of the plaintiff], had the element to indicate that the

product of the defendant was manufactured in India, the

Supreme Court held that if the respondent&#x27;s trade mark is

deceptively similar to the appellant, the fact that the word

&quot;INDIA&quot; is added to the respondent&#x27;s trade mark is of no

significance and the appellant is entitled to succeed in its action

for infringement of its trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_48">27.   Mr. Kandeparkar was justified in placing reliance on

another judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/175451084/" id="a_21">The

Himalaya Drug Company vs. S.B.L. Limited</a>,9 wherein the Delhi

High Court adverted to the doctrine of the prominent and

essential feature of the trade mark for the purposes of

adjudication of the dispute relating to infringement of the trade

mark. The observations in paragraphs 18 and 19 are material

and hence extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       &quot;18. The courts have propounded the doctrine of prominent
       and essential feature of the trade mark for the purposes of
       adjudication of the disputes relating to infringement of trade
       mark. While deciding the question of infringement, the court
       has to see the prominent or the dominant feature of the
       trade mark. Even the learned single judge agrees to this
       proposition when the learned judge quotes McCarthy on
       Trade Marks that all composite marks are to be compared


9     2013 (530 PTC 1 (Del).
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                  19/42</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                                                                     WPST4339-21.DOC

       as whole. However, it is dependent on case to case to basis
       as a matter of jury question as to what can be the possible
       broad and essential feature of the trade mark in question.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       19. It is settled law that where the defendant&#x27;s mark
       contains the essential feature of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark
       combined with other matter, the correct approach for the
       court is to identify an essential feature depending
       particularly ―on the court&#x27;s own judgment and burden ofon the court&#x27;s own judgment and burden of
       the evidence that is placed before the Court‖. . In order to
       come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively
       similar to another, the broad and essential features of the
       two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by
       side to find out if there are differences, rather overall
       similarity has to be judged. While judging the question as to
       whether the defendant has infringed the trade mark or not,
       the court has to consider the overall impression of the mark
       in the minds of general public and not by merely comparing
       the dissimilarities in the two marks.&quot;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                                                   (emphasis supplied)


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">28.   On the touchstone of the aforesaid principles, the claim of

the petitioner that the addition of the word &quot;DESIGNS&quot; renders

the mark of the petitioner and respondent no.3 distinct and

dissimilar is not worthy of acceptance. When the test of

propensity to cause confusion in the minds of the prospective

customers, on the basis of the broad, prominent and essential

features of the trade mark is applied, the addition of the word

&quot;DESIGNS&quot; does not dispel the likelihood of confusion.                                                    The

marks of the petitioner and respondent no.3, therefore, cannot

be said to be dissimilar to such extent as not to cause confusion

or deception.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_49">29.   At this juncture, the inconsistency in the stand of the

petitioner as regards the similarity of the marks comes to the

fore. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                 20/42</span>

fact that the petitioner had claimed in response to the

examination report that there were multitude of the differences

in the marks of the petitioner and respondent no.3 and in the

notice of opposition to the application of respondent no.3 to

register the said mark in Class-42, the petitioner asserted that

the mark of respondent no.3 was deceptively similar to the mark

of the petitioner is required to be appreciated in the backdrop of

the context and stage of the proceedings.        In any event, the

claim of the petitioner that the mark of respondent no.3 is

deceptively similar to that of the petitioner, could not have been

construed against the petitioner as there can be no estoppel

against law. The question as to whether the marks are

deceptively similar warrants determination on the basis of the

well recognized test. The Appellate Board thus could not have

decided the issue on the basis of the said inconsistent stand of

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_50">30.   To bolster up these submissions, Mr. Kamod, the learned

Counsel for the petitioner, placed reliance on the judgments in

the cases of <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_22">Kapil Wadwa and ors. vs. Samsung Electronics Co.

</pre><p id="p_51">31.   In the case H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB (supra), when

issue of admission at a prior stage was raised, the Delhi High

Court held that merely because the plaintiff at the stage of

seeking registration took a stand that the mark has to be

considered in entirety, cannot stop the plaintiff firm from

exercising its statutory and natural rights. There is no estoppel

against the statute. In the case of Insecticides (I) Ltd. (supra), it

was inter alia observed that neither the principle of admission

nor the principle of estoppel deprives the parties from seeking a

relief, if it were found to be entitled thereto.

</p><p id="p_52">32.   There can be no qualm over the position in law that an

erroneous admission on a principle of law by a party would have

no relevance in determining the rights and liabilities, for

cannot an estoppel against a statute. In this case, the stand of

the petitioner as regards the similarity of the mark differed at

different stages of the proceedings.           In response to the

examination report, the petitioner claimed that the marks were

dissimilar.    Whereas in the notice of opposition, to the

application of respondent no.3 for registration of the latter&#x27;s

mark under Class-42, the petitioner claimed that respondent

no.3&#x27;s mark was deceptively similar to that of the petitioner.

Evidently, after the petitioner&#x27;s mark was registered, the

petitioner took the stand that the proposed mark of respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                22/42</span>

no.3 is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the

petitioner. In any event, this aspect does not bear upon the core

controversy except reflecting upon the litigative conduct of the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_53">33.   In the case at hand, the Court is confronted with the

question as to whether, even on the premise that the marks are

similar, the Appellate Board was justified in ordering the

removal of the petitioner&#x27;s mark when the petitioner and

respondent no.3 have been dealing in different businesses and

respondent no.3&#x27;s earlier marks were registered in distinct

classes.      Is respondent no.3 entitled to protect the proprietary

right to the trade mark even when the petitioner is dealing in a

different business is the moot question?
</p>
<p id="p_54">34.   Mr. Kamod, the learned Counsel for the petitioner,

strenuously submitted that the Appellate Board was in error in

recording that the goods and services of fashion designing (in

which respondent no.3 primarily dealt in) and interior desiging

(that of the petitioner) pertain to creative art work and,

therefore, can be termed as cognate/allied goods/services. Mr.

Kamod would urge that this erroneous finding was recorded as

the Appellate Board did not consult the binding precedents of

the Supreme Court in the case of Vazir Sultan           (supra) and

Trading (supra) would be profitable.              In the said case, the

respondent Vazir Sultan was manufacturing cigarette under the

brand name &#x27;Charminar&#x27;. The appellant Vishudas Trading was

manufacturing the &quot;quiwam&quot; and &quot;zarda&quot; under the same trade

mark &#x27;Charminar&#x27;.            When the appellant applied for the

registration of the trade mark Charminar for &quot;quiwam&quot; and

&quot;zarda&quot;, the respondent raised objection. The appellant&#x27;s prayer

for registration was turned down.              Thereupon the appellant

made an application for rectification of the registration made in

favour of respondent company so that the said registration is

limited only in respect of the articles being manufactured and

marketed by the respondent company namely, cigarette.

Supreme Court enunciated the legal position in the following

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">         &quot;47. ..... In our view, if a trader or manufacturer actually

         manufacturer has no bonafide intention to trade in or
         manufacture other goods or articles which also fall under
         the said broad classification, such trader or manufacturer
         should not be permitted to enjoy monopoly in respect of all
         the articles which may come under such broad
         classification and by that process preclude the other traders
         or manufacturers to get registration of separate and distinct
         goods which may also be grouped under the broad
         classification. If registration has been given generally in
         respect of all the articles coming under the broad
         classification and if it is established that the trader or
         manufacturer who got such registration had not intended to
         use any other article except the articles being used by such
         trader or manufacturer, the registration of such trader is

liable to be rectified by limiting the ambit of registration and
confining such registration to the specific article or articles
which really concern the trader or manufacturer enjoying
the registration made in his favour. In our view, if
rectification in such circumstances is not allowed, the trader
or manufacturer by virtue of earlier registration will be
permitted to enjoy the mischief of trafficing in trade mark.
</blockquote><p id="p_75">Looking to the scheme of registration of trade mark as
envisaged <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_31">Trade Marks Act</a> and the Rules framed
thereunder, it appears to us that registration of a trade
mark cannot be held to be absolute, perpetual and
invariable under all circumstances. <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_32">Section 12</a> of the Trade
Marks Act prohibits registration of identical or deceptively
similar trade marks in respect of goods and description of
goods which is identical or deceptively similar to the trade
mark already registered. For prohibiting registration under
12(1), goods in respect of which subsequent registration is
sought for, must be (i) in respect of goods or description of
goods being same or similar and covered by earlier
registration and (ii) trade mark claimed for such goods must
be same or deceptively similar to the trade mark already
registered. It may be noted that under sub-section (3) of
<a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_33">Section 12</a> of Trade Marks Act. in an appropriate case of
honest concurrent use and/or of other                     special
circumstances, same and deceptively similar trade marks
may be permitted to another by the Registrar, subject to
such conditions as may deem just and proper to the
Registrar. It is also to be noted that the expression &quot;goods&quot;
and &quot;description of goods&quot; appearing in <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_34">Section 12(1)</a> of
Trade Marks Act indicate that registration may be made in
respect of one or more goods or of all goods conforming a
general description. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_35">The Trade Marks Act</a> has noted
distinction between description of goods forming a genus
and separate and distinctly identifiable goods under the
genus in various other Sections e.g. goods of same
description in <a href="/doc/1815775/" id="a_36">Section 46</a>, <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_37">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_38">34</a> and class of
goods in <a href="/doc/1587793/" id="a_39">Section 18</a>, Rules 12 and 26 read with Fourth
Schedule to the Rules framed under the Act.
</p><p id="p_76">48. The &quot;class&quot; mentioned in the 4th Schedule may
subsume or comprise a number of goods or articles which
are separately identifiable and vendible and which are not
goods of the same description as commonly understood in
trade or in common parlance. Manufactured tobacco is a
class mentioned in Class 34 of 4th Schedule of the Rules
but within the said class, there are number of distinctly
identifiable goods which are marketed separately and also
used differently. In our view, it is not only permissible but it
will be only just and proper to register one or more articles
under a class or genus if in reality registration only in
respect of such articles are intended, by specifically
mentioning the names of such articles and by indicating the
class under which such article or articles are to be

         comprised. It is, therefore, permissible to register only
         cigarette or some other specific products made of
         manufactured tobacco as mentioned in Class 34 of 4th
         Schedule of the Rules. In our view, the contention of Mr.
         Vaidyanatha that in view of change in the language of
         <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_40">Section 8</a> of Trade Marks Act as compared to <a href="/doc/614348/" id="a_41">Section 5</a> of
         Trade Marks Act 1940, registration of trade mark is to be
         made only in respect of class or genus and not in respect of
         articles of different under the genus is based on incorrect
         appreciation of <a href="/doc/568385/" id="a_42">Section 8</a> of the Trade Marks Act and 4th
         Schedule of the Rules.

         rectification of the registration by limiting or confining the
         registration of trade mark of the Respondent Company to
         particular goods, namely, cigarettes, in the facts and
         circumstances of the case, cannot be held as illegal or
         unjustified.&quot;

<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">41.      The   aforesaid    pronouncement         was    followed    by    the

Supreme Court in the case of Nandhini Deluxe (supra). In the

latter    case,   the    respondent      Karnataka      Cooperative       Milk

Producers Federation Limited was producing and selling milk

and milk products under the trade mark of &quot;NANDINI&quot;.                      The

mark of the respondent was registered under Class-29 and

Class-30. The appellant &quot;NANDHINI Deluxe&quot; was in the

business of running restaurants and it adopted the mark

&quot;NANDHINI&quot; for its restaurants and applied for registration of

the said mark.        The food stuffs sold by the appellant in the

restaurants also fell under Class-29 and Class-30 as well as the

other classes.

<p id="p_80">42.      The Supreme Court, after adverting to its previous

pronouncements, which enunciated that the real question to

decide in such cases is to see as to how a purchaser, who must

be looked upon as an average man of ordinary intelligence,

would react to a particular trade mark, what association he

would form by looking at the trade mark and in what respect he

would connect the trade mark with the goods which he would be

purchasing, in the facts of the said case, held that the not only

visual appearance of the two marks was different, they even

related to different products. Further the manner in which they

were treated by the appellant and respondent respectively

rendered it difficult to imagine that an average man of ordinary

intelligence would associate the goods of the appellant as that of

the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_81">43.   Evidently the aforesaid pronouncements, which govern the

controversy sought to be raised in the case at hand were not

adverted to by the Appellate Board. It is imperative to note that

in both these cases, the goods/services in respect of which

registration of competing trade marks was sought, broadly

pertained to the same class.
</p>
<p id="p_82">44.   In the case of Vazir Sultan (surpa) there were tobacco

products.   In the case of Nandhini Deluxe (supra) the marks

were registered under Class-29 and Class-30 i.e. food stuffs etc.

In the case of Vazir Sultan (supra), the Supreme Court

expounded that if a trader or manufacturer actually trades in or

broad classification and such trader or manufacturer has no

bonafide intention to trade in or manufacture other goods or

articles which also fall under the said broad classification, such

trader or manufacturer should not be permitted to enjoy

monopoly in respect of all the articles which may come under

such broad classification and by that process preclude the other

traders or manufacturers to get registration for separate and

distinct goods which may also be grouped under the broad

classification.
</p>
<p id="p_83">45.   Mr. Kamod, the learned Counsel for the petitioner, was

justified in criticising the approach of the Appellate Board

in    non-consideration    of     the   aforesaid   authoritative

pronouncements of the Supreme Court, though cited. It is one

thing, where the adjudicatory body refers to the decisions of the

superior Courts and holds that the propositions expounded

therein do not govern the case at hand.       It is a completely

different thing, where the authority does not at all refer to the

precedents cited, especially when the controversy raised in the

lis before such authority is dealt with by the superior Courts.

The situation gets exacerbated when the pronouncement is by

the Supreme Court, the decisions of which are binding on all

Courts and authorities.

</p><p id="p_86">46.     Mr. Khandeparkar, the learned Counsel for respondent

no.3, attempted to salvage the position by canvassing a

submission that the omission to refer to the judgments of the

superior Courts by itself may not render the decision of the

Appellate Board infirm, when the Appellate Board had kept in

view the principles expounded in those judgments and correctly

applied them to the facts of the case. Therefore, according to

Mr. Khandeparkar, the petitioner cannot draw much mileage

from the omission to refer to the aforesaid judgments.

</p><p id="p_87">47.     I find it rather difficult to accede to this submission. As

indicated above, the judgment in the cases of Vazir Sultan

(supra) and Nandhini Deluxe (supra) squarely dealt with the

order    passed   in   rectification   application    and    specifically

addressed the controversy of adoption of the trade mark for the

goods/services in which the prior trade mark user does not deal

in. In the backdrop of the controversy at hand, in my considered

view, the Appellate Board committed a gross error in not

referring and adhering to the ratio laid down in the aforesaid

judgments.
</p>
<p id="p_88">48.     Mr.   Khandeparkar     would    urge   that    the     aforesaid

pronouncement in the case of Nandhini Deluxe (supra) would

not govern the facts of the case as the marks &quot;NANDINI&quot; and

&quot;NANDHINI&quot; were not similar. Nor was it a case of concurrent

user. This submission of Mr. Khandeparkar is well-grounded in

facts. Indeed, the Supreme Court in the case of Nandhini

Deluxe (supra) observed that the visual appearance of the two

marks was different. However, that is not the only import of the

judgment in the case of Nandhini Deluxe (supra). The fact that

the marks related to different products also weighed with the

Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_89">49.   The aforesaid position becomes abundantly clear from the

following observations of the Supreme Court in paragraphs 31,

32 and 33.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       &quot;31. One other significant factor which is lost sight of by the
       IPAB as well as the High Court is that the appellant is
       operating a restaurant under the trademark &#x27;NANDHINI&#x27;
       and it had applied the trademark in respect of goods like
       coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, rice, tapioca, sago, artificial coffee,
       flour and preparations made from cereals, bread, pastry,
       spices, bill books, visiting cards, meat, fish, poultry and
       game; meat extracts; preserved, dried and cooked fruits and
       vegetables; jellies, jams, fruit sauces, etc. which are used in
       the products/services of restaurant business. The aforesaid
       items do not belong to Class 29 or 30. Likewise, stationery
       items used by the appellant in the aid of its restaurant
       services are relatable to Class 16. In these circumstances,
       there was hardly any question of confusion or deception.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">       32. Having arrived at the aforesaid conclusion, the
       reasoning of the High Court that the goods belonging to the
       appellant and the respondent (though the nature of goods is
       different) belong to same class and, therefore, it would be
       impermissible for the appellant to have the registration of
       the trade mark concerned in its favour, would be
       meaningless. That apart, there is no such principle of law.
       On the contrary, this Court in Vishnudas Trading as
       Vishnudas Kushandas has decided otherwise as can be
       seen from the reading of para 47 of the said judgment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">                                                   (extracted above)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">       33. We may mention that the aforesaid principle of law
       while interpreting the provisions of Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_43">Merchandise
       Act</a>, 1958 is equally applicable as it is unaffected by the

      Trade Marks Act, 1999 inasmuch as the main object
      underlying the said principle is that the proprietor of a trade
      mark cannot enjoy monopoly over the entire class of goods
      and, particularly, when he is not using the said trade mark
      in respect of certain goods falling under the same class. In
      this behalf, we may usefully refer to <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_44">Section 11</a> of the Act
      which prohibits the registration of the mark in respect of the
      similar goods or different goods but the provisions of this
      Section do not cover the same class of goods.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_90">50.   The Supreme Court has thus enunciated in clear and

explicit terms that there is no principle of law that once the

trade mark is registered in respect of the goods/services falling

in one class, it would be impermissible to have the registration

of the trade mark where there is a prior user of the trade mark

though the nature of the goods/services is different,               On the

contrary, the principle is otherwise. The main object underlying

the said principle is that the proprietor of a trade mark cannot

enjoy monopoly over the entire class of goods and, particularly,

when he is not user of the said trade mark in respect of the

certain goods falling under the same class.
</p>
<p id="p_91">51.   Mr. Khandeparkar, the learned Counsel for respondent

no.3, however urged that registration of a trade mark under a

particular class in the Schedule-IV appended to the Trade Mark

Rules is not decisive. The test of, &#x27;field of activity&#x27; is no more

valid. To bolster up this submission, Mr. Khandeparkar banked

upon a Division Bench judgment of the Delhi High Court in the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                 34/42</span>

case of <a href="/doc/193521140/" id="a_45">Larsen and Toubro Limited vs. Lachmi Narain Trades

and ors</a>.12

</p><p id="p_92">52.   In the said case, the respondent - defendant had started

using, &quot;LNT&quot; and &quot;ELENTE&quot; as brand names for electrical goods

including electric distribution systems like miniature circuit

breakers etc. A learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court,

while confirming the order of ad-interim injunction allowed the

defendant to use the following description on its goods.

</p><p id="p_93">      &quot;LNT/ELENTE-Lachmi Narain Trades&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_94">53.   In an appeal against the aforesaid order the Division

Bench held that the user of the mark &quot;LNT&quot;/&quot;ELENTE - Lachmi

Narain Trades&quot; could not become permissible simply because

the defendants were using the offending logo/trade mark with

some other expression like Lachmi Narain Trades. Repelling the

submission that some of the products marketed by the

defendants under the mark/logo &quot;LNT&quot;/&quot;ELENTE&quot; were not even

manufactured or marketed by the plaintiff appellant therein and

thus there was no justification to pass restraint order, the

Division Bench held that the test of, &quot;field of activity&quot; was no

more valid.    The question really is one of real likelihood of

confusion or deception amongst the consumer and resultant

damage to the plaintiff.

Bench referred to the judgments in the cases of <a href="/doc/1361643/" id="a_46">Sunder

Parmanand Lalwani and ors vs. Caltex (India) Ltd</a>., 13 <a href="/doc/150587/" id="a_47">Bata India

Thus, it was concluded that there was no difficulty in holding

that the dissimilarity in some of the products in which the

parties trade does not make any material difference.

High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/53358049/" id="a_50">FDC Limited vs. Docsuggest

Healthcare Services Pvt. Ltd. and ors</a>,18 wherein the learned

Single Judge considered the submission on behalf of the

defendants therein that the goods and services falling in

different classes cannot be said to be allied or cognate. In the

facts of the said case, it was ruled that classification of the

goods is not the criteria for deciding the questions of similarity.

</pre><p id="p_97">The observations in paragraph 48 are material and hence

extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">       &quot;48. In the present case, the plaintiff is using the registered
       mark &#x27;Zifi&#x27; for goods falling under Class 05 of the Schedule
       of the Act i.e. pertaining to pharmaceutical preparations.
       On the other hand, the defendants are using the mark &#x27;Ziffi&#x27;
       for booking of appointments for doctors, diagnostics, spas
       and salons, and have applied for registration under Class 35
       and 42 of the Schedule of the Act. It is the submission of
       the defendant that goods and services falling under different
       classes cannot be allied and cognate. I do not find merit in
       this submission. The classification of goods and services
       under <a href="/doc/1853612/" id="a_51">Section 7</a> of the Act is not the criterion for deciding
       the question of similarity in goods/services. Reliance may
       be placed on K. C. Kailasam/Ramu Vedaraman&#x27;s Law on
       Trade Marks &amp; Geographical Indications 1st Edition, 2003,
       wherein, the learned author on Page 180 has stated as
       under -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">            &quot;Classification of goods given in the rules not the
            criterion Whether or not two sets of goods or
            services are of the same description is not be
            decided on the basis of the classification of goods
            and services given in the 4th schedule to the
            Trade Marks Rules, 2002. The description of
            goods may be narrower or wider than any of the
            classes according to the circumstances of the
            case. As was observed by LINDLEY J., in the
            Australian Wine Importers Trade Mark case
            [(1889) 6 RPC 311]. &quot;If you come to look at that
            classification, you will find goods of the same
            description, in one sense, in different classes; and
            you will find goods of different description in the
            same class&quot;.&quot;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">56.   It is imperative to note that the pronouncement in the

aforesaid cases were made where the party alleging infringement

of the trade mark was an established prayer in its sphere of

business. &quot;LNT&quot; has acquired the secondary meaning. Likewise,

&quot;Kirloskar&quot; and &quot;Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited&quot; are almost the

household words. In that context, it was held that the test of

field of activity was not the sole criteria. Where a clear intent to

ride on the goodwill and market presence of established players

like Caltex, Bata, Benz, Kirloskar, L&amp;T and Mahendra and

Mahendra (as was the cse in the judgments referred to above) is

evincible, the nature of the business becomes inconsequential.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_98">It is the trademark which becomes decisive and not the nature

or filed of activity. It is pertinent to note that, in the case at

hand, the Appellate Board had not spelled out the particular

reasons for which the Registrar ought to be refused the

registration with reference to the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_52">Section

11</a> of the Trade Marks Act. Nor the Appellate Board came to the

conclusion that respondent no.3&#x27;s mark was a well-known trade

mark and required protection de hors the businesses it dealed

into. On the contrary, the Appellate Board relied upon the

judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of M/s. Shree

Rajmoti Industries (supra) wherein the following observations:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">       &quot;the nature of the products being as they are i.e.
       edible oil and water on the one hand and rice on
       the other, they are articles of human consumption
       and thus constitute similar or cognate/allied
       goods.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_99">57.   Drawing the analogy, the Appellate Board held that the

goods/services, fashion designing and interior designing, both

pertaining   to   creative   art   work,   are   considered   to   be

cognate/allied goods/services.      Whether this approach of the

Appellate Board is justifiable?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                               38/42</span><p id="p_100">
</p><p id="p_101">                                                     WPST4339-21.DOC

</p><p id="p_102">58.   Undoubtedly, the pertinent question is of real likelihood of

confusion   or    deception   among     the     consumers   of   the

goods/services. Classification cannot be the be all and end all

of the determination in the matter of conflicting claims to the

trade marks.     The classes are not themselves the criteria for

determining the question of similarity on the touchstone of

likelihood of confusion or deception.         At the same time, the

underlying object of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_53">Trade Marks Act</a> as expounded in the

case of Vazir Sultan (supra) and Nandhini Deluxe (supra) that

the proprietor of a trade mark cannot enjoy monopoly over the

entire class of goods and, particularly, when he is not using the

said trade mark in respect of certain goods falling under the

same class, cannot be lost sight of. If a proprietor of a trade

mark is permitted to claim protection of a mark even in respect

of the goods/services in which it does not deal in, even remotely,

it would run counter to the object of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_54">Trade Marks Act</a>,

unless it could be established that there is real likelihood of

confusion among the consumers as regards the manufacturer of

the goods/services.
</p>
<p id="p_103">59.   In the case at hand, as indicated above, respondent no.3

primarily dealed in the business of fashion products, namely

apparel, clothing, leather goods and accessories.       Respondent

no.3 claimed to have been in the said business since the year
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                              39/42</span>
                                                     WPST4339-21.DOC

2002. Application for registration of trade mark under multi-

class was made in the year 2017. From the perusal of the

pleadings, it becomes evident that there is no categorical

statement     that   respondent   no.3   ventured     into   &quot;interior

designing&quot; since a particular date. What was urged was that it

was a natural progression for fashion designers to venture into

interior designing. Implicit in this submission is the recognition

that the concepts of interior designing and fashion designing,

are not identical much less interchangeable.          The range of

activities which fall within the ambit of interior designing appear

to be materially distinct from fashion products/services.

</p><p id="p_104">60.     The analogy drawn by the Appellate Board on the basis of

the judgment in the case of M/s Rajmoti Industris (supra) where

the articles were meant for human consumption and thus

constituted similar or cognate/allied goods, does not seem to be

well drawn. Fashion designing and interior designing are

distinct concepts and there is no real likelihood of the persons

who are the consumers of the goods/services of respondent

no.3 being mislead to believe that the interior designing

services, (offered by the petitioner) emanated from respondent

no.3.     In my view, had the Appellate Board consulted the

judgments of Vazir Sultan (supra) and Nandhini Deluxe (supra),

which deal with rectification application, it would not have taken
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                              40/42</span>
                                                    WPST4339-21.DOC

the view that the goods/services offered by the petitioner and

respondent no.3 were similar or cognate/allied and there was

potentiality of confusion or deception amongst the prospective

customers.
</p>
<p id="p_105">61.   The endeavour on the part of respondent no.3 to draw

mileage from the fact that in the registration application the

petitioner had indicated the user as, &quot;proposed to be used&quot; and,

thus, there was an attempt to ride over the goodwill and

reputation of respondent no.3, does not carry the matter any

further.   It would be suffice to note that the petitioner has

placed material on record to demonstrate that it had been

dealing in the business of interior designing since prior to

seeking registration of the trade mark.      Even otherwise, this

does not detract materially from the claim of the petitioner, once

it is found that the businesses are materially distinct and there

is no real likelihood of confusion or deception.

</p><p id="p_106">62.   The upshot of the aforesaid consideration is that the

impugned order suffers from the vice of non-consideration of the

binding judgments of the Supreme Court and consequent

erroneous application of law. Resultantly, the impugned order

deserves to be interfered with. However, by way of abundant

caution it is clarified that the consideration is confined to

justifiability of removal of the petitioner&#x27;s trade mark from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                              41/42</span>
                                                                       WPST4339-21.DOC

                      Register of Trade Marks and this Court may not be understood

                      to have expressed any opinion on the rival claims of the parties,

                      which are being or may be agitated before the Courts and

                      Authorities, in other proceedings.

                      allowed. Hence, the following order:
