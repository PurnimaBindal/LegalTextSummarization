ORDER NO: ____________________________



Per: P.R. Chandrasekharan:
</p>
<p id="p_4">     These two appeals are directed against Orders-in-Revision No: 3/MS(3)COMMR/RGD/06-07 and 4/MS(4)COMMR/RGD/06-07 both dated 11/10/2006 passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise, Raigad.  As the issue involved is common, the appeals are taken up together for consideration and disposal.
</p><p id="p_5">2.  The appellant, M/s. Rieco Industries Ltd., Roha, received technical know-how from M/s. Intensive Filter GmbH &amp; Co. Germany, and M/s. Clean Gas Systems, Inc., USA during the period 01/11/2002 to 30/04/2003. For the technical know-how received they paid royalty to the foreign service-providers.  The department was of the view that the services received falls within the category of Management Consultancy Services and the appellant is liable to pay service tax on reverse charge basis for the period 01/11/2002 to 30/04/2003. Accordingly, service tax demand of ` 42,640/- and ` 9,343/- were confirmed against the appellant along with interest and also imposing equivalent amount of penalties. Aggrieved of the said decision, the appellant is before us.
</p><p id="p_6">3. The learned counsel submits that the appellant is not liable to pay any service tax on reverse charge basis on the service received from abroad prior to 18/04/2006 as held by the honble High Court of Bombay in the case of Indian National Ship Owners <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_1">Association vs. Union of India</a> 2009 (14) STR 289.  Therefore, the demands are not sustainable and the impugned order, as far as it pertains to the appellant, be set aside.
</p><p id="p_7">4. The learned Superintendent (AR) appearing for the Revenue, fairly concedes that the matter is covered by the decision of the honble High Court of Bombay in the case of Indian National Ship Owners <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_2">Association vs. Union of India</a>, cited supra.
</p><p id="p_8">5. After considering the submissions made by both the sides, we agree that the issue involved is squarely covered by the decision of the honble High Court of Bombay in the case of Indian National Ship Owners <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_3">Association vs. Union of India</a>, cited supra. Accordingly, we allow the appeal with consequential relief, if any, in accordance with law.
