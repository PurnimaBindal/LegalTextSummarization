<p id="p_1">            Leave is given to the learned advocate-

    on-record     for    the       petitioners     to         effect

    correction in the cause title of the writ

    petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The    Employees            Provident             Fund

    Organisation, represented by the Regional

    Provident     Fund       Commissioner-I         and         the

    Commissioner himself are the petitioners

    before me airing a grievance that security

    personnel of the erstwhile security agency

    engaged by them, being the respondents 8 to

    20 have been creating obstruction and/or

    disturbance     in       and    around       their        office

    premises and staff quarters which has led to

    disruption    in     normal      functioning         of     the

    Organisation and despite approaching the

    Chief Secretary, Government of West Bengal

    (with representation dated 3/5.11.2009 and

    reminders)     as    well      as   the   local       police

authorities, no action has been taken to

ameliorate their grievance.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      It is alleged that the respondent no.6

was previously engaged as the security agency

for the Organisation. However, with effect

from 1.10.2009



the contract with the respondent no.6 has

been terminated and a fresh contract has

been executed with the respondent no.7. This

infuriated the personnel engaged by the

respondent no.6 who have, in the guise of

lawful trade union activities, hung up flags

and festoons at the entrance of the office of

the    Organisation      and     have      been

unauthorisedly   committing    trespass   apart

from raising slogans and indulging in 'gherao'.

Personnel of the respondent no.7 are being

constantly threatened while they seek to

perform their duties.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      By filing a supplementary affidavit, the

petitioners have alleged that insecurity and

lawlessness is not only prevailing at the office

premises but safety and security of the

personnel of the Organisation residing at the

staff quarters with their family are also in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                   3</span>




jeopardy because of unruly conduct of the

respondents 8 to 20.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      In the writ petition, the petitioners have

prayed for, inter alia, orders on the Chief

Secretary, Government of West Bengal to

consider the representation dated 3.11.2009

and on the police authorities              for ensuring

that provisions of the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_1">Police Act</a>, 1861 are

adhered to. A writ has also been prayed for on

the respondents 8 to 20 not to squat,

demonstrate or hold meeting within a radius

of 50 meters of the gates of the office premises

and the staff quarters of the petitioners and

not   to   obstruct        the    respondent   no.7    to

discharge its duties thereat.</p><pre id="pre_2">

      At    the   outset,         Mr.   Mukhopadhyay,

learned       advocate            representing        the

respondents       8         to     20     objected     to

maintainability       of    the    writ   petition.   He

</pre><p id="p_6">contended that perusal of the writ petition

would reveal the anxiety of the petitioners to

espouse the cause of the respondent no.7

although no complaint whatsoever has been

lodged by it in respect of alleged obstruction

created by the respondents 8 to 20, resulting

in it not being able to perform its duty.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                      4</span>




</p><p id="p_7">         He further contended that there is no

evidence on record to demonstrate that the

respondents 8 to 20 had committed any

wrong thereby affecting the rights of the

petitioners       prejudicially.     If    at    all   the

respondents 8 to 20 have committed any

cognizable        offence    and     the     police    has

remained inactive, remedy of the petitioners

lies in approaching the appropriate forum

under       the   Code      of    Criminal      Procedure

(hereafter the Code) and the Writ Court would

not be the proper forum to ventilate such

grievance. He placed strong reliance on the

decision in <a href="/doc/325716/" id="a_2">Aleque Padamsee vs. Union of

India</a>,      (2007)    6     SCC     171,     particularly

paragraph 7 to contend that the petitioners

must approach the forum provided by the

Code. Paragraph 7 of the decision reads as

follows :
</p>
<p id="p_8">"7.    Whenever any information is received by
the police about the alleged commission of
offence which is a cognizable one there is a
duty to register the FIR. There can be no
dispute on that score. The only question is
whether a writ can be issued to the police
authorities to register the same. The basic
question is as to what course is to be adopted
if the police does not do it. As was held in All
India Institute of Medical Sciences case and
reiterated in Gangadhar case the remedy
available is as set out above by filing a
complaint before the Magistrate. Though it was
faintly suggested that there was conflict in the
views in All India Institute of Medical Sciences
case, Gangadhar case, Hari Singh case, Minu
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                  5</span>




Kumari case and Ramesh Kumari case, we
find that the view expressed in Ramesh
Kumari case related to the action required to be
taken by the police when any cognizable
offence is brought to its notice. In Ramesh
Kumari case the basic issue did not relate to
the methodology to be adopted which was
expressly dealt with in All India Institute of
Medical Sciences case, Gangadhar case, Minu
Kumar case and Hari Singh case. The view
expressed in Ramesh Kumari case was
reiterated in <a href="/doc/521920/" id="a_3">Lallan Chaudhary v. State of
Bihar</a>. The course available, when the police
does not carry out the statutory requirements
under <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_4">Section 154</a> the police does not carry out
the statutory requirements under <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_5">Section 154</a>
was directly in issue in All India Institute of
Medical Sciences case, Gangadhar case, Hari
Singh case and Minu Kumari case. The correct
position in law, therefore, is that the police
officials ought to register the FIR whenever
facts brought to their notice show that
congnizable offence has been made out. In
case the police officials fail to do so, the
modalities to be adopted are as set out in
<a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_6">Section 190</a> read with Section 200 of the
Code.*******."
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">      Next, he relied on the decision in <a href="/doc/1836621/" id="a_7">Sakiri

Vasu vs. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, (2008) 2 SCC

409 wherein the law laid down in Aleque

Padamsee (supra) has been reiterated.

</p><p id="p_11">      He then contended that no mandamus

can issue without there being a legal right.

According to him, there has been no failure on

the part of the respondent authorities to

discharge statutory duty and, therefore, on

the authority of the decisions in <a href="/doc/962200/" id="a_8">Tirumala

Tirupati Devasthanams vs. K. Jotheeswara

Pillai</a>, (2007) 9 SCC 461, and <a href="/doc/1680408/" id="a_9">State of Manipur
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                      6</span>




vs. Token Singh</a>, (2007) 5 SCC 65, the petition

must fail.
</p>
<p id="p_12">         It was also contended by him that the

petition      should       fail    on   the     ground          of

suppression          of       material        facts.           The

respondents 8 to 20 had raised an industrial

dispute and the Labour Commissioner is in

seisin     thereof        having     called     upon           the

disputing parties before him to resolve it. The

petitioners have deliberately suppressed such

fact and, therefore, are also not entitled to

discretionary relief.
</p>
<p id="p_13">         On    merits,      he     submitted     that          the

respondents 8 to 20 have never disrupted

normal functioning of the Organisation and,

therefore,     if   the     petition     is   held        to    be

maintainable         upon          overruling        of        his

preliminary objection, the respondents 8 to 20

may be called upon to place their version on

record by filing counter affidavit.

</p><p id="p_14">         Ms. Saha, learned advocate for the State

respondents, had placed before me the written

instructions dated 12.2.2010 furnished to her

by   the      Inspector-in-Charge,            Bidhannagar

(East) Police Station. It appears from the same

that when the personnel of the respondent

no.7 reported for work on 1.10.2009, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                     7</span>




security personnel of the respondent no.6,

being the old security guards, did not allow

them to take over the site and compelled them

not    to   perform          their   duty.     They    also

threatened the personnel of respondent no.7.

In this respect Bidhannagar (East) Police

Station Case No.169 dated 20.10.2009 under

<a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_10">Sections 341</a>/<a href="/doc/1947545/" id="a_11">448</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_12">506</a> of the Indian Penal

Code had been registered. Investigation of the

case is in progress and that one person had

been    arrested.       Although      a    new   security

agency has been deputed the old security

guards are still agitating to perform their old

duty    under   the          banner       of   CITU.    On

22.10.2009, the old guards started agitation

in support of their demand to perform duty in

the office premises. The last two sentences of

the penultimate paragraph of the written

instructions reads as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_15">"At present, the problem is still containing.
Vigilance and watch is containing so that no
untoward incident in respect of L &amp; O situation
take place."
</p>
<p id="p_16">       According        to     Ms.   Saha,     the     word

'containing' referred to in the penultimate

paragraph must be understood to convey a

meaning that the problem is under control

and not 'continuing' as thought of by me.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                   8</span>




</p><p id="p_17">      She     submitted     that       the     police

authorities having discharged their duty, the

petitioners have no reason to feel aggrieved.

</p><p id="p_18">      Mr. Mallick, learned senior advocate

representing the petitioners, contended that

the writ petition is maintainable despite the

decisions in Aleque Padamsee (supra) and

Sakiri Vasu (supra). According to him, those

decisions relate to inaction of the police in

respect of an incident of the past and the

same were not dealing with a case of the

present nature where allegation regarding

non-discharge of statutory duties by the

administrative    authorities    was    in     issue.

According to him, the petitioners are not

ordinary     individuals   moving      Court      for

protecting     their   private     interest;     the

petitioners are state functionaries bound to

discharge statutory functions and thereby

stand on a different footing. The inaction,

failure and/or neglect of the administrative

authorities to come to the petitioners' rescue

is indefensible and the Court ought to exercise

writ powers in the present case to enable a

statutory body to function normally without

any disruption from outside elements.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                     9</span>




</p><p id="p_19">      He     relied          on    the     decisions    in

<a href="/doc/1790216/" id="a_13">Transmissions P. Ltd. vs. C.V. Bapat</a>, AIR

1981 Bombay 83,               and <a href="/doc/1010317/" id="a_14">Mysore Machinery

Manufacturers vs. State</a>, AIR 1969 Mysore 51

in support of his submission that if the police

fails to discharge statutory duties on receipt of

a   complaint       from          an     aggrieved   party

disclosing commission of cognizable offence, a

writ petition would be maintainable to set the

police in motion.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      He also relied on the decision in <a href="/doc/1649577/" id="a_15">P.R.

Murlidharan         vs        Swami        Dharmananda

Theertha      Padar</a>, (2006) 4 SCC 501, to

contend that a writ of mandamus directing

the police authorities to give protection may

be given if life and liberty is at stake.

</p><p id="p_21">      Referring to the written instructions of

the local police he contended that the same

bears testimony of the situation prevailing at

the office premises of the Organisation and in

view of the failure of the police to contain the

respondents     8       to    20   from     indulging   in

disruptive activities, he urged the Court to

grant necessary relief in public interest.

</p><p id="p_22">      I have heard the parties and considered

the materials on record. The sole question

which arises for a decision at this stage is as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                     10</span>




to whether on the basis of the facts and

circumstances presented, the writ petition

deserves to be entertained and if so, to what

interim relief the petitioners are entitled.

</p><p id="p_23">        The petitioners have alleged that the

Chief      Secretary          despite    receipt      of

representations          seeking    intervention    has

largely remained inactive inasmuch as no

remedial action has yet been initiated at his

end. In fact, relief has been prayed for against

the respondent no.2 in terms of prayer (a) of

the petition. Irrespective of whatever has been

claimed against the police authorities, the writ

petition praying for orders to activate the

respondent no.2 on his alleged failure to rise

to the occasion and come to the aid and

assistance of a            statutory body like the

Organisation cannot be thrown out at the

threshold on the basis of the decisions cited

by Mr. Mukhopadhyay.               However, I do not

intend to rest my decision on the question of

maintainability without dealing with the said

decisions.
</p>
<p id="p_24">        The    decision       in   Aleque   Padamsee

(supra) followed the earlier decisions rendered

by the Apex Court on the point of police

inaction      to   register    a   complaint.      Those
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                      11</span>




referred to and relied on therein are All India

Institute    of   Medical        Sciences    Employees'

Union,      (1996)    11    SCC     582;     <a href="/doc/1456561/" id="a_16">Gangadhar

Janardhan Mhatre vs State of Maharashtra</a>,

(2004) 7 SCC 768; <a href="/doc/259068/" id="a_17">Minu Kumari vs State of

Bihar</a>, (2006) 4 SCC 359; and <a href="/doc/1840759/" id="a_18">Hari Singh vs

State of U.P</a>., AIR 2007 SC 2464.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      Paragraph 7 of the decision which

declares the law has been noted above. In no

uncertain terms law has been laid down

therein that when the police fails or neglects

to register a complaint disclosing commission

of cognizable offence, the complainant is not

without a remedy inasmuch as in such a

contingency          he    has     the      remedy   of

approaching the competent Magistrate under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">

the Code</a>. It has further been observed that in

such a case, a writ petition is not to be

entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      In Sakiri Vasu (supra) the same view

has been expressed and it has been held that

the High Court must discourage writ petitions

or petitions under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_20">Section 482</a> of the Code

where alternative remedies under <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_21">Sections

154(3)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_22">Section 36</a> or <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_23">Section 156(3)</a>

or <a href="/doc/943588/" id="a_24">Section 200</a> of the Code have not been

exhausted.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                   12</span><p id="p_27">




</p><p id="p_28">        It seems that in all these cases, the law

has been declared keeping in mind inaction

of the police to register and investigate

complaints in terms of power conferred under

Chapter XII of the Code with regard to alleged

commission of cognizable offence without

reference to Chapter XI of the Code or the

<a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_25">Police Act</a>. However what would require close

scrutiny, having regard to the fact that the

Apex Court did not have the occasion to

consider the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_26">Section

23</a> of the Police Act read with <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_27">Section 149</a> of

the Code, is whether the law laid down therein

would     also   be    applicable   for   continuing

offences in respect whereof the police is

alleged to be inactive, as well as cases where

on anticipation that an offence may be

committed the police is informed but it

remains inactive, and thus fails to discharge a

statutory duty as required by provisions

contained in Chapter X of the Code or <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_28">Section

149</a> thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        In relation to precedents binding on me

under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_29">Article 141</a> of the Constitution, certain

decisions have necessarily to be adverted to at

this stage. The Apex Court in its decision in

<a href="/doc/1863554/" id="a_30">Divisional Controller, KSRTC vs Mahadeva
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                  13</span>




Shetty</a>, (2003) 7 SCC 197, has held that "the

only thing binding as an authority upon a

subsequent Judge is the principle upon which

the   case   was      decided."   <a href="/doc/703650/" id="a_31">In   Director   of

Settlements, A.P. vs M.R. Apparao</a>, AIR 2002

SC 1598, it was ruled that "when Supreme

Court decides a principle it would be the duty

of the High Court or a subordinate Court to

follow the decision of the Supreme Court.". In

the said decision, it has also been held that

"the decision in a judgment of the Supreme

Court cannot be assailed on the ground that

certain aspects were not considered or the

relevant provisions were not brought to the

notice of the Court."
</p>
<p id="p_30">      However, in <a href="/doc/756364/" id="a_32">The Regional Manager vs

Pawan Kumar Dubey</a>, AIR 1976 SC 1766, the

Apex Court ruled as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_31">"It is the rule deducible from the application of
law to the facts and circumstances of a case
which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not
some conclusion based upon facts which may
appear to be similar. One additional or
different fact can make a world of difference
between conclusions in two cases even when
the same principles are applied in each case to
similar facts."
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">      Another decision on the point is the one

in <a href="/doc/747596/" id="a_33">The State Financial Corporation vs M/s.

Jagadamba Oil Mills</a>, AIR 2002 SC 834,

wherein without referring to Pawan Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                  14</span>




Dubey (supra) but adopting the principle laid

down in it, it has been ruled that judgments

of Courts are not to be construed as statutes

and    since   circumstantial   flexibility,   one

additional or different fact may make a world

of difference between conclusions in two

cases, disposal of cases by placing blind

reliance on a decision is not proper.

</p><p id="p_34">       The situation in this case is somewhat

different. The grievance of the petitioners is

that in course of espousing their rights

allegedly flowing from the labour laws of the

country, the respondents 8 to 20 are resorting

to    demonstration   and/or    agitation      and

thereby disrupting the functional activities of

a statutory body and this the respondent

authorities, in terms of provisions contained

under Chapters X and XI of the Code read

with <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_34">Section 23</a> of the Police Act, are bound to

tackle by removal/prevention thereof.

</p><p id="p_35">       Neither in Aleque Padamsee (supra) nor

in the other reported cases referred to above,

the Apex Court was seized of an issue similar

to the one at hand. There was no allegation of

refusal or failure of the police to take action

either under Chapters X or XI of the Code

read with <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_35">Section 23</a> of the Police Act. In this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                 15</span>




connection, to my mind, the decisions in P.R.

Murlidharan (supra) and <a href="/doc/990886/" id="a_36">Howrah Mills Co.

Ltd. vs Mohd. Shamin</a>, (2006) 5 SCC 539,

would deserve consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      In P.R. Murlidharan (supra), the Apex

Court appears to have carved out certain

exceptional situations on the occurrence of

which a person may be entitled to police

protection by way of issuance of mandamus.

It has been held that:
</p>
<p id="p_37">" A writ of mandamus directing the police
authorities to give protection to the person of a
writ petitioner can be issued, when the Court is
satisfied that there is a threat to his person
and the authorities have failed to perform their
duties ............
</p>
<p id="p_38">   A writ for 'police protection' so called, has
only a limited scope, as, when the Court is
approached for protection of rights declared by
a decree or by an order passed by a Civil
Court........."
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">      In   Howrah        Mills   (supra),   while

considering whether the State of West Bengal

should have responded to a request for

protecting the property from trespassers so as

to ensure that revival of a sinking industry is

achieved and its workers are protected, the

Apex Court observed that in such a situation

it was the duty of the police of the State to

</p><p id="p_41">        In Transmissions P. Ltd. (supra), a

learned Judge of the Bombay High Court was

seized with the question as to whether the

petitioners    are        entitled   to   claim    police

protection or assistance for enforcing their

right of entering the factory premises and

enjoying their properties. On consideration of

the provisions contained in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37"> the Code</a> as well

as the Bombay Police Act, 1951, it was held

that the Writ Court would not be powerless to

intervene if the police fail or refuse to carry

out their duty.
</p>
<p id="p_42">        The Division Bench of the Mysore High

Court in Mysore Machinery Manufacturers

(supra) also held that if the police authorities

fail to take action, the management can

approach the High Court for issue of writ of

mandamus against them and failure of the

management to move the Magistrate under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_38">

the Code</a> does not debar the High Court from

exercising its discretionary power of issuing a

writ.

worthwhile to take note of a decision of the

Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in

1989 SC 1607, held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_44">" It is clear from the above pronouncement that
a writ of mandamus should be issued to police
authorities to enforce law. It is needless to say
that duties imposed on the police authorities
are to prevent the commission of crimes
including the commission of cognizable
offences. It is immaterial whether such crime is
committed against an individual or public at
large. In this view of ours it is necessary for us
to grant the relief to the appellant because he is
complaining of the inaction on the part of the
police authorities to prevent the respondents
from committing offences and also rescue the
appellant from the clutches of the contesting
respondents who have taken law in their own
hands and are preventing the management
from exercising their fundamental right to
engage their own men and carry on a lawful
trade or business as above. For the foregoing
reasons the writ petition and writ appeal are
allowed.****"
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">      In the present case, there is no dispute

with regard to enjoyment of property rights.

The office premises as well as the staff

quarters belong to the Organisation. The

respondents 8 to 20 have no semblance of a

right to either trespass on such property or to

prevent ingress to and egress from the same.

Undoubtedly the petitioners have the right to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                 18</span>




discharge their statutory obligations from the

office   premises    without       interference     from

outside elements. The respondents 8 to 20 in

order    to   secure        service     benefits    can

legitimately take recourse to the labour laws.

However, in course thereof, the laws do not

permit them to conduct themselves in a

fashion which might jeopardize the interest of

hundreds and thousands of employees whose

needs are taken care of by the Organisation

and hold them to ransom. In such situation

not only the interest of the Organisation and

its officers but also the lives of the employees

who have the right to visit the office of the

Organisation, guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_41">Article 19(1)</a> of

the Constitution, for ensuring their right to

life protected by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_42">Article 21</a> thereof, have to be

given    primacy.      If    the      petitioners    for

maintaining peaceful atmosphere seek police

protection and alleging that protection prayed

for has been denied approaches the Court of

Writ for enforcement of not only their rights

but also the fundamental rights of employees

associated with the Organisation, can the writ

petition be held to be not maintainable on the

authority of the decisions in Aleque Padamsee

(supra) and Sakiri Vasu (supra)? The issue, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                    19</span>




my considered view, has to be answered in

favour of the petitioners and against the State

and the respondents 8 to 20.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      The petitioners are rendering service to

the society by attending to the employees of

various employers for securing their future

life. Disputes and/or differences may exist

between the petitioners on the one hand and

the respondents 6 and 8 to 20 on the other. It

has    not     been      contended         by    Mr.

Mukhopadhyay that the respondents 8 to 20

are the direct employees of the petitioners. At

this stage, the assertion in the petition that

they are the employees of the respondent no.6

has to be accepted as correct. Whatever

disputes/differences have arisen between the

petitioners and the respondent no.6 as a

consequence whereof the respondents 8 to 20

feel aggrieved are to be sorted out by taking

recourse to remedies available in law. Even

though holding of demonstrations and/or

engaging in agitation to secure relief/benefits

may be recognized trade union activities, such

rights cannot be allowed to be exercised by

trampling    the    rights   of   others   to   their

detriment and prejudice. The petitioners exist

for employees like the respondents 8 to 20
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                    20</span>




and that the interests of the employees being

catered to by the petitioners is of paramount

consideration.      No        activity        should     be

undertaken so as to cause harm to them or

prejudice their interests. This petition, where

the petitioners have expressed the grievance

that the police has not set the law in motion

despite the respondents 8 to 20 having

indulged in disruptive activities, ought not

and cannot be thrown out at the threshold on

the authority of the decisions in Aleque

Padamsee (supra) and Sakiri Vasu (supra)

which    are     distinguishable         and    have     no

application on facts and in the circumstances

of this case.
</p>
<p id="p_48">        Merely because the Magistrate under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_43">

the Code</a> has not been moved is no ground to

refuse   relief.   The    inaction       of    the     Chief

Secretary to respond has not been explained

by Ms. Saha. The Chief Secretary had a duty

to speak, which has not been discharged. It

cannot    therefore      be    contended        that    the

petitioners do not have legal right to maintain

this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_49">        I am also unable to concur with Mr.

Mukhopadhyay that the writ petition must fail

on the ground of suppression of facts. Mere
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                      21</span>




pendency      of     the       proceedings      before   the

Labour Commissioner is not germane for a

decision by me on this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_50">       The     preliminary            objection       stands

overruled. The writ petition is held to be

maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_51">       Now comes the question of grant of

interim relief. I am unable to agree with the

interpretation given by Ms. Saha to the

expression 'containing' in the penultimate

paragraph      of        the    instructions,      extracted

supra. In my view, the Inspector-in-Charge

intended to express that the problem is

continuing and that vigilance and watch is

continuing so that no untoward incident takes

place. The word 'continuing', it seems, has

been    misprinted             as     'containing'.      The

instructions        support         the   claim     of   the

petitioners that the problem arising out of

termination         of     the      contract      with   the

respondent no.6 has been persisting and

consequently             disrupting       their      normal

functioning. The Chief Secretary being the

numero uno at the bureaucratic level ought to

have looked into the repeated representations

sent to him by the petitioners. Not having

acted either way on consideration of the same,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                   22</span>




I have no other option but to grant interim

relief to the petitioners based on my prima

facie satisfaction that the petitioners are

entitled    to   the    same      and      that     unless

interdicted at this stage, the petitioners would

suffer irreparable loss and injury.

</p><p id="p_52">       I,    accordingly,         direct     that      the

respondents 8 to 20 while being entitled to

engage in lawful trade union activities shall

not in any manner whatsoever hinder the

normal functioning of the Organisation. No

obstruction shall be caused to free ingress

and egress of all concerned to and from the

office premises and staff quarters of the

Organisation. If there be any such obstruction

or   disturbance       at   the    instance       of   the

respondents 8 to 20 and if any specific

complaint is lodged with the respondent police

authorities in this respect by the petitioners,

it shall be their duty to give the petitioners

such    protection      and    assistance         as   the

circumstances would warrant according to

law as well as to prevent commission of

offence so that the Organisation may function

without any disruption.           It shall be open to

the respondent authorities to consider the

desirability of restraining the respondents 8 to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                          23</span>




      20   from     holding   any   demonstration    or

      agitational activities within a radius of 50

      meters of the gates of the office premises as

      well as the staff quarters if the situation at

      any given point of time turns worse. The Chief

      Secretary shall oversee that these directions

      are complied with by his subordinates, the

      police authorities as well as the respondents 8

      to 20.
</p>
<p id="p_53">               The respondents shall be entitled to file

      composite affidavit-in-opposition dealing with

      the contents of the writ petition as well as the

      supplementary affidavit within four weeks

      from date; reply, if any, thereto may be filed

      by two weeks thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_54">               The writ petition shall be treated as

      ready for hearing upon expiry of the time

      mentioned above for exchange of affidavits

      and thereafter the parties shall be at liberty to

      mention the writ petition for hearing before

      the appropriate bench.
