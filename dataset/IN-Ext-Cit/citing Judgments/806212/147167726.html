MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT and for costs.
</p>

<p id="p_7">      2.     Case of the plaintiff in brief is as follows:
      The plaintiff is a registered partnership concern
carrying    on     business       in     running    Andhra      Style
vegetarian &amp; Non-vegetarian restaurant.                  They have
been using the trade mark NANDHINI in respect of
said business since 1989. The artistic work, design
and get-up in respect of trade mark NANDHINI
exclusively belongs to them.             On account of intrinsic
value, salesmanship and quality of food prepared by
them, their trade mark has become popular all over
south India. The trademark and copyright in respect of
NANDHINI exclusively belongs to them. They are
running     12     branches        at    Bangalore.     They     also
registered their trade mark NANDHINI and NANDHINI
DELUXE under class 42. The same has been registered
under      the   Copy     right        Act   1957    under     No.A-
62848/2002. Recently defendant commenced their
restaurant by name NANDHINI MUSHROOM FAMILY
RESTAURANT          by using their trade mark/copyright
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                       5                     O.S.No.5778/2017</span>



NANDHINI DELUXE and NANDHINI used by them
since 1989. The action of the defendant to adopt the
trade        mark   NANDHINI      MUSHROOM          FAMILY
RESTAURANT is fraudulent, illegal, contrary to law
and unauthorized and calculated to deceive the
customers. The defendant in order to encash upon
reputation and goodwill built up by plaintiff has
adopted similar name and they have no authority or
right to use the trading style NANDHINI MUSHROOM
FAMILY RESTAURANT for running restaurant. It is
creating confusion among the customers and it also
amounts to infringing and passing off action under
Trade Mark Act. Hence the suit is filed for the above
reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        3.    The   defendant    appeared    through       its
counsel, have not filed the written statement inspite of
granting sufficient time.       Hence the case is posted
plaintiff evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_9">        4. The plaintiff in order to prove its case got
examined its managing partner as PW1, got marked
documents at Ex.P1 to P18 and closed their side.

<p id="p_10">     5. Heard the argument of plaintiff and perused
the contentions made out. The counsel for the plaintiff
has relied on the following decisions:

</p><p id="p_14">         8.POINT No.1 &amp; 2: Plaintiff had sought for the
relief        of    permanent      injunction      to    restrain     the
defendant, its servants, agents, or any one claiming
through them in any manner infringing the plaintiff's
trademark            and   copy    right     NANDHINI        DELUXE/

NANDHINI for running Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian
Restaurant            by   using    offending      name      NANDHINI
MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT and also for
passing off and for rendering true accounts of the
profits        of    defendant     derived    by   promoting        their
company by using offending trade mark/trading style

and directing payment of such acts having made
profits to the plaintiff and plaintiff had also sought for
damages.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     9.    It is the contention of the plaintiff that it is a
registered partnership concern carrying on business in
running Andhra Style vegetarian &amp; Non-vegetarian
restaurant.    They have obtained registration with
Registrar of Firms. They have been using the trade
mark NANDHINI for running Andhra Style Vegetarian
&amp; Non-Vegetarian Restaurant since 1989. The trade
mark NANDHINI is exclusively belongs to them, has
adopted the same in a particular artistic work, design
and get-up    with specially designed fonts with dots
inserted in each of the alphabets. On account of
intrinsic value, salesmanship and quality of food
prepared by them, their trade mark has become
popular all over South India. They are running
altogether 12 branches at Bangalore and at different
places and they have obtained registration of their
trademark NANDHINI and NANDHINI DELUXE under
Trademarks Act, 1999.        With a view to protect the
trade mark and particular design, get up, they have
secured registration of trade mark NANDHINI under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                        9                          O.S.No.5778/2017</span>



Copy Right Act and the same has been registered
under <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_1">Copyright Act</a> 1957.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      10.    It is the contention of the plaintiff that
defendant commenced their restaurant under the
name and style NANDHINI MUSHROOM FAMILY
RESTAURANT by using the plaintiff's well established
registered trademark NANDHINI DELUXE adopted and
used by the plaintiff since 1989. The act of the
defendant      to   adopt       the   trade    mark    NANDHINI
MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT is fraudulent,
illegal,    contrary       to   law   and     unauthorized     and
calculated to deceive the customers of the plaintiff.
The trade mark NANDHINI MUSHROOM FAMILY
RESTAURANT is structurally, phonetically and visually
similar to plaintiff's registered trademark.                 Since
plaintiff and defendant are engaged in business of
providing food, the adoption of trade name NANDHINI
MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT by defendant is
causing confusion among the customers. Defendant
who is aware of the plaintiff's trade mark, reputation
and goodwill has fraudulently adopted NANDHINI
MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT for providing food
in order to deceive the customers and to encash upon
goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.                  So the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                     10                     O.S.No.5778/2017</span>



adoption of similar trade style by the defendant
amounts to infringement of the trade mark and also
amounts to passing off action under Trade Mark Act.
</p>

<p id="p_17">      11.    Plaintiff in order to prove their case, had
opted to examine partner of the plaintiff firm as PW1
and in support of the oral evidence it had produced the
documents which are marked as Ex.P1 to P18.
Defendant though appeared through counsel have not
chosen to file their defence by way of written
statement. Defendant is shown as proprietary concern,
so as to deny the allegations made them and not
contested the suit and rebutted the evidence of the
plaintiff.   Plaintiff had produced the certified copy of
two instrument of partnership as Ex.P1 &amp; 2 and
partnership deed dtd.1.4.1995marked as Ex.P3 and
the certified copy of the trademark certificates as Ex.P4
&amp; 5. Copyright certificate as Ex.P6.       On Perusal of
Ex.P4 to 6 it makes out that plaintiff firm trade mark
NANDHINI/ NANDHINI DELUXE is registered as per
Ex.P4 &amp; P5 and copyright holder as per Ex.P6. Ex.P15
is the registration certificate of the plaintiff. Ex.P16 to
18 are downloaded print outs of online status of the
plaintiff along with certificate under <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_2">section 65B</a>.
Ex.P7 is the bill of the plaintiff restaurant. Ex.P8 is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                      11                    O.S.No.5778/2017</span>



menu card of plaintiff and Ex.P9 is packaging cover.
Ex.P10 is the tissue paper of the plaintiff. Ex.P11 is
the visiting card of the defendant. Ex.P12 &amp; 13 are the
photographs of defendant's hotel. Ex.P14 is the CD.
</p>

<p id="p_18">      12.   The     oral   evidence   coupled   with    the
documentary evidence of the plaintiff makes out that
plaintiff is a registered partnership firm and it is
running Andhra Style vegetarian and non-vegetarian
restaurant and it is using the trade mark NANDHINI
where by it is registered with the mark NANDHINI and
NANDHINI DELUXE as per documents produced. On
the other hand, defendant had not placed any
materials to make out either they are prior user of the
mark NANDHINI MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT
or whether they have got exclusive right over the word
NANDHINI. So use of word NANDHINI MUSHROOM
FAMILY RESTAURANT by the defendant which is
deceptively similar to that of the trade mark /copyright
of the plaintiff are amounts to infringement of the
plaintiff   trade   mark    NANDHINI     and    NANDHINI
DELUXE. Plaintiff is a partnership firm is registered
since from 1989 which makes out that they are into
the hotel business since from 1989. So since from long
use of the trade mark by the plaintiff it had gained
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                       12                            O.S.No.5778/2017</span>



goodwill. So as defendant is using the word NANDHINI,
there is confusion caused in the minds of a normal
person,     that    whether     NANDHINI      DELUXE            and
NANDHINI MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT is of
the same person and in the event of general public
accepting          NANDHINI            MUSHROOM             FAMILY
RESTAURANT to be that of NANDHINI DELUXE which
is the restaurant run by the plaintiff, then there is
sure    passing     off    plaintiff   registered     trade    mark
NANDHINI DELUXE.              Order 8 rule 5(2) states that
where defendant has not filed a pleading, it shall be
lawful for the court to pronounce judgment on the
basis of the fats contained in the plaint, except as
against a person under a disability. In the above
circumstances with the above reasoning I hold point
No.1 &amp; 2 in the affirmative.
</p>

<p id="p_19">       13.Point No.3 &amp; 4: The plaintiff has proved that
they are the registered owner of the trademark/
copyright NANDHINI / NANDHINI DELUXE and on
perusal of Ex.P11 to 13 it appears that the defendant
have infringed and passed off plaintiff's trademark and
copy as held in point No.1 &amp; 2. Therefore plaintiff is
entitled for the relief of permanent injunction as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                      13                     O.S.No.5778/2017</span>



prayed. Hence, I hold the above points in the
affirmative.
</p>

<p id="p_20">     14. Issue No. 5:        Plaintiff had contended that
Defendant      by    fraudulently    adopted   the     mark
NANDHINI MUSHROOM FAMILY RESTAURANT for
providing food in order to deceive the customers and to
encash the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff. So
by using the mark NANDHINI MUSHROOM FAMILY
RESTAURANT there is damages caused to the Plaintiff.
So they have claimed damages of Rs.25,000/- per
month from the date of suit. The Plaintiff in its plaint
has given the list of sales turnover from the year 1989-
90 till 2014-17.          However, the Plaintiff has not
produced any documents or account statement in
support of the same, so as to make out their income
per month and damages that is caused from the date
of filing the suit till the date of disposal. The Plaintiff
has also not shown what is the actual damages or loss
caused   to    the   Plaintiff   after   commencement      of
business by the Defendant. It is also settled principle
of law that in a remedy of damages on passing off, the
plaintiff can either claim damages or account of profit
and not both.

Park Infosys &amp; Ors</a> 2007 (34) PTC 178 (Del). The court
while granting permanent injunction restraining the
defendant from doing business under the name "Park
Infosys", the court refused to grant damages. The court
held that in the absence of any proof of damages, the
plaintiff is not entitled to any damages.
</p>

<p id="p_22">     16.   Dormeuil Freres SA -Vs- Feraglow [1990]
RPC 449 it was held that : An award of damages in
Trademark disputes is essentially an attempt to put
the proprietor into the same position as if the
infringement had not occurred. This means that any
damages awarded will be compensatory rather than
punitive or exemplary. The methodology used to
calculate what compensation is deemed appropriate in
the circumstances is often by reference to the "notional
reasonable licence" i.e. if the infringer was a licensee
under an arms length agreement, what royalty would
have been expected.
</p>

<p id="p_23">     17.   In the present case, the plaintiff has not
able to prove either the profits derived by the
defendant from its illegal activities or such sales record
to establish the loss. So in the circumstances, in the

event of Plaintiff having failed to prove the damages
having caused, there is no question of calling for the
Defendant to render the true account and also Plaintiff
being entitled for any damages. In the circumstances I
hold the above point in the negative.
