THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE R.KANTHA RAO        

WRIT PETITION No.18636 of 2014   

ORDER:  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner was appointed as Assistant Professor of Education in
the 2nd respondent University at Hyderabad by order dated 25.01.2012.
By order dated 28.04.2014 the 2nd respondent transferred the petitioner
from Hyderabad Branch to College of Teacher Education Centre at 
Asansol, West Bengal.  The transfer order is challenged in the writ petition
on the ground that it is arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional and in
violation of the rights of the petitioner under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the
Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_2">      It is the version of the petitioner that he suffered serious
neurological and E.N.T issues for which he had to undergo surgery at
Yashoda Hospital, Hyderabad, the empanelled Hospital of the 2nd
respondent University in November, 2013.  One part of the surgery
relating to his left ear has already been done and the second surgery
relating to the right ear is yet to be done.  He says that the Doctors at
Yashoda Hospital, Hyderabad advised him to attend for regular
consultations and follow-ups and not to travel long distances.  The
petitioner was transferred along with 11 other Assistant Professors.  The
petitioner after receiving the transfer orders, brought to the notice of the
2nd respondent his health condition, but the transfer order has not been
withdrawn so far.  He submits that the transfer order of one Mrs.Taiyaba
Nazli who was transferred under the very same impugned order has been 
stayed and she has been asked to continue at Hyderabad Branch of the 
2nd respondent University, but in spite of his medical condition, the
petitioners request to keep him at Hyderabad was not considered.
</p><p id="p_3">      According to the petitioner, the 2nd respondent university does not
have any empanelled hospitals in any other part of the country, therefore,
if he is transferred to any other part of the country, he would be
necessarily required to come to Hyderabad on regular basis for treatment
by the Doctors of the empanelled hospital at Hyderabad.  Further, he
submits that only in the empanelled hospital at Hyderabad there is
cashless treatment available and the said facility is not available at the
place where he was transferred.
</p><p id="p_4">      Nextly it is submitted by the petitioner that under the apprehension
that he may lose his job, he purchased Air ticket to Calcutta and Railway
ticket from Calcutta to Asansol, but on the night of 02.07.2014 he again
developed serious pain in the left side of the face and therefore, he could
not travel and join at the place of his transfer.  In response to the
representation made by the petitioner, the 2nd respondent did not
consider his request for retaining him at Hyderabad and assured that it
would reimburse all the medical expenses which the petitioner incurs in
any hospital even though not empanelled and also stated that the
petitioner can as well apply for leave at Asansol and come to Hyderabad
and get the treatment.
</p><p id="p_5">      The version of the petitioner is that he would be able to perform
his duties of teaching only if he is under regular supervision of the Doctors
at Hyderabad and if he is forced to go to Asansol, he would not be able to
perform his duties as a teacher as there is no empanelled hospital there.
Stating that if he is forced to go and join at Asansol, he would suffer
irreparable loss and injury and his medical condition would worsen and he
would suffer permanent deafness, which would make him unemployable   
as a teacher and his family would also suffer grave hardship because of
the transfer.  Stating these grounds, the petitioner filed the present writ
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to set aside the
transfer order and to issue a direction to the 2nd respondent University to
reconsider the said transfer order and continue him in Hyderabad.
</p><p id="p_6">      The writ petition is stoutly opposed by the 2nd respondent
contending inter alia in the counter affidavit as follows:
</p><p id="p_7">      The medical condition stated by the petitioner in the writ petition is
false and invented for the purpose of violating the transfer orders passed
by the 2nd respondent university.  The appointment order of the petitioner
clearly mentions that the petitioner may be posted at any of the
institutions of the University in the country during the service.  The
petitioner having accepted the said condition and joined the service
cannot now contend that he cannot be transferred to any place other than
Hyderabad on medical grounds.  The transfer of the petitioner and several
others are made on administrative grounds and the petitioner has no legal
right to question the transfer order.  The petitioner made a representation
on 02.05.2014 seeking extension of time for joining at Asansol till the
treatment is over.  The said representation was considered and the 2nd
respondent University vide reply dated 19.06.2014 informed the petitioner
that he should join at the new place of posting and then take the leave for
the treatment if required.  He was also assured that the 2nd respondent
university would reimburse the medical expenses of the petitioner as per
his entitlement and rules as it did in case of the employees who are
posted in any part of the country, and that the petitioner would definitely
be provided treatment as per his entitlement.
</p><p id="p_8">      It is further contended that if the teaching faculty is reluctant to
join the new institutions on flimsy grounds, the whole academic schedule
of the institutions would be adversely affected and the students would
suffer a lot and therefore, continuing the petitioner in the same place
would be against public interest, academic interest and also against the
efficiency of administration.
</p><p id="p_9">      Nextly it is submitted by the 2nd respondent that the representation
of the petitioner as well as Mrs.Taiyaba Nazli were considered and after
careful consideration of the representations, the case of Mrs.Taiyaba Nazli
was considered and she retained back and the petitioners case was
rejected.  The case of the petitioner was rejected on careful consideration
and that the petitioner cannot claim that as the case of Mrs.Taiyaba Nazli
was considered his case also has to be considered.  The 2nd respondent
University after careful consideration decided that the petitioner should be
asked to join at the new place of posting and then take the leave for the
treatment if required.  Thus, according to the respondents, the transfer is
condition of service, the petitioner or any employee has no vested right to
remain at a particular place, the transfer is not in violation of any rule,
regulation or statute.  The writ petition filed by the petitioner is not
maintainable and he is not entitled to any relief sought for in the writ
petition.
</p><p id="p_10">      I have heard Sri Avinash Desai, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner and Sri K.Rathangapani Reddy and Sri B.Narayana Reddy, 
learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
</p><p id="p_11">      It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
that in view of the health condition of the petitioner and the medical
treatment which the petitioner has to undergo, the impugned transfer
order is arbitrary and wholly unjustifiable and therefore, a direction be
issued to the 2nd respondent university to cancel the transfer order and
retain the petitioner at Hyderabad.
</p><p id="p_12">      On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the 2nd
respondent submits that the grounds on which the transfer was sought to
be reconsidered is invented for the purpose of filing the present writ
petition, even otherwise, the petitioner has no right to ask the Court to
issue a direction to the 2nd respondent university to reconsider the issue of
his transfer and to keep him at Hyderabad only.  According to the learned
counsel appearing for the respondents since the transfer is made on
administrative grounds and the same being not in violation of any rule or
statute, the writ petition itself is not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_13">      The transfer order issued to the petitioner clearly indicates that the
petitioner was transferred on administrative grounds.  Not only the
petitioner, along with him several other employees of the 2nd respondent
University were transferred.  Only the case of one lady Assistant Professor
was reconsidered by the 2nd respondent University on being satisfied with
the grounds pleaded by her.  The petitioner on that score cannot insist
that his case also can be reconsidered.  The scope of judicial review in the
matter of transfers is very limited.  This Court exercises judicial review
only if the transfer is prompted by mala fides.  The transfer is a condition
of service and the employee is under obligation to work at the place to
which he is transferred and he has no legal right to insist that he would
only work at a particular place.
</p><p id="p_14">      The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, in support of his
contentions, relied on a judgment of the Honble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/58448/" id="a_2">State
of M.P. v. S.S.Kourav</a>  wherein it was held as follows:
</p><p id="p_15">      The courts or tribunals are not appellate forums to decide on
transfers of officers on administrative grounds.  It is for the
administration to take appropriate decision and such decisions shall stand
unless they are vitiated either by mala fides or by extraneous
considerations without any factual background or foundation.  In this case
transfer orders having been issued on administrative grounds, expediency
of those orders cannot be examined by the court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      In fact, the petitioner did not plead the issue of mala fides in the
writ petition specifically.  He only stated that the transfer is illegal and it
is
the result of the arbitrary exercise of power.  In any event, if he is able to
show that the transfer is the result of mala fide exercise of power by the
2nd respondent University, this Court may incline to exercise the power of
judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_17">      On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the 2nd
respondent relied on the following judgments in support of this contention
that the writ petition is not maintainable;
</p><p id="p_18">1.      <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_4">Gujarat Electricity Board v. Atmaram</a>
</p><p id="p_19">2.      <a href="/doc/337662/" id="a_5">Bank of India v. Jagjit Singh Mehta</a>
</p><p id="p_20">3.      <a href="/doc/506541/" id="a_6">Airports Authority of India v. Rajeev Ratan Pandey</a>
</p><p id="p_21">4.      <a href="/doc/909172/" id="a_7">Rajendra Singh v. State of U.P</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_8">In Gujarat Electricity Board v. Atmaram</a> (2 supra), the Honble
Supreme Court held that 
      Transfer of a government servant appointed to a particular cadre
of transferable posts from one place to the other is an incident of service.
Transfer from one place to other is necessary in public interest and
efficiency in the public administration.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      <a href="/doc/337662/" id="a_9">In Bank of India v. Jagjit Singh Mehta</a> (3 supra) the Honble
Supreme Court held that 
      There can be no doubt that ordinarily and as far as practicable the
husband and wife who are both employed should be posted at the same  
station even if their employers be different.  The desirability of such a
course is obvious.  However, this does not mean that their place of
posting should invariably be one of their choice, even though their
preference may be taken into account while making the decision in
accordance with the administrative needs.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      <a href="/doc/506541/" id="a_10">In Airports Authority of India v. Rajeev Ratan Pandey</a> (4
supra), the Honble Supreme held that
      mere assertion or bald statement is not enough to discharge the
heavy burden that the law imposes upon the person leveling allegations of
mala fides; it must be supported by requisite materials.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      <a href="/doc/909172/" id="a_11">In Rajendra Singh v. State of U.P</a> (5 supra), the Honble
Supreme Court held that 
      The only question required to be considered in a writ petition
challenging the transfer is whether the transfer of an employee was
actuated with mala fides or otherwise in violation of statutory rules.  The
Supreme Court further held that the government servant has no vested
right to remain posted at a place of his choice, nor can he insist that he
must be posted at one place or the other because no Government can 
function in such manner.  The Courts should not interfere with a transfer
order which is made in public interest and for administrative reasons
unless the transfer orders are made in violation of any mandatory
statutory rule or on the ground of mala fide.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      The contentions urged by both the parties have to be examined in
the light of the ratio laid down by the Honble Supreme court in the afore-
referred judgments.
</p><p id="p_27">      The law is well established that when an employee accepts a
transferable post, he cannot at a later point of time urge that he has to be
retained or posted at a particular place even the transfer may cause
hardship to him.  The only ground on which the order of transfer can be
challenged by an employee is when the transfer is the result of mala fide
exercise of power by the employer or if it is made in violation of
mandatory statutory rule.  The grounds of inconvenience or hardship
cannot be urged in a writ petition to exercise the power of judicial review
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_28">      In the instant case, the appointment order of the petitioner itself
shows that he can be transferred to any of the branches of the 2nd
respondent University in the country.  He accepted the said condition and
joined as Assistant Professor in the 2nd respondent University.  Even
though the 2nd respondent contended that the medical condition was only
invented by the petitioner for the purpose of avoiding the transfer, the
petitioner produced some material to show that he was operated and that
he has been suffering from neurological and ENT problem and that he
also requires a further operation.  It appears that because of the transfer,
some inconvenience or hardship would be caused to the petitioner, but
that itself is not a ground to challenge the transfer order which is made on
administrative grounds.  The 2nd respondent considered his representation
and rejected his case and therefore, he is under an obligation to join at
the place where he is posted.  It is not open for him to contend that
because it would be convenient for him to undergo medical treatment at
Hyderabad he can be retained only at Hyderabad. 
</p><p id="p_29">      The petitioner did not specifically allege any mala fide exercise of
power by the 2nd respondent University though he submitted that the
transfer order is arbitrary and illegal.  As per the law laid down by the
Honble Supreme Court, highly convincing and reliable evidence has to be
placed on record by the petitioner who attributes mala fides to the
employer in the matter of transfer.  The material produced by the
petitioner though shows that the transfer causes some hardship to him, it
does not show that the transfer is the result of mala fide exercise of
power by the 2nd respondent university.  In its reply to the petitioners
representation, the 2nd respondent assured him to reimburse all the
medical expenses which he incurs in any hospital.  A person who suffers
ill-health after his appointment cannot take the stand that in view of his
ill-health he has to be retained at a particular place.
</p><p id="p_30">      Merely because of the medical condition of the petitioner causes
him some inconvenience or hardship on account of transfer, this Court will
not exercise the power of judicial review under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India to issue a direction to the 2nd respondent to
reconsider the case of the petitioner and retain him at Hyderabad.  This
Court is of the considered view that no case is made out by the petitioner
to persuade this Court to exercise the power of judicial review.  The Writ
Petition is therefore dismissed without any order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_31">        Pending miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed in
consequence.
