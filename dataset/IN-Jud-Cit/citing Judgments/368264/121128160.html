                     become very popular by the goods produced by them. No one can use the

                     a blatant imitation of the plaintiffs trademark Aachi/Aachi Super Stores.

                     The defendant use of Sudali Aachi Provision which is deceptively similar

                     mark of the plaintiffs is bound to create confusion and deception in the

                     market. The plaintiff is the prior user under the registered trade mark

                     “AACHI”. Whereas the defendant is a recent entrant. Hence, the adoption

                     and use of the impugned mark amounts to fraud under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_5">Trade Marks Act</a>

                     1999. The defendant&#x27;s adoption of said mark is not an act of innocence but

                     an act of dishonesty, motivated to poach upon the reputation and goodwill

                     enjoyed by the plaintiffs.

                     no infringement of the plaintiffs&#x27; trademark as alleged by the plaintiffs.

                     Neither there is any intention to poach upon the reputation and goodwill

                     enjoyed by the plaintiffs. There is no malafide or ill-intention to copy the

                     trademark of the plaintiffs. The defendant is selling grocery and other

                     masala products including the products of the plaintiffs. There is no

                     similarity between the two marks. The use of common word “AACHI” will

                     not create any doubt in the minds of the public. It is only an assumption on

                     defendant. They use the mark bonafidely, which is already in public domain.

                     is not an invented word, but a term which remains and used in Tamil

                     products are traded through same channel and in fact, the defendant admits

                     grand mother), mg;ghr;rp (Appaachi-grand father). In spoken tamil, the word

                     Aachi(Mr;rp) is used as a second syllable to denote &#x27;done&#x27; – Mudichaachi -

                     Kbr;rhr;rp Time up – Neeram aachi – Neukhr;rp. Vandathaachi or Vandu

                     rptfhkhr;rp (Sivagamiaachi) and kfpikahl;rp (Magimaiaachi). In western Tamil

                     Nadu, a popular town is named as bghs;shr;rp (Pollaachi). Thus, in tamil

                     language, one can find the word “AACHI” (Mr;rp) in abundance either as a

                     whole or part of the pronouns or as suffix to verb or adverbs. In Tamil

                     language, there is no equivalent to the Sanskrit/Hindi consonent &#x27;shi&#x27; ( ????

                     ). The near equivalent consonent to this word in Tamil is chi (rp). Therefore,

                     the pronouns in Tamil, when written in English alphabets, occurrence of

                     using the word &#x27;aachi&#x27; becomes inevitable.

                     &#x27;Rule&#x27;, colloquially by few pronounced as Aachi (Mr;rp). Therefore, if any

                     one tries to write the tamil word (Ml;rp) in English may end up in writing it

                     as aachi (Mr;rp). Hence, for the above reasons, the word Aachi in Tamil

                     cannot be equated with the English words like, Benz, Caterpillar, Bata or

                     Nepoleon Brandy etc., to claim secondary meaning. Without understanding

                     different meaning or a same word with different meaning. For example,

                     blue colour in Tamil is called as (ePy epwk;). The linear measurement-length

                                   runs the risk that the public will continue to use the term in
                                   its descriptive sense rather than identifying it with him. He
                                   must prove that the mark has acquired a secondary meaning
                                   as denoting his goods, and the burden of doing so is higher
                                   in proportion to the descriptive quality of the mark. Even if
                                   secondary meaning is proved two problems remain. One is
                                   that no trader can be prevented from using the word in its
                                   old descriptive sense if he avoids misrepresentation. (as in
                                   the isntant case). The second is that other traders may use
                                   similar and equally descriptive names or marks as their own
                                   and will be allowed to do so even if a degree of confusion
                                   results”. He further goes on to comment “A mark which
                                   is prima facie descriptive will only be protected if it can be

                                    distinctiveness is an essential precondition for all marks,
                                    whether descriptive or fancy, but the burden of proof is
                                    significantly higher for prima facie descriptive terms”.

                                   entitled, may subsequently become public juris, as in the
                                   case which has been cited of Harvey&#x27;s Sauce. It was
                                   admitted that, although that originally had been the name of
                                   a sauce made by a particular individual, it had become
                                   public juris, and that all the world were entitled to call the
                                   sauce they made Harvey&#x27;s sauce if they pleased. Then what
                                   is the test by which a decision is to be arrived at whether a
                                   word which was originally a trade mark has become public
                                   juris? I think the test must be, whether the use of it by other
                                   persons is still calculated to deceive the public, whether it
                                   may still have the effect of inducing the public to buy goods
                                   not made by the original owner of the trade mark as if they
                                   were his goods. If the mark has come to be so public and in
                                   such universal use that nobody can be deceived by the use
                                   of it, and can be induced from the use of it to believe that
                                   he is buying the goods of the original trader, it appears to
                                   me, however hard to some extent it may appear on the
                                   trader, yet practically, as the right to a trade mark is simply
                                   a right to prevent the trader from being cheated by other
                                   persons&#x27; goods being sold as his goods through the
                                   fraudulent use of the trade mark, the right to the trade mark
                                   must be gone.” As we shall see later, these remarks, which
                                   were subsequently approbated by Lord Macnaghten

                                     but it is not the entire test. Another passage, which is
                                     equally important, because it bears upon the principle of the

                                    property. A plaintiff complains of the invasion of this right
                                    to property. The property is in business or goodwill likely
                                    to be injured by misrepresentation. If the mark is distinctive
                                    of the plaintiff&#x27;s goods in the eyes of the public or a class of
                                    the public any misrepresentation is likely to deceive the
                                    ultimate customer. Property is not in the mark, name or get
                                    up improperly used by the defendant. But the property is in

                                    passing off is the infringement of right to property. A
                                    plaintiff can say that the defendant is infringing his name
                                    which is distinctive of his goods. A misuse of that name is
                                    hardly consistent with fair or honest trading, as Lord Parker

                     of its use and limitations under <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_72">Section 30</a> of the Act. The word Aachi, has

                     not gained any secondary meaning going by the test laid in JSB Cement

                     LLP cited supra, wherein the Division Bench of the Calcatta High Court as

                     vividly explained, when a mark gains secondary meaning, in the following

                     terms, “the reputation must be of such quality that it transcends the nature of

                     the goods or service that is attached to. Loosely speaking a mark –

                     particularly a word-mark is said to have secondary meaning when,

                     immediately upon seeing or reading the mark particularly the word-mark

                     the goods or service associated with what the mark particularly a work mark

                     flashes across the mind simultaneously with what the particularly a word

                     marks conveys in its ordinary sense.”
