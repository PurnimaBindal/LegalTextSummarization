     THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION
ON 7.01.2022, ALONG WITH Crl.MC.6702/2021, THE COURT ON
17.01.2022 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

                                 -:7:-



                                                          &quot;C.R.&quot;

                               O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">          Dated this the 17th day of January, 2022


     These Crl.M.Cs are preferred by the State challenging two

separate interlocutory orders passed by the Additional Special

Sessions Court (SPE/CBI)-III, Ernakulam in Crl.M.P.Nos.2039/2021

and 2040/2021 in SC No.118/2018 dated 21 st December, 2021.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.    The respondents are the accused.        The offences

alleged are under Sections 120(B), 109, 342, 366, 354, 354(B),

357, 376(D), 506(1) 201, 212 r/w S.34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> and <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_2">Sections 66(E)</a>

and <a href="/doc/645946/" id="a_3">67(A)</a> of IT Act, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.    The prosecution case in short is that, on the night of

17/2/2017, the survivor, a South Indian cine actress, was

abducted and sexually assaulted in a moving vehicle at

Ernakulam while returning from shooting location by the accused

Nos.1 to 6.   The prosecution alleges that the accused No.8, a

South Indian cine actor and producer, who is the master mind of

the crime hatched the criminal conspiracy with the remaining
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -:8:-</span>

accused to commit the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.    The case which received national attention has

reached this Court and the Apex Court on more than one

occasion at different stages. The Apex Court by its order dated

16th August, 2021 has directed the Court below to complete the

trial within six months which will expire on 15/2/2022.

</p><p id="p_5">     5.    The crime was registered on the date of occurrence

itself. The investigation was conducted by a special team. The

final report was initially filed on 18/4/2017. Thereafter, another

special   team     conducted      further     investigation   and      filed

supplemental final report on 22/11/2017. The examination of the

witnesses commenced at the Court below on 30/1/2020. As many

as 202 witnesses (PWs 1 to 202) were examined on the side of

the prosecution. It is submitted at the Bar that only the main

investigating    officer   was   remaining.    At   that   juncture,    the

prosecution filed two petitions at the Court below as Crl.M.P.

No.2039/2021 and Crl.M.P.No.2040/2021. The former one was u/s

91<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure (for short, the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>) to

summon eight witnesses to produce certain documents and the

latter one u/s 311 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a> was to summon sixteen witnesses to
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    -:9:-</span>

examine them. The respondents/accused stoutly opposed both

the petitions. The respondents Nos.7 and 8/accused Nos.7 and 8

filed objection statements. The Court below after hearing both

sides        dismissed    Crl.M.P.No.2039/2021      and   partly   allowed

Crl.M.P.No.2040/2021 by the impugned orders.               Out of the 16

witnesses sought to be summoned in Crl.M.P.No.2040/2021, the

Court below allowed to summon four witnesses alone.                 Being

aggrieved by the rejection of the prayer for summoning the

remaining witnesses, the State preferred Crl.M.C.No.6702/2021.

Being aggrieved by the dismissal of Crl.M.P.No.2039/2021, it

preferred Crl.M.C.No.6703/2021. Since both the Crl.M.Cs are

interconnected, I am disposing of the same together.

</p><p id="p_6">        6.      I have heard Sri.T.A.Shaji, the learned Director General

of Prosecution appearing for the petitioner/State, Sri.B.Raman

Pillai, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent

No.8/accused No.8, Sri.Pratheeksh Kurup, the learned counsel for

No.4/accused No.4 and Sri.K.V.Sabu, the learned counsel for the

respondent Nos. 5 and 6/accused Nos. 5 and 6,

</p><p id="p_7">     7.    Sri.T.A.Shaji,   the     learned   Director   General   of

Prosecution appearing for the petitioner, submitted that <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_7">Section

311</a> of Cr.P.C. confers a very wide power on the Court to summon

any person as a witness or to recall and reexamine any person

already examined at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other

proceeding and further Section casts a duty upon the Court to

summon and examine or recall and reexamine any such person, if

his evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the

case. A liberal approach shall be the rule and all other

parameters become exceptional, submitted the learned Director

General of Prosecution. He further submitted that the power

conferred u/s 91 are enabling in nature aimed at arming the Court

to enforce and to ensure the production of any document

necessary for the purpose of any trial by issuing a summons to

those in possession of the document and the language of the said

provision would indicate that the width of the powers is unlimited.

According to the learned Director General of Prosecution, the

Court below ought to have allowed both the petitions as prayed
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 -:11:-</span>

for. In support of his argument, the learned Director General of

Prosecution has cited the following decisions of the Apex Court:

<a href="/doc/171510013/" id="a_8">Mohanlal Shamji Soni v. Union of India and Another</a> [1991

Supp (1) SCC 271], <a href="/doc/150011419/" id="a_9">Mannan Shaikh and Others v. State of

West Bengal and Another</a>               [(2014) 13 SCC 59], State

represented by the <a href="/doc/49361454/" id="a_10">Deputy Superintendent of Police v.

Tr.N. Seenivasagan</a> (2021 SCC Online SC 212), <a href="/doc/1219209/" id="a_11">Rejendra

Prasad v. Narcotic Cell</a> (1999 KHC 417) and <a href="/doc/172105947/" id="a_12">Arjun Panditrao

Khotkar v. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal And Others</a> [(2020)

7 SCC 1]. Per contra, Sri.B.Raman Pillai, the learned Senior

Counsel   appearing   for      the   respondent   No.8/accused   No.8

submitted that the Court below rightly rejected the request of the

petitioner to summon the witnesses and to produce the

documents as it was found that the attempt of the prosecution

was to fill up the lacuna and to prolong the proceedings. The

learned Senior Counsel further submitted that issuing summons

to the remaining witnesses listed in Crl.M.P.No.2040/2021 will

cause serious prejudice to the accused and none of those

witnesses even remotely appear to be essential for just decision

of the case. The Counsel further submitted that the recalling of
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               -:12:-</span>

the witnesses and summoning large number of additional

witnesses when only investigating officer remains to be examined

is with ulterior motive to tutor all those witnesses and fill up the

great lacunae and to supply the omission after the defence of the

accused was exposed in its entirety during cross-examination of

nearly 200 witnesses. The prayers sought for in Crl.M.P.No.

2039/2021 are beyond the scope of S.91 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">Cr.P.C</a>. and no person

can be directed to create a document in the manner sought for

by any party and seeking such a direction is improper and illegal,

added the Senior Counsel. In support of his arguments, the

learned Senior Counsel cited two decisions of the Apex Court:

<a href="/doc/3583407/" id="a_14">Rajaram Prasad Yadav v. State of Bihar and Another</a>

[(2013) 14 SCC 461] and <a href="/doc/53757858/" id="a_15">Swapan Kumar Chatterjee v.

Central Bureau of Investigation</a> [(2019) 14 SCC 328]. The

Counsel appearing for the remaining accused endorsed and

supported the argument advanced by the learned Senior Counsel.

In addition, the learned counsel for the accused No.4 cited the

following decisions of the Apex Court: <a href="/doc/53478/" id="a_16">U.T. Of Dadra and Haveli

and Others v. Fatehsinh Mohansinh Chauhan</a> [(2006) 7 SCC

529], Himanshu Singh Sabharwal v. State of M.P. and

Mehar and Others</a> [(2016) 8 SCC 762] and the learned counsel

for the accused Nos.5 and 6 cited two decisions of this Court:

<p id="p_8">     8.    The legal position as regards <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_21">Section 311</a> of Cr.P.C is

well settled. A reading of <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_22">Section 311</a> of Cr.P.C makes it clear that

any Court can summon any person as a witness or to recall and

re examine any person already examined at any stage. The

exercise of the said power is conditioned by the requirement that

such exercise must be essential to just decision of the case. The

section is not intended only for the benefit of the accused. It may

equally benefit the prosecution. It is trite that wider the power,

greater is the responsibility of the Court which exercise it. Since

the power conferred u/s 311 is wide, its exercise has to be done

by the Court with caution and circumspection. The existence of a

valid and strong reason to meet the ends of justice is sine qua

non to invoke the power. The power shall not be resorted to fill up

the lacuna left by the prosecution or by the defence, or to the
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               -:14:-</span>

disadvantage of the accused or to cause serious prejudice to the

defence of the accused or to give an unfair advantage to the

opposite party. Nor could the power under the provision be

exercised if the Court is of the view that the application has been

filed as an abuse of process of Court.      It is for the Court to

consider all the circumstances and decide whether prayer to

summon or recall a witness is genuine. No straitjacket formula

can be prescribed. This is the sum and substance of the dictum

laid down in the decisions cited by both sides and stated in the

previous paragraph.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     9.    The prosecution, in Crl.M.P.No.2040/2021, has sought

to summon total sixteen witnesses which include six witnesses

who were already examined, one witness cited, but not examined

and nine additional witnesses who were not cited as witnesses in

the final report. PWs 43, 45, 54, 69, 73 and 120 are the six

witnesses who were sought to be recalled, out of whom, the

Court below as per the impugned order, allowed recalling of three

witnesses - PWs 45, 54 and 120. The prayer to recall the

remaining three witnesses - PWs 43, 69 and 73 was disallowed.

Out of the nine additional witnesses sought to be summoned, the
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 -:15:-</span>

court     below   allowed   to    summon   only   one   witness    -

Smt.Prathibha, the finger print expert. The prayer to recall the

remaining eight additional witnesses was disallowed. So also the

prayer to summon one witness (CW240 Sri. Sathyamoorthy), who

was cited, but not examined, was also rejected.

</p><p id="p_10">        10.   PW43 was examined by the prosecution to prove the

alleged conspiracy between accused Nos.1 and 8. He was

working as groundsman at Tennis Club, Kinattingal, Thrissur. He

was the only witness who alleged to have found the accused

Nos.1 and 8 together at Kinattingal Tennis Club on 13/11/2006.

Two specific grounds are urged in support of the prayer to recall

and examine PW43. The first among the two grounds urged is

that he should be recalled to identify accused No.1 on the

premises that when PW43 was examined, he was not present in

the Court. It is pertinent to note that the identity of the accused

No.1 by PW43 was not disputed as revealed from the deposition

including questions put during cross-examination by the counsel

for the accused No.1. That apart, it is specifically recorded in the

deposition of PW43 that &quot;counsel for A1 submitted that he is not

challenging the identity of A1&quot;. Thus, there is absolutely no
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               -:16:-</span>

necessity to recall him for identifying the accused No.1. The

second ground urged is that witness should be further asked

about events witnessed by him and about facts stated by him in

his 164 statement to bring about the facts and to clear ambiguity

in the evidence.    The said statement is so vague. It is not

specifically stated for what purpose further examination is

necessary. A perusal of the deposition of PW43 would show that

he was examined in length in chief examination by the Special

Public Prosecutor running into seven pages. He was also

reexamined by the prosecution extensively running into three

pages. He was examined as early as on 3/9/2020. It is after

exhausting all the legally permissible avenues, the prosecution

has now belatedly come up with a ground that PW43 &quot;should be

further asked&quot; without stating any further details.   If the party

who called the witness is given even fresh opportunity to ask

questions after the cross-examination and reexamination are

concluded, it will provide an opportunity to negate the facts

extracted during cross-examination as rightly argued by the

learned Senior Counsel for the accused. Such a course is not

contemplated u/s 311 of Cr. P.C.
</p><p id="p_11"> Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  -:17:-</span>

</p><p id="p_12">     11.     The next witness who was sought to be recalled is

PW73. According to the prosecution, part of the quotation amount

was given by the accused No.8 to the accused No.1 and the same

was received by him. PW73 was examined to prove the same.

PW73 in cross examination stated about certain monetary

transaction between the accused No.1 and himself based on

MO60 agreement executed between them. According to the

prosecution, it is necessary to recall him to bring the details and

correctness of the said monetary transaction. It is to be noted

that MO60 is a document produced and marked by the

prosecution. Certain monetary transactions between PW43 and

the accused No.1 based on MO60 were brought out in cross-

examination. Thereafter, the learned Special Public Prosecutor

reexamined the witness also. In reexamination, questions were

put touching MO60 as well.         He was examined as early as on

8/10/2020.      Now, after all these exercise, if the prosecution is

allowed    to   challenge   the    deposition   made   during   cross-

examination after a lapse of more than one year, it will definitely

cause prejudice to the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     12.     The third witness sought to be recalled is PW69. He
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               -:18:-</span>

was one among the first witnesses who visited the survivor at the

residence of PW5.    According to the prosecution, he could not

fully narrate all the important facts within his knowledge as

stated in his previous statements when he was examined at the

Court below and, hence, he has to be further examined to bring

out the entire facts in his knowledge. He was examined on

30/9/2020. His chief examination itself consists of 19 pages. After

the examination, reexamination was also conducted by the

prosecution. Apart from generally stating that he has to be

further examined to bring out the entire facts within his

knowledge, no valid or specific reason has been assigned

warranting his reexamination.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     13.   As stated already, PWs 43, 69 and 73 were sought to

be recalled and reexamined after more than one year of their

examination. There is absolutely no explanation about the long

delay. No cogent or sufficient reason has been stated for their

reexamination. The general statement that the entire facts could

not be brought out when they were examined cannot be

construed as a valid or sufficient reason to recall and reexamine

them. Their examination was done by a Special Public Prosecutor
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               -:19:-</span>

in the presence of the investigating officer. All of them supported

the prosecution. Recalling and reexamination of a witness cannot

be done to fill up lacuna or to cover up the defect or to rectify the

mistake    crept   in   evidence   [K.V.Vijyadas     (supra)].   The

apprehension put forward by the defence that if they are recalled

they will be tutored and that will cause prejudice to the accused

cannot be ruled out. Where the prosecution evidence has been

closed long back and the reasons for recalling of the witnesses is

not satisfactory, the recalling of the witnesses at a belated stage

would, no doubt, cause great prejudice to the accused and cannot

be allowed [Swapan Kumar Chatterjee (supra)]. The Court

below rightly rejected the prayer for recalling PWs43, 69 and 73.

No interference is called for on the said finding of the Court

below.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     14.   The prosecution has also sought to examine nine

additional witnesses who were not cited as witnesses in the final

report. Out of whom, except one (Smt. Prathibha), the prayer to

examine the remaining eight was disallowed. One Mr.Joseph @

Jose was sought to be summoned and examined to identify the

accused No.2 as the driver of the vehicle bearing registration
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               -:20:-</span>

No.KL-37 F 5744 which was allegedly used for the commission of

the offence. PW166 deposed that the above said vehicle in which

PW1 was taken to Ernakulam was regularly used by Mr.Joseph @

Jose. According to the prosecution, it is necessary to summon him

as an additional witness to prove that the said vehicle was not

available with him on 17/2/2017, the date of incident, as the

same was taken by accused No.2 to bring PW1 to Ernakulam. The

prosecution examined number of witnesses (including PW45 and

PW166) to prove the fact that accused No.2 drove the vehicle

mentioned above on the date of the incident to bring PW1 to

Ernakulam. This fact was not seen disputed by the accused No.2

also. Hence, the examination of the said witness is absolutely

unwarranted. One Mr.Nikhil Sackaria Korah who introduced

accused No.8 in a television programme on Manorama Online is

the next additional witness sought to be summoned. Absolutely

no reason has been stated in the petition about the purpose of

his examination and the relevance of the interview with the

crime. PW120 deposed that his friend had sustained injury on

account of a fall when they were in a crowd to view the

programme Mazhavillazhakilamma at Willington Island. He was
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               -:21:-</span>

allegedly admitted at the Medical Trust Hospital, Ernakulam and

treated by one Dr.Harikumar who issued a wound certificate. The

said Dr.Harikumar has been cited as an additional witness in

order to prove the wound certificate and also about the treatment

provided to the injured. The purpose of the examination of the

said witness has not at all been disclosed in the petition. The

relevancy of the said witness to the facts of the case has also not

been disclosed. Moreover, the friend of PW120 who was injured

has not been cited as a witness. Without showing any valid

reason, the prosecution cannot ask to issue summons to

additional witnesses at a highly belated stage. No doubt, the

Court cannot shut down the opportunity to adduce evidence for

just decision of the case, but wide power u/s 311 has to be

exercised with utmost care and caution. There is nothing on

record to show that the examination of these additional witnesses

is necessary for just decision of the case so as to invoke S.311 of

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_23">Cr.P.C</a>. Hence, I see no reason to interfere with the rejection of the

prayer for recalling these three additional witnesses.

</p><p id="p_16">     15.   Four additional witnesses viz. Smt. Nileesha, Sri.

Kannadasan, Sri. Suresh D., and Smt. Usha were also sought to
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                -:22:-</span>

be summoned to prove the customer application forms filed by

them to obtain mobile connections allegedly used by the accused

Nos.3, 4, 5 and 7. According to the prosecution, examination of

those additional witnesses is necessary to prove as to how the

said mobile phones reached the hands of the accused persons. It

is the case of the prosecution that those mobile phones were

used to commit conspiracy. The CDRs of the calls between the

accused persons through those mobile phones were also

produced.    The photostat copies of the customer application

forms signed by the above witnesses were marked as prosecution

exhibits. In Crl.M.P.No.2039/2021 which was filed u/s 91 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_24">Cr.P.C</a>.,

the prosecution sought to summon, among other things, the

originals of those application forms as well. The prayer to

summon the above four additional witnesses was turned down by

the court below on the ground that the prayer to summon the

original customer application forms was dismissed as per the

order in Crl.M.P.No.2039/2021. I am inclined to allow the prayer in

Crl.M.P.No.2039/2021    to     summon    those   original   customer

application forms (Reasons will be discussed in the later part of

this order). Hence, it is necessary to examine the above
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                               -:23:-</span>

mentioned four witnesses to prove those original customer

application forms. That apart, the prosecution will be able to let in

evidence how those mobile phones reached the hands of the

accused only through the oral evidence of these witnesses. For

these reasons, I am of the view that the request to examine those

witnesses is to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     16.   The last additional witness in the list is the First Class

Judicial Magistrate Smt.Leena Rasheed who recorded statement

of the approvers. u/s 360(4) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25">Cr.P.C</a>. The statement was already

marked.    The   approvers     were     also   examined.   In   these

circumstances, the learned Director General of Prosecution fairly

conceded that the examination of the Magistrate is not necessary.

</p><p id="p_18">     17.   The prosecution has further sought to examine one

witness viz., Sri. Sathyamoorthy (CW240) who was cited in the

final report, but not examined. He was the Nodal Officer of BSNL.

He was cited to prove the customer application forms and CDRs

along with the certificate u/s 65B of the Evidence Act in respect of

the phones allegedly used by the accused persons. Those

documents are Exts. P200(a), P201, P201(a), P202, P202(a),

P203, P204, P204(a), P205, P205(a), P206, P207, P207(a),
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                  -:24:-</span>

P208(series), P209, P209(a), P210(series), P211 (series), P212

(series), P212(a) and P213 (series). Since he was laid up, another

witness viz. Sri.P.K.Sajeev was examined as PW175 on his behalf.

The petition filed by the prosecution on 31st March, 2021 to

substitute CW240 would show that the permission was, in fact,

sought to examine the then Nodal Officer Sri. Saju George who

was acquainted with the signature of Sri.Sathyamoorthy on his

behalf. But he was not examined. Later on, another petition was

filed   as   Crl.M.P.No.1224/2021       on    22 nd   July,   2021   seeking

permission to examine Sri. P.K.Sajeev for and on behalf of

Sri.Sathyamoorthy. It was allowed and he was examined as

PW175.       In   fact,   certificate   u/s     65B      was    issued   by

Sri.Sathyamoorthy. He was the person who was conversant with

the original customer application forms and CDRs mentioned

above and he is the proper person to prove those documents.

True, the prosecution could have been more vigilant to examine

him earlier. But, the fact remains that he could not be examined

in time as he was laid up. If proper evidence could not be

adduced or a relevant material could not be brought on record in

time due to any inadvertence or omission, the Court should be
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                               -:25:-</span>

magnanimous     in   permitting   such   mistake   to   be   rectified

[Rajaram Prasad Yadav (supra)]. Hence, I am of the view that

the permission can be granted to summon and examine CW240.

</p><p id="p_19">     18.   The prayer in the Crl.M.P.No.2039/2021 is two fold. It

is the case of the prosecution that the accused persons contacted

one another and also with other witnesses on several occasions

immediately prior, during and subsequent to the commission of

the crime as a part of conspiracy using various mobile phones.

The prosecution also alleged that accused No.1 while in judicial

custody at District Jail, Kakkanad secretly obtained a mobile

phone with the help of PW176 and contacted him as well as other

witnesses in furtherance of the conspiracy PW176 had with the

accused No.1. In order to prove the use of those mobile phones,

the photostat copies of the customer application forms pertaining

to those mobile numbers were produced along with the final

report and marked during the evidence subject to proof.

According to the prosecution, original application forms are

available in the custody of respective mobile companies. Hence,

the respective nodal officers who are in custody of those

documents were sought to be summoned to produce the original
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                -:26:-</span>

of the customer application forms. This is the first prayer. CW240,

the Nodal Officer of BSNL, furnished CDRs of eight mobile

numbers and also issued corresponding certificates u/s 65B(4) of

the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_26">Evidence Act</a> which were marked as Exts. P201, P202, P204,

P205, P207, P209, P210 and P212. Similarly PW144, the Assistant

Superintendent of District Jail, had produced Exts. P149 and P152

certificates u/s 65B(4) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_27">Evidence Act</a> pertaining to Ext. P148

pen drive allegedly containing visuals of C1 Block, District Jail,

Kakkanad as well as Ext. P151 pen drive containing visuals of

guard room area of the District Jail, Kakkanad. According to the

prosecution,    the   above    mentioned   certificates   marked   in

evidence are not fully in terms of S.65B(4) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_28">Indian Evidence

Act</a>. The second prayer is to summon certificates fully in terms

with S.65B(4) from PW144 and CW240. The Court below rejected

both prayers.
</p>
<p id="p_20">     19.   The first prayer was rejected holding that there was

undue delay in filing the petition and no satisfactory explanation

was shown for non production of the original till filing of the

petition. It is true that the original of the customer application

forms mentioned above were not produced along with the final
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                               -:27:-</span>

report. However, it is trite that the documents which were not

produced along with the final report can be produced even after

submission of the final report. The photocopies of the customer

application forms marked in evidence were produced along with

the final report and the copy of the same were given to the

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     20.   <a href="/doc/1915814/" id="a_29">Sections 61</a> and <a href="/doc/1248052/" id="a_30">62</a> of the Evidence Act read together

show that the contents of a document must, primarily, be proved

by the production of the document itself (original) for the

inspection of the Court. <a href="/doc/1456410/" id="a_31">Section 63</a> categorizes five kinds of

secondary evidence. Photocopy of a document (copy made by

mechanical process) is one among them. <a href="/doc/1050291/" id="a_32">Section 64</a> provides that

document must be proved by primary evidence except in cases

provided in <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_33">Section 65</a>. <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_34">Section 65</a> provides when secondary

evidence can be given [clauses (a) to (g)]. Secondary evidence

relating to contents of a document is inadmissible until the non

production of the original is accounted for so as to bring it within

one or more other of the cases provided in <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_35">Section 65</a>. The party

who proposes to adduce secondary evidence is bound to explain

the non availability of the original.   To admit a photocopy in
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                 -:28:-</span>

evidence, it is necessary to lay the foundation of reception of

secondary evidence [<a href="/doc/953942/" id="a_36">J. Yashoda v. K.Shoba Rani</a> [(AIR 2007 SC

1721)].    That   apart,   the    secondary   evidence     must    be

authenticated by foundational evidence that the alleged copy is

in fact true copy of the original.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     21.    As per the evidence of the Nodal Officers, the originals

of the customer applications now sought to be produced were

kept in the warehouse of the mobile companies and the same

were available. So, it is a case where non production of the

original is not properly accounted for.       It is well settled that

neither mere admission of a document in evidence amount to its

proof nor mere marking of an exhibit of a document dispense

with its proof which is otherwise required to be done in

accordance with law. As stated already, the photocopies of the

original customer application forms were produced along with the

final report and copies of the same were furnished to the

accused. Now, the prosecution wants to summon its original. It

is true that there is a delay in filing the application. The matter of

delay is fatal only if the parties attempt to obtain any unfair

advantage. In this case, no new document is attempted to be
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                               -:29:-</span>

introduced. The only prayer is to produce the original of the

documents which were already marked. By producing the

originals, no undue advantage will be obtained by the prosecution

and no prejudice would be caused to any of the accused. Hence,

the first prayer can be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     22.   The second prayer is stoutly objected by the defence.

The learned Senior Counsel, Sri.B.Raman Pillai, strenuously

submitted that the Court exercising power u/s 91 can only ask for

production of the document and law does not permit Court

issuing further direction to produce a document incorporating or

drafting a particular content in the document. What is sought for

is to direct production of documents including detailed certificate

u/s 65B(4) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_37">Evidence Act</a> satisfying all requirements. The

Court below also found that the attempt of the prosecution is to

fill up lacuna by directing the concerned authorities to produce

the documents in a particular manner and if such a direction is

issued, it would cause prejudice to the accused.

</p><p id="p_24">      23. <a href="/doc/788840/" id="a_38">Section 91</a> of Cr.P.C empowers a Court to issue

summons for the production of a document in the possession or

power of a person if such document is necessary or desirable for

the purpose of any inquiry or trial. True, ordinarily, the said power

cannot be stretched to direct a person to create a document and

to produce the same. The document must be one in existence

and believed to be in the possession or power of the person to

whom summons is to be issued to produce it. No Court can issue

a summons u/s 91 to any person to produce a document after

preparing it. [<a href="/doc/33290034/" id="a_39">Sarath Kumar v. State of Kerala and Another</a>

to issue certificate u/s 65B(4) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_40">Evidence Act</a> issues a

defective certificate, or a certificate not in conformity with the

said provision, a direction to the said person to issue a proper

certificate in terms of the provision is permissible in view of the

law laid down by the Apex Court in Arjun (supra).

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_44">Evidence Act</a>. A two-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1769219/" id="a_45">State

(NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu</a> [(2005) 11 SCC 600] while

examining the provisions of <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_46">Section 65B</a>, held that in a given

case, it may be that the certificate containing the details in Sub

section (4) of <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_47">Section 65B</a> is not filed, but that does not mean

that secondary evidence cannot be given. It was held that the law

permits such evidence to be given in the circumstances

mentioned in the relevant provisions, namely, Sections 63 and

</p><p id="p_26">65. Irrespective of the compliance with the requirements of

<a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_48">Section 65B</a>, which is a provision dealing with admissibility of

electronic records, there is no bar in adducing secondary

evidence under the other provisions of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_49">Evidence Act</a>, namely,

<a href="/doc/1456410/" id="a_50">Sections 63</a> and <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_51">65</a>, it was held. However, later, a three-Judge

Bench of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/187283766/" id="a_52">Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer</a> [(2014)

10 SCC 473] held that <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_53">Section 65B</a> of the Evidence Act is a

complete code in itself and being a special law, the general law

under <a href="/doc/1456410/" id="a_54">Sections 63</a> and <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_55">65</a> has to yield. Navjot Sandhu (supra)

was held as &#x27;not a good law&#x27;, by specifically observing that

<a href="/doc/1456410/" id="a_56">Sections 63</a> and <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_57">65</a> have no application in the case of secondary

evidence by way of electronic record. It was further held that the
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                               -:32:-</span>

electronic record produced in evidence has to be accompanied

with a certificate issued under <a href="/doc/112805442/" id="a_58">Section 65B(4)</a> to be admissible in

law. However, it was clarified that there would be no need of

producing   certificate   under   <a href="/doc/112805442/" id="a_59">Section   65B(4)</a>   if   the   original

electronic record as such is produced as primary evidence. The

three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in Arjun (supra) agreed with

the law laid down in Anvar (supra), but gave certain clarifications

to the same. The Apex Court reiterated that special provisions of

<a href="/doc/159075137/" id="a_60">Section 65A</a> and <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_61">Section 65B</a> of Evidence Act is a complete code

in themselves and that a written certificate under <a href="/doc/112805442/" id="a_62">Section 65B(4)</a>

is sine qua non for admissibility of evidence by way of electronic

record. However, it was clarified that the requisite certificate in

sub-section (4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is

produced.
</p>
<p id="p_27">     25.    S.65B does not speak of the stage at which such

certificate must be furnished to the Court. In Anvar (supra), the

Apex Court observed that such certificate must accompany the

electronic record when the same is produced in evidence.

However, in Arjun (supra), it was held that so long as the hearing

in a trial is not yet over, the requisite certificate can be directed
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                               -:33:-</span>

to be produced at any stage, so that information contained in

electronic record form can then be admitted, and relied upon. It

was clarified that the contemporaneous production is required

only in cases where such certificate could be procured by the

person seeking to rely upon an electronic record. It was

specifically held that in cases where either a defective certificate

is given, or in cases where such certificate has been demanded

and is not given by the concerned person, the Judge conducting

the trial must summon the person/persons referred to in <a href="/doc/112805442/" id="a_63">Section

65B(4)</a> of the Evidence Act, and require that such certificate be

given by such person/persons. The Apex further clarified that

&quot;This, the trial Judge ought to do when the electronic record is

produced in evidence before him without the requisite certificate

in the circumstances aforementioned&quot; (Para 52). The Rajasthan

High Court in <a href="/doc/1120144/" id="a_64">Paras Jain v. State of Rajasthan</a> (2015 SCC

OnLine   Raj   8331)   examined   the   issue   as   to   whether   a

&quot;contemporaneous certificate&quot; under <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_65">Section 65B</a> would be

required for admissibility of a CD in evidence. It was held that

there is no requirement of procurement of a certificate under

<a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_66">Section 65B</a> at the time of taking the electronic record and the
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                               -:34:-</span>

same could be procured later and submitted at the time of

production of such document in evidence. That was also a case

where the certificate was produced along with the final report,

but it was not in a proper form and during the course of hearing,

the certificate in the prescribed form was produced. In Arjun

(supra), the Apex Court concurred with the law laid down by the

Rajasthan High Court in Paras Jain (supra). The dictum laid down

in Arjun (supra) when applied to the facts of the case, I have no

hesitation to conclude that the second prayer to summon

certificates in terms with <a href="/doc/112805442/" id="a_67">Section 65B(4)</a> is only to be allowed.

</p><p id="p_28">     26.   The   learned   Senior   Counsel   submitted   that     the

directive of the Apex Court to complete the trial will be over by

15/2/2022 and both the petitions were filed by the prosecution

with ulterior motive to protract the trial and to avoid a verdict

from the court below. The learned counsel further submitted that

the Special Public Prosecutor tendered resignation and, hence, it

may not possible to examine the additional witnesses without

delay. In answer to this submission, the learned Director General

of Prosecution, after having discussion with the investigating

officer who was present in the court during arguments, submitted
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                               -:35:-</span>

that all the witnesses sought to be summoned are very much

available and the documents sought to be summoned are also

ready with the concerned persons and he will ensure that the

witnesses are present and the documents are produced and the

further evidence is completed within the time prescribed by the

court.
</p>
<p id="p_29">     In the light of the above findings, the order impugned in

Crl.M.C.No.6703/2021 stands set aside and Crl.M.P.No.2039/2021

stands allowed. The order impugned in Crl.M.C.No.6702/2021 to

the extent rejecting summoning of five additional witnesses viz.,

Smt.Nileesha, Sri.Kannadasan, Sri.Suresh D, Smt.Usha and Sri.

Sathyamoorthy (CW240) is set aside. The prayer to examine

these witnesses stands allowed. The entire exercise of adducing

additional evidence allowed as per this order shall be completed

within ten days from the date of the receipt of the copy of this

order by the Court below. The Director General of Prosecution

shall see that a new Special Public Prosecutor is deputed or some

other alternative arrangement is made to conduct the case on

behalf of the prosecution and ensure that the examination of the

witnesses and production of the documents as allowed as per this
 Crl.M.C.Nos.6702 &amp; 6703/2021

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                               -:36:-</span>

order is done within the period of ten days. The accused shall

also co-operate to complete the additional evidence within this

period. Crl.M.C.s are, accordingly, disposed of.
