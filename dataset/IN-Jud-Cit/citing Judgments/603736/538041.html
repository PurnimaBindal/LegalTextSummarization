Act") to the petitioner and quashing of notices under Sections 148

and is, thus, a foreign company under Section 2(23A) of the Act. It

has a Branch office in India. It is a part of International Coca Cola

corporate group. The said group has other companies operating in

India incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956.
</p><p id="p_4">3.         The petitioner obtained permission under <a href="/doc/988545/" id="a_2">Section 29(1)(a)</a>

of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA) to operate a

Branch office in India to render services to Coca Cola Group

companies, as per conditions mentioned in the application for the

said permission. There is a service agreement between the petitioner

on the one hand and Britco Foods Company Private Limited (Britco)

on the other. As per the said agreement, the petitioner provides

advisory services to Britco to advise, monitor and coordinate the

activities of bottlers, in consideration of which the petitioner receives

fee calculated on the basis of actual cost plus 5%. The petitioner was

assessed under the Act for the assessment year 1998-99 on

31.3.2004. The Assessing Officer, however, formed an opinion that

income of the petitioner, chargeable to tax for the said year, had

escaped assessment within the meaning of <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_3">Section 147</a> of the Act. A

notice dated 30.3.2005 was issued under <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_4">Section 148</a> of the Act,

requiring the petitioner to file a return and thereafter, some further

information was sought from the petitioner for the purpose of

assessment. The petitioner filed reply to the said notice, seeking

reasons for proposed reassessment. The reasons indicated that the

Assessing Officer referred to <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_5">Section 92</a> of the Act, which enables

the Assessing Officer to determine profits which may reasonably

deemed to have been derived, when less than ordinary profits are

shown to have been derived by a resident. It was further stated in

the said reasons that as per order dated 7.2.2005 under Section 92 CA

(3) for the assessment year 2002-03, passed by the Transfer Pricing

Officer-I, the profit declared by the petitioner was abnormally low,

on account of which arm's length price had been fixed. On that

account, the income of the assessee had escaped assessment. Similar

notices were issued for the assessment years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and

2001-02.

acting as Transfer Pricing Officer, on a reference made by the

Assessing Officer under <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_7">Section 92CA(1)</a> of the Act for the

assessment year 2003-04, to determine arm's length price. Identical

notices were issued for the assessment years 2004-05, 2005-06 and

enhancing the income of the assessee. Against the said order, the

petitioner has preferred an appeal which is still pending before the

appropriate authority.
</p><p id="p_6">5.         The petitioner filed the present writ petition in this Court

on 19.10.2005. On 21.10.2005, notice was issued to the respondents

and vide order dated 18.11.2005, stay of passing of final order for the

assessment years 2003-04, 2004-05, 1998-99 to 2001-02 was

granted. Similarly, on 15.12.2006, stay of passing of final order for

the assessment year 2005-06 was granted and permission to amend

the petition was also granted to challenge notice in respect of the said

year. Similarly, on 26.5.2008, stay of passing of final order for the

assessment year 2006-07 was granted. The petitioner has further

amended the petition to challenge the notice in respect of assessment

year 2006-07, which amendment has been allowed by a separate

order.
</p><p id="p_7">6.         Main contention raised in the writ petition is that

provisions of Chapter X i.e. <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_8">Sections 92</a> to <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_9">92F</a> of the Act have been

enacted with a view to prevent diversion of profits in intra-group

transactions leading to erosion of tax revenue. The said provisions

have been incorporated vide <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_10">Finance Act</a>, 2001 and further amended

vide <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_11">Finance Act</a>, 2002. Having regard to the object for which

provisions have been enacted, applicability of the said provisions has

to be limited to situations where there is diversion of profits out of

India or where there may be erosion of tax revenue in intra group

transaction. In the present case, there is neither any material to show

diversion of profits outside India nor of erosion of tax revenue. If the

price charged was less and profit of the petitioner was less, there was

corresponding lesser claim for deduction by Britco. Question of

diversion of profits out of India would arise only if price charged is

higher and that too if the higher profit is not subject to tax in India,

which is not the situation in the present case. Further contention is

that there was no occasion for determining arm's length price as the

price determined by the petitioner itself is as per <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_12">Section 92</a> (1) and

(2)   of the Act i.e. cost plus 5%. In such a situation, there was no

occasion to make reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer. Even if

the reference was sought to be made, the petitioner was entitled to be

heard before such a decision is taken, so that it could show that

reference to Transfer Pricing Officer was not called for. In objecting

to notices for reassessment, contention raised is that provisions of

Chapter X having been introduced only from 1.4.2002, there could be

no reassessment for the period from 1.4.1997 to 31.3.2001. It is

pointed out that prior to amendment w.e.f. 1.4.2002 under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_13">Section 92</a>

of the Act, there was a provision for determination of reasonable

profits deemed to have been derived by a resident and not a 'non

for the period prior to 31.3.2001.
</p><p id="p_8">7.         In the reply filed on behalf of the respondents, the

impugned notices and orders have been defended.
</p><p id="p_9">8.         As regards the period prior to assessment year 2002-03,

when amended provisions of Chapter X were not operative, stand of

the respondents is that the petitioner suppressed its profit in its

transactions with its associated companies, which was clear from the

proportion of amount of working capital employed to the declared

profit and this resulted in escapement of income within the meaning

of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_14">Section 147</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_10">9.         As regards the period for and after the assessment year

2002-03, it was submitted that the said Chapter was applicable to the

petitioner as the petitioner had entered into "international

transaction" within the meaning of the said provisions with its

"associated enterprises".    There was no condition that the said

Chapter could apply only if the parties were not subject to the tax

jurisdiction in India. Only requirement is that atleast one of the

parties should be non-resident, apart from other requirements in the

said chapter.

           same multinational group. The profits derived by such

           by the multinational groups by manipulating the prices
           charged and paid in such intra-group; transactions,

           enterprises, new provisions are proposed to be introduced

applicable only to transaction in which one of the parties was not

there was allegation of profits being diverted out of India, was

necessary to save the provision from being hit by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_103">Article 14</a> of the

inapplicability of unamended <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_104">Section 92</a> of the Act to non-residents

had no relevance for application of provision of reassessment of

escaped income under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_105">Section 147</a> of the Act and thus, notice under

<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_106">Section 148</a> of the Act was perfectly valid, as the reasons given

therein had nexus with escapement of income.          Applicability of

provision for reassessment required formation of opinion of

escapement of income and such opinion could be formed on any

relevant material subject to the statutory scheme of the Act. Material

contained in the order of Transfer Pricing Officer was a relevant

material which could be taken into account for formation of opinion

for escapement of income.        Apart from the said material, the

Assessing Officer has also taken into account other material and at

irrelevant or absurd and had no nexus with the opinion of escapement

attracted to situations enumerated therein, namely there being

international transaction as defined in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_108">Section 92B</a> of the Act i.e. a

transaction between two or more associated enterprises either or both

of whom were non-resident in situations specified therein.        The

applicability of the said provisions could not be controlled by

reference to Statement of Objects and Reasons or Finance Minister's

speech which could be referred to only for the purpose of

ascertaining the history and object of the provisions and for not

controlling their meaning. History or object of provisions may be

relevant only if there is ambiguity in the meaning of a statutory

provision.     There could be no violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_109">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution in reading the provisions as being applicable to

situations contemplated in the Statute irrespective of there being no

material to show diversion of profits outside India or erosion of tax.

           construe a word appearing in Entry 54 which is a head of
           legislative power. As pointed out by Gwyer, C.J. in
           United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum (1940) FCR 110, at
           p.134, none of the items in the Lists is to be read in a

           should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary
           matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be
           comprehended in it. It is, therefore, clear -- and it is

           ordinary meaning must be put upon the words used

           rule of interpretation, however, is that words should be
           read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning
           subject to this rider that in construing words in a
           constitutional enactment conferring legislative power the

             decided on the facts of each case. There must no doubt be
             some rational connection between the item taxed and the
             concept of income liberally construed. If the legislature
             realises that the private controlled companies generally
             adopt the device of making advances or giving loans to
             their shareholders with the object of evading the payment
             of tax, it can step in to meet this mischief, and in that
             connection, it has created a fiction by which the amount
             ostensibly and nominally advanced to a shareholder as a
             loan is treated in reality for tax purposes as the payment
             of dividend to him. We have already explained how a
             small number of shareholders controlling a private
             company adopt this device. Having regard to the fact that
             the legislature was aware of such devices, would it not be
             competent to the legislature to devise a fiction for treating
             the ostensible loan as the receipt of dividend? In our
             opinion, it would be difficult to hold that in making the
             fiction, the legislature has travelled beyond the legislative

Frankfuter, J. in Morey v. Daud, (1957) 354 US 457, to the

following effect :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                 "In the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases,
                 there are good reasons for judicial self-restraint if
                 not judicial deference to legislative judgment. The
                 legislature   after    all   has      the   affirmative
                 responsibility. The Courts have only the power to

                  the   complexity     or     economic      regulation,   the
                  uncertainty, the liability to error, the bewildering
                  conflict of the experts, and the number of times the
                  judges have been overruled by events, self-
                  limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial

           statute, a contract or anything else. But it is one of the
           surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence
           not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to
           remember that statutes always have some purpose or

<p id="p_135">      6. The primary objection against the literal construction of

  unreasonable and absurd consequences. It is true that the
  consequences of a suggested construction cannot alter the meaning
  of a statutory provision but they can certainly help to fix its

  statutory provision must be so construed, if possible, that
  absurdity and mischief may be avoided......"

from the fact that the Assessing Officer has given other reasons, it

have nexus for reaching the conclusion that income has been

incorrectly assessed or has escaped assessment.    In    the   present

'International transaction' and 'associated enterprises' have been

well defined under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_151">Sections 92B</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_152">92A</a> of the Act. International

transaction is a transaction between two or more associated

enterprises, either or both of whom are non-residents. Associated

enterprise is an enterprise which participates in management or

control of capital or other gains. The provision for computing arm's

length price has been applied to income arising from international

transactions. The Statute is, thus, applicable to well defined class

which meets the test of intelligible differentia. It also meets the test

of rational relationship to the object i.e. to determine the real income.

having regard to arm's length price as per guidelines laid down in

appropriate for the purpose of determining the true income. Proviso

application of Chapter X to persons who are subject to jurisdiction of

taxing authorities in India nor we find any statutory requirement of

establishing that there is transfer of profits outside India or that there

is evasion of tax. Only condition precedent for invoking provisions

of Chapter X is that there should be income arising from international

transaction and such income has to be computed having regard to

arm's length price.     "International transaction" as defined under

<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_156">Section 92B</a> of the Act, as already observed, certainly stands on

different footing than any other transaction. Arm's length price is

nothing but a fair price which would have been normal price. There

is always a possibility of transaction between a non resident and its

associates being under-valued and having regard to such tendency, a

provision that income arising out of said transaction could be

computed having regard to arm's length price, will not be open to

question and is within the legislative competence to effectuate the

charge of taxing real income in India.

without there being any material to show transfer of profits outside

India or evasion of tax between the two parties. The contention that

according to the permission granted by the Reserve Bank of India

under the FERA, the assessee cannot charge more than particular

price, can also not control the provisions of the Act, which provides

for taxing the income as per the said provision or computation of

income, having regard to arm's length price in any international

consistent with the object. The language cannot be controlled or

transfer of profits outside India as per any other notion except the

manner statutorily laid down. The language being clear, the

provisions will be attracted to an international transaction i.e. a

transaction between two associated enterprises atleast one of whom

<p id="p_161">Re:Q.No.(iv)

</p><p id="p_162">57.   The grievance on behalf of the petitioner that there is denial of

opportunity, at the stage of making reference under Section 92 CA of

the Act, has no merit. The decision to make a reference does not in

any manner visit the assessee with any civil consequence.          The

decision is to be taken by the Assessing Officer having regard to the

question whether it will be proper for the Assessing Officer himself

to determine the arm's length price or it will be expedient to have it

determined from the Transfer Pricing Officer. There is safeguard of

seeking prior approval of the Commissioner. Whether computation of

arm's length price is made by one officer or by the other, does not in

any manner affect the assessee. Even though the Assessing Officer

may, in view of latest amendment be bound by the computation by

the Transfer Pricing Officer, the assessee has opportunity to

challenge the same at higher levels as per hierarchy laid down in the

Statute. Even earlier, the assessee is given due opportunity by the

Transfer Pricing Officer. There is thus no difference, as far as

opportunity is concerned, whether computation is made by the

Assessing Officer himself or by the Transfer Pricing Officer. No

doubt quasi judicial authorities are expected to act as per principles

of natural justice in all matters, it depends on context of a statutory

provision whether opportunity is sufficient. Even in absence of any

statutory provision, requirement of giving an opportunity can be

inferred if a person is adversely affected.    When it is a matter of

assessment by one or other officer and the assessee is to be provided

opportunity, in the course of the assessment, we do not find any merit

for inferring further opportunity at the stage of decision of the

question, whether the Assessing Officer himself is to compute the

arm's length price or to make a reference to the Transfer Pricing

Officer for the said purpose.
