GHISA LAL V. THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN</a> .

DATE OF ORDER                      :                         05-11-2008

                HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C. M. TOTLA


Mr. K.R.Bhati, for Petitioner (s)
Mr. O. P.Rathi, P.P., for the State.


       Preferring instant petition under Section 482, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>., petitioner
requests that 1200 bamboos seized while investigating FIR No.177/2007,
Police Station, Parsoli   may be handed over to him by way of interim
custody. Petitioner's such application is rejected by learned Magistrate
as per order dated 18.3.08 which           also mentioning that as ownership
can only be decided in course of trial so be auctioned. Petitioner, being
aggrieved, has preferred this petition.
       Learned counsel for the petitioner states that these big quantity of
bamboos are lying      in open at the police station -     about a year has
elapsed since seizure - lying in open this material shall be destroyed -
petitioner has purchased bamboos from Hema and Lakhma on whose
Khatedari these bamboos were standingf so should be given to him. In
support of his contention, placed reliance on S. B. Criminal Misc. Petition
No.1546/<a href="/doc/1210867/" id="a_3">2007, Subhash v. The               State of Rajasthan</a>, decided on
03/10/2007.
       Learned Public Prosecutor stated that as per report of Patwari, the
bamboos were standing on the Khatedari land of Hema and Lakhma and
may be given to the petitioner only on appropriate conditions. Learned
Public Prosecutor stated that value may be a round Rs.20,000/-.
       Considered and perused. Learned Magistrate has ordered for
auction. Though about a year has elapsed but considering events, proper
may be to release only after securing value. Altering the above order, it is
hereby directed that instead of auction, the bamboos may be given to the
petitioner on his furnishing a bank guarantee of a amount nearing value
                                        2

of material which amount is to be determined by the learned Magistrate.
The bank guarantee, if the concerned person so desires, can also be in
the form of FDR-amount, being payable to and only as per orders of the
Court.
         With the above directions, the petition stands disposed of.


                                                      (C. M. TOTLA), J.
