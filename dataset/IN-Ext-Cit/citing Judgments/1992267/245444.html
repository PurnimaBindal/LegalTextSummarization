       wells   and   lands   are   under   cultivation.   They   also   suggested   the 


       availability of large tracts of alternative lands with no construction 


       and irrigation facility situated within one Kilometer towards North. 


       However,   the   concerned   authorities   did   not   reply   to   these 


       representations   of   the   appellants.   Subsequently,   the   appellants, 


       aggrieved by the said notification, filed Writ Petition No. 22252 of

       dismissed   vide   its   Order   dated   22.04.2010   without   deciding   any

       <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_14">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act. Thereafter, the State Government issued a

expressed the intention of the Government to take possession of the 


said   land,   in   which   it   was   directed   to   the   appellants   to   appear 


before the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Jyotiba Phule Nagar. 


The   appellants,   being   aggrieved,   filed   a   Writ   Petition   before   the 


High   Court   of   Judicature   at   Allahabad  interalia  questioning   the

8.10.2010, dismissed the Wirt Petition and allowed the respondents 


to proceed further with acquisition of the said land in terms of the 


Act   on   the   ground   that   the   construction   of   the   District   Jail   is   an 


urgent matter which has been mentioned in the Notification under

       consideration   is:   Whether   the   respondent   is   justified   in   invoking 


       the   urgency   provision   under   <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_26">Section   17(1)</a>   and   excluding   the 


       application of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_27">Section 5-A</a> in terms of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_28">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act for 


       acquisition of the land for construction of District Jail. 




</p><p id="p_13">6).           The learned counsel Shri.  Prashant Kumar submits  that the 


       district of Jyotiba Phule Nagar came into existence on 24.04.1997. 


       Since   then,   the   State   Government   had   not   shown   any   kind   of 


       urgency   and   was   only   considering   the   proposal   of   acquiring   the 


       land  for  the  public  purpose  of construction  of the  District  Jail.  It 


       was   only   in   the   year   2010   that   the   State   Government  had   issued 


       Notifications under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_29">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_30">6</a>, invoking urgency provision 


       as contemplated by the <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_31">Sections 17(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_32">17</a> (4). In other words, 


       the   lackadaisical   attitude   of   the   State   Government   since   the 


       creation of the new district nearly 13 years ago does not exhibit or 


       depict   any   kind   of   urgency   but   only   lethargy   on   their   part   in 


       acquiring the land. Therefore, the urgency contemplated in the Act 


       cannot be equated with dereliction of responsibility on the part of 


       the   State   Government.   The   learned   counsel   contends   that   the 


       respondents   had   unnecessarily   invoked   the   urgency   provisions 


       under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_33">Section 17</a> (1) read with <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_34">Section 17</a> (4) for acquisition of the 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                      6</span>


land for construction of the District Jail in view of the delay of 13 


years in the issuance of the Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_35">Section 4</a> of the Act 


and   still,   the   said   land   is   under   the   possession   of   the   appellants. 


The learned counsel argues that invoking of the urgency provisions 


under   <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_36">Section   17(4)</a>,   which   excludes   the   application   of   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_37">Section 


5-A</a>,   by   the   respondents   in   the   absence   of   any   real   urgency   as 


contemplated by <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_38">Section 17</a>, amounts to illegal deprivation of the 


right to file objection and hearing of the appellants under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_39">Section 


5-A</a>   of   the   Act.   He   submits,   relying   on   various   decisions   of   this 


Court, that the expropriatory legislation like <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_40">Land Acquisition Act</a> 


must  be given strict construction. He further submits that <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_41">Section 


5-A</a>   is   a   substantial   right   and   akin   to   Fundamental   Right   which 


embodies   a   principle   of   giving   of   proper   and   reasonable 


opportunity   to   the   land   owner   to   persuade   the   authorities   against 


the   acquisition   of   his   land   which   can   be   dispensed   with   only   in 


exceptional  cases  of real   urgency.     The  learned  counsel  relies  on 


the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1992267/" id="a_42">Dev Sharan &amp; Others v. State of U.P</a>. 


(2011) 4 SCC 769 in support of his contention that dispensing with 


the   opportunity   of  hearing   and   enquiry   under   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_43">Section   5-A</a>   of  the 


Act in view of prolonged lethargy of almost 13 years on the part of 


respondents by invoking emergency provisions under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_44">Section 17</a> is 


illegal and unjustified.  The learned counsel has further cited catena 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                     7</span>

       submits that the newly created district of Jyotiba Phule Nagar does 


       not have a District Jail to lodge the prisoners of the district who are 


       presently   accommodated   in   the   Moradabad   District   Jail,   wherein 


       the total population  of inmates  exceeds  by more than three times 


       the capacity of the Jail, causing great hardships to inmates. Further, 


       producing of the prisoners from Moradabad Jail to various Courts 


       in Jyotiba Phule Nagar raises financial  and security concerns. He 


       submits   that   since   the   creation   of   the   new   district,   the   State 


       Government has been making continuous efforts for acquisition of 


       land   to   construct   the   District   Jail.     However,   the   process   of 


       construction of Jail could not be carried forward due to subsequent 


       dissolution   of   the   district   vide   Notification   dated   13.04.2004, 


       which   was   challenged   before   the   High   Court   and   later,   the   High 


       Court quashed the said Notification of Dissolution. Pursuant to this 


       Order   of   the   High   Court,   the   district   was   recreated   in   2004.   He 


       further submits that the State Government had issued a Notification 


       dated 5.3.2010 under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_46">Section 4</a> read with <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_47">Section 17</a> (4) of the Act

for   acquisition   of   the   said   land   for   public   purpose   of   urgent

03.09.2010   regarding   the   compensation   and   measurement   of   the 


land under <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_53">Section 9</a> of the Act, handed over the possession of the 


said   land   to   the   Senior   Superintendent   of   Jails,   Mordabad,   on

lethargy   or   negligence   on   the   part   of   the   State   Government   to 


acquire   the   said   land.   He   further   supports   the   observation   of   the 


High Court in the impugned Judgment that construction of Jail is 


an   urgent   matter   requiring   acquisition   of   the   land   by   invoking

       applicable   to   the   present   case   because   in   that   case,   this   Court 


       invalidated the acquisition of land by invoking urgency provisions 


       for construction of a new Jail when old Jail was already existed in 


       District Shahjahanpur but was located in a densely populated area 


       which   needs   to   be   shifted.   Learned   Senior   Counsel   has   placed

        very   often,   the   delay   increases   the   urgency   of   the   necessity   for
