<p id="p_1">2.   06.01.2012               Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">                              This application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the

                  Constitution of India has been filed by the petitioner

                  seeking a simple direction to be issued to the Subordinate

                  Judge, 5th, Patna City, Patna to comply the order dated

                  10.2.2005 passed in Civil Revision No. 72 of 2005 by this

                  Court and to dispose of the Title Suit No. 160 of 1996 as

                  per direction by order dated 18.7.2003 passed in Civil

                  Revision No. 746 of 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                              It appears that those directions were passed

                  by this Court in Civil Revision Jurisdiction. Thus, there are

                  already directions of this Court. There is no requirement to

                  pass repeated orders.

<p id="p_4">                              In the case of <a href="/doc/1373037/" id="a_2">M/s. M.M.T.C. Ltd. vs.

                  Commissioner of Commercial Taxes</a> 2009 AIR SCW

                  767 the Apex Court has held that under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> an

                  order, direction or writ is to issue to a person, authority or

                  the State. In a proceeding under that Article the person,

                  authority or State against whom the direction, order or

                  writ is sought is a necessary party. Under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Article 227</a>

                  however, what comes of before the High Court is the order

                  or judgment of a subordinate court or tribunal for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>




       purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment

       or order that subordinate court or tribunal has acted within

       its authority and according to law. Admittedly, in present

       application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_5">Article 227</a> of the constitution of India

       the petitioner is not challenging any order passed by the

       court below. It is well settled principles of law that the

       High Court exercises administrative supervision as well as

       judicial supervision. When no order passed by the court

       below is produced before this Court, in the application

       under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_6">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India this court has

       no jurisdiction to pass any judicial order and, therefore,

       judicial supervision cannot be exercised under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_7">Article 227</a>

       of the Constitution of India. Thus, this writ application is

       not maintainable for the relief claimed by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_5">                   Accordingly, this writ application is dismissed.
