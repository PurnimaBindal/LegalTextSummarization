</p><p id="p_7">   v)      In the year 2011 the plaintiff No.2 jointly with the Haryana
           Police Department set up THE SHRI RAM POLICE PUBLIC
           SCHOOL in Bhondsi, Haryana for the children of Police
           Personal and the General Public. The plaintiffs at present
           are associated with schools at six different locations.
</p><p id="p_8">   vi)     It is alleged that the plaintiffs' schools under the name SHRI
           RAM have carved out a unique space as institutions of
           excellence and are well known for their value based
           innovative caring and child-centered approach to educate

           Schools in India" for the year 2013 in the ranking released
           by IndiaRanker.com.
</p><p id="p_9">   vii)    The plaintiffs' use of the word "SHRI RAM" in relation to
           schools since the year 1988 i.e. for almost 25 years, the
           same has become exclusively identified with the schools of
           the plaintiffs and/or the core values and educational
           philosophy of the plaintiffs said schools. An application for
           registration of the trademark THE SHRI RAM SCHOOL was
           filed by the plaintiffs on 6th June, 2008 under No.1696277 in
           Class 41 which is pending with the Registrar, Trade Marks.
</p><p id="p_10">   viii) The top rankings by independent surveys, quality education
           and national and international awards has garnered
           extensive reputation and goodwill to the plaintiffs. The
           plaintiffs have incurred substantial expenditure in setting up
           its Shri Ram Schools in the year 1988.

           4106, Ashoka Marg, Near DLF Galleria, DLF Phase IV,
           Gurgaon, Haryana 122002. The said school was opened
           right next to the plaintiff No.1's The Shri Ram School, Aravali


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                            Page 4 of 62</span>
            at Hamilton Court Complex, DLF Phase IV, DLF City,
           Gurgaon-122002. Immediately on the opening of the said
           school and the proximity of the two schools, the principal of
           the plaintiff's school started getting a number of enquiries
           from parents including as to whether the School is a part of
           The Shri Ram School or admission in the SHRI RAM
           GLOBAL       PRE-SCHOOL          guaranteed   an    automatic
           admission to THE SHRI RAM SCHOOL. As the SHRI RAM
           GLOBAL PRE-SCHOOL had been opened by a trust
           founded by the brother of the plaintiff's, Mr. Arun Bharat
           Ram, Chairman of the Board of Governors of plaintiff No.1
           wrote a letter to his brother i.e. Trustee of the defendant
           apprising him of the substantial reputation of 'The Shri Ram
           School' run by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_12">   x)      Instead of giving up the use of the trademark SHRI RAM the
           defendant expanded its operations under the trademark
           SHRI RAM and opened the SHRI RAM CENTENNIAL
           SCHOOL, Dehradun at Knowledge Village Sherpur, Shimla
           Road, Dehradun - 248197, SHRI RAM CENTENNIAL

            Gurgaon barely 240 meters from the head office of the said
           SRF Limited.
</p><p id="p_13">                The plaintiffs accordingly put up notices in Indore,
           Gurgaon and Dehradun informing the general public that
           THE SHRI RAM SCHOOL had no relation or connection with
           these schools.
</p><p id="p_14">   xi)     The plaintiff No.1 received a letter dated 17th February, 2014
           from M/s. Factum Lawyers &amp; Co. on behalf of the defendant
           claiming to "hold unmatched goodwill; reputation and
           standing in the market through its educational institutions,
           schools running under the brand name of SHRI RAM
           GLOBAL SCHOOL/SHRI RAM CENTENNIAL SCHOOLS"
</p><p id="p_15">           even though these schools were opened nearly two decades
           after the establishment of THE SHRI RAM SCHOOL in 1988
           and none of the schools of the defendant have been able to
           reach the recognition, milestone or ranking, as achieved by
           the schools of the plaintiff. The legal notice called upon the
           plaintiff No.1 to withdraw the advertisements and to tender a
           public apology for releasing these advertisements in two
           leading     newspapers   of    the   metros   wherever    such
           advertisements have been released failing which appropriate
           legal action would be taken.

           order dated 28th April, 2014 of The Competition Commission

               the plaintiff No.1 inter alia alleging that the plaintiff No.2 had
              intentionally placed the hoardings.
</p><p id="p_17">3.           Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the plaintiffs have no
objection if the said mark/name SHRI RAM is used by the defendant
in relation to any other different activities or services except in
relation to the services of school on the reason that as far as running
of school bearing the mark SHRI RAM is concerned, they are prior
user and have acquire unique goodwill, name and reputation and it
would create confusion and deception if allowed to the defendant
who was aware about the same on the date of adoption and it is
done by the defendant in order to make misrepresentation.
</p><p id="p_18">4.           The plaintiffs have filed large number of documents in support
thereof. The details of few documents are mentioned below:-

who argued that the use of the name/mark SHRI RAM is a bonafide
use. The plaintiffs cannot have the monopoly rights over the mark
SHRI RAM.              It is the name of the grandfather of the founding
members of the plaintiffs' schools and defendant's trust. The plaintiffs
cannot claim the prior user in respect of the educational institution
like school if the College under the mark SHRI RAM is being run prior
to the use of plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_32">8.       It is argued by Mr. Anand that the reputation and goodwill that
is enjoyed by the Shriram brand in present times was first established
by the efforts and endeavours of Late Sir Shri Ram, who was
renowned        for      his   endeavours   in   the   industrialization     and
modernisation of education in India. Late Sir Shri Ram's contributions
towards upliftment of educational services and facilities in India are
widely acknowledged and respected across India. The legacy of
educational excellence as established by Late Sir Shri Ram was
furthered to greater heights by the successive generations of the
Shriram family.

      which are mentioned herein below:
</p><p id="p_69">      (i)   Shri Ram College of Commerce : The institution was
            established in the year 1920 by Sir Shri Ram under the
            name "Commercial High School". It was later elevated to
            function as an "Intermediate College" in the year 1926. The
            same was further elevated as a Degree College in the year
            1930 and college offering Post - Graduate studies in the
            year 1934. This educational institution was later renamed
            the "Shriram College of Commerce" in the year 1951 in

       Women. Shri Charat Ram, son of Sir Shri Ram had also
      contributed to his father's legacy of educational excellence and

</p><p id="p_74">V. The Shriram Family is also credited with tremendous contribution
      to the field of the performing arts. It is submitted that Ms. Sheila

       was actively involved in the affairs of SRF Limited. Further, Smt.
      Sukanya Bharat Ram, Trustee of the defendant Trust herein had
      also served as a member on the Governing body of the Lady

      to 2012. She is also a member on the Board of Trustees of the
      Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Trust, which provides inter
      alia educational services to rural communities in North Delhi.
VII. In the year 1989, through a Scheme of Arrangement, the Shri
      Ram Family witnessed its first division, a tripartite division
      amongst the sons of Sir Shri Ram i.e., Shri Murli Dhar, Shri
      Charat Ram and Shri Bharat Ram thereby granting parallel rights
      to carry forward the rich legacy of Sir Shri Ram. Subsequent
      division had occurred in the Family of Shri. Bharat Ram,
      commonly known as the Bharat Ram Group in the year 1998,
      whereby parallel rights were conferred to his sons as the legacy
      of the Shri Ram Family while ensuring that values and ethics
      propounded by Sir Shri Ram and late Shri. Bharat Ram were
      protected.
</p><p id="p_76">                Reliance is also placed upon letter dated 6th May, 2004
      addressed by Dr. Charat Ram to his son, Shri Siddharth Shriram
      wherein he recognized the tremendous goodwill enjoyed by the
      "Shriram" brand. Through this letter, Dr. Charat Ram had
      advised for sharing of such goodwill and for avoiding all
      disputes. The contents of the letter are reproduced herein below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            "... "Usha" and "Shriram" are brands that enjoy
            tremendous goodwill and are synonymous with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                        Page 16 of 62</span>
             Shriram group entities. There has been decades of
            harmony between these enterprises, and the brands
            have been used by many of the Shriram enterprises
            for their respective brands. This has benefited the
            enterprises and in the process also enriched the
            brands.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            All the enterprises have contributed towards the
            goodwill of the brands through usage on quality
            products and earning the trust of the customers. Any
            dispute can only damage the brand and in turn the
            reputation of Shriram enterprises built up through
            years of hard work".

<p id="p_77">VIII. Thus, it is evident that the elders in the Shriram family including
      inter alia Shri. Bharat Ram of the DCM Shriram Group as well as
      Sh. Charat Ram of the Usha Group shared the same views as
      their founding father Sir Shri Ram, that the Shri Ram Family
      should retain all such rights to make use of their family name
      and must protect the family name from falling into the hands of
      outsiders.
</p><p id="p_78">                Thus being a Founder and Chairman of the defendant,
      vide his letter dated 26th September, 2011 had reminded the
      Chairperson of the plaintiff No. 1 of the stellar contribution of
      members of the Shriram Family in upholding and further
      strengthening the reputation and goodwill enjoyed by the
      educational institutions established by the Shriram Family. There
      was a fear in the minds of the plaintiffs that at one time, the
      share holdings may divest in the hands of outsiders. The
      plaintiffs felt it necessary to ensure that the use of the word

       "SHRI RAM" remains within the family as was the desire of the
      founding fathers of the said family.
</p><p id="p_79">         Therefore, it is submitted that the plaintiffs and the defendant
herein have concurrent rights to make use of their family name
"Shriram" in relation to their schools.
</p><p id="p_80">11.      It is submitted that the use of the name "Shri Ram" by the
defendant in relation to running the services of schools is in
furtherance of the common family name of the plaintiffs and the
defendant, which constitutes a bonafide use under the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 as the elders in the Shri Ram family had
always professed a principle of "Live and Let Live" while advising
family members to maintain peace and harmony in the family.
Further, the elders in the Shri Ram family shared the common view
that all members of the Shri Ram family possess concurrent rights to
make use of their family name. Dr. Bansi Dhar in a letter dated 18th
April, 1990 had clearly advised that no member of the Shri Ram
family must be restricted from making use of the tremendous goodwill
vested in the name Shri Ram. Further, Dr. Charat Ram, son of Late
Sir Shri Ram vide letter dated 6th May, 2004 addressed to his son Mr.
Siddharth Shriram had clearly stated that the collective efforts of
various enterprises in the Shriram Family had enriched the brand
Shri Ram over the years and that any dispute between such
enterprises must be prevented.
</p><p id="p_81">12.      It is submitted by the defendant that the names of the
defendant's schools that is "Shri Ram Global School", "Shri Ram
Centennial School" and "Shri Ram Global Pre-School" are sufficiently


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                         Page 18 of 62</span>
 distinctive from the name of the plaintiff's Schools, i.e. "The Shri Ram
School" and "Shri Ram Millennium School". The names of the
defendant's schools make use of additional elements as suffix which
distinguishes clearly the schools of the defendant from those of the
plaintiffs. The defendant also makes use of a particular Shield Device
in relation to its schools and educational institutions, which is
completely different and distinguishable from the mark of the
plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_82">         With regard to goodwill, reputation and prior user claimed by
the plaintiffs that due to prior establishment of the plaintiff's Shri Ram
Schools on the initiative of Mrs. Manju Bharat Ram in the year 1988,
the name Shri Ram and the consequent goodwill vested in it in
relation to schools is the sole property of the plaintiffs is incorrect and
unacceptable. Various factions of the Shri Ram family have not only
made use of the Family Name prior to the plaintiffs but have also
obtained trademark registrations for the name "Shri Ram".
</p><p id="p_83">13.      It is submitted that the Shri Ram Family, in its efforts to uplift
educational excellence in India had established 'The Shri Ram
School Mawana" in the year 1957. The said school running under the
Chairmanship of Mr. Siddharth Shriram predates the establishment of
the plaintiff's schools by over 30 years. Therefore, neither are the
plaintiffs the only faction of the Shri Ram family which has been in the
field of running schools in India nor are they the first amongst the Shri
Ram family to do so.
</p><p id="p_84">14.      With regard to confusion and deception, it is argued by the
defendant's counsel that the plaintiffs have placed reliance upon


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                          Page 19 of 62</span>
 letters and e-mails allegedly emanating from the general public. The
same are in the nature of inquiries raised internally either by the
employees of SRF Ltd., the holding company of the plaintiff or by
members of the plaintiffs' schools themselves. The E-mail dated 27th
March, 2014 from one Ms. Payal Gulati highlighted the difference in
between the devices of the plaintiff's marks and the defendant's by
stating that the other school "does not have the Shri Logo".
</p><p id="p_85">15.      However, it is not denied on behalf of defendant that the
plaintiffs are the prior user of the mark/name SHRI RAM in relation to
running the schools between the parties. But, it is stated that the
plaintiffs are not the exclusive proprietor of the same. It is admitted
that the defendant established its first school, namely the Shri Ram
Global Pre-School in Gurgaon in the year 2011. Subsequently, the
defendant has established its schools in various cities of the country
including New Delhi, Dehradun, Indore, Rohtak, Siliguri among
others.
</p><p id="p_86">16.      It is informed by Mr. Anand that at present, the defendant runs
nineteen schools under two banners namely, the Shri Ram Global
Schools and the Shri Ram Centennial Schools by itself or under the
contracts with third parties. The defendant is holding the registered
trademark under the name SHRI RAM.
</p><p id="p_87">17.      In a nut-shell, the case of the defendant is that the defendant's
right to use the name SHRI RAM for schools emanates from the
common lineage from the legacy of Late Sir Shri Ram. Thus, the
plaintiffs' action is not sustainable. There are other factions of the
Shri Ram family using the name SHRI RAM for schools particularly


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                         Page 20 of 62</span>
 other members of the family in Mawana. There is bonafide use of the
family name SHRI RAM by the defendant who is using the mark
SHRI RAM in different ways along with logo and thus there is no
confusion amongst the general public. It is not denied that Late Sir
Shri Ram did not run any school under the name SHRI RAM.
</p><p id="p_88">18.       It is admitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that purpose of the
scheme of arrangement of 1998 was to provide a framework to arrive
at the division of the family assets and meet the family liabilities. Thus
the inherent right to use the name SHRI RAM vests with each
member of the Shri Ram family but such right is subject to restricting
oneself to its domain of business and not encroaching upon/infringing
others right and the letter of Dr. Bansi Dhar only dealt with his view
against any restriction to use of the name DCM and SHRI RAM by a
particular group of the Shri Ram family i.e. no faction of the Shri Ram
family could object to the use of the name SHRI RAM by another
faction, however, the same would in effect be subject to limiting the
use of the name SHRI RAM to their respective and exclusive domain
of business so as to avoid competition and confusion regarding trade
origin.
</p><p id="p_89">19.       It is submitted by the plaintiffs that there is no bonafide use of
the family name SHRI RAM by the defendant as many misleading
statements of the defendant are malafide attempts on its part to
associate itself and its SHRI RAM schools with the plaintiff's well-
known SHRI RAM schools in Delhi and Gurgaon so as to piggy bank
on its reputation and goodwill and gain illicit profits out of the same.
The defendant in fact is using the name/mark SHRI RAM as a trade


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                           Page 21 of 62</span>
 mark.
</p><p id="p_90">20.      With regard to dissimilarity between the school name of the
defendant and the plaintiffs, it is argued by the plaintiffs that the use
of an identical name SHRI RAM for its schools by the defendant
evidently makes it similar to the name of the plaintiff's well-known
SHRI RAM schools.
</p><p id="p_91">21.      The use of the words "Centennial" and "Global" by the
defendant in conjunction with the name SHRI RAM for its schools do
create confusion and deception as THE SHRIRAM MILLENNIUM
SCHOOL and SHRI RAM CENTENNIAL SCHOOL are deceptively
similar. The term "Centennial" used by the defendant in conjunction
with the name SHRI RAM for its schools is synonymous with the term
'Millennium" used by the plaintiffs in conjunction with the name SHRI
RAM for its schools. Even the use of the Shield device would not
make any difference as the foremost and essential feature of the
defendant's school name is the word 'SHRI RAM".

the difference in the devices of the plaintiffs and defendant's mark.
Rather, this email evidences the fact that the devices used along with
the name SHRI RAM are irrelevant for the purpose of creating
dissimilarity between the marks and that the essential and the
prominent feature of both marks is the name SHRI RAM, because
otherwise Ms. Gulati on seeing the Shield Device of the defendants
would have understood that the defendant's SHRI RAM schools do
not originate from the plaintiffs and thus, would have not written the

 aforesaid email.
</p><p id="p_93">23.      It is argued that the confusion has further occurred by
defendant's franchisee's own admission in the defamation suit that
the general public refrained from seeking admission in the
defendant's SHRI RAM school in Indore pursuant to being made
aware of the non-connection between the plaintiffs' SHRI RAM
schools and the defendant's SHRI RAM schools. This in effect
means that before being made aware of the non-connection, the
general public believed the defendant's SHRI RAM schools to be
connected/associated with the plaintiffs' SHRI RAM schools.
</p><p id="p_94">24.      It is stated by the plaintiffs that the defendant as per Exhibit E
of its Brand License and Franchisee Agreement dated 26th
September, 2012, was charging a one-time fee of Rs. 1.15 Crore
from its franchisee for the licensed right to start SHRI RAM branded
schools in a particular territory followed by an additional amount of
Rs. 5 Lakhs per pre-school that is opened by the franchisee within its
franchise territory after the first pre-school.

 contrary does not dispute the said position but raises a defence that
the mark SHRI RAM is not merely proprietary interest of the plaintiffs
for manifold reasons including that the defendant is real brother of
the plaintiffs and belongs to Shri Ram family and is closely connected
with the field of the education operating under the mark SHRI Ram. It
is also the case of the defendant that there are documents
suggesting that the family members can use the word SHRI RAM to
promote the same and thus the defendant is entitled to use the mark
SHRI RAM being a family member. I have considered the
submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties on the
aspect of the proprietorship of the mark SHRI RAM. I am of the view
that there is a material available on record which indicates that the
family members of the Sir Shri Ram has been using the mark SHRI
RAM in respect of the diverse kind of the business and services
including education in colleges. There is no material on record which
prima facie suggests that a faction of the family members as per
family settlement has been specially allowed to run the school or the
groups emanating from Shri Ram family which limits their rights to
use the mark SHRI RAM in respect of the particular field of the
business. It is though altogether different matter that there may be a
line in the business which has been adopted by the Shri Ram family
in good senses by not intruding in each other's business for all this
period. Still, for prima facie purposes, it cannot be said that the
plaintiffs have been provided with the mark SHRI RAM solely for
running the schools as per any written document executed by the
family members.        It is now to be considered as to whether the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                      Page 24 of 62</span>
 plaintiffs have any right to run the school exclusively under the name
SHRI RAM. It has come to record that prior to plaintiffs' schools who
have acquired unique goodwill and reputation, none of the family
member of         Late Bharat Ram had started school under the said
name but no doubt family members were actively involved in the
educational institutions apart from other activities. It has also brought
to my knowledge that one of other faction of family relation has been
running school prior to the plaintiffs. But, the objection was raised by
the plaintiffs' counsel that the said plea is not taken in written
statement and it was pointed out by the counsel that prior to the
plaintiffs use, the said school under the name SHRI RAM was
opened for the education of employees children of Sugar Mill only
which has no goodwill and name who is running the said school
outside Delhi in remote area in a small way.

mark/name SHRI RAM in the manner depicted are deceptively
similar or not. The said issue has been discussed by the Division

      the essential feature of the plaintiff's mark combined with
      other matter, the correct approach for the court is to identify
      an essential feature depending particularly "on the court's
      own judgment and burden of the evidence that is placed
      before the Court". In order to come to the conclusion whether
      one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and
      essential features of the two are to be considered. They
      should not be placed side by side to find out if there are
      differences, rather overall similarity has to be judged. While
      judging the question as to whether the defendant has
      infringed the trade mark or not, the court has to consider the
      overall impression of the mark in the minds of general public

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                         Page 26 of 62</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      21. The ascertainment of an essential feature is not to be by
      ocular test alone but if a word forming part of the mark has
      come in trade to be used to identify the goods of the owner of
      the trade mark, it is an infringement of the mark itself to use
      that word as the mark or part of the mark of another trader for
      which confusion is likely to result. The likelihood of confusion
      or deception in such cases is not disproved by placing the
      two marks side by side and demonstrating how small is the
      chance of error in any customer who places his order for
      goods with both the marks clearly before him, for orders are
      not placed, or are often not placed, under such conditions. It
      is more useful to observe that in most persons the eye is not
      an accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks are
      remembered rather by general impressions or by some
      significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the
      whole". In the decision reported as (1951) 68 RPC 103, 105,
      De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co., the plaintiffs were the
      proprietors of a label containing the words "Vick's VapoRub"
      as the essential feature, registered in Jamaica, and the
      defendants used a similar label with the words "Karsote
      Vapour Rub" as the essential feature, and it was shown that
      the expression "VapoRub" had become distinctive of the
      plaintiff's goods in Jamaica, an action for infringement was
      successful. (See De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co. (supra),

      one could become a proprietor of a trade mark only by
      user, but after the passing of the Act of 1875, one could
      become a proprietor either by user or by registering the
      mark even prior to its user. He could do the latter after
      complying with the other requirements of the Act, including
      the filing of a declaration of his intention to use such mark.

      and particularly the following: "A proprietary right in a mark
      sought to be registered can be obtained in a number of ways.
      The mark can be originated by a person or can be acquired,
      but in all cases it is necessary that the person putting forward
      the application should be in possession of some proprietary
      right which, if questioned, can be substantiated". Law in India
      under our present Act is similar."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_108">35.      The said views emanating from the courts in India clearly
speak in one voice which is that the rights in common law can be
acquired by way of use and the registration rights were introduced
later which made the rights granted under the law equivalent to the
public user of such mark. Thus, registration is merely a
recognition of the rights pre-existing in common law and in case
of conflict between the two registered proprietors,                     the
evaluation of the better rights in common law is essential as the
common law rights would enable the court to determine whose
rights between the two registered proprietors are better and
superior in common law which have been recognized in the
form of the registration by the Act. (Emphasis Supplied)

</p><p id="p_109"> 36.      The applicability of the said principle can be seen as to which
proprietor has generated the goodwill by way of use of the mark /
name in the business. The use of the mark/ carrying on business
under the name confers the rights in favor of the person and
generates goodwill in the market. Accordingly, the latter user of the
mark/ name or in the business cannot misrepresent his business as
that of business of the prior right holder.
</p><p id="p_110">37.      The prior user is considered to be superior than that of any
other rights. Consequently, the examination of rights in common law
which are based on goodwill, misrepresentation and damage are
independent to that of registered rights. The mere fact that both prior
user and subsequent user are registered proprietors are irrelevant for
the purposes of examining who generated the goodwill first in the
market and whether the latter user is causing misrepresentation in
the course of trade and damaging the goodwill and reputation of the
prior right holder/ former user.
</p><p id="p_111">38.      It is also recognized principle in common law jurisdiction that
passing off right is broader remedy than that of infringement. This is
due to the reason that the passing off doctrine operates on the
general principle that no person is entitled to represent his or her
business as that of business of other person. The said action in
deceit is maintainable for diverse reasons other than that of
registered rights which are allocated rights under the Act.
</p><p id="p_112">39.       The defendant has also referred the E-mail dated 28th
September, 2011 by stating that there are admission/ no objection on



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                          Page 35 of 62</span>
 the part of plaintiffs to use the name SHRI RAM for running the
schools. The extract of the said E-mail reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "I want to mention that if you ever wanted to divest or
      reduce your shareholding, you would then be reduced to
      minority shareholding in your company. You must
      remember that the 'Shri Ram' brand might then go to wrong
      outsiders. One would have no control over how they would
      use this brand."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_113">40.      Even otherwise, let us take the face value of the said letter
written by the plaintiff in Trade Mark Registry making some
admissions to the effect that no monopoly can be claimed and the
mark SHRI RAM applied is not similar to the mark of the defendant's
mark. But at the same time, if Court would find that it is a distinctive
mark then the same is protectable under the law, the said admissions
are totally immaterial as per settled law as well as with regard to E-
mail dated 28th September, 2011.
</p><p id="p_114">41.      The law of admission has its genesis from the rules of
evidence wherein it is well settled that the admission is best evidence
and no further evidence is required once the admission is clear and
unambiguous. However, the admissions are usually made of some
facts and not of pure questions of law.
</p><p id="p_115">         As observed by Phipson in his Law of Evidence (1963 Edition,
Para 678) as the weight of an admission depends on the
circumstances under which it was made, these circumstances may
always be proved to impeach or enhance its credibility. The effect of
admission is that it shifts the onus on the person admitting the fact on
the principle that what a party himself admits to be true may


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                        Page 36 of 62</span>
 reasonably be presumed to be so, and until the presumption is
rebutted, the fact admitted must be taken to be established. An
admission is the best evidence that an opposing party can rely upon,
and though not conclusive is decisive of matter, unless successfully
withdrawn or proved erroneous.
</p><p id="p_116">42.      The admission in the context of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_16">Indian Evidence Act</a>, 1872
shall always be of facts due to the definition of the admission under
<a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_17">Section 17</a> of the Act and the same is confined to statement which
may suggest inference as to fact or relevant fact. A logical corollary to
this which follows is that the admissions shall always be of facts or
relevant facts but cannot be of law.
</p><p id="p_117">         If one examines the concept of admissions on the basis of law
of pleadings as envisaged under the Code of Civil Procedure, it is
realized that the cardinal rule of pleadings is that the pleadings
should contain the facts, material facts and not the law. There again,
it is not practical or feasible to give rise to any such admission of the
law or legal position. Afortiori, it follows that the admission of the
legal position or legal principle which may or may not be correct is no
admission in law and it is inconsequential in law.
</p><p id="p_118">43.      In the case of Ram Bharosey vs Ram Bahadur Singh, AIR
1948 Oudh 125, the Court had observed that the admission by a
party on pure question of law is not binding on him. The same view
was also taken by the Nagpur Bench in the case of Gulabchand vs.
Bhaiyalal, AIR 1929 Nag 343. There cannot be an estoppel against
the law or statutory provisions. When one is concerned with the
statutory right or constitutional guarantee, there cannot be any

 estoppel against the same as held in the case of A.C. Jose Vs Sivan
Pillai &amp; Ors, (1984) 3 SCR 74.
</p><p id="p_119">44.      Once there is no estoppel against the statute, the admissions
or concessions made by the counsel for the parties under the wrong
understanding of law cannot operate to the detriment of the party
making such admissions and it is only on the basis of correct legal
position, the rights of the parties are to be determined.
</p><p id="p_120">         This proposition has been laid down in the case of <a href="/doc/1688802/" id="a_18">Union of

         consequence, because the wrong concession made by a

species of the principle that there cannot be any estoppel against
the statute. It was held that a case decided on the basis of wrong
concession of a counsel has no precedent value. That apart, the
applicability of the statute or otherwise to a given situation or the
question of statutory liability of a person/institution under any
provision of law would invariably depend upon the scope and
meaning of the provisions concerned and has got to be adjudged
not on any concession made. Any such concessions would have no
acceptability or relevance while determining rights and liabilities
incurred or acquired in view of the axiomatic principle, without
exception, that there can be no estoppel against statute.

<p id="p_122"> 46.      In view of the above discussion, it is clear that the admissions
made of law or legal provisions are inconsequential, they cannot
operate as an estoppel against the person making it. The courts are
not to act upon the admissions of wrong legal principles made by the
parties. Rather, the court has to adjudicate rights and liabilities of
parties basing on the true legal position emerging from the interplay
of the provisions of the statute and not upon any such wrong
admissions.
</p><p id="p_123">47.      Therefore, it is evident that if the mark SHRI RAM was/is
distinctive as per law and both rival marks are similar, in case any
admission is made by the plaintiffs the same has no consequence.
The same cannot operate to the detriment of the plaintiff No.2. The
said admission whatsoever does not help the case of the defendant
who itself had applied for registration of the mark SHRI RAM which
is registered in the name of the defendant. It is not understood if the
said plea is taken then why the defendant has filed the application
for registration of the said mark who made its admission of
distinctiveness of the same mark at the time of registration.
</p><p id="p_124">         It appears from the E-mail apparently that Arun Bhagat Ram
warned his brother not to share the name SHRI RAM with the third
party otherwise the quality of the name is likely to be tarnished.
However, despite of the same, the name SHRI RAM was allowed by
the    defendant       to   the   third   party   by   way   of     licensing
agreements/contract. Even otherwise, he has not allowed the
defendant to use the name SHRI RAM in the said E-mails. Prima

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                              Page 40 of 62</span>
 share the mark SHRI RAM with the defendant for running the
schools.
</p><p id="p_125">48.      The next submission of Mr. Anand is that one of the family
members is operating school in Mawana prior to the plaintiffs, thus,
the plaintiffs cannot claim the exclusive rights to the use of the mark
SHRI RAM.
</p><p id="p_126">49.      It is also argued by the plaintiffs' counsel that the reliance on
the existence of The Shri Ram School, Mawana is untenable for the
fact that this school's presence is limited to a town in Uttar Pradesh,
with     limited       access   to   the   general   public   and     lacks
reputation/goodwill.        It is not denied that the said school was
established as the "Mawana Sugar Works Primary School" in the
year 1957 and not as the Shri Ram School, Mawana. The use of the
name SHRI RAM by this school prior to the plaintiffs was as a
primary school. This school is yet to become full-fledged as it
currently caters to students till only Class XI. The school is located
within the campus of Mawana Sugar Limited Factory. The plaintiffs
submit that the school was established to cater to the educational
requirements of the employees of Mawana Sugar Works and not the
general public. It is submitted that no such plea was taken in the
written statement.
</p><p id="p_127">50.      It is contended by the plaintiffs that the defendant itself
became aware of the Mawana school much later as there is no
mention of the same in the pleadings. It is only the plaintiffs faction
of the Shri Ram family that started schools under the name SHRI
RAM. No other faction has been in the business of running schools

 under the name SHRI RAM. Therefore, the goodwill in the name
SHRI RAM in the field of schools in India is indeed a result of the
efforts of plaintiffs. Hence, the defendant cannot be allowed to use
the identical name SHRI RAM for its schools, amounting to the
continuing detriment of the plaintiffs who have built up a goodwill
and reputation in the name SHRI RAM for its schools after years of
hard work. It is specifically argued by the plaintiffs that Mawana
School has no goodwill and reputation, it was originally established
for the purpose of giving education to the children of the employees,
and is now being used for other children after the use of the name
SHRI RAM by the plaintiffs and the said plea does not help the case
of the defendant. In view of settled proposition of law that in case of
an action of passing off the rights of prior user are to be considered
between the parties at the interim stage.
</p><p id="p_128">51.      It is the case of the plaintiffs that they have created the
enormous goodwill and reputation in the mark SHRI RAM vis-a-vis
schools. The plaintiffs are not claiming goodwill in the name SHRI
RAM to all fields of education. They are limiting their claim of
goodwill in the name SHRI RAM only to Schools and no other field
of education. The goodwill in THE SHRI RAM SCHOOL is not the
result of any effort on behalf Late Sir Shri Ram. Late Sir Shri Ram
did not run any school under the name SHRI RAM. The defendant
has not given any evidence to show that there is any other member
of the family which is running a school which has a reputation in the
SHRI RAM name except evidence is of one school in Mawana which
has no reputation.

      similar mark prior in point of time to user by the appellant is
      irrelevant in an action passing off and the mere presence of
      the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry
      did not prove its user by the persons in whose names the
      mark was registered and was irrelevant for the purposes of
      deciding the application for interim injunction unless evidence

no evidence contrary to the contention has been produced by the

      of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth Edition, para
      16.49), the name under which a business trades will almost
      always be a trade mark (or if the business provides services,
      a service mark, or both). Independently of questions of trade
      or service mark, however, the name of a business (a trading
      business or any other) will normally have attached to it a
      goodwill that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off
      will then lie wherever the defendant companys name, or its
      intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert
      business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion
      between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is
      no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the
      proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in which
      the business may be carried on in the future, and to its not
      being carried on precisely as carried on at the date of the

<p id="p_138">57.      As per Kerly (Law on Trade Marks and Names, para
16.16) passing off cases are often cases of deliberate and
intentional misrepresentation, but it is well-settled that fraud is not
a necessary element of the right of action, and the absence of an
intention to deceive is not a defence though proof of fraudulent

of deception. Christopher Wadlow in Law of Passing Off (1995

actual damage in order to succeed in an action for passing off.
Likelihood of damage is sufficient.

         has built up his goodwill in the business after years of hard

         that what was previously a misrepresentation of goods has
         now become a misappropriation of another man's property
         in the business or goodwill, or misappropriation of
         another's personality. You cannot make use of the
         plaintiff's expensive labour and effort. You cannot

<p id="p_140">59.      Further, it is apparent in the present case that the
commencement of its use in the year 2011 by defendant by opening
its first school in Gurgaon is in close proximity to the plaintiffs' Shri
Ram School, Aravali. When the defendant adopted the name SHRI
RAM for its schools, the plaintiffs SHRI RAM schools were named
the best school in Gurgaon and South West Delhi as well as in India.
The defendant calls its students "Shri Ramite" which is same to the
name given to the students of the plaintiffs Shri Ram schools since
as early as the year 2000.        The defendant claimed that it has a
School in Delhi when it does not.

<p id="p_141">60.      It is also evident from the material placed on record that the
defendant had never been in the field of running schools until the
year 2011 when it started its first school. The plaintiffs are the only
faction of the Shri Ram family which has been in the field of running
schools. The defendant's trustees have been on the board for other
educational institutions such as Lady Shri Ram College and Sri Ram

that the name/surname are protectable under the law. Once the

various judgments delivered by the courts including Supreme Court.

with his sons under the SHRI RAM name in relation to school. It is a
fact that Late Sir Shri Ram did not run any school under the name

the services of schools.
</p><p id="p_158">b)       The second case referred by Mr. Anand is Jaggi Ayurvedic
Pharmacy (supra); the facts of this case are different from the facts
of the case at hand. The trademark in question in this case i.e.
JAGGI, was the family surname whereas in the case at hand the
trademark in question is the name of the grandfather of the parties
i.e. SHRI RAM, and not their surname. The use of the trademark
JAGGI was started by the predecessor of the parties to the suit for
his ayurvedic clinic which name was subsequently adopted by the
sons and grandsons of the predecessor for their respective ayurvedic
businesses whereas in the case at hand it is a fact that Late Sir Shri
Ram did not run any school under the name SHRI RAM. The
plaintiffs were the first and the only faction of the Shri Ram family to
begin using the mark SHRI RAM for schools and create a goodwill in
the word SHRI RAM in relation to schools.
</p><p id="p_159">c)       The third case referred by Mr. Anand is Precious Jewels
(supra); the facts of this case are different from the facts of the case
at hand. The trademark in question in this case i.e. RAKYAN, was
the family surname whereas in the case at hand the trademark in
question is the name of the grandfather of the parties i.e. SHRI RAM,
and not their surname. <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_29">Section 35</a> of the Act is therefore not
applicable. That use of the trademark RAKYAN was started by the
predecessor of the parties to the suit for the business of "jewellery"
which name was subsequently adopted by the successors of the
family for their respective jewellery businesses i.e. 15 different

 jewellery businesses in total. Whereas in the case at hand it is a fact
that Late Sir Shri Ram did not run any school under the name SHRI
RAM. The plaintiffs were the first and the only faction of the Shri Ram
family to begin using the mark SHRI RAM for schools. The defendant
at the time of use was fully aware about the use of the plaintiffs.
Even when the plaintiffs come across the user, the defendant was
informed.
</p><p id="p_160">d)       In the case of Goenka Institute of Education &amp; Research
(supra) the Court observed that both the parties started using the
name GOENKA as part of its institutions i.e. Appellant had been
using the name GOENKA as part of the name of its trust since 1995
in different state i.e. Rajasthan who claimed prior user as well as
concurrent rights and the respondent had been using the name
GOENKA as part of its school name since the year 1994. In the case
at hand, the defendant's first SHRI RAM pre school was established
in the year 2011, whereas the schools under the name SHRI RAM
started in or around 2013-2014 and the defendant trust under the
name SHRI RAM was started in the year 2010 as compared to the
use of the name SHRI RAM by the plaintiff's for its schools since the
year 1988. The defendant had started its school within the same
area having full knowledge about the well established school running
by the plaintiffs. Therefore, the facts are materially different.

educational institutions of Delhi. This is reflected in the application
where it is stated in Para 11 "The Petitioner and the Respondent
have been associated in business and commonly known as Usha -
Shriram Group of Companies." It is further stated in para 12 that both
the parties have been marketing their products under the marks Usha
and Usha Shriram and acted together and jointly along with other
group companies to restrain other parties from using 'Usha'. The
facts in the present case are dis-similar.

Court by stating that it became aware of the disparaging activities of
the    defendant       in   September,   2005   when   in   actuality     the
advertisement had been running since February, 2005. The plaintiff
was thus held to be guilty of concealment of material facts and the
interim order was vacated. The facts in the said matter were totally
different as each day delay in the action of disposing of product of the
plaintiff on the television advertisement is crucial. In the said matter,
the plaintiff alleged in the plaint that it came to know of the
disparaging advertising in September, 2005. The court observed that
it could not be possible as the alleged disparaging advertisement was
shown on commercial television on large scale since February, 2005
on this account the interim order was lifted

of his own name without any intention to deceive anybody or without
any intention to make use of the goodwill which has been acquired by
another trader. The words "bonafide use" is the governing words and

 heart and soul of the said Section. The party cannot blindly read this
Section that under the statute, he is entitled to use his own name,
surname in respect of same goods and services.                No different
meaning can be given to this Section, if the use is not bonafide and
the same is tainted and dishonest. Under these circumstances, this
<a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_30">Section 35</a> of the Act would not apply in the facts of the present case.
</p><p id="p_165">64.      Even otherwise no doubt proprietorship right claimed by the
plaintiff is to be determined after the trial in the matter as to whether
the mark SHRI RAM belongs to the plaintiff in respect of running the
school or not or the defendant being the family member is entitled to
claim any right to use the same. It is a matter of fact however prima
facie this Court finds that the use of the name SHRI RAM in relation
to running of the schools particularly in the same area is not bonafide.
</p><p id="p_166">65.      In the case at hand, the plaintiffs have disclosed to the Court
the fact that they became aware of the defendant's infringing activities
in the year 2011, which was brought to the notice of the defendant's
trustee by the plaintiffs' chairman at a personal level as it was then a
off pre-school. But immediately on becoming aware of the rampant
opening of schools by the defendant under the name SHRI RAM in
the year 2014, plaintiffs initiated the present suit. There is a force in
the argument of the plaintiffs' counsel to extent that despite of
communication, the defendant has been continuing to open the new
schools by itself or through contract with the third party.
</p><p id="p_167">66.      It also appears from the material placed on record that in
respect of running the schools, no doubt the plaintiffs are the prior
user than the defendant. One thing is also clear between the family

 members that they would have always an understanding between
themselves that the confusion or deception does not occur. If the
name SHRI RAM is used for the last more than 65 years for college
there is no Shriram College by any other family members. Similarly
for the past 58 years, no other college under the name of Lady
Shriram has been established by any member of the family. It means
that all parties have maintained discipline so that no actual deception
and confusion is occurred and no harm would cause to other
party/relation.
</p><p id="p_168">67.      No doubt that the father's of both the parties and grandfather
were involved in the field of education bearing the mark SHRI RAM
prior to the schools of the plaintiff but it is a matter of fact, no school
was run by them on commercial scale prior to the date of the plaintiffs
who have no objection if the defendant may claim legacy of
grandfather Sir Shri Ram in relation to other activities of education
except for running the school. The defendant has also issued large
number of licenses and appointed franchisees and is getting license
fee, despite of e-mail written by the brother not to allow them,
otherwise quality of education and name of Shri Ram would be
affected, but the defendant did not care about it.
</p><p id="p_169">68.      It is pertinent to mention here that after filing the present suit,
the defendant had entered into contract with their parties uptil March,
2015 disclosing that the construction of twenty one more schools
which are to be operated from the period of 1st September, 2015 to
1st April, 2020 under the name of Shri Ram Global Pre-School, Shri
Ram Centennial School at various parts of India despite of pendency


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                           Page 55 of 62</span>
 of the suit. The said information was provided by the counsel for
defendant when the matter was put up for clarification. It is clear that
the plaintiffs have been able to prima facie established the case of
confusion, deception and prior user.
</p><p id="p_170">69.       But at the same time there exists a unexplained delay of
about 3 years in approaching the court which prima facie indicates
towards the inference as to acquiescence. This is due to the reason
that as per plaintiffs own saying in the suit the defendants adopted
the mark SHRI RAM in respect of the school in the Gurgaon region in
the year 2011. If the plaintiffs and defendants schools are established
within the same region/ area in Gurgaon and the plaintiffs are
affected by the said misuse of the same, the plaintiffs ought to have
given the legal notice alarming the defendant about the proprietary
rights over the mark SHRI RAM owned by the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_171">70.      The plaintiffs have not adopted the said recourse but
remained quiet knowing well that the defendant being its brother has
been using the mark SHRI RAM in respect of the schools in the year
2011 through defendant without objecting to its misuse at the earnest
opportunity given the fact that both the schools are located at the
proximity to each other. It is only in the year 2014, when the
defendant expanded the schools in other areas which according to
the defendant are 19 in number, the plaintiffs approached this court
objecting to the use of the mark SHRI RAM by the defendant. The
caution notices issued by the plaintiffs are also the notice to the
public not to mislead in believing that the defendant school is
belonging to plaintiffs. But the plaintiffs never objected by specifically


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                         Page 56 of 62</span>
 directing the notice to the defendant in the year 2011 until the year
2014. The said no objection for the continuous period of 3 years
given the proximity of relation between the founding members of the
plaintiffs and defendant being real brothers and the admitted
knowledge of the plaintiffs in the plaint can be good enough for the
prima facie purposes as assent or sitting by or encouragement
allowing the defendant to expand/ grow its business without objecting
to the misuse of the same all this while leading to prima facie
inference of the acquiescence. The said plea of unexplained delay
leading of the acquiescence is thus a relevant consideration for the
passing off action, the grant of the relief in which rests on the
equitable considerations and is affected by the principle of
applicability of the acquiescence.
</p><p id="p_172">71.      The grant or non grant of injunction has to be measured within
the parameters of three tests laid down by this court. However, the
court must weigh the comparative hardship of one party as against
the another and has to decide whether the injunctory relief is
warranted or whether interim directions would suffice. Injunctions
should not result in extreme prejudice to the defendant. The balance
of convenience doctrine is of essence in cases for consideration of
the issue of grant of injunction.

RPC 513 (at 541, 542), it was observed that it was sufficient if a
'triable issue' was there. According to Lord Diplock, the Court must
also be satisfied if there is a "serious question to be tried" : therefore
it should not try to assess relative merits by looking into prima facie


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">CS (OS) No.1980/2014                                         Page 57 of 62</span>
 case in the affidavit evidence but should instead turn at once to the
balance of convenience; if damages to be awarded at the trial can
adequately compensate plaintiff and the defendant could pay them,
injunction could be refused; if not, injunction could be refused; if not,
injunction could be granted; if defendant could be compensated by
way of      damages later by plaintiff, injunction by way of damages
later by plaintiff, injunction could be granted; where there is doubt
about the adequacy of damages to one or both ; any factor which
may     affect     balance of convenience is to be considered.        If the
balance is even, the relative strength of the case is to be considered.
</p><p id="p_174">73.      The principle of law relating to temporary injunction during
pendency of the suit is well recognized in the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/49480/" id="a_31">Dalpat Kumar vs. Prahlad Singh</a> AIR
1993 SC 276.           The relevant portion of the observations of the
Supreme Court in the said case states as under:-

             the injunction will be greater than that would be likely to
            arise from granting it.

            raised, bona fide, which needs investigation and a
            decision on merits. Satisfaction that there is a prima
            facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction.
            The court further has to satisfy that non-interference by
            the court would result in 'irreparable injury' to the party
            seeking relief and that there is no other remedy
            available to the party except one to grant injunction and
            he needs protection from the consequence of
            apprehended injury or dispossession of apprehended
            injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury, however,
            does not mean that there must be no physical
            possibility of repairing the injury, but means only that
            the injury must be a material one, namely on that
            cannot be adequately compensated by way of
            damages. The third condition also is that 'the balance

            The court while granting or refusing to grant injunction
            should exercise sound judicial discretion to find the
            amount of substantial mischief or injury which is likely to
            be caused to the parties, if the injunction is refused and
            compare it with that it is likely to be caused to the other
            side if the injunction is granted.         If on weighing
            competing possibility or probabilities of likelihood of
            injury and if the court considers that pending the suit,
            the subject matter should be maintained in status quo,
            an injunction would be issued. Thus the court has to

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">            "46....... The object of the interlocutory injunction is to
            protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right
            for which he could not be adequately compensated in
            damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty
            were resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for such
            protection has, however, to be weighed against the
            corresponding need of the defendant to be protected
            against injury resulting from his having been prevented
            from exercising his own legal rights for which he could
            not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh
            one need against another and determine where the
            'balance of convenience' lies. See : <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_32">Wander Ltd. and
            Anr. v. Antox India P. Ltd</a>. [1990] Supp. SCC 727 at pp.
            731-32. In order to protect the defendant while granting
            an interlocutory injunction in his favour the Court can
            require the plaintiff to furnish an under taking so that the
            defendant can be adequately compensated if the
            uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trail."

exercise its discretion from various facets which arise in particular set
of circumstances in each matter. There may be cases in which grant
of an injunction will only meet the ends of justice and an alternative
safeguard for the preservation of rights of the challenging party
cannot at all be thought of. Thus, balance has to be strike down in
the present case in view of peculiar facts of the present case

 otherwise, great hardship would not only cause to the defendant but
also to the students and their family members who have already paid
their fees and have taken admission in the school. Their interest

put to terms and restricted interim orders for future purposes are
