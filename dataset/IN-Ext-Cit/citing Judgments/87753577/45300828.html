<p id="p_1">                                 DATE :- 06th September, 2018


Per Court:
</p>
<p id="p_2">1            The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has gone through the

judgment   of   the   Honourable   Supreme   Court   delivered   in  <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_1">Gurudassing

Nawoosing Panjwani vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a>, 2016 (2)

SCC 213,  which provides for a statutory second revision under Section

257  of  the  Maharashtra   Land  Revenue  Code.  The  Petitioner, therefore,

desires to avail of the said remedy, more so in the light of the fact that the

Authorities have handed over the possession of the property at issue to the

Respondents pursuant to the decree at issue.

2            In view of the above, this Writ Petition is disposed of so as to

enable the Petitioner to initiate a revision proceeding under Section 257.

Delay, if any, in filing the said revision would be considered by the said
                                                       *2*                     909wp10118o18


       Revisional Authority on it's own merits after considering the contentions

       of the litigating sides. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3               Needless to state, as the handing over of possession of the

       property at issue has occurred during the pendency of this writ petition,

       such developments would be subject to the litigation being pursued by the

       Petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4               All contentions of the litigating sides are kept open.
