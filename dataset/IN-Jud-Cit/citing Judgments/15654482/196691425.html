</p><p id="p_5">  2.       CS (COMM) 637/2019 has been filed by the plaintiff

  seeking to restrain the defendant from using the identical



  /deceptively similar mark LIBERTY,                  ,

  and deceptively similar trade name LIBERTY INNOVATIVE

  OUTFITS or any identical/deceptively similar mark/logo for its

  goods and services so as to result in violation of the statutory and

  common law rights of the Plaintiff in its well-known trade mark

  'LIBERTY' along with damages / account of profits against the

  defendant. It may be stated here that on November 20, 2019, ad

   interim order was passed in favour of the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_6">  3.       Some of the facts as noted from the plaint are, plaintiff, a

  registered partnership firm, was established in the year 1954. The

  plaintiff forms an integral part of Liberty Group of Companies

  and Firms ('Liberty Group', for short), which includes

  partnership firms Liberty Group Marketing Division ('LGMD',

  for short), Liberty Enterprise ('LE', for short) and Liberty Shoes

  Limited ('LSL', for short).       The Liberty Group has since its

  establishment been engaged in the business of manufacturing and

  marketing footwear and fashion products. It is noted from the

  plaint that the foundation of the footwear business under the

  brand and banner of 'LIBERTY' was established by the elder

  son of Freedom Fighter Late Lajja Ram Gupta, a renowned and

  respected resident of a small town Karnal of erstwhile Punjab,

  now in Haryana, before independence of India in 1944. The

  business was incorporated to help the shoemaker community of

  Karnal that was for generations engaged in the production of

  safety shoes for army men. It is the case of the plaintiff, that the

  plaintiff firm was established, founded by two sons of Late Lajja

  Ram Gupta, namely Late Dharam Pal Gupta and Late

  Purushottam Das Gupta with their nephew Late Raj Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 3 of 56</span>
   Bansal. The Liberty Group operations started in the year 1954

  from a retail outlet in Karnal and for well over six decades, the

  Liberty Group has been leading the Indian market with the most

  diversified variety of quality products under its brand such as

  leather bags, belts, wallets, stroller bags, school bags, ladies

  handbags, leather jackets, perfumes, deodorants, sweat shirts,

  sports &amp; fitness apparels etc. It is the case of the plaintiff that

  today, the Liberty Group is amongst the largest footwear and

  leather accessories manufacturing group in India and forms an

  integral part of the leading fashion and lifestyle retail companies

  in India. It is also averred that the Liberty Group, in addition to

  its well-known trademark 'LIBERTY', has launched various

  international and domestic brands/sub-brands including but not

  limited to TIPTOPP, FORCE 10, SENORITA, FORTUNE,

  PREFECT, FOOTFUN, GLIDERS, COOLERS, WINDSOR etc.

</p><p id="p_7">  4.       The plaintiff devised a unique and appealing corporate



  logo "LIBERTY LOGO"                    in the year 1992 and has been

  continuously using the same ever since. The corporate logo has

  been used by the plaintiff extensively through several advertising

  mediums such as Cinema, Television, Radio, Audio Visuals,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 4 of 56</span>
   Digital Mediums so much so, that the public associate the said

  trademark / logo and the goods under it to be emanating from the

  business of the plaintiff and the Liberty Group alone.

</p><p id="p_8">  5.       The Liberty Group's strong presence in the market is

  established from its expansive presence through 10 branch

  offices, 200 distributors, 5000 multi brand outlets and over 500

  exclusive stores including 20 situated outside India. It is averred

  in the plaint, that the Liberty Group has been the recipient of

  plethora of prestigious awards. It is also stated that the plaintiff

  maintains a high quality standard for all its products with ISO

  3001:2000 certification. The Liberty Group also has a significant

  online presence through its website www.libertshoesonline.com.

  According to the plaintiff, the long-standing success of the

  'LIBERTY' brand is illustrated by its annual turnover exceeding

  INR 500 crores.        That apart, the Liberty Group has created,

  developed and promoted its 'LIBERTY' brand through

  expenditure of extraordinary promotional and advertising efforts

  by spending nearly 5% of the factory price of its products on

  advertising and marketing activities, which run into crores of

  rupees annually.
</p>
<p id="p_9">  6.       It is averred that by the virtue of such long and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 5 of 56</span>
   continuous use since over six decades and extensive sales and

  promotions, the 'LIBERTY' marks have achieved tremendous

  goodwill and reputation and as a result thereof, the 'LIBERTY'

  marks have become well-known for wide range of footwear and

  fashion products sold by the Liberty Group.
</p>
<p id="p_10">  7.       On the trade mark, it is averred that plaintiff is the

  proprietor of the well-known trademark 'LIBERTY', which was

  coined and adopted in 1954 and variations in the trademark

  'LIBERTY' with respect to various goods and services including

  Classes 03, 25, 18, 35, to list a few. It is averred that an Internal

  Regulation dated January 20, 2003 was also signed by majority

  partners of the plaintiff firm, including Vivek Bansal, wherein it

  was decided that the plaintiffs Intellectual Property related to the

  mark 'LIBERTY', can only be used by a partner in his

  individual capacity for a competing business subject to the

  consent in writing of two-third majority and a validly executed

  License Agreement. In March 2003, pursuant to a consolidation

  process within the Liberty Group various assignment deeds were

  executed     between     partnership   firms   whereby;    (a)     All

  'LIBERTY' trade marks and logos along with goodwill stood

  assigned to the plaintiff firm (LFC); (b) Sub brands of the Liberty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 6 of 56</span>
   Group were transferred to the partnership firm LGMD and (c)

  Industrial designs were transferred to LE.         Some of the

  registrations for the 'LIBERTY' marks owned by the plaintiff

  are detailed in para 21 of the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_11">  8.       It is the case of the plaintiff, on March 31, 2003 the

  plaintiff firm entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with

  Liberty Shoes Limited ('LSL', for short), a public limited

  company with respect to its trademark 'LIBERTY' under Class

  18 &amp; 25 for a period of 10 years, which expired on March 31,

  2013. On April 03, 2013 an Exclusive License Agreement was

  entered between plaintiff firm and LSL for products falling in

  Class 18 and 25. The License Agreement dated April 03, 2013

  stipulated a term of five years commencing from March 01, 2013

  with automatic renewal for two terms of five years each.

</p><p id="p_12">  9.       About the defendant Company, it is stated that the

  defendant Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing,

  trading and marketing various kinds of goods falling under Class

  18 and 25 such as bags, school uniforms, socks, shoes etc. under

  the brand name 'ANYTHINGSKOOL'. That Vivek Bansal is

  the founder and one of the Directors of the defendant Company.

  That Vivek Bansal is also a partner of the plaintiff firm and also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 7 of 56</span>
   holds a stake in other partnership firms forming part of the

  Liberty Group, however he does not have any personal rights in

  the    plaintiff's   registered   trademark   'LIBERTY'     either

  individually or through the defendant Company. Further, Vivek

  Bansal is also an employee of LSL, the Exclusive Licensee of the

  plaintiff. That by virtue of being a family member and partner of

  the plaintiff firm and an employee of plaintiff's exclusive

  licensee, Vivek Bansal is well aware of the plaintiff's exclusive



  rights in     'LIBERTY',                 and variations of the

  'LIBERTY' mark as well as the Exclusive License granted to his

  employer LSL. Admittedly, no written consent and/or Licence

  Agreement can be executed between the defendant Company and

  plaintiff firm for Classes 18 &amp; 25 and therefore, the use of the

  plaintiff's registered trade marks by the defendant Company is

  unlicensed and unauthorised. LSL is the Exclusive License holder

  for the use of the mark 'LIBERTY' for Classes 18 &amp; 25. That

  Vivek Bansal, being a partner of the plaintiff firm has also

  received royalty proceeds to the tune of Rs. 3.38 Crores for the

  years 2003-2017 in terms of the Exclusive License Agreement.

</p><p id="p_13">  10.      It is averred that the defendant Company, without any

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                    Page 8 of 56</span>
   authority or license from the plaintiff, has been using the



  plaintiff's registered trade marks LIBERTY,           LIBERTY;

  and various variations of 'LIBERTY' mark in the following

  manner:
</p>
<p id="p_14">  a. Incorporated 'LIBERTY' in its trade name "LIBERTY

  Innovative Outfits Ltd.".
</p>
<p id="p_15">

  b.       Using the plaintiff's corporate bird logo           on its

  visiting cards, pamphlets, brochures, etc. thereby giving a false

  impression that the defendant is an off shoot/extension/part of the

  Liberty Group.
</p>
<p id="p_16">  c. Trading, marketing and sourcing footwear and other

  accessories related to school products through the defendant

  Company &amp; claiming it to be a "Liberty Group Venture" in its

  advertising materials.
</p>
<p id="p_17">  d.       Incorporated the LIBERTY mark LIBERTY written in

  red colour in the identical font in the impugned trade name



  logo             thereby attempting to draw an association between

  the Liberty Group and the defendant;
</p>
<p id="p_18"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                     Page 9 of 56</span>
   e. Using the plaintiff's registered trade mark 'LIBERTY'

  individually on packaging of several products such as bags,

  uniform, etc.

  f.       Apart from falsely advertising, the defendant Company


  has also been using the logo            for its footwear products,

  in order to mislead the public to believe that the defendant

  Company's footwear products are in fact the footwear products of

  the Liberty Group.
</p>
<p id="p_19">  11.      It is the case of the plaintiff that ever since the

  commencement of the unauthorised use of plaintiffs trade marks

  'LIBERTY' (and its variations) by the defendant Company in

  2010, plaintiff has taken measures to get the defendant Company

  to cease the illegal and infringing use and has communicated the

  same to the defendant Company time and again. Vivek Bansal

  being a family member, the plaintiff firm has tried to amicably

  settle the issue with the defendant Company, however the same

  have failed on every occasion. It is also averred that left with no

  other means to amicably settle the matter, plaintiff issued a Legal

  Notice dated December 08, 2018 calling upon the defendant to

  immediately cease and desist the unauthorised / unlicensed use of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                     Page 10 of 56</span>
   the plaintiffs trade mark LIBERTY and its variations and in the

  alternative gave a final opportunity to the defendant Company to

  amicably settle the dispute by March 31, 2019. The defendant

  Company sent a reply to the said legal notice vide letter dated

  December 26, 2018 seeking to enter into an arrangement with the

  plaintiff thereby agreeing to pay royalty subject to the condition

  that the terms of such arrangements be similar to those imposed

  on other related parties / family member entities. It is also stated

  that Vivek Bansal thereafter, approached the plaintiff in

  February, 2019, to amicably settle the dispute and requested time

  until March 31, 2019, extendable to August 31, 2019, to induct /

  transfer the business of the defendant Company with / to LSL and

  assured to cease and desist the use of the plaintiff's trade mark

  through the defendant concern.
</p>
<p id="p_20">  12.      It is the case of the plaintiff that the unauthorised use of

  the impugned trade name and identical logos is completely

  detrimental to the distinctive character of the plaintiff's well-

  known mark 'LIBERTY' and will have a negative impact on the

  distinctiveness of the goods and services as provided by the

  plaintiff. It is also stated that the use of the impugned trade name

  and identical logos in any manner clearly results in violation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 11 of 56</span>
   the vested rights of the plaintiff. It is also stated that the

  confusion would definitely be caused as the plaintiffs and

  defendant Company's fields of activities overlap.

</p><p id="p_21">  13.      It is stated that the defendant Company is using identical



  logos            and           as that of the plaintiff. The same is

  being done with a specific intent of illegally usurping the

  plaintiff's rights in the well-known trademark 'LIBERTY'.

</p><p id="p_22">  14.      A written statement to the plaint has been filed by the

  defendant Company, wherein it has raised a plea that the suit be

  dismissed for want of authority of the person signing the plaint.

  According to the defendant Company, the suit has been initiated

  through Adarsh Gupta, who claims to be the authorized signatory

  of the plaintiff firm.     But there is no averment in the plaint

  explaining as to how and in what manner Adarsh Gupta has been

  authorized to institute the present proceedings on behalf of the

  plaintiff firm. In fact, it is the case of defendant Company, that

  immediately after receiving the notice dated December 08, 2018,

  purportedly issued on behalf of plaintiff's firm, challenged the

  authority of Adarsh Gupta for taking the said action, vide email

  dated December 10, 2018. In response, a reply dated December

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 12 of 56</span>
   13, 2018 was received by the defendant Company stating that

  Adarsh Gupta was authorised through a Power of Attorney issued

  in December 2004. It is stated in the written statement, that a

  bare perusal of Power of Attorney would reveal that the said

  Power of Attorney was executed for a specific purpose of filing

  some proceedings on behalf of the partners of the firm before this

  Court in the year 2004. The proceedings so initiated in the year

  2004 was the suit filed by LFC, LGMD, LE and LSL against

  Kanishk Gupta and his sole proprietorship concern namely

  Liberty Trends. In other words, the Power of Attorney executed

  in December 2004 is limited to the said suit. Therefore, the

  present proceedings having not been initiated through a legally

  constituted / authorized person on behalf of the plaintiff firm, are

  liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_23">  15.      A plea of non-joinder of necessary and / or proper parties

  is also taken. In this regard, it is stated that the LFC, LE, LGMD

  were engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling

  footwear / footwear components during different periods till

  2003. The said three entities, all partnership firms, having

  common partners obtained registration of different trade marks

  for footwear and in the year 2003 appointed LSL as their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 13 of 56</span>
   exclusive licensee for the footwear business. In the plaint Adarsh

  Gupta has made generic allegations of infringement of trade

  marks belonging to all the above entities, against defendant

  Company presumably on the basis of Assignment Deeds

  executed in the year 2003. Despite execution of Assignment

  deeds, LFC has not been recorded as registered /subsequent user

  of all the trade marks. It is stated that LIBERTY (word per se) is

  still registered in the name of LE for Footwear falling in class 25.

  Therefore, LFC cannot claim to be the owner of the trade mark

  LIBERTY (word per se). Similarly, LSL the exclusive licensee of

  LFC, LE and LGMD, who has been dealing with the defendant

  Company since more than a decade is a necessary party to the

  present proceedings. All the three partnership firms namely LFC,

  LE and LGMD receive license fee from LSL and hence cannot

  claim ignorance of existence of defendant Company, its business

  activities, which are carried from the same premises as that of

  LFC, LE, LGMD and LSL.
</p>
<p id="p_24">  16.      It is also stated that the plaintiff has also not approached

  this Court with clean hands and has suppressed the material

  information from this Court.           In this regard, it is stated that

  Adarsh Gupta purportedly acting in the name of the plaintiff firm
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                          Page 14 of 56</span>
   has made averments, which are factually incorrect and

  misleading. Defendant Company was incorporated in the year

  2008 and primarily deals in school uniforms including shoes and

  school bags. Defendant Company does not manufacture shoes at

  all and the entire stock of shoes to be used in its business by the

  defendant company, is purchased by it from LSL, which is the

  exclusive licensee of LFC, LGMD and LE since the year 2003.

  The transactions between the defendant Company and LSL

  started since the incorporation of defendant Company, or

  thereabout, and are continuing till date. Adarsh Gupta was one of

  the shareholders and Executive Director of LSL till the year 2015

  and hence was fully aware of the existence of defendant

  Company as well as its business. It is also stated that even prior

  to incorporation and commencement of business by the defendant

  Company, Adarsh Gupta, vide his email dated January 12, 2008

  addressed to Vivek Bansal of the defendant Company, approved

  idea of defendant Company exploring and promoting the business

  opportunity of "One Shop School Shop". It is the case of the

  defendant that Adarsh Gupta, in his aforesaid email, even

  suggested a name for defendant Company i.e. Liberty Dream 18

  Pvt. Ltd., which necessarily included the trade mark 'LIBERTY'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                     Page 15 of 56</span>
   as integral part of it. Therefore, there was no objection of any

  kind in use of the mark 'LIBERTY' as trade name of the

  defendant Company. It is conceded by the defendant Company

  that the name suggested by Adarsh Gupta could not be adopted

  due to some technical reason. Defendant Company was

  incorporated with the name Liberty Innovative Outfits Ltd.

  ('LIOL', for short) Furthermore, Adarsh Gupta has deliberately

  placed on record, copies of some old packing material / catalogue

  / visiting cards, which were printed at or about the time of

  commencement of business of defendant Company's in the year

  2008-09. The said packing material / catalogue / visiting cards



  contained one of the trade mark of LFC                which was

  discontinued by the defendant Company, more than 10 years ago.

  Defendant Company has not been using any of the trade mark

  belonging to LFC and all assertion and allegations made by

  Adarsh Gupta in the plaint are false to his specific knowledge. In

  so far as use of expression 'LIBERTY' as a part of corporate

  name is concerned, it is stated that the defendant Company was

  incorporated with consent, concurrence and knowledge of all the

  partners of the plaintiff's firm and no objection of any kind was

   ever raised. Ever since its incorporation the defendant Company

  is carrying out its business, using corporate name LIOL. It is also

  stated that defendant Company had applied for obtaining the


  trade mark of the device                 in   the   year   2009,   which

  inadvertently got abandoned in the year 2018. Adarsh Gupta was

  well aware of defendant Company's application but never

  objected to the same, as the said application was filed with his

  concurrence as well. The defendant Company is using only the

  aforesaid trade mark on its packing material, business cards and

  catalogues, none of which contains the trade mark of the plaintiff

  firm. It is also stated that none of the products of defendant

  Company, except shoes which are procured by it from LSL

  alongwith the trademark affixed thereon by LSL, bear trade mark

  of the plaintiff firm. The products of the defendant Company,

  other than footwear, bear the trade mark "Anything Skool",

  which is the proprietary mark registered in the name of defendant

  Company.       Adarsh Gupta has concealed all these facts for

  obtaining interim injunction.

   / directors of the defendant Company, who are also partners of

  plaintiff firm.      Adarsh Gupta who has failed in all his

  independent business ventures leading to sale of his shares in

  LSL, started making illegal demands from the partners of

  plaintiff firm. Having failed in achieving his illegal designs,

  Adarsh Gupta has resorted to filing false and frivolous

  proceedings against defendant Company and another business

  venture of Bansal family namely Liberty Fashion Outfit.

</p><p id="p_26">  18.      A plea of acquiesce / limitation has also been taken,

  inasmuch as the defendant Company had been using the

  corporate name of Liberty Innovative Outfits Ltd. since its

  incorporation in the year 2008 and commencement of business

  thereafter, which fact is well within the knowledge of all the

  partners of the plaintiff firm. Out of all its products sold by

  defendant Company each year, more than 50% sales are

  attributable to shoes/footwear, which are purchased by the

  defendant's Company from LSL, the exclusive licensee of

  plaintiff firm. Hence, all the partners of the plaintiff firm have

  acquiesced in use of the trade mark as well as company name of

  defendant since 2008. Accordingly, the plaintiff firm cannot seek

  injunction for restraining the defendant Company from using the

<p id="p_36">  24.       A written statement has been filed by the defendant to the

  plaint.     Similar objections have been taken in the written

  firm got its trade mark registered as        in Class 25 vide trade

  mark application no. 1995902, which is valid upto July 20, 2020.

  Adarsh Gupta was well aware of defendant firm's trade mark of


  the device           as well as its use on the products of the

  defendant firm in Class 18 as well as Class 25.           He never

  objected to such use, as the above trade mark was registered and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 22 of 56</span>
   being used with his concurrence as well. It is also stated that the

  defendant firm has        also applied afresh for registration of its


  trade mark             as well as                   in Class 18 vide

  trademark application nos. 4173268 and 4173267 both dated May

  10, 2019 respectively.         The defendant firm is using only the

  aforesaid trade mark on its products, packing materials, business

  stationery and catalogues, none of which contains the trade mark

  of the plaintiff as alleged.
</p>
<p id="p_37">  SUBMISSIONS:-
</p>
<p id="p_38">  25.      Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, learned counsel appearing for the

  plaintiff firm has made common submissions to the applications

  in both the suits. According to him, plaintiff firm is the first

  adopter and prior user of trademark 'LIBERTY' since the year

  1954 till date and has been using the 'LIBERTY' brand

  continuously and uninterruptedly. According to him, this fact has

  been admitted by the defendant Company in CS (COMM)

  637/2019 at page 16 of the written statement, which is reply to

  para 4 of the plaint as well as by the defendant Firm in CS

  (COMM) 638/2019 at page 17 of the written statement, which is

  reply to para 4 of the plaint. According to Mr. Rao, LE was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 23 of 56</span>
   established later in 1976, LGMD was established in the year 1984

  and LSL in the year 1989. LSL is the exclusive licensee of the

  'LIBERTY' trade mark.                  Trade mark applications for

  'LIBERTY' and LIBERTY formative marks were applied in the

  name of the plaintiff firm (LFC).              However, the same

  inadvertently lapsed. Some applications were inadvertently filed

  in the name of LE and LGMD and by a consolidation process, LE

  and LGMD applications / registrations were assigned to the prior

  user and owner of 'LIBERTY' i.e LFC, the plaintiff firm herein.

  In substance, it is his plea that LE is not a prior user of trade mark

  'LIBERTY' and only assigned the trade mark filed in its name.

  Execution of assignment in favour of the plaintiff firm is

  admitted and not challenged till date by the defendants and

  similarly, the assignments given effect to by the plaintiff by

  granting exclusive licenses to LSL from 2003 till date have not

  been challenged. In fact, Mr. Rao, by drawing my attention to

  reply to paras 15 and 16 of the plaint in both the written

  statements would urge that this aspect has been admitted by the

  defendants. He relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case

  of <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_1">Century Traders vs. Roshan Lal Duggar</a> AIR 1978 (Del) 250,

  in support of his contention that being a prior user, the rights of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                        Page 24 of 56</span>
   the plaintiff in the trade mark are protected.

</p><p id="p_39">  26.      That apart, it was his submission that the rights in trade

  mark registrations vested with the plaintiff immediately upon

  execution of the assignments and merely non-recordal of

  assignments in favour of the plaintiff does not preclude the

  plaintiff firm from claiming ownership, more so, when such

  application for recordal of assignments are pending with the

  Trade Marks Registry. In support of his submission, he has relied

  upon the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/152682715/" id="a_2">Sun Pharma Industries vs.

  Cipla Ltd</a>., 2009 (108) DRJ 207.
</p>
<p id="p_40">  27.      That apart, on the plea of the defendants that a single

  partner cannot maintain an action on behalf of the partnership

  firm, he has relied upon the following judgments to contend that

  majority cannot be allowed to act against the interest of the firm

  to protect trade mark rights.

</p><p id="p_45">   28.      That apart, it was his submission that the defendants'

  partners / Directors, Vivek Bansal / Raman Bansal admittedly

  earned royalty receipts under two exclusive licenses as partners

  of the plaintiff firm from 2003-13 and 2013 till date. So, they are

  barred from challenging the right of the plaintiff in the trade

  mark.
</p>
<p id="p_46">  29.      He also made a submission that the plea of the defendants

  of delay / acquiescence / limitation is totally misconceived,

  inasmuch as the plaintiff objected to the defendants' unauthorized

  business since commencement. In this regard, he has drawn my

  attention to para 26 of both the plaints, to show the steps taken by

  the plaintiff firm to get the defendants to cease the illegal and

  infringing use of the trade mark and also the efforts made to

  amicably settle the issue. In substance, it was his submission that

  the settlement talks continued till 2019, hence, there is no

  question of delay or acquiescence. He stated that the defendants

  being "At risk users" cannot now claim equities in their favour,

  after having knowledge of the plaintiff's prior use of mark since

  1954. He has relied upon the following judgments in support of

  his contention.

  similar and subsequent mark            does not override the rights of

  the plaintiff, who is the prior user since 1954. In other words,

  passing off action based on prior use is unaffected by registration.

  Counsel appearing for the defendants, in both CS(COMM)

  637/2019 as well as CS(COMM) 638/2019 would submit that the

  following entities are together known as Liberty group:-

</p><pre id="pre_3">  (i)      Liberty Footwear Company (LFC);

  (ii)     Liberty Group Marketing Division (LGMD);

  (iii)    Liberty Enterprise (LE) and;

  (iv)     Liberty Shoes Limited (LSL).

</pre><p id="p_59">  32.      All the above entities, except LSL are registered

  partnership firms and are owned by family members.             Vivek

  Bansal is a Director in defendant Company, LIOL, in

  CS(COMM) 637/2019 as well as plaintiff firm, LE and LGMD.

</p><p id="p_60">  33.      Insofar as Raman Bansal is concerned, he is a partner in

  defendant firm, LFC, in CS(COMM) 638/2019 as well as in

  plaintiff firm, LE and LGMD. Both Vivek Bansal and Raman

  Bansal are the shareholders as well as key managerial personnels

  of LSL. Therefore, defendants are interested parties in all the

  entities and cannot even think of causing any loss to either of the

  entities.   In 2003, the businesses of all four entities were

  consolidated and LFC, LE and LGMD appointed LSL as their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 28 of 56</span>
   exclusive licensee for manufacturing and selling footwear. The

  defendant Company (in CS(COMM) 637/2019), LIOL, was

  formed in 2009 and since is trading in school uniforms, school

  bags, socks, shoes etc., under its registered trademark

  'ANYTHINGSKOOL'. Defendant Company purchased shoes

  from LSL only, which is admittedly the exclusive licensee of

  trademark     'LIBERTY'.         Defendant   Company's     products

  therefore, do not compete with those of plaintiff (LFC).

  According to him, it is a settled law that a registered proprietor

  cannot have monopoly over the entire class of goods. Defendant

  Company, LIOL, do not compete with plaintiff's or LSL's

  products, hence merely because the defendant goods fall in Class

  18 or 25, no infringement can be alleged. He relied upon the

  judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_11">Nandini Deluxe vs.

  Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Ltd</a>., (2018)

  9 SCC 183.
</p>
<p id="p_61">  34.      The trade mark 'LIBERTY INNOVATIVE OUTFITS

  Ltd.' and its trade name are being used by defendant company

  since 2009 and also applied for its registration but the same was

  abandoned inadvertently. Since the financial year 2012-13, its

  transactions are being disclosed in the related party transaction of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 29 of 56</span>
   LSL where Adarsh Gupta was a Director till 2015 and was

  approving all the transactions.        Besides, all the partners of

  plaintiff including Adarsh Gupta were also being paid royalty

  since last ten years for the business being carried out between

  LSL and defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_62">  35.      Similarly, with regard to the defendant firm's LIBERTY

  FASHION OUTFITS in CS(COMM) 638/20189, he stated that


  the defendant firm is the registered owner of its trademark

  since 2009 in Class 25. The defendant firm had also applied for

  the above mark in Class 18 in 2010 but inadvertently, the same

  got abandoned. It deals in leather accessories and shoe care

  products such as socks, laces, belts, leather wallets, stroller bags

  etc. and do not compete with either LSL or the plaintiff firm. He

  stated that the defendant firm does not own any showroom or

  shops and all its products are being sold through LSL, the

  exclusive licensee of plaintiff. He further stated that since the

  financial year 2017-18, its transactions are being disclosed in the

  related party transaction of LSL where Adarsh Gupta is an

  existing shareholder.
</p>
<p id="p_63">  36.      That apart, all the partners of plaintiff firm including

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 30 of 56</span>
   Adarsh Gupta were also being paid royalty from the turnover of

  LSL, which included business being carried out between LSL and

  defendant firm. He makes a similar submission based on the

  judgment in the case of Nandini Deluxe (supra).

</p><p id="p_64">  37.      It was also his submission that plaintiff is not the

  registered proprietor of the trademark 'LIBERTY'.            In this

  regard, he stated that the mark 'LIBERTY' in Class 25 is

  registered in the name of LE.          Therefore, plaintiff is not a

  registered proprietor of the trade mark 'LIBERTY' in terms of

  <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_12">Section 2(1)(v)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 ('<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_13">Trade Marks

  Act</a>', for short) as claimed in the suit.       The plaintiff cannot

  maintain the present suit in view of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_14">Section 28</a> of the Trade

  Marks Act. So, it follows that Mr. Rao's contention that nobody

  can use the word 'LIBERTY' is also liable to be rejected.

  According to Mr. Sethi, as per the document at page 28 filed by

  the plaintiff, which is a document of the Trade Marks Registry

  depicting the name of 'LIBERTY ENTERPRISE' clearly

  establishes that even on that date, LE is the registered proprietor

  of the trademark 'LIBERTY' in Class 25 and registration is valid

  upto 2026. In other words, the registration having been renewed

  in 2016 in favour of LE and not in the name of plaintiff, hence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 31 of 56</span>
   the plaintiff's claim of proprietorship of assignment falls flat on

  that ground alone. Mere filing of renewal application by the

  plaintiff does not make it registered proprietor in terms of <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_15">Section

  2(1)(v)</a> of the Trade Marks Act. In fact, it is his submission that

  all family members are using 'LIBERTY' trade mark as part of

  the trade name since so many years and there has never been any

  dispute in that regard. It is only in the year 2018, for certain mala

  fide reasons Adarsh Gupta had raised dispute. He laid stress on

  the fact that, no Assignment Deed by LE in favour of the plaintiff

  has been filed with the suit or even thereafter.

</p><p id="p_65">  38.      That apart, it was his submission that since admittedly

  there is no recordal of assignments in favour of the plaintiff and

  there are disputes between the partners, the assignments, if any

  cannot be said to be valid after 17 years. In support of his

  submission that recordal of assignment under <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_16">Section 45</a> of the

  Trade Marks Act is mandatory, he has relied upon the judgment

  of this Court in the case of Su-kam Power Systems Ltd. Vs.

  Kunwer Sachdev &amp; Ors., 264 (2019) DLT 326.
</p>
<p id="p_66">  39.      It was his submission, that, in any case, even under

  <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_17">Section 45(3)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, in case of dispute,

  Registrar may refuse to register the assignment unless a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 32 of 56</span>
   competent Court decides such dispute.           That apart, in an

  arbitration between the partners of LE, it was clearly held that all

  the partners as well as their children can use 'LIBERTY'.

</p><p id="p_67">  40.      It was his endeavor to challenge the maintainability of the

  suit on the ground that Adarsh Gupta lacks authority from the

  plaintiff firm to institute the same. In this regard, he has stated

  that the Power of Attorney of the year 2004 was for specific

  purpose and the purpose having been achieved by filing a suit in

  the year 2004, he could not have filed this suit on that basis. That

  apart, he stated that the Power of Attorney has been revoked by

  majority partners of plaintiff firm, LE and LGMD vide separate

  letters dated November 08, 2019 and an undertaking dated

  December 16, 2019 by the partners of the plaintiff who hold 56%

  shares in the plaintiff firm and hence, the suit is liable to be

  dismissed on that ground as well. That apart, it was also his

  submission that under <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_18">Section 12</a> of the Trade Marks Act, any

  differences have to be decided by majority partners. In this case,

  majority partners have withdrawn all the authorities from Adarsh

  Gupta even before filing of these suits. He draws a distinction

  between a partnership firm and a company by stating that the firm

  does not have separate and independent rights from its partners
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 33 of 56</span>
   and Mr. Gupta could not have filed the present suits. In this

  regard, he has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in

  the case of <a href="/doc/1505286/" id="a_19">Malabar Fisheries Company vs. Commissioner of

  Income Tax</a>, 1979 (120) ITR 49 (<a href="/doc/900028/" id="a_20">SC) and Purushottam

  Umedbhai &amp; Co. vs. Manilal &amp; Sons</a>, AIR 1961 SC 325.

</p><p id="p_68">  41.      Mr. Sethi had also submitted that properties of a

  partnership firm including trade mark is owned by all partners

  and can be used by all partners and therefore even if it is

  presumed, though not admitted, that plaintiff firm is the

  proprietor of trade mark 'LIBERTY' then also, the suits are

  legally untenable against one of the partners of the plaintiff firm.

  In this regard, he has relied upon the judgment in the case of

  Sohanlal &amp; Ors. Vs. Amin Chand &amp; Sons &amp; Ors., AIR 1973 SC

  2572, <a href="/doc/854943/" id="a_21">American Dry Fruit Stores vs. ADF Foods Limited</a>, 2006

  (3) Bom CR 837; Kalinga Gudakhu Udyog vs. Konark

  Gudakhu Factory, 1990 (10) PTC 216 (Del).
</p>
<p id="p_69">  42.      Mr. Sethi, during his submissions, has also highlighted

  conduct of Mr. Gupta, inasmuch as Adarsh Gupta was himself

  carrying on business using the name 'LIBERTY' and no royalty

  has been paid by him till date for such use. According to him,

  Adarsh Gupta has initiated action selectively with the sole
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 34 of 56</span>
   intention of personal vendetta. Moreover, Mr. Gupta himself

  suggested the use of 'LIBERTY' in his email dated January 12,

  2008. He also highlighted that these suits have been filed by Mr.

  Gupta after being unsuccessful in making illegal demands such as

  25 years salary from LSL. According to Mr. Sethi, partners held

  meetings to settle all the issues but Adarsh Gupta deliberately did

  not participate in the said meetings, as his unlawful demands

  were not being accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_70">  43.      It was also the case of Mr. Sethi that the suits are barred

  by limitation, inasmuch as the suits have been filed after ten

  years. The plaintiff was aware of the defendant firm and usage of

  its trade mark and business since the year 2009 and also enjoying

  royalty from the business between defendants and LSL. Hence, it

  is a clear case of acquiescence as well. In the end, Mr. Sethi,

  submitted, that, there is no compliance of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC.

  This Court directed the compliance of the said provision within

  two weeks, which period expired on December 04, 2019, whereas

  the petition was served on December 05, 2019. He relied on

  <a href="/doc/187830612/" id="a_22">Ashwani Pan Products Pvt. Ltd. vs. Krishna Traders</a>, 2012

  (128) DRJ 592. Mr. Sethi has also contested the judgments relied

  upon by Mr. Rao in support of his contentions to state that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 35 of 56</span>
   same are not applicable to the facts of this case.

</p><p id="p_71">  44.      Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, the first

  and foremost issue that need to be decided is whether, the suit is

  maintainable or not, due to lack of authority in favour of Adarsh

  Gupta, as was contended by Mr. Sethi.
</p>
<p id="p_72">  45.      Mr. Rao has relied upon a Power of Attorney of

  December, 2004 to contend that Adarsh Gupta has the authority

  whereas Mr. Sethi stated that the said Power of Attorney was

  executed for a specific purpose, that is filing of a suit in the year

  2004, by LFC, LGMD, LE and LSL against Kanishk Gupta and

  its sole proprietorship concern namely Liberty Trends from

  infringing the trade mark of the plaintiffs' therein and in fact a

  suit bearing No. CS (OS)1447/2004, had been filed in this Court.

  Additionally, it was stated that neither the plaintiff firm nor its

  partners have decided to file this suit. I have seen the Power of

  Attorney executed in December 2004.          Prima facie, the said

  document does not appear to have been executed for the purpose

  of filing a case in 2004. It has been executed by partners of the

  plaintiff firm in favour of Adarsh Gupta for doing the following

  acts, deeds, matters of things:-

</blockquote><p id="p_73">  46.      It is seen from the above, it is a General Power of

  Attorney executed by all the partners not confining to filing of

  suit referred above. It is for filing pleadings / documents etc., in

  legal proceedings to be filed on behalf of partners / firm or in

  which they are interested. This suit has been filed in the name of

  the firm, the same could be filed on the strength of the said Power

  of Attorney. In any case, the plea raised by Mr. Sethi is a mixed

  question of fact and law, to be decided after evidence is adduced

  by the parties on a specific issue framed in that regard. The plea

  as raised by Mr. Sethi cannot come in the way of this Court to

  decide these applications under consideration.

</p><p id="p_74">  47.      Now coming to the plea of Mr. Sethi that, the plaintiff is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                         Page 38 of 56</span>
   not the registered proprietor of the trade mark is concerned, this

  plea is primarily for the following reasons:-

  (1)      The mark 'LIBERTY' in Class 25 is registered in the

  name of LE and hence the plaintiff is not a proprietor in terms of

  <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_23">Section 2(1)(v)</a> of the Trade Marks Act for it to maintain a suit in

  view of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_24">Section 28</a> of the Trade Marks Act;
</p>
<p id="p_75">  (2)      The plaintiff's contention that nobody can use the word

  'LIBERTY' is also liable to be rejected as per <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_25">Section 17</a> of the

  Trade Marks Act;
</p>
<p id="p_76">  (3)      All family members are using 'LIBERTY' as trade mark

  for so many years without any dispute raised in that regard;

  (4)      No assignment deed by LE in favour of LFC has been

  filed with the suit or even with bunch of documents filed on

  January 31, 2020. Even otherwise, there are disputes existing

  between the partners, such assignment cannot be said to be valid;

  (5)      Recordal of assignment under <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_26">Section 45</a> of the Trade

  Marks Act is mandatory and in case of dispute, the Registrar has

  been given power under <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_27">Section 45(3)</a> to refuse registration of the

  assignment;
</p>
<p id="p_77">  (6)      In terms of Arbitration Award between the parties of LE,

  it was clearly held that all the partners as well as their children
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                     Page 39 of 56</span>
   can use 'LIBERTY'.
</p>
<p id="p_78">  48.      Insofar as the pleas at (1) to (4) above are concerned, no

  doubt that, the mark 'LIBERTY' is registered in the name of LE

  (Ref: page No. 28 of the documents filed on January 30, 2020),

  but reliance is placed by Mr. Rao on the assignment deed (s)

  executed in favor of the plaintiff by which, the trade marks with

  'LIBERTY' have been assigned in favour of the plaintiff, as is

  stated in para 20 of the plaint (s).     In fact, I find one such

  assignment in favour of the plaintiff is dated March 28, 2003 and

  pursuant to the assignment, a communication dated December 14,

  2003 was sent to the Trade Marks Registry to change the name of

  the proprietor of the mark as 'Liberty Footwear Company'

  (Ref: Page 143 of plaintiff's documents). It is also the case of the

  plaintiff that it has registrations of 'LIBERTY' marks in its

  favour. That apart, it is a fact, that in the year 2004, on the basis

  of Power of Attorney executed by Vivek Bansal and Raman

  Bansal, also the plaintiff firm had filed a suit against Liberty

  Trends, for infringing the same trade marks of the plaintiff firm,

  which are subject matter of the these suits. So, now, Vivek

  Bansal and Raman Bansal as Partners of the defendants cannot

  contend otherwise.

</p><p id="p_80">   49.      Insofar as the plea of Mr. Sethi that mere assignment

  without recordal of assignment by the Trade Marks Registry shall

  not confer any right of the plaintiff to contend infringement, by

  relying on the judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in

  Su-kam Power Systems Ltd. (supra), is concerned, this plea was

  opposed by Mr. Rao by relying on the judgment of another Co-

  ordinate Bench in Sun Pharmaceuticals (supra).

</p><p id="p_81">  50.      I have seen the judgments as relied upon by the counsels

  including the judgment in the case of Ramaiah Life Style Café

  Vs. Eminent Entertainment and Ors., CS (COMM) 1433/2016,

  of which a reference is made in the judgment of Su-kam Power

  Systems Ltd. (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_82">  51.      In Ramaiah Life Style Café (supra), the Court has in

  paras 15, 16, 18, 19, 21 to 24 has stated as under:-

     "15. I, in Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited supra, on
     consideration of the aforesaid judgments held (i) that the
     reasoning which prevailed with the Madras High Court in
     Soundarapandian Match Works supra had not been
     considered in Modi Threads Limited supra and Grandlay
     Electricals (India) Ltd. supra; (ii) however another learned
     Single Judge of this Court in Astrazeneca UK Ltd. Vs.
     Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (2006) 32 PTC
     733 had also taken the same view and held that the rights in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                    Page 41 of 56</span>
      the trade mark come on the basis of assignment deeds and
     the plaintiffs cannot be denied the rights in the trade mark
     which they had got on the basis of the assignment deeds in
     their favour on the ground that in the records of the
     Registrar of Trade Marks, the trade mark was still shown in
     the name of the assignor; (iii) the Supreme Court in
     Collector of Central Excise Ahmedabad Vs. Vikshara
     Trading and Investment (P). Ltd. 2003 (27) PTC 603 though
     not directly concerned with the issue had held that once it
     was not in dispute that there was an assignment, the mere
     fact that the assignment was not registered could not alter
     the position; (iv) that the learned Single Judge of the
     Madras High Court in Soundarapandian Match Works
     supra had not considered the earlier judgment of the
     Division Bench of that Court in T.I. Muhammad Zumoon
     Sahib supra; (v) that registered trade mark is different from
     registered proprietor; (vi) that assignment under <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_28">Section
     2(b)</a> is an assignment in writing by an act of parties
     concerned and does not require registration; (vii) that for
     assignment to be complete, the Registrar is not involved;
</p><p id="p_83">     (viii) that from the language of <a href="/doc/1501590/" id="a_29">Section 45(1)</a> of the Trade
     Marks Act also, the assignee acquires title to the registered
     trade mark on assignment and not by registration; (ix) that
     registration is of title acquired by assignment; (x) that a
     dispute as to assignment can be raised by the assignor or by
     some person claiming prior assignment and not by
     strangers or by persons claiming adversely to the assignor;


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                     Page 42 of 56</span>
</p><p id="p_84">      (xi) that thus the assignee immediately on assignment
     acquires title to the registered trade mark and title to the
     registered trade mark exists in assignee even before
     registration under <a href="/doc/1501590/" id="a_30">Section 45(1)</a>; (xii) that what prevailed
     with the Madras High Court in Soundarapandian Match
     Works supra was the inaction of the plaintiff therein to even
     apply to the Registrar of Trade Marks; (xiii) that however
     the plaintiff in Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited
     supra had applied for registration of the assignment as far
     back as in the year 2000 and there was nothing to show that
     the plaintiff was in any way to blame for the Registrar
     having not decided the application either way; the plaintiff
     could not be made to suffer for the actions of the Registrar;
</p><p id="p_85">     (xiv) that <a href="/doc/1584071/" id="a_31">Section 45(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act prohibiting
     admission into evidence of any assignment till registered
     was in the nature of <a href="/doc/176042882/" id="a_32">Section 35</a> of the Indian Stamp Act,
     1899 prohibiting the Courts from admitting into evidence
     documents not duly stamped i.e. to ensure registration of
     assignments; (xv) thus the plaintiff, notwithstanding being
     not registered was held entitled to exercise rights as
     registered proprietor of the trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">     16. I have wondered whether the reasoning which prevailed
     with me in Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited supra
     should prevail in the facts of the present case also, where
     the plaintiff inspite of assignment claimed in its favour as
     far back as on 9th December, 2009 and inspite of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                     Page 43 of 56</span>
      knowledge of infringement of the said trade mark by the
     defendants as far back as in 2012, has till date not taken
     any steps for registration of the assignment in its favour.


</p><p id="p_88">     XXX                        XXX                      XXX


</p><p id="p_89">     18. It needs to be considered whether <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_33">Section 45</a> as it now
     stands requires re-consideration of the view taken in Sun
     Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited supra.
</p>
<p id="p_90">
</p><p id="p_91">     19. Sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_34">Section 45</a> of the Trade Marks Act as
     it now stands is new. It makes the assignment ineffective
     against a person acquiring a conflicting interest in or under
     the registered trade mark without the knowledge of
     assignment or transmission. The defendants herein have
     however not acquired any conflicting interest in or under
     the registered trade mark.

</p><p id="p_93">     21. The said changes in <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_35">Section 45</a> however do not call for a
     change in the view taken in Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries
     Limited supra. I may however record that the Division
     Bench of the High Court of Bombay in Parksons
     Cartamundi Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Suresh Kumar Jasraj Burad 2012
     SCC OnLine Bom 438 has held that though prior to the
     amendment      registration    of   assignment   under <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_36">Section
     45</a> could not be said to be a mere formality but is so after
     the amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 44 of 56</span>
</p><p id="p_95">      22. One thing which is however clear as a day light on a
     reading of <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_37">Section 45</a> is that registration of assignment
     under <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_38">Section 45</a> is mandatory. This is evident from the use
     of the word „Shall‟ in <a href="/doc/1501590/" id="a_39">Section 45(1)</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_96">
</p><p id="p_97">     23. Thus it is mandatory for a assignee of a registered trade
     mark to apply in the prescribed manner to the Registrar,
     Trade Marks to register his title thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">     24. Seen in this light what distinguishes the present case
     from Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited supra and the
     judgments relied upon therein is that while in all those cases
     the plaintiff had applied to the Registrar, Trade Marks for
     registration of his title to the trade mark by assignment or
     transmission and non-registration was not attributable to
     any default on the part of the plaintiff therein, the plaintiff
     herein for the last nearly eight years from the date of the
     claimed assignment and for the last nearly five years since
     the admitted knowledge of claimed infringement has not
     even applied to the Registrar of the Trade Marks for
     registering the assignment of trade mark in its favour. The
     possibility of the plaintiff not doing so for reasons not
     spelled out before this Court cannot be ruled out."


</p><p id="p_100">  52.      From the above, it is seen the Court has held; (i) that

  under <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_40">Section 45</a> of the Trade Marks Act, registration of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 45 of 56</span>
   assignment is mandatory; (ii) It is mandatory for an assignee of a

  registered trade mark to apply in the prescribed manner to the

  Registrar of Trade Marks to register his title thereto.

</p><p id="p_101">  53.      It is also seen that the Court had distinguished the case

  from Sun Pharmaceuticals (supra) and the judgments relied

  upon therein, by stating that in all those cases, the plaintiff had

  applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks for registration of his title

  to the trade mark by assignment or transmission and non-

  registration was not attributable to any default on the part of the

  plaintiff therein. The Court also stated that the plaintiff therein

  for nearly eight years from the date of claimed assignment and

  for the last five years since admitted knowledge of claimed

  infringement has not applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks for

  registering the assignment of the trademark in its favour.

</p><p id="p_102">  54.      In the case in hand, in reply to application under Order 39

  Rule 4, the plaintiff in reply to para 4 of the application has stated

  as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_103">     "The plaintiff has further applied to the Registrar of Trade
     Marks for recordal of assignment and consequently, taking
     the Plaintiff on record as the subsequent proprietor. It is
     submitted that any inaction of part of the Trade Marks
     Registry with respect to a few registration, does not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                         Page 46 of 56</span>
      preclude the Plaintiff herein from exercising its rights which
     accrued to the Plaintiff immediately upon the said
     assignment of LIBERTY trademarks in its favour by Liberty
     Enterprises (LE) and Liberty Group Marketing Division
     (LGMD) in the year 2003."
</p>
<p id="p_104">  55.      In rejoinder to the reply to para 4, the defendant has not

  disputed the fact that the plaintiff has applied for recordal of

  assignment (Refer to page 143 of the plaintiff's documents). If

  that be so, the judgment in the case of Ramaiah Life Style

  (supra) is distinguishable, as in that case the plaintiff has not

  filed any application for recordal of assignment. In fact, this

  aspect prevailed with the Court to deny interim injunction. The

  effect thereof is that the ratio of the judgment in Sun

  Pharmaceuticals (supra) was upheld.

<p id="p_105">  56.      Now coming to the judgment in the case of Su-kam

  Power Systems Ltd. (supra), the said judgment is distinguishable

  inasmuch as: (i) therein the Court has held the deed of assignment

  to be void on the ground of breach of fiduciary duty. There is no

  such challenge to the assignment in this case by the defendant;

</p><p id="p_106">  (ii) in any case the application for recordal is made after twelve

  years, after commencement of Insolvency Resolution process,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 47 of 56</span>
   whereas in the case in hand, the plaintiff has in fact made an

  application for recordal of assignment immediately in 2004 itself,

  which is still pending. Any delay on the part of the Trade Marks

  Registry cannot be to the prejudice of the plaintiff firm, who has

  every right to protect its right in the trade marks. The observation

  of the Coordinate Bench in Sun Pharmaceuticals (supra) that,

  "If the interpretation canvassed by defendant herein is to be

  adopted it will amount to allowing a person who is divested by

  assignment of title to registered trade mark to nevertheless

  continue exercising such rights; it would play havoc with

  assignability and trading in trade mark, expressly permitted

  under the Act.       If the person in whom title has vested by

  assignment is held to be not entitled to exercise such rights owing

  to non-registration, the same result will follow besides giving

  premium to third parties", is important and conclusive.

</p><p id="p_107">  57.      Insofar as the plea of Mr. Sethi that trade mark of a

  partnership firm is owned by all the partners is concerned, the

  same is primarily for the following reasons:-

</p><p id="p_108">  (i)      Majority partners have withdrawn all the authorities from

  Adarsh Gupta;
</p>
<p id="p_109">  (ii)     Plaintiff is not a Company but a partnership firm, which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 48 of 56</span>
   does not have separate and independent right from the partners.

  In this regard, he had relied upon the judgments in the cases of;

</p><p id="p_110">  (i) Malabar Fisheries (supra) and Purushottam Umedbhai &amp;

  Co. (supra);
</p>
<p id="p_111">  (iii)    Properties of a partnership firm including trade mark is

  owned by all the partners and can be used by all the partners by

  placing reliance on Sohanlal &amp; Ors. (supra), American Dry

  Fruit Stores (supra), Kalinga Gudakhu Udyog (supra).

</p><p id="p_112">  58.      The plea of Mr. Rao in this respect is that Adarsh Gupta

  being a partner in the plaintiff firm is entitled to institute these

  suits to protect the interest and intellectual property rights of the

  plaintiff firm. He stated that in the past also, Mr. Gupta had filed

  a suit concerning the intellectual property rights of the plaintiff

  firm. This is because as a partner Mr. Gupta has a vital interest in

  the activities of the partnership firm and thus is entitled to

  institute these suits on behalf of the plaintiff firm against the

  defendants, more so, when some of the partners of the plaintiff

  firm are inclined to act in bad faith and in breach of fiduciary

  duties and contrary to the interest of the partnership firm solely

  for their personal gains and in this background, a suit filed by one

  partner, to protect the intellectual property of the firm against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 49 of 56</span>
   another partnership firm, whose partner is the partner of the

  plaintiff firm is maintainable by relying on the judgments in the

  case of Suresh Kumar Sanghi (supra), Novartis (supra),

  Economic Transport Carrier (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_113">  59.      There is no dispute on the proposition of law as laid down

  by the judgments as relied upon by Mr. Sethi, but the relevant

  issue is whether a partner is precluded from initiating action, to

  protect the intellectual property rights of the firm. The answer, in

  view of the judgments relied upon by Mr. Rao is "NO". In

  Suresh Kumar Sanghi (supra), this Court held that the majority

  of the partners are not vested with a power to bind the other

  persons with regard to the matter of vital importance and decision

  with regard to the same must be taken with the consent of all the

  partners. Further, the majority must act in good faith, is another

  important aspect.     The following observation of the Court in

  Suresh Kumar Sanghi (supra), is also of relevance:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "32......
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        No doubt, a partnership being the business of all the
        partners, the powers of management of the
        partnership are co-extensive but the control and
        management of partnership business can be
        exercised by a single partner and need not be by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 50 of 56</span>
         majority....".
</blockquote><p id="p_114">  60.      An identical issue arose in the case of Economic

  Transport Carrier (supra), wherein a suit was filed by one of the

  partners of the plaintiff therein against a firm, for using the name

  and trade name.        The question that arose was whether the

  majority of the partners have the right to withdraw the suit filed

  by one of the partners of the firm without any permission or

  authority of the original partnership firm. This Court, in para 4 of

  the judgment, held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           "4.    In such a situation the decision of the majority of
           the partners cannot be binding on the other partners
           particularly when the suit is for passing off the name of a
           firm or infringement of the trade name as commercial
           activity of every kind is prosecuted through a partnership
           firm. In no circumstances, the majority of the partners
           can be allowed to permit a stranger to use their name or
           trade name as it would amount to offence of passing off.
           Every partner has a vital interest in the activities of a
           partnership firm. Majority cannot trample or impede the
           interests of minority partners."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_115">  61.      I find, Mr. Vivek Bansal and Mr. Raman Bansal, apart

  from being partners in the plaintiff firm, are Director in the

  defendant Company in CS (COMM) 637/2019 and partner in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                      Page 51 of 56</span>
   defendant firm in CS (COMM) 638/2019 respectively. So, by

  opposing the action initiated by the plaintiff firm, through Adarsh

  Gupta, they stand to gain as Director/ partner of defendants.

  The plea is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_116">  62.      Insofar as the pleas of Mr. Sethi of acquiescence and

  limitation are concerned, it is averred by the plaintiff firm that,

  since 2009, the plaintiff firm, has taken measures to get the

  defendants to cease the illegal and infringing use and has

  communicated the same to the defendant time and again.

  Instances have been given in para 26 of the plaint (s) about the

  efforts made on different occasions to come to a common

  understanding / settling the issue. The plaintiff firm also averred

  that the defendants through Vivek Bansal and Raman Bansal had

  discussed settlement, with the plaintiff firm including giving up

  the use of plaintiff trade mark 'LIBERTY'. It is also stated that

  the defendants had sent email, seeking to enter into a settlement

  with the plaintiff, thereby agreeing to pay royalty. Noting the

  averments made, suffice would it be to state that the issue of

  acquiescence / limitation is a mixed question of fact and law,

  which cannot be decided at this stage.         Parties should be

  permitted to prove their case on these aspects by leading
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                     Page 52 of 56</span>
   evidence, on specific issues framed in that regard.

</p><p id="p_117">  63.      During the course of his submissions, Mr. Sethi has,

  highlighted, that conduct of Adarsh Gupta, as mala fide. The

  instances highlighted are:-
</p>
<p id="p_118">  (i)      Adarsh Gupta was himself carrying out a business using

  the name 'LIBERTY' without paying any royalty;

</p><p id="p_119">  (ii)     There are many other companies not owned by LIBERTY

  family, who are using 'LIBERTY' as their trade name as

  'LIBERTY' is a generic term;
</p>
<p id="p_120">  (iii)    Action has been initiated against selected family members

  as a personal vendetta.
</p>
<p id="p_121">  64.      I am afraid, the said submission shall not have any

  bearing on the rights of the plaintiff firm to initiate action for

  infringement of the trademark 'LIBERTY', based on the

  assignments of 2003 and / or in terms of registrations in its

  favour. If any person has any grievance / claim, against Adarsh

  Gupta, in his individual capacity (not as a Partner of the plaintiff

  firm), he is at liberty to agitate the same in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_122">  65.      Insofar as the plea of Mr. Sethi that a registered proprietor

  cannot have a monopoly over the entire class of goods by relying

  on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Nandini Deluxe
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                        Page 53 of 56</span>
   (supra) is concerned, there is no dispute on the proposition of law

  as pleaded by Mr. Sethi, but it is also the case of the plaintiff that

  passing off action based on prior use is unaffected by registration.

  Whether the plaintiff is a prior user; the effect of assignment;

  registrations, if any in favour of the plaintiff shall be considered,

  after evidence is led by the parties, and not at this stage when the

  plaintiff has made out, a prima facie case in its favour.

  Moreover, the defendants have not been able to show, their right

  in the trademark 'LIBERTY' and its variations.

</p><p id="p_123">  66.      That apart, the plea on behalf of the plaintiff firm that

  Vivek Bansal / Raman Bansal have not taken any objection to the

  institution of the suit being CS(OS) 1447/2004, against Kanishk

  Gupta / Liberty Trends seeking permanent injunction from using

  the plaintiff's trademark 'LIBERTY' and various sub-brands of

  the LIBERTY group, which are also the prayers in these suits, is

  appealing.
</p>
<p id="p_124">  67.      I must also, note the submission of Mr. Sethi that Adarsh

  Gupta was a Director of LSL till 2015 and all partners including

  Adarsh Gupta were being paid royalty since last almost 10 years

  for business carried out between LSL and defendants is also

  appealing, but the effect thereof, that too keeping in view the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                        Page 54 of 56</span>
   averments made by the plaintiff, in para 26 of the plaint, has to be

  seen and decided finally in the suit, after the parties lead their

  evidence in support of their respective case.

</p><p id="p_125">  68.      Insofar as the submission of Mr. Sethi that the interim

  order need to be vacated as the plaintiff has not complied with

  Order 39 Rule 3, inasmuch as the plaint was served on the

  defendant on December 05, 2019, and affidavit of compliance

  was filed on December 07, 2019 by relying on the judgment of

  Ashwani Pan Products Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is concerned, no doubt,

  this Court has directed compliance to be made within two weeks,

  which expired on December 04, 2019, which means, the plaint

  was served on the defendant one day after the period expired and

  the affidavit was also filed beyond time, but the delay is not fatal.

  It is not a case, where the complete paper book was not served on

  the defendant as has happened in the judgment relied upon by

  Mr. Sethi. The said judgment is distinguishable on facts. In so

  far as the plea of Mr. Sethi, that in an arbitration between the

  partners of LE it was clearly held that all the partners as well as

  their children can use 'LIBERTY' is concerned, the same is not

  appealing. The plaintiff has no locus to make such a plea. It is

  for the partners of LE to make a claim against the plaintiff, if any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">CS(COMM) 637/2019 and connected matter                       Page 55 of 56</span>
   right exist in their favour.
</p>
<p id="p_126">  69.      In view of my above discussion, this Court is of the view,

  the order dated November 20, 2019 passed in the suits require no

  interference, except as modified vide order dated December 24,

  2019 in CS(COMM) 638/2019. The orders are confirmed till the

  disposal of the suits.
