                drugs. The second Plaintiff is engaged in manufacturing and marketing

                active pharmaceutical ingredients. According to the Plaintiffs, in course of

                business, a company called Milmet Laboratories Private Limited adopted

                the mark HYVISC in the year 1997 in respect of medicinal preparations

                used in the treatment of dry eyes and to accelerate the healing process after

                cataract operations. The aforesaid company applied for registration of the

                above mentioned mark under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_6">Trade Marks Act</a>,1999 (the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">Trade Marks

                Act</a>).         While the application for registration was pending, Milmet

                Laboratories Private Limited merged             with the second Plaintiff herein.

                Consequently, the second Plaintiff became the proprietor of the trademark

                HYVISC. Subsequently, the second Plaintiff assigned the mark to one

                Sholapur Organics Pvt. Ltd. under a deed of assignment dated 01.04.2002.

                Sholapur Organics Pvt. Ltd. assigned the mark              HYVISC to the first

                Plaintiff, Unimed Technologies Ltd., under a deed of assignment dated

                01.07.2007.           In this manner, the first Plaintiff became the exclusive

                proprietor of the mark HYVISC. The mark HYVISC is registered under

                No.751852 in class 5              in respect of &#x27;&#x27;medicinal, pharmaceutical and

                veterinary preparations and substances included in class 5&#x27;&#x27;. While the suit

                was pending, the first Plaintiff assigned various marks, including the mark,

                Hyvisc, to the third Plaintiff. Therefore, the third Plaintiff applied for and

                was impleaded in the suit by order dated 17.08.2021 in Application No.2624

                of 2021.

                ophthalmic preparations under the mark HYVISC were effected between

                the financial years 2008 - 2009 and 2012 - 2013. The Plaintiffs assert that

                on account of extensive publicity, long and continuous use, the trademark

                HYVISC has come to be identified exclusively with the Plaintiffs. The

                Plaintiffs state that they came across the Defendants&#x27; medicinal preparations

                bearing the mark ZYVISC, which is alleged to be phonetically, structurally

                and ocularly almost identical to the Plaintiffs&#x27; registered trademark

                HYVISC. The Plaintiffs further state that their products and those of the

                Defendants are prescribed for treatment of dry eyes and to accelerate the

                healing process after cataract operations. Since both the marks are very

                that deception and confusion are probable and not merely likely.                     The

                Plaintiffs also state that the adoption of the mark ZYVISC by the

                Defendants is deliberate, mala fide and dishonest.



</p><p id="p_6">                                  4. The Defendants state that they manufacture and market several

                medicinal preparations and hold more than 400 patents. One of the brands

                of the Defendants is &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27;. The Defendants further state that they

                proposed changes to the mark &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; upon receipt of the pre-suit notice

                dated 04.12.2013 but no further progress could be made on the said

                proposal because of the failure of the Plaintiffs to respond to such proposal.

                According to the Defendants, they had no knowledge of the Plaintiffs&#x27;

                trademark &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27; at the time of adoption of the mark &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27;. The

                Defendants state that the mark &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; was adopted by taking the prefix

                &#x27;&#x27;ZY&#x27;&#x27; from the house mark of the Defendants, namely, &#x27;&#x27;ZYDUS&#x27;&#x27;.                       As

                regards the suffix &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27;,            it refers to viscoelasticity, which is a

                characteristic of the products. The Defendants state that the suffix &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27;

                is common to the trade in relation to ophthalmic products. In order to

                substantiate the statement, the Defendants rely upon the website of the

                &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27;(Ex.D4). The Defendants further state that their product &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27;

                is used in a sterile syringe with a grip and a sterile single use cannula.

                Since it is a schedule &#x27;H&#x27; drug, it is stated that members of the public will

                not be confused with regard to the origin of the said products.

                Defendants to piggyback             on the Plaintiffs&#x27; reputation. The Defendants

                assert that the Plaintiffs have failed to prove confusion, loss of business or

                reputation.          The Defendants also state that this Court does not have

                jurisdiction because the first and second Plaintiffs have their registered

                offices at Vadodara and the Defendants&#x27; registered offices are at Ahmedabad.

</p><p id="p_17">                                  8.   The Defendants pleaded at paragraph 19 of the written

                statement that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

                Although this Court did not frame an issue on jurisdiction, this aspect

                warrants consideration since it was pleaded. As stated at the outset, the suit

                was filed as a rolled-up action for alleged trademark infringement and

                passing-off. Therefore, <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_8">Section 134</a> of the Trade Marks Act is applicable. In

                terms thereof, the suit may be filed where one or more of the Plaintiffs

                reside or carry on business or personally work for gain. Since the Plaintiffs

                are corporate entities, the only material consideration is whether any of the

                Plaintiffs carry on business at Chennai. The Plaintiffs specified the

                addresses of both the first and second Plaintiff at Chennai. As pointed out by

                the Defendants, this is not the registered office address. The Defendants also

                relied on the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/51545606/" id="a_9">Indian Performing

                Rights Society Ltd. v. Sanjay Dalia</a> (2015) 10 SCC 161 (IPRS) to contend

                that the suit is not maintainable before this Court merely because the branch

                office of the first and second Plaintiff is at Chennai. IPRS is an authority for

                the proposition that <a href="/doc/1631603/" id="a_10">Section 134(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act enables the filing

                of a suit where the plaintiff actually carries on business and is not intended

                to enable the filing of a suit at a place where a branch office is situated

                although the entire cause of action arose where the relevant plaintiff&#x27;s

                principal place of business is situated. In substance and effect, the Supreme

                Court held that the enabling provision should not be abused by filing the

                suit at a place which has a tenuous or flimsy connection with the case. In

                this case, both the first and second Plaintiffs carry on business at Chennai.

                The Defendants have not controverted this statement except by stating that

                the registered office is at Baroda. The Plaintiffs have also asserted that the

                impugned mark is used on products sold commercially at Chennai and have

                exhibited a sales invoice (Ex.P-10) indicating commercial sale at Chennai.

                Although the Defendants pleaded, in their written statement, that the

                Plaintiffs failed to prove commercial sale at Chennai, the invoices filed by

                the Defendants (Ex.D-3) evidence commercial sale at Chennai. Therefore, it

                cannot be said that the Plaintiffs do not carry on business at Chennai.

                Besides, at least a part of the cause of action arose at Chennai. Therefore,

                the preliminary objection of the Defendants on jurisdiction is overruled.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  Issue No. 1 and 2</span>

</p><p id="p_18">                                  9. The first and second issues relate to whether the Defendants&#x27;

                trademark ZYVISC is distinct and distinguishable as a coined word and

                whether the Defendants are infringing the Plaintiffs&#x27; registered trademark

                HYVISC by using a deceptively similar trademark ZYVISC. Since these

                two issues are closely inter-related, they are dealt with jointly.



</p><p id="p_19">                                  10. The first contention of the Plaintiffs was that the trademark

                &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27; was adopted in or about the year 1997. The said mark was

                initially adopted by Sholapur Organics Private Limited on 01.04.2002 and

                thereafter assigned to the first Plaintiff on 01.07.2007. While the suit was

                pending, it was assigned to the third Plaintiff. As the registered proprietor of

                the trademark, the Plaintiffs contended that they are entitled to prevent

                infringement and passing off by the Defendants. The Plaintiffs contended

                that the impugned mark &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; is phonetically, structurally and ocularly

                deceptively similar to the mark &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27;, and that the similarities are such

                that even pharmacists were likely to confuse the products of the Defendants

                with those of the Plaintiffs. On this issue, the Plaintiffs relied upon the

                judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd v.

                Cadila Pharmaceutical Ltd, AIR 2001 SC 1952, wherein the Court referred

                to a judgment of a US court to the effect that even physicians are not

                immune from confusion or mistake.

<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">                                  11. The Plaintiffs further contended that the composition and

                strength of their products vary in comparison to the Defendants&#x27; products

                and that, therefore, considerable harm could be caused to patients who

                mistakenly consume the Defendants&#x27; products instead of the Plaintiffs&#x27;.

                From the evidence on record, it appears that the Plaintiffs&#x27; product

                &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27; contains a 1% (or less) solution of sodium hyaluronate solution

                whereas the Defendants&#x27; product contains a 2% solution of hydroxypropryl

                methylcellulose ophthalmic solution USP. The Plaintiffs next contended

                that the trademark &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27; has acquired secondary meaning through

                long, extensive and continuous use. By relying on the judgment of the

                Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1655935/" id="a_11">Blue Hill Logistics and another v. Ashok

                Leyland</a> [2011 (4) CTC 417 (DB)], the Plaintiffs contended that they are

                entitled to the statutory presumption under <a href="/doc/1646788/" id="a_12">Section 29(3)</a> of the Trade Marks

                Act.

</p><p id="p_23">                                  12. The Plaintiffs also contended that the two marks should be

                examined as a whole and not by breaking-up the mark into its elements. In

                support of this proposition, the Plaintiffs referred to and relied upon the

                judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Ciba Geigy Ltd. and

                another v. Crossland Research Laboratories Ltd (1995 PTC 251), wherein

                this Court held that the two rival marks should be considered as a whole,

                and that the true test is whether there is likelihood of confusion or deception

                in the minds of persons consuming the relevant products upon looking at

                the marks as a whole. In response to the contention of the Defendants that

                the suffix &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27; is common to the pharmaceutical trade, the Plaintiffs

                contended that the Defendants have not adduced any evidence in the form of

                cartons, labels or bills. The Plaintiffs contended that the alleged usage of

                similar marks by third parties does not constitute a valid defence by relying

                on the judgment of the Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/698503/" id="a_13">Hindustan Pencils Limited v.

                J.N. Ghosh and Brothers Private Limited</a> [2007 (34) PTC 49 Del]. For the

                same proposition, the Plaintiffs also relied on the judgment of the Division

                Bench of the Bombay High Court in Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited v.

                Sami Khatib of Mumbai, Indian inhabitant, 2011 SCC Online Bom. 484.

                The Plaintiffs also relied upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in

                vowel &#x27;a&#x27; from &#x27;&#x27;EFACID&#x27;&#x27; and the addition of the suffix &#x27;&#x27;ca&#x27;&#x27; instead does

                not distinguish the defendant&#x27;s mark and that the two marks are deceptively

                similar notwithstanding these minor changes.

<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">                                  13. Likewise, the Plaintiffs relied on the Division Bench judgment

                of this Court in <a href="/doc/1655935/" id="a_15">Blue Hill Logistics and another v. Ashok Leyland</a> 2011 (4)

                CTC 417 (DB), wherein the words &#x27;&#x27;Luxura&#x27;&#x27; and &#x27;&#x27;Luxuria&#x27;&#x27;, were held to be

                variants of the descriptive term &#x27;&#x27;luxury&#x27;&#x27;. Nevertheless, on account of the

                prior registration of the mark &#x27;&#x27;Luxuria&#x27;&#x27;, the plaintiff therein was granted

                relief. The Plaintiffs also relied upon the fact that the mark &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27; has

                been used from the year 1997 and that the subsequent adoption of the mark

                &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; by the Defendants is mala fide and dishonest. Therefore, it was

                contended that the Defendants are liable.

                the unique word &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; by combining two elements, namely, &#x27;&#x27;ZY&#x27;&#x27; and

                &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27;. The prefix &#x27;&#x27;ZY&#x27;&#x27; is drawn from the house name &#x27;&#x27;ZYDUS&#x27;&#x27; and the

                suffix “VISC” from elasto-viscocity, which is a characteristic of the

                products and commonly used in relation to ophthalmic products. In order to

                establish that the suffix         &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27;   is used extensively in the trade, the

                Defendants relied upon an Internet report of the Trademarks Registry and an

                updated report, which are marked as Ex.D4 and Ex.D7, respectively.

                Likewise, the Defendants relied upon an Internet report from the

                Trademarks Registry reflecting marks with the prefix &#x27;&#x27;ZY&#x27;&#x27;, which was

                marked as Ex.D6.               The Defendants also contended that their mark

                &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; was adopted bona fide and honestly and that the said mark is

                both visually and phonetically different from the Plaintiffs&#x27; trademark. By

                relying on the judgment in <a href="/doc/1483216/" id="a_16">M/s.Lakme Ltd. v. M/s.Subhash Trading</a>, 1996

                (64) DLT 251, the Defendants pointed out that the Delhi High Court

                refused to grant relief to the plaintiff in respect of the trademark &#x27;&#x27;Lakme&#x27;&#x27;

                although the defendant sold products under the name &#x27;&#x27;Likeme&#x27;&#x27;.



</p><p id="p_28">                                  15. Upon considering the rival contentions on these issues and

                the evidence on record, it should be noticed at the outset that the evidence

                on record discloses conclusively that the word mark &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27; was first

                registered on 25.07.1997. The said registration is under Class 5 and pertains

                to medicinal, pharmaceutical and veterinary preparations and substances

                included in Class 5. The said registration was valid up to 25.07.2017.

                Although the Defendants contended that the renewed certificate is not on

                record, there is no doubt that the registration was valid as on the date of

                institution of the suit. The question whether the Defendants are liable for

                infringement and passing off should be tested as on the date of institution

                of the suit and, therefore, the non-production of the renewal certificate is

                not relevant. The Plaintiffs have also established the devolution of title by

                duly exhibiting documents evidencing change of proprietorship (Ex.P2).

                Indeed, all the parties involved in the devolution of title have been arrayed

                as Plaintiffs.         Thus, the Plaintiffs have established that they are the

                registered proprietors of the trade mark &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27;.            In addition, the

                Plaintiffs have established prior adoption and use with effect from 1997.



</p><p id="p_29">                                  16. This leads to the question whether the use of the impugned

                mark &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; constitutes infringement of the registered trade mark

                &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27;. The principal defence of the Defendants is that the mark

                &#x27;&#x27;ZYVISC&#x27;&#x27; consists of two elements, namely, &#x27;&#x27;ZY&#x27;&#x27; and &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27;. As regards

                the first element &#x27;&#x27;ZY&#x27;&#x27;, it is stated that the said element is drawn from the

                house mark “Zydus”. With regard to the second element &#x27;&#x27;VISC&#x27;&#x27;, it is stated

                that the said element is common to the trade in ophthalmic products and is

                used widely. In an action for infringement of trademark, dishonest adoption

                is not an essential pre-requisite although it is a material consideration for the

                grant of relief. The real test is whether the impugned mark is identical or

                deceptively similar. Without doubt, the two marks are not identical. As

                regards deceptive similarity, the Defendants contended that the marks are

                distinctive and not phonetically or visually similar. The question whether

                the two rival marks are phonetically or visually similar should be judged

                with the eye, ear and even mind by looking at the marks as a whole. Such

                judgment should be made by putting oneself in the shoes of a consumer of

                average intelligence and imperfect recollection. Before undertaking such

                exercise, it may be relevant to take into account the context in which these

                drugs are prescribed and administered. The admitted position is that both

                of dry eyes. &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC Plus&#x27;&#x27; is used in eye surgeries to prevent damage to

                the cornea and is also used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, and is intended

                to be administered intra-ocularly (i.e. within the eye). As regards “Hyvisc

                Eye Drops”, it appears to be a product which may be applied by the patient

                in a home environment.          On the contrary, Hyvisc Plus appears to be a

                product used in course of eye surgeries, which is administered intra-

                ocularly.         Likewise, the Zyvisc Ophthalmic Solution appears to be a

                lubricant used for dry eyes and is, therefore, likely to be purchased by the

                patient on a prescription and applied in a home environment. Zyvisc PFS,

                like Hyvisc Plus, appears to be a product used in course of eye surgeries.

                Therefore, this product would be prescribed by doctors and administered

                intra-ocularly in        a hospital or ophthalmic clinic. Even in a hospital

                environment, however, it is likely that either the patient or the attender may

                be called upon to procure the medicine albeit under a prescription.

                Therefore, as regards the intra-ocular products, the risk of deception and

                confusion is mitigated but not eliminated, whereas, as regards the patient

                administered eye drops, the risk is higher.

</p><p id="p_31">                                  17. Notwithstanding the nuances discussed above, the two marks

                are phonetically similar. Even visually, there is considerable similarity and

                both products are used in the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. Although

                the likelihood of confusion is reduced when a product is administered in a

                hospital setting, given the phonetic and ocular similarity of the two marks,

                the likelihood of confusion cannot be discounted. Therefore, it has to be

                held that the impugned mark ZYVISC is deceptively similar to the

                Plaintiffs&#x27; registered trade mark &#x27;&#x27;HYVISC&#x27;&#x27;.



</p><p id="p_32">                                  Issue No.3

</p><p id="p_33">                                  18. Issue No.3 relates to whether the Defendants are passing off

                their goods as those of the Plaintiffs.           While an action for trademark

                infringement is founded on the Plaintiffs&#x27; proprietary interest in intangible

                property, an action for passing off is founded on the tort of deceit.

                Consequently, the burden of proof is higher. In this case, the goods are

                substantially similar and the marks are also similar. The evidence on record

                indicates that the Plaintiffs adopted the mark in the year 1997, whereas the

                Defendants adopted the mark much later. The explanation provided by the

                Defendants with regard to the reasons for adoption of the mark ZYVISC

                support the inference that the initial adoption was not mala fide but does not

                constitute a valid defence to the charge of infringement and passing off. In

                any case, the continued use of the mark ZYVISC especially in relation to

                ophthalmic products is likely to cause confusion amongst potential

                consumers of the relevant products. Therefore, the Plaintiffs are entitled to

                injunctive reliefs both in respect of infringement and passing off.



</p><p id="p_34">                                  19. The 4th issue pertains to whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to

                rendition of accounts. In view of the conclusion that the Defendants are

                guilty of infringement and that the continued use of the impugned mark is

                likely to cause deception or confusion,              the Plaintiffs are entitled to a

                preliminary decree for rendition of accounts, including particulars of profits

                earned by the sale of products bearing the infringing mark. On the basis of

                the loser pays principle, the Plaintiffs are also entitled to costs.



</p><p id="p_35">                                  20. In the result, the suit is decreed by granting the reliefs prayed

                for as prayer a, b and d of paragraph 21. In addition, the Plaintiffs are

                entitled to a preliminary decree directing the Defendants to render accounts

                of profits made by selling products bearing the mark ZYVISC.                            The
