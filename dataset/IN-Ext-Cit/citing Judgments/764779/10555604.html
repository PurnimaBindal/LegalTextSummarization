<p id="p_16">4.2   It is alleged that upon physical search of Mr. Sharma
and examination of his baggage, nothing incriminating was
found but during the checking of black coloured trolleybag
carried by Mr. Lokesh Sharma, the business card of the
present Petitioner was found and as per statement of Mr.
Lokesh Sharma, nine brown coloured packets containing

</p>


<p id="p_17">4.3   It is alleged that thereafter Mr. Jignesh Savaliya and
Mr. Lokesh Sharma were arrested and confessed that gold

to prohibit the authorities from arresting the petitioner and
others without following the mandatory provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The present petitioner
and others also sought permission to have an advocate at

by the Officers of the Deputy Commissioner of Customs,
Ahmedabad. Accordingly, prayer was granted by the Court.
It is further alleged that on 2.8.2019, the impugned order of
detentions were passed against the petitioners and the same
is challenged on the following grounds:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            (1)        That the detention order is liable to be
            struck down only on the ground that it does not
            disclose proper application of mind and it is based
            on merely reproduction of various Clauses of
            <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_1">Section 3</a> of the COFEPOSA;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            (2)        That the first ground mentioned is that
            abetting the smuggling goods. The detenue has
            not indulged into any activity of smuggling or on
            the contrary, the allegation would show that long
            back in the year 2014 and 2015, the other
            detenu&#x27;s had financed to transact with gold which
            was never smuggled into India;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            (3)        That the word &quot;grounds of detention&quot; does
            not state as to how he had abetted smuggling of
            goods and all the ingredients of abetment as
            defined under <a href="/doc/1667403/" id="a_2">Section 107</a> of the Indian Penal
            Code were not fulfilled.

        detained for dealing in smuggled goods otherwise
        than by engaging in transporting or concealing or
        keeping smuggled goods in future, is also not
        tenable as it would come into play once the goods
        are smuggled.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        (5)        That there is no allegation that the detenue
        has done any overt act after the goods were
        smuggled because the goods have been seized on
        the Airport, which were not belonging to the
        present Petitioners.

        even in the bail application by the detenue.

and the fact averred from the statement which were
recorded under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_3">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act, which are
admissible in evidence, have been taken into consideration
by the detaining authority and it is legal and valid. It is also
submitted that considering the magnitude of offence of
smuggling of gold in India, it was necessary to pass
detention order in respect of the petitioners to prevent them
from indulging into acitivity of smuggling of gold into India.
While referring to various statement from various persons, it
has been stated that retraction of statement by certain
persons have no bearing on the passing of order, as when
they were produced before the learned Magesterial Court,
they have not stated anything as to any pressure on them
or recording of statement by the authority and by coercion it
was first time raised at the time of filing of bail application
before the Court.       It is also contended that there is no
merits in the averment made by the petitioners and the
present petitions may be dismissed.

of the respondent as well as the detention order, learned Sr.
Counsel has submitted that as per the respondent, the
entire racket has been orchestrated and masterminded by
Shri Rutugna Trivedi and he co­opted Shri Mehul Bhimani,
Shri Jitendra Rokad and Shri Pramodgiri Premgiri Goswami
and Shri Vipul Joshi as Financers. According to him, the
whole case regarding conspirary of smuggling falls to the
ground in view of the subsequent development that Shri
Rajubhai Goswami has been released by the Hon&#x27;ble
Supreme Court and Mr. Mehul Bhimani has been released
by the Delhi High Court. While referring both these
decisions, the learned Sr. Counsel for the petitioners has
submitted that the whole theory of conspiracy of smuggling
does not survive. He has also submitted that the detenu
was not a party to the conspiracy to smuggled gold and they
were other persons which are mentioned in the grounds.
Learned Sr. Counsel has also submitted that the present
petitioner is in no way connected with the so­called
conspiracy and smuggling of gold and there is no nexus
between the earlier transaction with the present one.

to learned Sr. Counsel, unless the gold is seized, it cannot
be confiscated and, therefore, it would not amount to
smuggling.         While referring <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_8">Section 111</a> and <a href="/doc/965107/" id="a_9">113</a> of the

<p id="p_28">9.4       Regarding other sub­clauses of <a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_10">Section 3</a>, he has

amount to abetting of smuggling of the gold. He has also
submitted that even if the gold is purchased by the detenu&#x27;s

the order of detention is passed on 2.8.2019 and there is no
explanation in the grounds of detention regarding the delay,
with     the      result   that   unexplained            delay     vitiates        the

has also submitted that the delay is also not explained in
the said affidavit.

punitive in nature. Learned Sr. Counsel has also submitted
that it is an admitted position that the present detenu Mr.
Lokesh Sharma was in judicial cusotdy when the order of
detention was passed and no cogent reasons are given why
preventive detention was necessary. According to him, the
impugned order is punitive in nature and not preventive
detention as it clearly emerges from the fact that Mr. Lokesh
Sharma and Divya Bhundia have been granted default bail.
He has also submitted that the detention order was passed
at the stage when there was no material with the authority
to file charge­sheet. Therefore, according to him, it is a
colourable exercise of powers and the punitive detention
was resorted to.

communicating             the    result    thereof        to     the      petitioner.
According to learned Sr. Counsel, the delay has vitiated the

Act, Mr. Devang Vyas, learned ASG has vehemently
submitted that these legal provisions are made to see to it
that no illegal activities affect the foreign exchange as well
as economic condition and the security of the State. He has
also     contended        that   any     action   passed     under          the
<a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_56">COFEPOSA Act</a> for detaining any person, particularly as
provided statutorily, is a preventive action and not a

on record as well as entire order of detention and the
affidavit­in­reply and the contents of certain statements
referred to in detention order, Mr. Devang Vyas, learned
ASG has submitted that in present case, the activities of

has been imported clandestinely, no duty is paid and there
is illegality committed by all the persons against whom the
authority has passed detention order. By referring the role
of each person, learned ASG Mr. Vyas has submitted that
individual petitioners have taken part in smuggling of the
gold. Mr. Vyas, learned ASG has also submitted that the
gold is restricted item as per Customs Circular and foreign
trade policy. Mr. Vyas, learned ASG has also submitted that

contended that the preventive detention is only for a
restricted period and there is a conflict between right of
individual as well as right of society at large.

evidence in the form of statement of various persons and
documents either in electronic and/ or Accounting Book

and Mr. Lokesh Sharma were arrested on 4.6.2019 with
gold of almost 25 kg and during the investigation of the said
incident, it was found that the smuggling activities were
going on since 2014­15 and the present petitioners were
party to those activities. Learned ASG has also submitted
that the petitioner Mr. RutugnaTrivedi is the Mastermind
and as per the modus operandi, his wife used to send gold
through carrier into India and the ground staff who have
free access in every part of the Airport, would hand over the
same outside the Airport to another persons, who would
hand it over to Rutugna Trivedi. Learned ASG has also
stated that there is sufficient material on record for the
detaining authority for subjective satisfaction to put the
petitioners in custody i.e. preventive detention. While

<p id="p_83">13.3           Mr. Vyas, learned ASG has also submitted that
there is no need of any criminal action being pending or
initiated for passing the detention order. According to him,
if the action of the person concerned was smuggling or any
activities detrimental to the economy and security of the
State, the authority could pass preventive detention order
as it is not a punitive action.

<p id="p_84">13.3           Mr. Vyas, learned ASG has also submitted that
when there is ample material on record and on that basis
the detaining authority has thought it proper to pass
detention order, in that case the Court may not act as an
Appellate Forum for scrutinizing the detention order.
Learned ASG has also submitted that though judicial review
of the action of the detaining authority is available, but,
while reviewing the action of the authority in passing order
of     subjective         satisfaction    of    the   detaining      authority,

and ground of detention was supplied on 6.8.2019, clearly
within statutory provision as contained in sub­section 3 of
Section 3 of the COFEPOSA. He has also contended that,
thus, there is no delay in supplying the grounds and the
stand taken by the Petitioners is not sustainable.

<p id="p_86">13.5           Regarding Petitioner Rutugna Trivedi and Nitaben
Parmar, Mr. Devang Vyas, learned ASG has submitted that
their conduct is required to be taken into consideration by
this Court as they were arrested on 14.10.2019. He has also
contended that these persons have earlier filed Special Civil
Application before this Court for seeking direction to the
authority that they should not be arrested without following
due process of law as envisaged under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_62"> Criminal Procedure
Code</a> and this Court has directed the authority to permit the
petitioner to appear through their advocate with rider that
advocate should be at a distance wherefrom he can watch/
see but he may not hear what ever has been recorded.
Learned ASG has submitted that after passing of such
order, the authority has sent almost three summons to
Rutugna Trivedi and Nitaben Parmar to remain present for
interrogation but they did not care and, therefore, the
authority had to move this Court for necessary direction to
these persons to appear before the concerned authority.
According to Mr. Devang Vyas, learned ASG only on passing
of such order, Mr. Rutugna Trivedi and Nitaben Parmar

powers are vested with the Customs Officer to record

smuggling gold were settled through emails.

<p id="p_91">13.10 Regarding retraction of statements, Mr. Vyas, learned
ASG has also submitted that during the hearing of the Bail
Application at the trial Court, the Petitioners have raised the
point of retraction of their statement and even then the
learned trial Court had not initially granted bail to the
concerned persons. Mr. Vyas, learned ASG has stated that
even if no criminal action is taken against the concerned
persons, the concerned persons can be detained under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_65">COFEPOSA Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_92">13.11           Mr. Vyas, learned ASG has also contended that
the date of retraction of all the concerned detenu is
11.6.2019 i.e. from the 7 day of the arrest of concerned
persons. He has also contended that for passing detention
order the grounds have already been provided in the
impugned detention order.

<p id="p_93">13.12         While referring the documentary evidences, Mr.
Vyas learned ASG has submitted that commission for
carrying out the work have been paid either by Mr. Rutugna
Trivedi or by Nitaben Parmar to the concerned persons in
cash. While referring to the statement of Mr. Jigensh
Savaliya,      who       has   also   filed       separate     Special        Civil
Application, Shri Vyas, learned ASG has submitted that the

has purchased a residence in posh area.

<p id="p_94">13.13        Mr. DevangVyas, learned ASG has also contended
that the retraction of the statement by the detenu is made
after filing of the Bail Application and there was no
retraction in the beginning. He has also submitted that due
to retraction of the statement by the other detenu, even if it
is believed, then there is further material placed on record
i.e. statement of ground staff as well as staff of travel agent
and the copy of the Note­book and exchange of messages on
Wechat and through email, as well as Panchnama, to
sustain the detention order.

the grounds of detention were supplied to them on

<p id="p_108">15.   Mr. Sanjanwala , learned Sr. Counsel for the petitioner
in the rejoinder to the points raised on behalf of respondent
authority, has vehemently submitted that the basis of the
arguments of Mr. Devang Vyas, learned Assistant Solicitor
General (ASG) appearing for the respondents is to create a
prejudice regarding the quantity of Gold and the amount
involved, which is hardly relevant for the consideration by
the Court while dealing with detention orders. While
referring to the various judgments, which he has relied
upon during his argument earlier, he has submitted that
the procedural sanctity has to be satisfied by the authority
and it is incumbent duty of the detaining authority to
explain the delay occurred in the matter. While inviting the
attention of the Court regarding the ground raised in the
petitions, which were added due to passing of detention
order, and the ground raised therein as well as the reply
filed by the authority, the learned Sr. Counsel has
submitted that points raised by the Petitioner in his
petition, has not been denied specifically by the authority

and, therefore, the sole ground of delay is sufficient to set­
aside the detention order as there is inordinate unexplained
delay of 59 days from the date of detention order and about
4 years from 2013­2014 and there is no explanation given
in the ground of detention nor in affidavit­in­reply.
</p>


<p id="p_109">15.1           Mr. Sanjanwala, learned Sr. Counsel has also
submitted that the decisions relied upon by the Petitioners
have not been referred to in the argument of Mr. Devang
Vyas, learned ASG. He has submitted that in detention
matter it is always found that when the Court have found
that the detenu is entitled to be released on one ground, it
is not necessary to go into the details of the other grounds.
While referring to the judgment of the co­ordinate bench of
Justice S.H.Vora in a similar matter, which was arisen out
of the same facts and circumstances, Mr. Sanjanwala,
learned Senior Counsel has submitted that those judgments
squarely applicable to the present facts and on the ground
of parity, the present petition needs to be allowed by this
Court. Learned Sr. Counsel has also submitted that the
other co­detenu, who have filed the writ petition before the
Delhi High Court, have been released on the same ground of
delay by following the judgment passed by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme
Court in case of Pramodgiri Goswami. Mr. Sanjanwala,
learned Sr,. Counsel has also stated that reliance placed by
Mr. Vyas, learned ASG on the provisions of <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_77">Section 111</a> and
<a href="/doc/965107/" id="a_78">113</a> of the Customs Act is totally misconceived as there is

no any act or omission by the detenu and if it is not so, the
goods will not be liable to be confiscated under <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_79">Section 111</a>
or <a href="/doc/965107/" id="a_80">Section 113</a> of the Customs Act. According to him, there
is no allegation that there were any such trips in which gold
was seized. According to him, unless the gold is seized it
cannot be confiscated and, therefore, it would not amount
to smuggling. While relying upon the decision referred to by
him in his earlier submission, reported in 2008 (227) ELT
330 and 2009 (235) ELT 623, learned Senior Counsel has
submitted that if the goods are not seized, there is no
question of confiscation and there is no question of
application of <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_81">Section 111</a> or <a href="/doc/965107/" id="a_82">Section 113</a> of the Customs
Act and, therefore, it would not fall within the definition of
smuggling as contemplated under <a href="/doc/64279/" id="a_83">Section 2(39)</a> of the
Customs        Act.     Learned      Senior        Counsel    has        further
submitted that the amount of gold and value thereof are
totally immaterial and the grounds stated in the detention
order are not in consonance with the relevant facts. He has
also contended that certain documents have not been
supplied to the detenu and certain documents are illegible,
which are at page Nos. 278, 374, 377, 381 and 429 of
Paper­book and which fact has affected the valuable right of
the Petitioners of making representation. He has also
contended that though this point has been raised in the
Petition, there is no reply in the affidavit­in­reply.

Advisory Board, learned Senior Counsel has stated that
argument of learned ASG is contrary to <a href="/doc/76364996/" id="a_84">Section 10</a> of
COFEPOSA,             which     provides      for   maximum        period         of
detention i.e. one year and there is no flexibility.
</p>
<p id="p_111">15.3           Regarding the submission of Mr. Devang Vyas,
learned ASG that in the detention matter, time is not
relevant, learned Senior Counsel has submitted that the
submission made by Mr. Vyas, learned ASG is contrary to
the order of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in other matters.
Regarding the submission of Mr. Vyas, learned ASG that
retraction is an afterthought, learned Senior Counsel has
submitted that it cannot be believed even with reference to
the grounds of detention as statement was recorded on
11.6.2019 and the same was retracted when the Petitioner
was      produced         before    the      learned   Magistrate.           That
JitendraRokad             was   arrested       on   29.6.2019       and       was
produced before the learned Magistrate on 1.7.2019 and,
therefore, there is no afterthought or delay. While in the
case of Mehul Bhimani, the same thing has happened.
According to him, this fact vitiates the Order of detention as,
as retracted statement of co­detenu cannot be the basis of
the detention order.

<p id="p_112">15.4 Regarding decision relied upon by Mr. DevangVyas,
learned ASG, the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Sanjanwala
has submitted that the same are not on the points and they
are distinguishable on facts. Learned Senior Counsel has
prayed to set­aside the impugned detention Order in

relation to the respective Petitions and Petitioners be
released immediately from the detention.
15.5      Mr. Sanjanwala, learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners has submitted in his rejoinder that it is the duty
of the government counsel to satisfy that there was
satisfactory         material     to      sustain       the   detention         order.
According to him, even if no ground is raised by the detenu,
it is the duty of the government to satisfy the Court
regarding fulfillment of all the procedural aspect in strict
manner. Regarding non­supplying of the grounds under the
detention order, the learned Senior Counsel has submitted
that in the impugned detention order, only facts have been
narrated        but       no    ground        whatsoever      is    assigned           to
substantiate the detention order. He has also stated that in
present petitions, no procedure safeguard is proved by the
authority. He has also contended that the argument of
learned ASG regarding the quantity and price of gold is
made only with a view to prejudice the Court. He has also
contended that the procedural aspects have not been
observed        by        the   detaining        authority     and,       therefore,
detention order is vitiated in this case.
</p><p id="p_113">15.6     Mr. Sanjanwala, learned Senior Counsel has also
submitted that a per <a href="/doc/65589060/" id="a_85">Section 3(3)</a> of the COFEPOSA Act, the
time limit is prescribed and it is constitutional right of the
detenu. Learned Senior Counsel has submitted that right of
representation is a fundamental right and in the present
case, such right has been curtailed and it has major effect

on the sustainability of the detention order. He has also
contended that when the detenu were in jail, it was not
possible for them to get documents. He has also contended
that the argument of the learned ASG is contrary to the
various decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. According
to him, it is for the government to satisfy the Court that all
these procedural safeguards have been strictly followed and
no burden lies on the detenu to prove his non­involvement.
He has also submitted that personal liberty is an important
Constitutional right of the detenu and the fact that other co­
detenu have been released by quashing the detention order
passed on the facts of the present petitions, either by the
Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court or by this Court or by the Delhi
High Court, on the basis of doctrine of Parity, all these
petitions require to be granted. He has repeatedly mention
that there is 59 days delay in passing detention order and
the same is not explained by the respondents and no
submission has been made by the other side regarding the
representation of the petitioners and the same are not
objected to in the affidavit­in­reply. He has also contended
that the grounds raised in the representation are not
considered by the detaining authority or the higher
authority. He has also stated that if there is no seizure of
the gold, then there cannot be any confiscation of such
goods, and therefore, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_86">Sections 111</a> and
<a href="/doc/965107/" id="a_87">113</a> of the Customs Act is not applicable.

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">            &quot;5. We may first deal with the question of unexplained
            delay. In this regard we may notice the following dates:
            On     13.10.2003,       Appellant      was   arrested.      He      was
            discharged on bail on 6.1.2004. Several inquiries were
            conducted both inside and outside India. A report in
            relation to overseas inquiry was received on 12.5.2004. On
            25.6.2004 proposal of detention was sent which was
            approved on 2.12.2004. On 20.12.2004, the authorities of
            the DRI stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not
            under scrutiny. Furthermore, the authorities of the DRI by a
            letter dated 28.02.2005 requested the Bank to defreeze the
            bank accounts of Appellants. The order of detention was
            passed on 5.4.2005.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">            8.    Indisputably, delay to some extent stands explained.
            But, we fail to understand as to why despite the fact that
            the proposal for detention was made on 2.12.2004, the
            order of detention was passed after four months. We must
            also notice that in the meantime on 20.12.2004, the
            authorities of the DRI had clearly stated that transactions
            after 11.10.2003 were not under the scrutiny stating:

        according to the Gurmukhi version the detenu was taken in
        detention under clauses (i) and (ii) of<a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_98"> S. 3(l)</a> of the Act.

        clauses (iii) and (iv) of<a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_100"> S. 3(l)</a> of the Act. The above
        satisfaction does not speak of smuggling of goods or
        abetting the smuggling of goods which are the grounds
        found in the Gurmukhi version of the detention order. There
        is, therefore, considerable force in the contention urged by
        the learned counsel for the appellant that on account of this
        variance the detenu was not able to effectively represent
        his case before the concerned authorities. In fact according
        to him the appellant was confused whether he should
        represent against his detention for smuggling of goods
        and /or abetting the smuggling of goods or for engaging, in
        transporting and concealing smuggled goods and / or
        dealing in smuggled goods. Besides the English version of
        the detention order was only for abetting the smuggling of
        goods. The satisfaction recorded in the Gurmukhi version of
        the grounds for detention is not consistent with the purpose
        for detention found in the detention order. It left the detenu
        confused whether he should represent against the grounds

<p id="p_120">&quot;   The formation of the opinion about detention rests with the
Government or the officer authorised. Their satisfaction is all that
the law speaks of and the Courts are not constituted an appellate
authority. Thus the sufficiency of the grounds cannot be agitated
before the Court. However, the detention of a person with a trial,
merely on the subjective satisfaction of an authority however
high, is a serious matter. It must require the closest scrutiny of
the material on which the decision is formed, leaving no room for
errors or at least avoidable errors. The very reason that the
Courts do not consider the reasonableness of the opinion formed
or the sufficiency of the material on which it is based, indicates
the need for the greatest circumspection on the part of those who
wield this power over others.&quot;

<p id="p_122">&quot; The Courts have by judicial decisions carved out an area,
limited though it be, within which the validity of the subjective
satisfaction can yet be subjected to judicial scrutiny. The basic
postulate on which the Courts have proceeded is that the
subjective satisfaction being a condition precedent for the
exercise of the power conferred on the executive, the Court can
always examine whether the requisite satisfaction is arrived at
by the authority; if it is not, the condition precedent to the
exercise of the power would not be fulfilled and the exercise of
the power would be bad.&quot; The learned Judge continued:

<p id="p_123">&quot; Where the liberty of the subject is involved, it is the bounden
duty of the Court to satisfy itself that all the safeguards provided

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">                &quot;7.        It is well settled in our Constitutional framework that
                the power of directing preventive detention given to the
                appropriate authorities must be exercised in exceptional
                cases as contemplated by the various provisions of the
                different statutes dealing with preventive detention and
                should be used with great deal of circumspection. There
                must be awareness of the facts necessitating preventive
                custody of a person for social defence. If a man is in
                custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being
                released, the power of preventive detention should not be
                exercised. In the instant case when the actual order of
                detention was served upon the detenu, the detenu was in
                jail. There is no indication that this factor or the question
                that the said detenu might be released or that there was
                such       a   possibility   of   his    release,     was      taken      into
                consideration by the detaining authority properly and
                seriously before the service of the order. A bald statement
                is merely an ipso dixit of the officer. If there were cogent
                materials for thinking that the detenu might be released
                then these should have been made apparent. Eternal
                vigilance on the part of the authority charged with both law
                and order and public order is the price which the
                democracy in this country extracts from the public officials

              &quot;27.       In our opinion, there is a real possibility of release of
              a person on bail who is already in custody provided he has
              moved a bail application which is pending. It follows
              logically that if no bail application is pending, then there is
              no likelihood of the person in custody being released on
              bail, and hence the detention order will be illegal. However,
              there can be an exception to this rule, that is, where a co­
              accused whose case stands on the same footing had been
              granted bail. In such cases, the detaining authority can
              reasonably conclude that there is likelihood of the detenu
              being released on bail even though no bail application of
              his is pending, since most courts normally grant bail on this
              ground. However, details of such alleged similar cases

    not taken in the petition at the hearing. The same rule cannot be

    enough for the detenu to say that he is under wrongful detention,
    and the burden lies on the detaining authority to satisfy the Court
    that the detention is not illegal or wrongful and that the petitioner
    is not entitled to the relief claimed. This Court on more occasions
    than one has dealt with the question and it is now well settled
    that it is incumbent on the State to satisfy the Court that the

              detention     being   one     of   the   two   exceptions       to    the
              constitutional protection under <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_142">Article 22</a> against arrest
              and detention, certain procedural safeguards are provided
              in respect of exercise of the power to direct preventive
              detention.     The     procedural        safeguards       under       the
              Constitution have been interpreted, to require every
              material which is relevant, having a bearing on the
              question as to whether a person should be detained under
              the Act, to be placed before the detaining authority, as the
              decision to detain a person is rendered by a detaining
              authority on his subjective satisfaction as to the existence
              of the grounds for such detention. The sponsoring authority
              should not undertake any exercise of examination and
              interpretation of the available material with a view to place
              the documents selectively before the detaining authority. It
              is not for the sponsoring authority to decide as to which of
              the relevant documents should be placed before the
              detaining authority, or which of the documents are likely to
              help, or not help, the prospective detenu. Consequently, the
              sponsoring     authority      cannot     exclude    any      particular
              document from the material to be placed before the

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">      &quot;7.     It has to be noted that whether prayer for bail would be

      and fast rule can be applied. The only requirement is that the
      detaining authority should be aware that the detenu is already in
      custody and is likely to be released on bail. The conclusion that
      the detenu may be released on bail cannot be ipsi­dixit of the
      detaining authority. On the basis of materials before him, the
      detaining authority came to the conclusion that there is likelihood
      of detenu being released on bail. That is his subjective
      satisfaction based on materials. Normally, such satisfaction is
      not to be interfered with. On the facts of the case, the detaining
      authority has indicated as to why he was of the opinion that
      there is likelihood of detenu being released on bail. It has been
      clearly stated that in similar cases orders granting bail are
      passed by various courts. Appellant has not disputed correctness
      of this statement. Strong reliance was placed by learned counsel
      for the appellant on <a href="/doc/1093856/" id="a_153">Rajesh Gulati v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and
      Another</a> [2002 (7) SCC 129]. The factual scenario in that case
      was entirely different. In fact, five bail applications filed had been
      already rejected. In that background this Court observed that it
      was not &quot;normal&quot; case. The High Court was justified in rejecting
      the stand of the appellant&quot;.

             that the Founding Fathers enacted the safeguards in
             <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_158">Article 22</a> in the Constitution so as to limit the power of the
             State to detain a person without trial, which may otherwise
             pass the test of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_159">Article 21</a>, by humanizing the harsh
             authority over individual liberty. Since, preventive detention
             is a form of precautionary State action, intended to prevent
             a person from indulging in a conduct, injurious to the
             society or the security of the State or public order, it has
             been recognised as &quot;a necessary evil&quot; and is tolerated in a
             free society in the larger interest of security of the State
             and maintenance of public order. However, the power
             being drastic, the restrictions placed on a person to
             preventively        detain       must,     consistently       with       the
             effectiveness of detention, be minimal. In a democracy
             governed by the rule of law, the drastic power to detain a
             person without trial for security of the State and/or
             maintenance of public order, must be strictly construed.
             This Court, as the guardian of the Constitution, though not
             the only guardian, has zealously attempted to preserve
             and protect the liberty of a citizen. However, where
             individual liberty comes into conflict with an interest of the
             security of the State or public order, then the liberty of the
             individual must give way to the larger interest of the

placed the same in Part III of the Constitution. While giving to an
individual the most valuable right - personal liberty - and also
providing for its safeguard, the Constitution has perceived
preventive detention as a potential solution to prevent the danger
to the state security. The security of the State being the legitimate
goal, this Court has upheld the power of the Parliament and State
Legislatures to enact laws of preventive detention. The Court has
time and again given the expression &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; its full
significance and asserted how valuable, cherished, sacrosanct
and important the right of liberty given to an individual in the
Constitution was and yet legislative power to enact preventive
detention laws has been upheld in the larger interest of state

released from jail, and if the authority is bona fide satisfied that
such detention is necessary, he can make a valid order of
detention a few days before the person is likely to be released. It

is further observed that &quot;therefore the question as to whether an
order of detention can be passed against a person who is in
detention or in jail, will always have to be determined in the
circumstances of each case. Following the aforesaid decision of
this Court, in the subsequent decision, in the case of <a href="/doc/328748/" id="a_193">N. Meera
Rani v. Government of T.N</a>. (1989) 4 SCC 418, in para 22, this
Court observed and held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">        &quot;....Subsisting custody of the detenu by itself does not
        invalidate an order of his preventive detention and the
        decision must depend on the facts of the particular case;
        preventive detention being necessary to prevent the detenu
        from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the
        State or to the maintenance of public order etc. ordinarily it
        is not needed when the detenu is already in custody; the
        detaining authority must show its awareness to the fact of
        subsisting custody of the detenu and take that factor into
        account while making the order; but, even so, if the
        detaining authority is reasonably satisfied on cogent
        material that there is likelihood of his release and in view
        of his antecedent activities which are proximate in point of
        time he must be detained in order to prevent him from
        indulging in such prejudicial activities, the detention order
        can be validly made even in anticipation to operate on his
        release. This appears to us, to be the correct legal position.&quot;

<p id="p_164">&quot; 49. In the case of Kamarunnissa (supra), this Court concluded
as under:
</p>
<p id="p_165">&quot;(1) A detention order can validly be passed even in the case of a
person who is already in custody. In such a case, it must appear
from the grounds that the authority was aware that the detenu
was already in custody.

<p id="p_166">(2) When such awareness is there then it should further appear
from the grounds that there was enough material necessitating
the detention of the person in custody. This aspect depends upon
various considerations and facts and circumstances of each case.
If there is a possibility of his being released and on being so
released he is likely to indulge in prejudicial activity then that
would be one such compelling necessity to pass the detention
order. The order cannot be quashed on the ground that the proper
course for the authority was to oppose the bail and that if bail is
granted notwithstanding such opposition the same can be
questioned before a higher court.
</p>

<p id="p_167">(3) If the detenu has moved for bail then the application and the
order thereon refusing bail even if not placed before the detaining
authority it does not amount to suppression of relevant material.
The question of non application of mind and satisfaction being
impaired does not arise as long as the detaining authority was
aware of the fact that the detenu was in actual custody.
</p>

<p id="p_168">(4) Accordingly the non­ supply of the copies of bail application or
the order refusing bail to the detenu cannot affect the detenu&#x27;s
right of being afforded a reasonable opportunity guaranteed
under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_194">Article 22(5)</a> when it is clear that the authority has not
relied or referred to the same.
</p>

<p id="p_169">(5) When the detaining authority has merely referred to them in
the narration of events and has not relied upon them, failure to
supply bail application and order refusing bail will not cause any
prejudice to the detenu in making an effective representation.
Only when the detaining authority has not only referred to but
also relied upon them in arriving at the necessary satisfaction
then failure to supply these documents, may, in certain cases

      depending upon the facts and circumstances amount to violation
      of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_195">Article 22(5)</a> of the Constitution of India. Whether in a given
      case the detaining authority has casually or passingly referred to
      these documents or also relied upon them depends upon the facts
      and the grounds, which aspect can be examined by the Court. (6)
      In a case where detenu is released on bail and is at liberty at the
      time of passing the order of detention, then the detaining
      authority has to necessarily rely upon them as that would be a
      vital ground for ordering detention. In such a case the bail
      application and the order granting bail should necessarily be
      placed before the authority and the copies should also be
      supplied to the detenu.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_170">      50. Now applying the law laid down by this Court, referred to
      hereinabove, to the facts of the case on hand and considering the
      ground (para 7) and the various circumstances noted by the
      Detaining Authority, we are satisfied that the detention orders
      cannot be quashed on this ground. It is to be noted that the
      detenus have been granted bail by the Court on the very date the
      orders of detention were quashed by the High Court, i.e., on
      2.8.2019. Therefore, the apprehension in the mind of the
      Detaining Authority that the detenus are likely to be released on
      bail was well founded and fortified. Therefore, the High Court
      has fallen in error in quashing and setting aside the detention
      orders on the ground that there is a clear lapse and failure on the
      part of the Detaining Authority, to examine and consider the
      germane       and   relevant   question     relating    to     the   imminent
      possibility of the detenus being granted bail, while recording its
      subjective satisfaction and passing the detention orders&quot;.

(supra), two Judges Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court

has observed in Para­18, 19, 20, 22 as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_81">     &quot;18. ....Both the parties are at ad­idem that if the detention
     order is based on more than one grounds, independent of each

<blockquote id="blockquote_82">     19.    In order to have proper analysis of the detention order, we
     will have to first understand the meaning that is to be attributed
     to the expression &#x27;grounds&#x27; contained in <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_197">Section 5A</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/989511/" id="a_198">In

     to the expression &#x27;grounds&#x27;: (SCC pp 552­53, para 29)
            &quot;29. We have reproduced the particulars of the grounds of
            detention, in full, earlier in this judgment. Read as a whole
            they appear to be reasonably clear and self­sufficient to
            bring home to the detenue the knowledge of the grounds of
            his detention. The abbreviation F.I.U. occurs four times in
            these grounds, but each time in conjunction with PAK, and
            twice in association with the words &quot;Pak Officers&quot;. The
            collocation of words and the context in which F.I.U occurs
            makes its purport sufficiently intelligible.

        name of the notorious PAK agent and courier (Mian Reham
        resident of Jumbian) through whom he was supplying the
        information about the Indian Army. He was informed about
        the places in Pakistan which he was visiting. He was
        further told that in lieu of the supply of this information he
        had been receiving money from Pakistan. Nothing more
        was required to be intimated to enable him to make an
        effective representation. The facts which were not disclosed
        were not basic facts, and their non­disclosure did not affect
        the petitioner&#x27;s right of making a representation. As recited
        in the communication under cover of which the grounds of
        detention were served on the detenue, those factual details
        were withheld by the detaining authority because in its
        opinion, their disclosure would have been against public
        interest.&quot; (emphasis supplied)

        Khudi Ram&#x27;s case, are required to be communicated to the
        detenu, as soon as may be practicable, with reasonable
        expedition. It follows, that if in a case the so­called
        &quot;grounds of detention&quot; communicated to the detenu lack
        the basic or primary facts on which the conclusions of fact
        stated therein are founded, and this deficiency is not made
        good and communicated to the detenu within the period
        specified in Sec. 3(3) the omission will be fatal to the
        validity   of   the   detention.       If,   however,    the     grounds
        communicated are elaborate and contain all the &quot;basic
        facts&quot; but are not comprehensive enough to cover all the
        details or particulars of the &quot;basic facts&quot;, such particulars,

        facts and circumstances of the particular case. In the

        of such additional particulars, exceeds marginally, the
        maximum fixed by the statute for communication of the

<p id="p_174">&quot; 22. From the above noted judgments, some guidance as to
what constitutes &#x27;grounds&#x27;, forming the basis of detention order,
can be easily discerned. In the first instance, it is to be mentioned
that these grounds are the &#x27;basic facts&#x27; on which conclusions are
founded and these are different from subsidiary facts or further
particulars of these basic facts. From the aforesaid, it is clear that
each &#x27;basic fact&#x27; would constitute a ground and particulars in
support thereof or the details would be subsidiary facts or further
particulars of the said basic facts which will be integral part of
the &#x27;grounds&#x27;. <a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_205">Section 3</a> of the Act does not use the term &#x27;grounds&#x27;.
No other provision in the Act defines &#x27;grounds&#x27;. <a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_206">Section 3(3)</a> deals
with communication of the detention order and states that
&#x27;grounds&#x27; on which the order has                    been made shall be
communicated to the detenue as soon as the order of detention is
passed and fixes the time limit within which such detention order
is to be passed. It is here the expression &#x27;grounds&#x27; is used and it
is for this reason that detailed grounds on which the detention
order     is   passed   are     supplied       to   the    detenue.        Various
circumstances which are given under sub­section (1) of <a href="/doc/169382/" id="a_207">Section 3</a>
of the Act, on the basis of which detention order can be passed,
cannot be treated as &#x27;grounds&#x27;. On the contrary, <a href="/doc/1348769/" id="a_208">State of Gujarat
v. Chamanlal Manjibhai Soni</a>, reported in (1981) 2 SCC 24 case
clarifies that there is only one purpose of the Act, namely,
preventing smuggling and all other grounds, whether there are
one or more would be relatable to the various activities of
smuggling. This shows that different instances would be treated
as different &#x27;grounds&#x27; as they constitute basic facts making them
essentially factual constituents of the &#x27;grounds&#x27; and the further
particulars which are given in respect of those instances are the

      as &#x27;materials on which the order of detention is primarily based&#x27;.

        five days from the date of detention order. The said
        guidelines were fully complied with. Also, it is well­settled
        principle that any executive instruction like the guidelines
        cannot curtail the provisions of any statute or whittled
        down any provision of law.

        validly passed against a person in custody and for that
        purpose, it is necessary that the grounds of detention must
        show that the detaining authority was aware of the fact
        that the detenu was already in custody. The detaining
        authority must be further satisfied that the detenu is likely
        to be released from custody and the nature of activities of
        the detenu indicate that if he is released, he is likely to

<p id="p_176">49.    Upon consideration of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_215">COFEPOSA
Act</a> as well as <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_216">Customs Act</a> and the decisions referred to
above, the following settled legal propositions emerge:
</p>

<p id="p_177">1.      The      Constitution     recognizes       preventive           detention
      though it takes away the liberty of a person without any
      enquiry or trial.
</p>
<p id="p_178">2.    The Court has time and again given the expression
      &quot;personal liberty&quot; it full significance and asserted how
      valuable, cherished, sacrosanct and important the right
      of liberty given to an individual in the Constitution was
      and yet legislative power to enact preventive detention
      laws has been upheld in the larger interest of the State
      Security.
</p>
<p id="p_179">3.    Notwithstanding the many disadvantages of preventive
      detention, particularly in a country like ours where
      right to personal liberty has been placed on very high
      pedestal, the Constitution has adopted preventive
      detention to prevent the greater evil of elements
      imperiling the security, the safety of State and the
      welfare of the Nation.
</p>
<p id="p_180">4.    There is no Constitutional mandate that preventive
      detention cannot exist for an act when such act is not a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_253">                                  Page 84 of 122</span>

     criminal offence and does not provide for punishment.
</p>
<p id="p_181">5.   The law of preventive detention arms the State with
     precautionary action and must be seen as such. Of
     course, the safeguards that the Constitution and
     preventive detention laws provide must be strictly
     insisted upon whenever the Court is called upon to
     examine the legality and validity of an order of
     preventive detention.
</p>
<p id="p_182">6.   The basis of preventive detention is suspicion and its
     justification is necessity.
</p>
<p id="p_183">7.   The     menace     of   smuggling         and   foreign      exchange
     violations has to be curbed.
</p>
<p id="p_184">8.   An act may not be declared as an offence under law but
     still for such an act, which is an illegal activity, the law
     can provide for preventive detentions if such act is
     prejudicial to State Security.
</p>
<p id="p_185">9.   The essential concept of preventive detention is not to
     punish a person for what he has done but to prevent
     him from doing an illegal activity prejudicial to the
     Security of State.
</p>
<p id="p_186">10. Strictly speaking, preventive detention is not regulation,
     it is something much more serious as it takes away the
     liberty of a person but it is accepted as a necessary evil
     to prevent danger to the community.
</p>
<p id="p_187">11. Even solitary incident may be sufficient for forming
     subjective satisfaction of passing detention order.

<p id="p_188">12. Each &#x27;basic fact&#x27; would constitute a ground and
      particulars in support thereof or the details would be
      subsidiary facts or further particulars of the said basic
      facts which will be integral part of the &#x27;grounds&#x27;.
</p>
<p id="p_189">13. It is well settled that the order of detention and for that
      purpose it is necessary that the ground of detention
      must show that the detaining authority was aware of
      the fact that the detenu was already in custody. The
      detaining authority may further satisfy that the detenu
      is to be released from custody under prejudicial
      activities of the detenu indicating that if he is released,
      he is likely to indulge in such prejudicial activities and,
      therefore, it is necessary to detain him in order to
      prevent him from engaging in such activities.
</p>
<p id="p_190">14.    Preventive detention results in negation of personal
      liberty of an individual; it deprives an individual
      freedom and is not seen as compatible with the rule of
      law, yet the Framers of the Constitution placed the
      same in Part III of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_191">15. It is a trite law that all documents which are not
      material are not necessary to be supplied. What is
      necessary to be supplied is the relevant and the
      material documents, but, thus, all relevant documents
      must be supplied so as to enable the detenu to make an
      effective representation which is his fundamental right
      under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_217">Article 22(5)</a> of the Constitution of India. Right to
      make an effective representation is also a statutory

      right.
</p>
<p id="p_192">16. If the activity of any person is person is prejudicial to
      the conservation or augmentation of foreign exchange,
      the authority is empowered to make a detention order
      against such person and the Act does not contemplate
      that such activity should be an offence.
</p>
<p id="p_193">17.    The discharge or acquittal by a criminal Court is not
      necessarily a bar to preventive detention on the same
      facts for &quot;security&quot; purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_194">      But if such discharge or acquittal proceeds on the
      footing that the charge is false or baseless, preventive
      detention on the same condemned facts may be
      vulnerable on the ground that the power has been
      exercised in a malafide or colourable manner.
</p>
<p id="p_195">18. Where the delay is not only adequately explained but is
      found to be the result of recalcitrant and refractory
      conduct of the detenu in evading arrest, there is
      warrant       to   consider   the      &#x27;link&#x27;   not   snapped           but
      strengthened.
</p>
<p id="p_196">19.    Whether prayed for bail would be accepted depends on
      the circumstances of each case and no hard­and­fast
      rule can be applied. The only requirement is that the
      detaining authority should be aware that the detenu is
      already in custody and is likely to be released on bail.
      The conclusion that the detenu may be released on bail
      cannot be an ipse dixit of the detaining authority. On

      the basis of materials before it, the detaining authority
      come to the conclusion that there is likelihood of the
      detenu being released on bail. That is his subjective
      satisfaction       based   on      materials.   Normally,           such
      satisfaction is not to be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_197">20.    It is not the law that whenever there is delay the
      detention order would be vitiated. The law is that the
      delay should not be unexplainable and that the
      explanation offered must appear to the Court to be
      reasonable and acceptable.
</p>
<p id="p_198">21. The right of the detenu to receive the document which
      was taken into consideration by the detaining authority
      while formulating the grounds of detention is well
      recognized; but it is not that non­supply of each and
      every document provides a ground for setting aside the
      detention order.
</p>
<p id="p_199">22. It is for the detenu to establish that the non­supply of
      copies of the documents has impaired the detenu&#x27;s right
      to make an effective and purposeful representation. The
      demand made by the detenu for the document merely
      on the ground that there is a reference in the grounds of
      detention, cannot vitiate the otherwise legal detention
      order. No hard­and­fast rule can be laid down in this
      behalf. What is essential is that the detenu must show
      that the failure to supply the documents had impaired
      his right, however, slight or insignificant it may be.

purpose of preventive detention in certain cases for the
purposes of conservation and augmentation of foreign
exchange and prevention of smuggling activities and for
matters connected therewith. As per the object of the Act, as
there were violations of foreign exchange regulations and
smuggling activities were having an increasingly deleterious
effect on the national economy and thereby a serious
adverse effect on the security of the State, to prevent such
activities and for providing detention of persons concerned
in any manner therewith by preventive detention, the Act
has    been       enacted,   which      has     come    into       force       on
30.12.1974.
</p>
<p id="p_201">51.   The importance of foreign exchange in the development
of a country needs no emphasis. The conservation and
augmentation of foreign exchange continued to be an
important thing. All though, contravention of its provision is
not regarded as a criminal offence yet it is an illegal activity
jeopardizing the very economic fabric of the country. For
violation of Foreign Exchange Regulation, penalty can be
levied and its non­compliance results in civil imprisonment
of the defaulter. But whole intent and idea of the
<a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_219">COFEPOSA Act</a> is to prevent violation of Foreign Exchange
and Regulation of smuggling activities which have serious
and deleterious effect on national economy and security.
</p>
<p id="p_202">52.   One must remember that a person, who violates
foreign exchange Regulation or indulge in smuggling
activities, succeeds in frustrating the development and

growth of the country. His act or omission seriously affects
national economy.
</p>
<p id="p_203">53.   The object of law preventing detention is not punitive
but only preventive. In case of preventive detention, no
offence is to be proved nor is any charge formulated. The
justification        of   such    detention       is   suspicion             and
reasonability and there no criminal conviction which can
only be warranted by legal evidence. At the same time, the
laws of preventive detention are to be strictly construed and
procedure provided must be meticulously complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_204">54.   It is obvious that having regard to the nature of activity
of smuggling, an inference could legitimately be drawn even
from single incident of smuggling, that the person is likely
to be indulged in the smuggling of gold.
</p>
<p id="p_205">55.   The power of prevention detention is a precautionary
power exercised in reasonable anticipation. It may or may
not relate to an offence. It is not a parallel proceeding. It
does not co­relate to prosecution even if it relies on certain
facts on which prosecution is launched or may have been
launched. An order of preventive detention may be made
before or during prosecution. The pendency of prosecution
is no bar to an order of preventive detention. An order of
preventive detention is also no barred to prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_206">56.   The order of preventive detention is based on a
reasonable prognosis of future behavior of a person, based
on his past, in light of his surrounding circumstances.

Nitaben Chunilal Parmar cannot be endorsed. They ought to

have appeared before the concerned authority without any

necessary direction of this Court. The conduct of both these

petitioners is not in consonance with the conduct of law

abiding persons.
</p>
<p id="p_254">66.   It also reveals that the statement recorded by the

authorities of the persons namely Lokesh Sharma, Nitaben

Parmar etc., have retracted from their statement during the

filing of bail application before the trial Court. The main

contention of the Petitioners is that as the persons

concerned have retracted their statement, there was no

material before the authority to pass detention order on the

basis of the statement recorded under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_257">Section 108</a> of the

Customs Act.
</p>
<p id="p_255">67.   Further, it appears from Para­(ix) of the grounds of

detention that searches were carried out at the following

residential and business premises and this exercise was

started from 4.6.2019 till 1.7.2019. It also appears from the

grounds that the detaining authority has relied upon the

statement of the following persons:

</pre><p id="p_268">70. Upon consideration of materials placed on record as

well as the submission of both the sides, it is admitted fact

that Pramodgiri Premgiri Goswami, who was detained under

the provisions of <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_258">COFEPOSA Act</a>, has approached the

Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has

set­aside the detention order on the basis of the fact that

there is no proximate link between events of March, 2013

and March, 2015 and the detention order, which is over

four years later.

<p id="p_269">71. The Division Bench of Delhi High Court, while relying

on the aforesaid decision of Supreme Court in case of

January 2014 and July, 2015 and the impugned order -
</p>
<p id="p_271">which is nearly four years later. It also appears that on the

basis of the aforesaid decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

Court in case of Pramodgiri Premgiri Goswami v. Union of

India and Ors (Supra) and in the case of <a href="/doc/15696323/" id="a_260">Mehulbhai

Rasikbhai Bhimani v. Union of India and Ors (Supra</a>) by

Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court, the coordinate bench of this High

Court has also passed the order of release of detenu

Jitendrakumar Rokad, who is alleged to be financer and

first prejudicial act was recorded in the month of January,

2014 to July, 2015 and the detention order was passed on

2.8.2019, which is after a period of four years. It was also

observed therein that the case of petitioner i.e. Jitendra

Rokad also stands on the same footing and thus the matter

was disposed of as there was no proximity link and there

was inordinate and unexplained delay in passing the

detention order.
</p>


<p id="p_272">71.1           Heavy reliance has been placed on aforesaid two

decisions for grant of same relief on the ground of parity by

the petitioners herein.

<p id="p_273">72.    Regarding application of principle of parity, it is
pertinent to note that in the case of <a href="/doc/142192473/" id="a_261">Premgiri Pramodgiri
Goswami v. Union of India and Others</a> (supra), it appears
that said matter is not similar to present matter as there
was seizure of 731.705 kgs. of gold between March 2013
and March 2015. Whereas in the present case, there was no
past seizure except seizure of gold on 4.6.2019. Thus, there
is difference in facts of both these matters.
</p>

<p id="p_274">72.1           Similarly, in the case of Jitendra Dhanjibhai
Rokad v. Union of India (Supra), the allegations were that he
along with one Mehul Bhimani had financed for smuggling
of gold into India and that too for the period from January
2014 to July 2015, for which the order of detention was
passed on 2nd August 2019. Thus, the role attributed to
Jitendra Rokad is financing the activities of smuggling of
gold and that too for the period from 2014 to 2015. Whereas
in the present case, role alleged against the present
petitioner Rutugna Trivedi is that he is the mastermind,
while Nitaben Parmar is an associate and link between the
carriers and the mastermind, and Mr.Lokesh Sharma is the
person, who has brought gold from Dubai and who has
been arrested on 4.6.2019 on the basis of the information
given by the co­detenu Jignesh Savaliya. Thus, factually
different roles are attributed to the petitioners as compared
to the roles attributed to Jitendra Rokad and Mahul

Bhimani in the aforesaid cases. Accordingly, decision
rendered by this Court on 27.2.2020 in the case of Jitendra
Rokad as well as decision of Division Bench of Honourable
Delhi High Court in the case of Mehul Bhimani are not
applicable in the present case as different roles are
attributed to every individual and there is no question of
application of principle of parity. Of course, the facts and
statements, which are relied on by the detaining authority,
are same, however, considering their participation in the
alleged illegal activity and specific role attributed to the
persons concerned, this Court is of the view that principle of
parity is not applicable in the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_275">73.   Regarding delay in passing detention order after
detaining the detentu is concerned, it is crystal clear that
when     the      detention   order     was      passed   on      2.8.2019,
Mr.Rutugna Trivedi and Ms.Neeta Parmar, the petitioners
herein were not in custody and they were evading the arrest
on one pretext or the other. Whereas Mr.Lokesh Sharma
was arrested on 4.6.2019 under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_262">Customs Act</a>. It also
appears from the material placed on record that the
material is voluminous and there are ten or more persons
involved in the entire racket of smuggling of gold from Dubai
to India. Even if the submission made on behalf of the
petitioners regarding delay in passing the detention order is
believed for the sake of arguments, then delay would come
to 59 days only. Such delay can be assailed by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_334">                               Page 111 of 122</span>

petitioner of Special Civil Application No.23147 of 2019 viz.
Mr.Lokesh Sharma only, as he was arrested but this ground
of delay cannot be made applicable in case of other two
petitioners, as they have evaded their interrogation and
arrest. At the same time, though Mr.Lokesh Sharma can
assail the delay of 59 days in passing the detention order,
the fact remains that Shri Lokesh Sharma, petitioner of
Special Civil Application No.23147 of 2019 was arrested on
4.6.2019 at the SVPI Airport, Ahmedabad, and against
whom detention order was passed on 2.8.2019 and the
same was served to him on 3.8.2019 and the grounds
thereof were served on 6.10.2019 and it was confirmed by
the authority on 25.10.2019. Considering the provisions of
<a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_263">Section 8B</a> and <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_264">8C</a> of the COFEPOSA Act, which are already
referred to herein above, if we consider the date of detention
order being 2.8.2019 and finality of detention order by the
authority on 25.10.2019, the span would come to almost
two months and 23 days. According to sub­section (C) of
<a href="/doc/1045067/" id="a_265">Section 8</a>, the Advisory Board has to decide the matter
within 11 weeks from the detention. Admittedly, in the
matter though he was arrested on 4.6.2019 under the
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_266">Customs Act</a>, he has been arrested under the <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_267">COFEPOSA
Act</a> by passing the impugned order dated 2.8.2019 and,
therefore, the decision taken by the competent authority
confirming the order of detention on 25.10.2019 is well
within statutory period. Moreover, considering the material
placed on record, it appears that investigation was going on

to collect sufficient material for moving the detaining
authority for passing the order of detention, therefore, in the
peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, delay cannot
be considered as a factor to vitiate the detention order.
</p>

<p id="p_276">74. The detaining authority has observed in Para­xl as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">             &quot;Considering the track record, potentiality, propensity and
             the vital evidences/ materials placed before me by the
             Sponsoring Authority, I do not find merit on the grounds
             given in the retraction applications of Shri Lokesh Sharma,
             Shri Jigneshkumar Govindbhai             Savaliya, Shri Mehul

<p id="p_277">74.1 It is revealed from the aforesaid observation by the
detaining authority, it is crystal clear that Ms. Nitaben
Chunilal Parmar, Mr. Jignesh Savaliya and Mr. Lokesh
Sharma       have       retracted   their         statement    recorded           by
Customs Officer under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_268">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act. It
also appears from the detention order that with regard to
present two petitions regarding the so­called retraction of
statement by aforesaid persons, the detaining authority has
referred to the said fact of retraction and also stated that
such retraction is an after­thought.

<p id="p_278">74.2           On perusal of the grounds of detention, it appears
that the detaining authority has taken into consideration
retraction of statement by Shri Lokesh Sharma, Shri
Jignesh Savaliya, Shri Mehul Bhimani, Shri Jitendra Rokad
and Shri Bhundiya Kishor and dealt with it thoroughly and
has reached to the conclusion that retraction of statements
appear to be false, frivolous and afterthought with an intent
to mislead/divert the investigation. At this juncture, it is
pertinent to note that the detaining authority has also relied
upon the statement of one Mr.Vijay Raval alias Vijay, who is
working as Sales Executive in M/s.Akhandjyot Jewel LLP,
which is owned by Mr.Rutugna Trivedi. As stated in his
statement recorded under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_269">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act,
1962 on 13th June 2019, he had met Mr.Jignesh Savaliya at
the function of M/s.Akhandjyot Group; that thereafter as
per the instruction of his boss, Mr.Rutugna Trivedi, he had
gone to meet Mr.Jignesh Savaliya many a times; that one
day at the time of going home from his office situated at
Manek Chawk, Mr.Rutugna Trivedi called him and gave
mobile number 90999 88877 of Mr.Jignesh Savaliya and
asked him to contact Mr.Jignesh Savaliya on his mobile and
collect one parcel from him and hand over said parcel to
Mr.Rutugna Trivedi at his office premises; that Mr.Jignesh
Savaliya came and gave him one backpack; that he took the
backpack and felt that it was very heavy; that he
immediately came to know that it was containing gold bars;

Shri Lokesh Sharma and Shri Jignesh Savaliya, in addition
to    signatures         of     panchas       and      competent          customs

Shri Rutugna Trivedi.

<p id="p_285">75.           So far as ground of delay in considering the
representation of the detenus, i.e. Mr.Rutugna Trivedi and

they had made representation on 16.9.2019 when they were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_357">        C/SCA/22512/2019                                               CAV JUDGMENT</span>




not arrested and have not made themself available for
interrogation,            as    referred         to      herein       above.          Said
representation            came    to      be     rejected     by       order        dated
21.10.2019 by the competent authority, which is at page
179 in the paper book; it also appears that on 16.12.2019,
Mr.Rutugna Trivedi and Ms.Neeta Parmar­petitioners herein
have moved Advisory Board. Now, as stated by the authority
that such representation came to be rejected on 1.1.2020.
At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that when
Mr.Rutugna Trivedi and Ms.Neeta Parmar have made
representation on 16.9.2019, they did not appear before the
authority even after getting protective orders from this
Court. It is also pertinent to note that the authority had to
move this Court for necessary direction to the petitioners
Mr.Rutugna Trivedi and Ms.Neeta Parmar to appear on a
specified date. On such application, this Court has directed
Mr.Rutugna Trivedi as well as his associate Mr.Neeta
Parmar to appear before the authority and, accordingly,
they have appeared on 14.10.2019 and they were arrested.
This     conduct          of   both     these         petitioners       reflect       their
intentions and attitude towards legal order. It also appears
from record that after getting protective order, when they
were summoned thrice by the authority, they have not
appeared and only after written direction by this Court, they
have appeared before concerned authority. Therefore, the
ground of delay in considering representation, as raised by
them      is     not      acceptable        in     the    peculiar         facts       and

circumstances of this case, as they themselves have tried to
see that they are not arrested.
</p>

<p id="p_286">76.   One of the grounds raised by the petitioner is
regarding non­supply of the material documents to them. It
is settled law that it is not the rule that each and every
document to be supplied to the detenu, which has been
referred to by the authority. The documents which are relied
upon by the authority for the grounds of detention and
which are material are required to be supplied to the detenu
and ancillary document may not be supplied by the
detaining authority. In this case, so far as the petitioner
Neetaben Parmar is concerned, the documents in the form
of pen drive and V­chat messages have been seized from her
premises and it was well within her knowledge. So far as
ground raised by other petitioners is concerned, on perusal
of the material on record, it clearly appears that necessary
material documents have been supplied to the petitioners
and, therefore, the dispute raised by the petitioners is not
acceptable.
</p>

<p id="p_287">77.   It is also well settled principle of law that the detaining
authority has power to issue detention order under <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_271">Section
3</a> of the COFEPOSA Act on his subjective satisfaction. It is
trite law that generally the Court cannot sit as an appellate
authority in such cases over the subjective satisfaction of
the detaining authority. However, judicial review of such

exercise of power by the detaining authority on his
subjective satisfaction is available. At this juncture, it is
worthwhile        to     refer   to      the     decision   in    the      case of
<a href="/doc/1253865/" id="a_272">Senthamilselvi v. State of T.N</a>. reported in (2006) SCC
676, which is referred to in the decisions in the case of
<a href="/doc/76845242/" id="a_273">Union of India v. Dimple Happy</a> reported in 2019 SCC
On­line SC 875. In the said decision, satisfaction of the
authority in coming to the conclusion that there is
likelihood of the detenu being released on bail is &quot;subjective
satisfaction&quot; based on the material and normally subjective
satisfaction is not to be interfered with. In the present case
also, the detaining authority has referred to every material
placed before him and has also considered the retracted
statements of the persons concerned and has satisfied
himself to pass the detention order against the petitioners.
Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of this
case, this Court is of the view that no interference is
required to be exercised on the subjective satisfaction of the
detaining authority in passing such detention order.
</p>

<p id="p_288">78.   It is a fact that the Constitution and the Supreme
Court are very zealous of holding personal liberty of an
individual but at the same time, the liberty of an individual
has to be subordinated within reasonable bounds to the
good of the people. Order of detention is clearly a preventive
measure and device to afford protection to the society. It is
also stated that when preventive detention is aimed to

protect the safety and security of everyone, balance has to
be struck between liberty of an individual and the needs of
the society.
</p>

<p id="p_289">79.    Considering the entire material placed on record, it is
crystal clear that the detaining authority has properly
applied his mind while passing individual detention order in
respect of each of the petitioner. It is also crystal clear that
necessary        safeguards   are     followed   by     the       detaining
authority. All the points raised by the petitioner challenging
the detention orders are devoid of merits. There is no legal
infirmity in the detention orders passed against the present
petitioners. This Court is of the considered view that the
impugned detention orders are sustainable in the eyes of
law and does not deserve to be set aside. The petitioners
herein are not entitled to be released from such preventive
detention.

all the three petitions and the same deserves to be
dismissed. Accordingly, all the three petitions are dismissed.
