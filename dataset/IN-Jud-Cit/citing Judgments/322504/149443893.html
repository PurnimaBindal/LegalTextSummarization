Coram: HON&#x27;BLE MR. JUSTICE WASIM SADIQ NARGAL, JUDGE

                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    The present writ petition has been filed on behalf of the petitioners,

who claim to be the aspirants, who have responded to the advertisement for

various examinations to be conducted by the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Services

Selection Board (JKSSB) and the two such examinations are Junior

Engineer (civil), Jal Shakti Department and Sub Inspector (Home

Department) to which all the petitioners have responded to and applied.

The petitioners are seeking direction to respondent No.1 not to conduct the

examination through respondent No.2 (M/s Aptech Limited), blacklisted in

the past, which contract was given to respondent No.2 and as per the

petitioners, the examinations are tentatively scheduled to be conducted

from 05.12.2022 to 20.12.2022. Petitioners further seek a direction to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2                     WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




appoint some other agency, which is not previously blacklisted for

conducting such examinations through Computer Based Test Mode

(CBTM) involving public employment. According to the petitioners, prior

to this, respondent No.1 has previously floated a tender for empanelment of

agency for conduct of its various examinations through Optical Mark

Recognition (OMR) mode exams vide e-NIT No.01 of 2021. In that tender,

one ND Info Systems Private Limited was the successful bidder but

respondent No.1 awarded the contract to one Merit Trac Services Pvt. Ltd.

overlooking the fact that in pre-qualification evaluation for e-NIT No.01 of

2021, the Merit Trac Services Private Ltd. clearly and in unambiguous

terms mentioned itself to be a blacklisted firm. The Merit Track Services

Pvt. Ltd. conducted the examinations of Junior Engineer (Civil) (Jal Shakti

Department) on 20.03.2022 and Sub Inspector (Home Department) on

29.03.2022 and also Finance Account Assistant exam. The malpractice

occurred during the aforesaid examinations and the examination conducted

by the said Merit Trac Services Pvt. Ltd. was compromised as papers were

leaked, as a consequence of which these two examinations among others

were scrapped by respondent No.1. It has been brought to the notice of the

Court that the matter at presently is being investigated by the Central

Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and recently the CBI has filed charge-sheet

in these matters. The further case of the petitioners is that since the contract

was given to a blacklisted agency, this was the precise reason that

malpractices occurred and the matter at presently is being investigated by

the CBI.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3                     WP(C) No.2580/2022</span><p id="p_2">




</p><p id="p_3">2.    It is further pleaded by the petitioners that in spite of the fact that the

aforesaid agency i.e. Merit Trac Services Pvt. Ltd. has indulged in

malpractices and the charge-sheet has been filed by the CBI, yet respondent

No.1 till date has not held them accountable or blacklisted the agency. It

has been contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the

JKSSB has issued e-Tender Notice No.18 of 2022 dated 05.09.2022 by

virtue of which tenders were invited for engagement of agency for conduct

of Computer Based Tests/Examinations (End to End) for J&amp;K SSB for a

period of one year. The petitioners have drawn attention of this Court to

Clause 2.8 of the aforesaid tender notice, which specifically provides as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_4">
2.8          Affidavit- The agency must certify A declaration sworn by
             that----

               1. It is not under a Declaration of representative     of
                  Ineligibility for corrupt or

                  fraudulent practices with any
                  Government         departments/ submitted as Annexure-
                   agencies/ministries or PSU&#x27;s C.
                   and is not blacklisted by any
                   government              departments/
                   agency/Ministries or PSUs.

               2. If    successful,       the   bidding

                   the Scope of Work and provide
                   a dedicated, well qualified team
                   for the purpose.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4                   WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




                 3. All the documents enclosed are
                    True and nothing has been
                    fabricated.




</pre><p id="p_5">3.    It has further been pleaded by the petitioners that the aforesaid e-

tender notice required the bidder to submit a declaration by way of an

Affidavit in the form as Annexure-C. For facility of reference, relevant

portion of Annexure-C: Affidavit is reproduced hereunder:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            &quot;1.We are not under any Declaration of Ineligibility for
            corrupt or fraudulent practices with any Government
            departments/agencies/ ministries or PSU&#x27;s and we are not
            blacklisted by any government departments/agncy/Ministries
            or PSUs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            2.      If successful, we will undertake the assignment in
            accordance with the Scope of Work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            3.      The firm has never been blacklisted in the past by any
            Govt./Private Institution of the country and there is no case
            pending in any Investigating Agency.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            4.      If successful, we will provide a dedicated, well qualified
            team for the purpose.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            5. All the documents enclosed/uploaded in response to the
            above quoted tender are True and nothing has been fabricated.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            6. In the event of the failure of complying with any of the
            above condition, we are liable for initiation of necessary
            legal/criminal proceeding against us along with forfeiture of
            the EMD.&quot;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5                      WP(C) No.2580/2022</span><blockquote id="blockquote_7">




</blockquote><p id="p_6">4.    From a bare perusal of the aforesaid terms and conditions of the

tender notice coupled with declaration in Form-C, it was emphatically clear

that the agency was under an obligation to submit a declaration that it has

never been blacklisted in the past by any Govt./Private Institution of the

country and there is no case pending in any investigation agency.


</p><p id="p_7">5.    The brief case of the petitioners before this Court is that since

respondent No.2 i.e. M/s Aptech Limited did not fulfill in the aforesaid

criteria, respondent No.1 with a view to award contract in favour of the

said agency, issued a corrigendum No.01 dated 14.09.2022 to e-NIT No.18

of 2022 dated 05.09.2022, wherein amongst other conditions, aforesaid

clause in the affidavit was changed with a view to lift the rider for

Respondent No.2 to participate in the tendering process and ultimately

award contract in its favour and to shower undue benefit on respondent

No.2, conditions were tailor-made, so that the contract is awarded to

respondent No.2 and, accordingly, aforesaid corrigendum was issued. The

petitioners in the writ petition have reproduced para-9 of the aforesaid

corrigendum, which specifically reads thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            &quot;9. At Annexure C-Affidavit (page No.38) Condition No.3 is re-casted
            as &quot;The Firm/Agency is not involved in any ongoing investigation by
            any investigating agency related to conduct of CBT exams. Further,
            Firm/Agency is not blacklisted/debarred by any govt. Body/Govt.
            Institution/Board/PSU of the Country as on date.&quot;

</blockquote><p id="p_9">6.    The petitioners have further pleaded that it has been specifically

provided in the aforesaid NIT dated 05.09.2022 in Note 4 of Clause 3 that

any addendum/corrigendum to the e-NIT, if required, shall be uploaded on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6                   WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




the website www.jktenders.gov.in. It is the specific case of the petitioners

that no such corrigendum was issued by respondent No.1 and it was

published only in one newspaper namely, &quot;State Times&quot;, which did not

have wide circulation. The publication of the corrigendum in the aforesaid

newspaper, which did not have wide circulation, clearly proves the conduct

of respondent No.1 that it was determined to give preference to respondent

No.2 right from the beginning.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">7.    The further case of the petitioners is that some of the aspirants came

to know about the corrigendum and they started raising voice against the

corrigendum as a consequence of which, respondent No.1 in a hush-up

manner cancelled the tender and shortly floated a new tender in which the

same condition of the corrigendum was added in place of earlier condition,

which finds mention in NIT No.18 of 2022 with a view to favour their

blue-eyed person i.e. respondent No.1. The specific case of the petitioners

is that respondent No.1 with mala fide intention in an arbitrary manner

changed the terms and condition of the earlier NIT. With a view to favour

respondent No.2 the condition was tailor-made so that respondent No.2 can

participate in the tendering process and ultimately the contract can be

awarded to such respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">8.    It has been specifically pleaded by the petitioners that respondent

No.2 has already been involved in various malpractices and irregularities

and has been blacklisted by the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL).

It has further been contended that respondent No.2 was involved in

malpractices in Rajasthan police constable recruitment exam which was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                          7                        WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




cancelled later on. The further case of the petitioners is that vide order

dated 23.05.2019 issued by the UPPCL, respondent No.2 was blacklisted

for award of contract for a period of three years after it was found that it

has resorted to and facilitated hacking and cheating by candidates in public

examination. Feeling aggrieved of the same, respondent No.2 preferred a

writ petition before the Allahabad High Court to assail the black listing

order passed by the UPPCL dated 23.05.2019. The petitioners have

referred to the judgment passed by a Division Bench of the Allahabad High

Court     dated      07.08.2019     in       Civil    Miscellaneous          Writ      Petition

No.19639/2019 titled <a href="/doc/49472819/" id="a_1">M/s APTECH Lt. v. UP Power Corporation and

another</a>. In paragraph No.4 of the judgment of Allahabad High Court, it has

been observed as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">              &quot;14.     He further submits that from a bare perusal of the F.I.R., it is
              evident that it contained the averment in regard to Aptech Limited being
              the examination conducting agency its failure to ensure that the computer
              systems which were installed at the examination centres, namely,
              J.K.Public School, Lucknow and Mahabir Prasad Degree College did not
              contain any virus/hacking software. Thus, from the F.I.R. it is clear that
              the Aptech Limited had not only failed to ensure that the computer
              systems were properly sanitized and free from hacking etc. but also
              facilitated the accused persons to install AMMY ADMIN software
              which gave access to such systems to the hackers to hack the
              examination papers and to benefit certain of the candidates illegally. The
              report    of   the   S.T.F.U.P.        police   spells   out    the      technical
              shortcoming/anomalies at the end of the petitioner.&quot;

</blockquote><p id="p_15">9.      Learned counsel for the petitioners has also referred to a judgment

passed by the Delhi High Court in WP(C) No.6922/2020 titled <a href="/doc/188357981/" id="a_2">M/s

APTECH LIMITED v. Union of India and another</a> on 11.02.2021

wherein a cost of Rs.10,00,000/- has been imposed upon respondent No.2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  8                   WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




by observing that organizations resorting to or permitting malpractice at an

institutional level should be kept at bay, by bodies conducting public

examination and such conduct ought not to be condoned. Respondent No.2

through the medium of aforesaid writ petition before the Delhi High Court

had challenged disqualification dated 28.08.2020 imposed upon it with a

further direction to allow respondent No.2 to participate in the tendering

process. While dismissing the writ petition of respondent No.2, High Court

of Delhi has observed that the writ petition filed by respondent No.2 was

gross abuse of the process of Court as respondent No.2 (petitioner therein)

has not come to the Court while invoking its discretionary jurisdiction with

clean hands because respondent No.2 has deliberately suppressed from the

Court the judgment of the Allahabad High Court, which has returned a

specific finding about the blameworthy conduct of Respondent No.2,

besides giving false declaration while submitting its bid on a completely

specious premise. Since respondent No.2 did not disclose in its declaration

that it had been blacklisted by UPPCL on 23.05.2019 for a period of three

years and the said blameworthy conduct of respondent No.2 was noticed in

the blacklisting order as well as in the decision of the Allahabad High

Court and respondent No.2 was found guilty of having installed a software

which made it possible for candidates to hack the system and to have

resorted for cheating.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">10.   Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that since

respondent No.2 was conscious of the aforesaid position and sought to

cover its blameworthy conduct and falsity in the declaration given in Form
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   9                    WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




&quot;B&quot;. Accordingly, the writ petition filed by respondent No.2 was dismissed

and a cost of Rs.10,00,000/- was imposed upon it.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">11.   According to the petitioners, when new tender bearing No.19 of

2022 was issued in favour of respondent No.2, the aspirants became

curious of their future and fearing unfair recruitment process, they

approached number of times to respondent No.1 and verbally appraised

about the situation and consequently filed a representation dated

04.11.2022 against respondent No.2 being a blacklisted agency for UP and

further in the State of Assam and Rajastha also respondent No.2 has been

indicted in the process. Further case of the petitioners is that although, two

agencies, namely Aptech Limited and Eduquity Career Technologies Pvt.

Ltd. prequalified for technical presentation and evaluation but the technical

bid was won by Eduquity Career Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and was declared

technically superior agency, who could better handle the online

examination but instead the contract was awarded to respondent No.2, who

has scored better in the financial bid. With a view to fortify their claim, the

petitioners have placed on record the minutes of the meeting showing

technical and financial score of both the bidding agencies, which clearly

proves beyond any shadow of doubt that Eduquity Career Technologies

Pvt. Ltd. has scored better than respondent No.2 in the technical bid.


</p><p id="p_20">12.   It has also been contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners

that owing to the scam done in the OMR based examination where there

was no check on the standard of procedure adopted for conducting

examination by the service provider, respondent No.1issued tender for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   10                       WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




selection of service provider for review/audit of examination process of

computer based test of agency vide e-Tender No.20 of 2022 dated

17.10.2020 and there too, overlooking poor response from agencies,

agency namely Ernst and Young LLP was given tender on 22.11.2022. It

has been further pleaded that Ernst and Young LLPwas fined 100 million

penalty for employees cheating on CPA Ethics Exams and for misleading

investigation. As per the petitioners, respondent No.1 did not learn from its

past mistakes inspite of the fact that their two examinations were scrapped

and matter was referred to the CBI, yet they awarded the contract for

conducting examination for one year to a Agency, which was blacklisted

and tainted and was involved in malpractices. Feeling aggrieved of the

same, the petitioners, who are young aspirants hailing from different parts

of the Union Territory have come to this Court through the medium of

present writ petition and have sought the following reliefs:-

petitioners have also supplied brief synopsis to this Court, which was taken

pointed out irregularities committed by respondent No.2, which are as

this Court with respect to the pre-bid queries of M/s Aptech and also

that the terms and conditions were changed pursuant to the decision of the

that the corrigendum was published not only in State Times but also in The

Hindu, Times of India Delhi Edition, Rising Kashmir and also on the

website. Mr. Rahul Sharma has also taken this Court to the minutes of the

purchase committee held under the chairmanship of the Chairman on

25.10.2022 by virtue of which technical evaluation as per the criteria

specified in the NIT No.19 of 2022 was reflected. Besides, learned counsel

for respondent No.1 has also placed on record the evaluation result of

stage-1 Eligibility of e-NIT No.18 of 2022 dated 05.09.2022 with regard to

engagement of respondent No.2 for conducting computer based tests for

</p><p id="p_30">18.   Mr. Abhinav Sharma, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of

respondent No.2, who is on caveat, along with Mr. Mayank gupta,

Advocate vehemently argued that the turnover of the bidding agency,

which was fixed at the minimum average turnover of INR 2000.00 lac for

the last three financial year i.e. 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 from CBT

examinations at Clause 2.3 was slashed by virtue of fresh tender dated

30.09.2022 to 1000. Lac for the last three financial years with a view to

have maximum competition. Learned Senior counsel has justified that on

the day of the tendering, respondent No.2 was not blacklisted, thus, there

was no legal impediment for respondent No.2 to participate in the tendering
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  14                   WP(C) No.2580/2022</span>




process. He has further submitted that since the condition in the earlier

tender notice was vague in nature and subsequently terminology of the

affidavit was changed with regard to the blacklisting. Because on the date

of tender, respondent No.2 was not blacklisted by any government agency

and thus, respondent No.2 was having every right to participate in the

bidding process. It has further been argued by the learned counsel that

initially respondent No.2 was blacklisted for three years w.e.f. 23.05.2019

to 22.05.2022 and on the date of the fresh tender, respondent NO.2 was not

disqualified and has every right to participate in the same. It has been

further argued that a transparent procedure has been adopted by respondent

No.1 while awarding contract to respondent No.2 and there is no violation

of the terms and conditions of the tender notice. Relying upon a judgment

of the Supreme Court rendered in the case of Kulja Industries Limited v.

Chief General Manager, Western Telecom Project Bharat Sanchar

Nigam Limited and others, (2014) 14 SCC 731, learned Senior Counsel

argues that the blacklisting signifies a business decision by which the party

affected by the breach decides not to enter into any relationship with the

party committing the breach and any such decision is subject to judicial

review when the same is taken by the State or its instrumentalities. He

further submitted that since as on the date of tender, respondent No.2 has

not been blacklisted by the Government and thus, it is not prevented from

entering into lawful relationship with respondent No.1

including Class-IV vacancies as referred to it by various government

departments and has the power/authority to hold examination/interviews

including skill tests wherever required for carrying out the recruitment to

various posts. From the record, which has been produced by respondent

No.1, it is apparent that the SSB is trying to make efforts to improve the

efficacy of recruitment process by infusing technology-based interventions

like CBT mode of examination which is more secure and transparent than

the traditional OMR based tests. From the record, it is apparent that

respondent No.1 has taken a decision on 10.08.2022 for authorizing the

JKSSB to undertake end to end process including setting of question papers

in computer bases test through authorized agency. Pursuant thereto, a

meeting was held under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary in which a

decision was taken that the JKSSB shall conduct all the examinations

through CBT mode only. The CBT mode of examinations reduced human

involvement in the process thereby decreasing the chances of paper leakage

as cumbersome process of printing and transportation of examination

material involved in OMR bases examinations is eliminated.

the image and raised eye brow about the efficacy of the recruitment method

Legal Analysis


</p><p id="p_45">28.   Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is

mala fide or intended to favour someone, also does Arbitrariness exist in

the decision making process: Firstly, This is a rarest of the rare case where

the Jammu and Kashmir Services Selection Board, which is a premier

recruiting agency of the Union Territory of J&amp;K having the mandate of

undertaking recruitment in a fair and transparent manner and its action in

the past leading to cancellation of examination for the post of Sub

Inspectors in Police Department and Junior Engineer in Jal Shakti

Department has seriously dented the image and raised questions about the

efficacy of the recruitment method adopted by the SSB, yet again has

perpetuated its wrong in giving contract to an agency which is

tainted/previously blacklisted for perpetuating fraud in the form of hacking

of question papers.
</p>
<p id="p_46">
</p><p id="p_47">29.   From a perusal of the record, it appears that the SSB in view of the

recent developments, has admitted its fault and accordingly, a conscious

decision was taken for serious audit of the entire recruitment process as

well as the agencies engaged/empanelled for conduct of examination by the

JKSSB, wherein it was observed that the candidate&#x27;s faith was the

paramount importance and a decision was taken that the Board shall

conduct all the examinations through CBT mode only while taking the

decision to float fresh tender for empanelling the most suitable agency for

conducting the examinations.

investigated by the premier agency of the Country i.e. CBI and the challan

has also been produced with regard to the recruitment of Sub Inspectors

again altered/changed the terms and conditions of the NIT with a view to

favour   their   own   blue-eyed     persons   i.e.   respondent      No.2   by

annulling/cancelling the earlier tendering process and initiating fresh

process again by issuing a fresh tender by way of changing the conditions,

which were tailor-made just to give benefit to respondent No.2 so that

respondent No.2 is not ousted from the zone of competing or award of

contract. The SSB has, in a way, altered the terms and conditions of the

NIT by incorporating negative conditions and relaxing the terminology of

the affidavit by incorporating that &quot;The Firm/Agency is not involved in any

ongoing investigation by any investigating agency related to conduct of

CBT exams. Further, Firm/Agency is not blacklisted/debarred by any Govt.

body. Institution/Board/PSU of the country as on date&quot; when in the earlier

tender notice, which was cancelled, the terminology in the affidavit was

Agency&quot;.

<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">31.   Since respondent No.2 was already blacklisted in the past and there

was a case pending with the investigating agency, the aforesaid condition

was relaxed with a view to shower undue benefit on respondent NO.2 and

the conditions were tailor-made so that respondent No.2 is not ousted from

the consideration zone or award of contract.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">32.   The entire action of the SSB by relaxing the aforesaid conditions

smacks foul play and leads to an irresistible conclusion that the SSB was

bent upon to engage a previously blacklisted/tainted agency when already

SSB&#x27;s actions are being investigated/enquired by the CBI for awarding

contract to a tainted agency in the past. By way of aforesaid action, the

fundamental rights of all the participants, which are guaranteed by <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_3">Article

16</a> of the Constitution have been infringed i.e. their right to participate in a

fair and transparent manner selection process has been infringed by the

impugned action on part of SSB by awarding contract in favour of a tainted

agency. It goes without saying that right to participate in a selection

process does not mean a mere minimal participation in a process, but which

is fair and transparent and not loathed with mala fide consideration. No

rational whatsoever is forthcoming from the record supplied to this Court

for withdrawing the earlier NIT and initiating the fresh tendering process

by altering the terms and conditions of the NIT with a view to favour a

tainted/blacklisted agency.

exposed to challenge to the ground of arbitrariness. Thus, Rule of law does

not completely eliminate discretion in the exercise of power, as it is

unrealistic, but provides for control of its exercise by judicial review.


</p><p id="p_60">35.   It goes without saying that mere reasonable or legitimate expectation

of a citizen in such a situation may not by itself be a distinct enforceable

right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the

legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness, a

necessary concomitant of the rule of law.

satisfy this requirement of non- arbitrariness in a State

the past recent developments the SSB will conduct a fair and transparent

recruitment process and the doctrine of legitimate expectation has an

important place in the developing law of judicial review but respondent

awarding contract to a tainted/previously blacklisted agency. The

that would be in violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_10">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The action of

respondent No.1 to cancel the earlier tender notice was worse than the

problem. Altering the terms and conditions of the tender document and the

gone through the record supplied by the SSB minutely and found that no

reasons have been assigned while taking a decision to relax the terms and

conditions of the tender document or issuing fresh NIT. Failure to give

reason amounts to denial of justice. The reasons are live links between the

mind of the decision taker to the controversy in question and the decision

or conclusion arrived at. The reasons substitute subjectivity by objectivity.

One of the salutary requirements of natural justice is to spelling out reasons

for altering the decision.

welfare state is the regulator and dispenser of the special services and

provider of a large number of benefits, including jobs, contracts, licenses,

quotas and mineral rights etc. The discretion of such instrumentality like

the SSB is not unlimited while distributing state largesse in its monetary

discretion or at its sweet will as it does not stand in the same position as a

private individual. Whatever its activity, the Government and its

instrumentalities will be subject to restraints, inherent in its position in a

democratic society. It cannot lay down arbitrary and capricious standards

for the choice of persons with whom alone it will deal, like it has happened

in the present case where the contract has been awarded by the SSB to

respondent No.2.

                    and provide room for manipulation to suit the whims of the State

                    agencies in picking and choosing a bidder for awarding

                    contracts as in the case of distributing bounty or charity. In our

                    relax or waive a rule or a condition exists under the Rules, it

                    has to be done strictly in compliance with the Rules.&quot;

emerges from the record, the terms and conditions of the tender have been

tailor-made to suit respondent No.2, infact this is a reverse process evolved

to achieve that objective by relaxing the tender conditions having negative

impact on a tainted/blacklisted agency in the past with a view that only one

party may fit in the said process. Such an endeavour has been categorized

as &quot;Decision Oriented Systematic Analysis&quot; (DOSA).

</p><p id="p_118">68.   The Apex Court in various authoritative pronouncements has

interpreted the word &quot;blacklisting and its effect insofar as contractual

matters are concerned. Blacklisting has the effect of preventing a person

from the privilege and advantage of entering into lawful relationship with

the Government or its agencies for purposes of gains. The fact that a

disability is created by the order of blacklisting indicates that the relevant

authority is to have an objective satisfaction while grating/awarding

contract.
</p>
<p id="p_119">69.   Merely that respondent No.2 has excelled in financial bid will not be

the sole criteria to award contract, when admittedly in the technical

evaluation the Respondent No.2 was not upto mark. The public interest has

to give way to commercial interest because in the present case it involves

career of so many aspiring candidates, who will compete in the process of

selection and the award of contract in such like cases can, in no way, be

given to an agency, which is tainted and already blacklisted in the past.


</p><p id="p_120">70.   In the present case, a blacklisted agency has been allowed to

compete in the tendering process and the commercial interest has

outweighed the public interest and, thus, the decision taken by respondent

No.1 to award contract in favour of respondent No.2 cannot sustain the test

of law, as there is every likelihood of biasness, favourtism and unfairness

in the said process.

corrigendum and subsequently by way of issuing fresh NIT, is not borne

out from the record nor any reason has been spelt out from the record

supplied to this Court. Respondent No.2 has already been involved in

various malpractices and irregularities and was blacklisted by UPPCL.

Besides, respondent No.2 was also involved in malpractices in Rajasthan

Police constable recruitment, in Irrigation Department of the State of

Assam, Allahabad High Court NTA, UPPCL etc. Even High Court of Delhi

has imposed fine of Rs.10,00,000/- on respondent No.2. While passing the

aforesaid judgment, High Court of Delhi has observed that the organization

resorting to or permitting malpractices at institutional level should be kept

at bay by bodies conducting public exams. Yet inspite of the clear cut

direction issued by the Delhi High Court, contract has been given to

respondent No.2 without any justifiable cause.

<p id="p_123">

</p><p id="p_124">72.   Respondent No.2 in the present case has been granted permission to

conduct the examination on behalf of respondent No.1 and the unfairness in

the selection process and the anomalies keeping in view the past conduct of

respondent No.2 cannot be ruled out, which will be against the basic

principle of fairness and equity, as envisaged under <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_55">Article 16</a> of the

Constitution of India. The nature of conducting public examinations

requires high degree of secrecy/fairness as future of lacks of aspirants

would depend upon such examination. The conduct of public examination

by the Government or any instrumentality like respondent No.1 is a matter

of trust and utmost faith and what impression can be gathered if such

contract is given to a agency, which was blacklisted in the past, to conduct

the selection process where career of lacks of aspirants are at stake. It is

pertinent to mention here that a fair and reasonable selection process is a

fundamental requirement under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_56">Article 14</a>           and <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_57">Article 16 (1)</a> of the

constitution. Respondent No.1 ought to have acted in public interest

outweighing the commercial interest even if it costs more to the State

exchequer.

</p><p id="p_126">73.   Keeping in view the past incidents, which have occurred and are

subject matter of investigation by the CBI, again respondent No.1 has

given the contract to a tainted service provider to conduct the public

employment examinations, I completely agree with a view taken by Delhi

High Court in a case titled M/s Aptech Limited, supra that organizations

resorting to, or permitting malpractice at an institutional level should be

kept at bay, by bodies (SSB in the present case) conducting public

examination and such conduct ought not to be condoned. It would be a

different matter if there are stray incidents where an employee, or some

employees, may show weakness of character and indulge in isolated acts of

malpractice. However, if such malpractices are adopted by an organization

(M/s Aptech Limited) itself, or are facilitated by the organization itself, it is

very different matter, and is indeed a serious matter since it reflects

adversely on the intent of the management of the organization itself.
