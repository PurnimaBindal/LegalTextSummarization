</p><p id="p_57">28.    The learned trial Court vide its impugned order observed to the
effect that:
</p><p id="p_58">  &quot;Findings:-
</p><p id="p_59">  &quot;I have heard the rival submissions made by the Ld. Counsel for
  parties and also carefully gone through the written submission
  and supporting case laws placed on record by both the parties.
  In my considered opinion the application filed by the plaintiff
  u/O 39 R 1 and 2 CPC needs to be dismissed for the reasons
  stated here under:-
</p><p id="p_60">  6.1 Worth to mention at the outset that both the sides have cited
  plethora of case law in support of their submissions, it is stated
  that there is no dispute to the proposition of law enunciated
  therein, the determining principles remains the same, the
  outcome depends upon the particular facts and circumstances of
  each case.
</p><p id="p_61">  6.2. The entire controversy herein is centered around whether
  the defendant&#x27;s trademark &#x27;BEVATAS&#x27; is deceptively similar to
  that of the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark &#x27;BEVETEX&#x27;. Plaintiff&#x27;s mark is
  registered whereas defendant&#x27;s mark is under objection before
  the registrar Trademark. There is no doubt that registration of
  trademark gives the registered proprietor thereof exclusive right
  to use of the trademark in relation to the goods or services in
  respect of infringement of the trademark as stipulated in Sec-
  28(1) Trademark Act.
</p><p id="p_62">  6.3 <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_3">Section 28(1)</a> of the Act confers upon the registered
  proprietor of a trademark, the exclusive right, upon a valid
  registration, to the use of the trademark in relation to goods or
  services in respect of which the trademark is registered. <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_4">Section
  29(1)</a> provides that a registered trade mark is infringed by a
  person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">FAO 447/2018                                               Page 25 of 87</span>
   by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark
  which is identical with, or deceptively similar to the trade mark
  in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade
  mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of the
  mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.
  6.4 The expression &quot;deceptively similar&quot; is defined in <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_5">Section
  2(l)(h)</a>- &quot;A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to
  another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be
  likely to deceive or cause confusion.&quot;
</p><p id="p_63">  6.5. In factual matrix of the case, it is apparent that the trade
  mark used by the defendant &quot;BEVETAS&quot; is not a registered
  trademark. It is also apparent that the defendant&#x27;s mark
  &quot;BEVETAS&quot; is not per se identical with the plaintiffs registered
  mark &quot;BEVETEX&quot;. Noticeably the defendants and plaintiff
  trademark are not in relation to the same molecule/product/salt.
  Therefore, the only question that has to be examined whether the
  defendant&#x27;s mark is deceptively similar/ confusingly similar to
  the plaintiffs registered trademarks thereby entitling to the
  interdiction against the defendant to its use.
  6.6. It is not uncommon, rather, I would say in pharmaceutical
  trade it is a normal practice to have prefixes or suffixes linked to
  chemical salt or compound across various similar products
  manufactured by different companies. It is also common to have
  the abbreviated name of the company in conjunction with such
  prefix or suffix of the salt to indicate the source of the product.
  6.7 In view of the pharmaceutical trade, one finds name of
  various drugs almost similar to each other, having common
  prefixes of suffixes, for the reason that the name of the drug
  conveys as to which salt/ compound it is a derivative of drug.
  Acronyms and short forms are commonly used as a trademark.
  6.8 Meaning thereby, having prefix or suffix conjunctively with
  company name is the normal practice in pharmaceutical
  business. And trite to say that to judge the similarity the two




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">FAO 447/2018                                                Page 26 of 87</span>
   marks are to be compared as a whole, it is not legally
  permissible to dissect it to minutely compare the marks with
  microscopic eye. What it means in the context of the present case
  is that in the pharmaceutical trade it would not be unusual to
  find drugs including the term &#x27;BEVE&#x27; as a prefix in plaintiffs
  mark and &#x27;BEVA&#x27; in defendant&#x27;s mark. And significantly, the
  chemical compound &#x27;Bevacizumab&#x27; in the defendant&#x27;s drug is
  totally different from the compound/salt of plaintiff drug, i.e.
  &#x27;Paclitaxel&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_64">  6.9 With above noted factors in mind I proceed to examine
  whether the two marks in question are deceptively/confusingly
  similar or not.
</p><p id="p_65">       To the said word &#x27;BEVE&#x27;, plaintiff has added suffix &#x27;TEX&#x27; to
  arrive at the trademark &#x27;BEVETEX&#x27;. On the other hand, the
  defendant has added the suffix &quot;TAS&quot;, which is part of its
  company name (INTAS), to arrive at the trademark &#x27;BEVATAS&#x27;.
  The trademarks in this case, be it the plaintiffs&#x27; registered
  trademark or the defendant&#x27;s trademark are what is described as
  hybrid or blended words.
</p><p id="p_66">  6.10. In the facts of the case, it would be fruitful to refer to the
  decision of the Ho&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi reported as
  <a href="/doc/1509899/" id="a_6">Astrazeneca UK Ltd. V. Orchid Chemicals and
  Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. : 2007(34) PTC 469 (Del) wherein
  similar words in competing marks being public jurisdiction was
  considered and it was held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       &quot;21. In our considered opinion the facts of the said case
       are almost similar and squarely applicable to the facts
       of the present case. &#x27;Meropenem&#x27; I the moleculte which
       is used for treatment of bacterial infections. In that view
       of the matter, the abbreviation &#x27;Mero&#x27; became a generic
       term, is publici jurisdiction and it is distinctive in
       nature. Consequently, the appellants/plaintiffs cannot
       claim exclusive right to the use of &#x27;Mero&#x27; as constituent




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">FAO 447/2018                                                Page 27 of 87</span>
       of any trademark. The possibility of deception or
      confusion is also reduced practically to nil in view of
      the fact that the medicine is sold only on prescription by
      dealers. The common feature in both the competing
      marks i.e. &#x27;Mero&#x27; is only descriptive and publici
      jurisdiction and, therefore, the customers would tend to
      ignore the common feature and would pay more
      attention to the uncommon feature. Even if they are
      expressed as a whole, the two did not have any phonetic
      similarity to make it objectionable. There are at least
      four other registered users of the prefix &#x27;Mero&#x27; in India
      whereas the names of 35 companies using &#x27;Mero&#x27;
      trademarks, which have been registered or applied for
      registration, have been furnished in the pleadings. The
      respondent/defendant       advertised    its   trademark
      &#x27;Meromer&#x27; after submitting its applicant for registration
      and at that stage, there was no opposition even from the
      appellants/plaintiffs.    The     trademark      of    the
      respondent/defendant was registered there being no
      opposition from any quarter, including the
      appellants/plaintiffs&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_67">  6.11 For the plaintiff to succeed, it must also be established that
  the defendant has no right to use the genuine
  name/abbreviations of the compound &#x27;Bevacizumab&#x27; in their
  drugs, and that the plaintiff has exclusive right to use the same
  and which the plaintiff has failed to show.
</p><p id="p_68">  6.12. Thus, it is clear that parts of words can be combed to pack
  the meanings of both the words in the new word so formed. And
  the defendant has been able to show the derivation of the
  trademark &#x27;BEVATAS&#x27;. &#x27;BEVA&#x27; from &#x27;Bevacizumab&#x27; and &#x27;TAS&#x27;
  from its name/trade name &#x27;INTAS&#x27; which apparently is also
  reflected from other prominent brands of the defendant being




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">FAO 447/2018                                               Page 28 of 87</span>
   continuously used since long. Necessary documents to support
  the said view have been placed on record by the defendant.
  6.13. Further, in my view the defendant&#x27;s trademark has been
  derived by combining the publici- juris, the abbreviation of the
  salt &#x27;Bevacizumab&#x27; with suffix TAS, the abbreviated form of its
  trade/company name.
</p><p id="p_69">  6.14. Defendant has also placed on record a list of third party
  use of Similar trademark with abbreviated prefix &#x27;BEVA&#x27; to their
  merchandise/drugs as detailed in paras 18 and 30 of the WS. To
  name a few BEVATAS (of the defendant), BEVACIREL
  (Reliance), BEVAZZA (Lupin), Bevarest (Emcure), AVASTIN
  (Roche) and ZYBEV (Zydex U.S.) And relevant to note the list
  includes prominent names in pharmaceutical industry.
  6.15. Defendant has also placed on record large number of
  products which have the trademarks with the suffix &#x27;TAS&#x27; by
  amalgamating with the name of molecule/active ingredient or
  salt which are already registered in the name of the defendant in
  class 5. And apparently substantive use by the defendant of the
  mark for its products is also demonstrated by placing on record
  invoices/bills etc.
  6.16. We must not lose sight of the fact that herein we are at
  preliminary stage therefore the validity, relevancy and
  weightage of the documents placed on record can be tested
  during course of trial, at this stage, prima-facie opinion in
  favour of defendant is supported by these documents. And
  thereafter in my view, plaintiff can not have any monopoly over
  the use of the word &#x27;BEVA&#x27;. The Prefix &#x27;BEVA&#x27; is derived from
  &#x27;Bevacizumab&#x27; which conveys as to which salt it is derivative of.
</p><p id="p_70">  7. Now coming to factual aspect of similarity or deceptive
  similarity -
</p><p id="p_71">  7.1. Ocular/ Visual similarity:-it is important to note that there is
  markedly difference between the two trademarks in dispute here.
  Plaintiffs mark comprised of &#x27;BEVETEX&#x27; whereas the mark of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">FAO 447/2018                                                 Page 29 of 87</span>
   the defendant &#x27;BEVATAS&#x27; is depicted along with the name of
  the salt in small font underneath. Both the trademarks are
  prominently qualified by the name of the compound which ex-
  facie is completely different, i.e. Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab.
  And important to note that the name of the salts are
  predominantly reflected overshadowing the trademarks on the
  packaging. The get-up, the trade-dress of the two products is
  different making it highly unlikely of any confusion amongst its
  consumers. And taking note of above discussion and the font
  thereof I can thoughtfully say that there is no structural
  similarity also.
</p><p id="p_72">  7.2. Phonetically also, I find apparently there is no similarity in
  the two words. The word &#x27;Bevetex&quot; बेवे &amp; टे कस and &#x27;Bevetas बेवा
  &amp; तास (Hindi varaamala uchcharan) and pronounced as a
  whole they do not rhyme with each other.
</p><p id="p_73">  8. Thus, it cannot lead to the conclusion that any slight
  semblance of phonetic similarity between two marks would
  automatically satisfy the test of confusion to a man as a whole.
  In entirety of the facts, looking at the two marks as a whole, I do
  not see any likely hood of confusion or deception and/or
  similarity     between      the    two     marks    amongst     the
  customers/consumers. The two marks are entirely different and
  distinct. There is no phonetically or visual similarity between the
  two mark taken as a whole.
</p><p id="p_74">  9. Further both the drugs are schedule H, IV Injunction Drugs
  and cannot be self administered. Nor it can be said that they are
  &#x27;Over The Counter&#x27; drugs or for that matter easily/readily
  available on self medication, a general tendency within our
  society.
</p><p id="p_75">  10. Drugs are available only on prescriptions and can be
  administered to the patients by highly specialized -super

   oncology centers. Both the drugs are sold under different
  contents/weight and the price , i.e.
</p><p id="p_76">      (i) BEVATAS- 400 mg cost: Rs. 39,995/- 100 mg cost: Rs.
  25,990/-
</p><p id="p_77">      (ii) BEVETEX- 300 mg cost: Rs. 37,000/- -100 mg cost: Rs.
  32,500/-.
</p>
<p id="p_78">  11. Herein another import factor that needs to be considered
  and in my view very relevant to the facts of the case is who are
  the customers /targeted users, the persons who are likely to
  purchase the drugs in question here. And I must state that it is
  not the general public or unwary customer in the bracket of
  targeted customers/ consumers. The customer of the two
  products are not illiterate persons or a common man. But highly
  specialized doctors and equally talented and specialized medical
  staff where the chance of confusion are practically negligible.

  completely ruled out. It is impossible that a super specialist

this very defendant/respondent from dealing in medicinal preparations
under the mark MIRATAS (for treatment of overactive bladder),
which was found to be deceptively similar to MIRTAZ i.e. for
treatment of depression and in that case, this Court injuncted the
defendant/respondent after observing that the two trademarks are more
or less identical but being used for treatment of separate diseases and
which would gravely endanger the health of the public. The appellant

occur at any level and it can occur at the time of dispensation of the

competing medicines are administered by oncologists and their para
medical staff and that confusion can occur considering both are cancer
drugs though for different cancers.

the learned trial Court erroneously made a side by side comparison of

customer buying the product neither has the benefit of side by side
comparison nor does he know the molecules/salt or the difference
between the competing salts and that the Doctor&#x27;s prescription does
not carry the image/ trade dress/ packaging of the drug prescribed nor
does it suggest the name of the salt that the requisite drug would

and Bevatas are too close on account of both prefix and suffix of the
competing marks being similar and it was reiterated on behalf of the
appellant that the impugned mark is likely to cause confusion leading

detract from the merits of the contentions of the appellant that there

another important circumstance taken into account is the price

      appellants/plaintiffs and the respondent/ defendant from
     the drug &#x27;Meropenem&#x27;, taking the prefix &#x27;Mero&quot; which
     is used as a prefix in both the competing marks. Both the
     appellants/plaintiffs and the respondent/defendant are
     marketing the same molecule &#x27;Meropenem&#x27;. Neither the
     appellants/plaintiffs nor the respondent/defendant can
     raise any claim for exclusive user of the aforesaid word
     &#x27;Meropenem&#x27;. Along with the aforesaid generic/common
     prefix, &#x27;Mero&#x27;, the appellants/plaintiffs have used the
     syllables &#x27;nem&#x27;, whereas, the respondent/defendant has
     used the syllable &#x27;mer&#x27;. It is true that the aforesaid
     words/trade names cannot be deciphered or considered
     separately, but must be taken as a whole. But even if
     they are taken as a whole, the prefix &#x27;Mero&#x27; used with
     suffix in the two competing names, distinguishes and
     differentiates the two products. When they are taken as a
     whole, the aforesaid two trade marks cannot be said to
     be either phonetically or visually or in any manner
     deceptively similar to each other.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_65">     20. We are informed that there are a number of such
     other similar names with the prefix &#x27;Mero&#x27; which are in
     the market. They were also taken notice of by the
     learned Single Judge while dealing with the injunction
     application. In the decisions of the Supreme Court and
     this Court also, it has been clearly held that nobody can
     claim exclusive right to use any word, abbreviation, or
     acronym which has become publici juris. In the trade of
     drugs, it is common practice to name a drug by the name
     of the organ or ailment which it treats or the main
     ingredient of the drug. Such an organ ailment or
     ingredient being publici Juris or generic cannot be
     owned by anyone exclusively for use as a trade mark. In
     the Division Bench decision of this Court in SBL
     Limited (supra) it was also held that possibility of
     deception or confusion is reduced practically to nil in
     view of the fact that the medicine will be sold on medical
     prescription and by licensed dealers well versed in the
     field and having knowledge of medicines. It was further

      held that the two rival marks, &#x27;Liv.52&#x27; and &#x27;LIV-T&#x27;,
     contain a common feature, &#x27;Liv&#x27; which is not only
     descriptive, but also publici Jurisdiction and that a
     customer will tend to ignore the common feature and
     will pay more attention to uncommon features i.e. &#x27;52&#x27;
     and &#x27;T&#x27; and that the two do not have such phonetic
     similarity so as to make it objectionable.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">     21. In our considered opinion the facts of the said case
     are almost similar and squarely applicable to the facts of
     the present case. &#x27;Meropenem&#x27; is the molecule which is
     used for treatment of bacterial infections. In that view of
     the matter, the abbreviation &#x27;Mero&#x27; became a generic
     term, is publici Juris and it is distinctive in nature.
     Consequently, the appellants/plaintiffs cannot claim
     exclusive right to the use of &#x27;Mero&#x27; as constituent of any
     trademark. The possibility of deception or confusion is
     also reduced practically to nil in view of the fact that the
     medicine is sold only on prescription by dealers. The
     common feature in both the competing marks i.e. &#x27;Mero&#x27;
     is only descriptive and publici Juris and, therefore, the
     customers would tend to ignore the common feature and
     would pay more attention to the uncommon feature.
     Even if they are expressed as a whole, the two did not
     have any phonetic similarity to make it objectionable.
     There are at least four other registered users of the
     prefix &#x27;Mero&#x27; in India whereas the names of 35
     companies using &#x27;Mero&#x27; trademarks, which have been
     registered or applied for registration, have been
     furnished in the pleadings. The respondent/defendant
     advertised its trademark &#x27;Meromer&#x27; after submitting its
     application for registration and at that stage, there was
     no opposition even from the appellants/plaintiffs. The
     trademark of the respondent/defendant was registered
     there being no opposition from any quarter, including
     the appellants/plaintiffs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_67">     22. Consequently, the two names, namely, &#x27;Meromer&#x27;
     and &#x27;Meronem&#x27; are found to be prima facie dissimilar to

       each other. They are Schedule-H drugs available only
      on doctor&#x27;s prescription. The factum that the same are
      available only on doctor&#x27;s prescription and not as an
      over the counter medicine is also relevant and has been
      rightly taken note of by the learned Single Judge. In our
      considered opinion, where the marks are distinct and the
      features are found to be dis-similar, they are not likely to
      create any confusion. It is also admitted by the parties
      that there is a difference in the price of the two products.
      The very fact that the two pharmaceutical products, one
      of the appellants/plaintiffs and the other of the
      respondent/ defendant, are being sold at different prices
      itself ensures that there is no possibility of any
      deception/confusion, particularly in view of the fact that
      customer who comes with the intention of purchasing
      the product of the appellants/plaintiffs would never settle
      for the product of the respondent/defendant which is
      priced much lower. It is apparent that the trademarks on
      the two products, one of the appellants/plaintiffs and the
      other of the respondent/defendant, are totally dissimilar
      and different.

      in favor of the appellants/plaintiffs and directing

 is no ground for variation of the order made by the Trial Court and
there is no infirmity in the impugned order taking into account the

contentions raised on behalf of the appellant that there was a
likelihood of confusion cannot be accepted in as much as even qua the
contention that has been raised on behalf of the appellant that there has
been a confusion at one stage in administration of the drug due to
similarity in name of the drug of the appellant and the respondent, no
such circumstance has been specified on behalf of the appellant, qua
which it was submitted on behalf of the appellant by the learned

either side. Through the written submissions of the appellant it has
been sought to be reiterated that the plaintiff&#x27;s i.e. the appellant&#x27;s mark
Beve in BEVETEX is arbitrary not derived from the salt Paclitaxel
and that the competing drugs BEVETEX and BEVATAS are for
different cancers and both are injections and administration of one for
another can lead to disastrous consequences i.e. causing of Gastro
Intestine Perforation i.e. creating holes in the stomach which would
eventually prove fatal. The appellant reiterates that the suit has been
filed purely in public interest and that it has no commercial interest

learned trial Court.

respondent&#x27;s mark has not been claimed to be used, whereas the
appellant i.e. the plaintiff is a prior user since 2015 of the registered
trade mark, registered in 1983.
</p><p id="p_116">47.   The appellant submits that though the respondent has contended
that there is no possibility of confusion as the drug is administered by
a specialized doctor and the staff, confusion can occur at any level and
it can occur at the time of dispensation of the medicine by the
pharmacist, at the para medical level and that competing medicines are
administered by oncologists and their para medical staff and that
confusion can occur considering both are cancer drugs though for
different cancers. Inter alia the appellant submits that such an
argument could have been raised that one medicine is administered by
a general physician/ gynecologist etc. and the other by oncologists and
their staff and that no confusion would take place because the
respective doctors may know their medicines but in the instant case
there is no such situation.
</p><p id="p_117">48.   The appellant further submits that there have been reported
cases where people had died on account of wrong drugs having been
dispensed despite of their being prescription of schedule drugs and
that the prescription does not contain the name of the salt or the trade
dress/ packaging of the drug and that the competing marks are not to
be compared side by side. Inter alia the appellant has contended that
the test of confusion that is to be seen if an average person with

 imperfect recollection would get confused. Inter alia the appellant
submits that the consumer/patient does not know the difference
between the salt and in fact one cannot even pronounce the competing
salts/molecules and that to be able to distinguish between the two is
not possible.

     well settled law, the actual confusion and deception is not
     required in order to prove the case of passing off even if the
     defendant has adopted the mark innocently and the court
     comes to the conclusion that the two trade marks are
     deceptively similar, injunction under the said circumstances
     has to be granted. Actual deception is not required in an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">FAO 447/2018                                               Page 67 of 87</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_101">       &quot;8. It is common in the trade and business for a trader or
      a businessman to adopt a name and/or mark under which
      he would carry on his trade or business. According to
      Kerly (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth
      Edition, para 16.49), the name under which a business
      trades will almost always be a trade mark (or if the
      business provides services, a service mark, or both).
      Independently of questions of trade or service mark,
      however, the name of a business (a trading business or
      any other) will normally have attached to it a goodwill
      that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off will
      then lie wherever the defendant company&#x27;s name, or its
      intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert
      business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion
      between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is
      no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the
      proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in
      which the business may be carried on in the future, and to
      its not being carried on precisely as carried on at the date
      of the proceedings. Where there is probability of
      confusion in business, an injunction will be granted even
      though the defendants adopted the name innocently.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_140">66.   Reliance was also placed on behalf of the appellant on the
observations in the verdict in <a href="/doc/15654482/" id="a_27">Novartis AG vs. Crest Pharma Pvt. Ltd.
and Anr</a>. in CS (OS) 851/2008, a verdict dated 24.07.2009 wherein
vide para 23, it was observed to the effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_102">      &quot;23. The other argument of the counsel for the defendant
      that the plaintiff&#x27;s product is available in tablets and oral
      suspension form and the defendant&#x27;s product is available
      in injection form has also no force as it has been seen
      from experience of the pharmaceuticals products
      available in all over the world that most of the companies
      are making pharmaceuticals products in both the forms
      i.e. tablets as well as in injection form under the same
      trade mark. As per well settled law, the actual confusion

       and deception is not required in order to prove the case of
      passing off even if the defendant has adopted the mark
      innocently and the court comes to the conclusion that the
      two trade marks are deceptively similar, injunction under
      the said circumstances has to be granted. Actual
      deception is not required in an action of passing off.

      (Del) 250. Therefore there is no chance of confusion and
      deception.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_141">67.   Inter alia on behalf of the appellant reliance was placed on the
verdict in Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd. Vs. Ajanta Pharma Ltd.
(supra) wherein it has been categorically laid down therein that in
case of products used for the same ailments but with different
composition, a more stringent test is required to be set down.
</p><p id="p_142">68.   As regard the reliance placed on behalf of the appellant on the
verdict of this Court in <a href="/doc/147593010/" id="a_29">Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd. vs. Intas
Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. in CS (COMM) 1206/2016, a verdict dated
15.05.2019 in which the respondent herein as the defendant of the suit
was injuncted from user of the trade mark DECITAS or any other
mark i.e. similar to the petitioner&#x27;s trade mark &#x27;DECITEX&#x27;, which was
found to be structurally or deceptively similar to the petitioner&#x27;s
registered trade mark &#x27;DECITEX&#x27;, it is essential to observe that the
basic facts in the said case relied upon by the plaintiff therein using
the trade mark DECITEX for its medicinal preparations used for
cancer/chemotherapy since July 2011 with the said trade mark having
been registered on 15.07.2011 with the defendant therein having
alleged that its drug used for cancer/chemotherapy using the trade
mark DECITAS, for which an application for registration was filed on




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">FAO 447/2018                                               Page 69 of 87</span>
 19.04.2019 and it was stated that the said trade mark was proposed to
be used.
</p><p id="p_143">69.       It was inter alia observed vide para 17 of the said verdict to the
effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_103">          &quot;17. Hence, the test to see as to whether the trade mark of
          the defendant is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff
          is as to whether the essential features of the trade mark of
          the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant. Phonetic
          similarity would constitute an important index. To see as
          to whether a mark bears a deceptive or misleading
          similarity to another, the rival marks have to be compared
          as a whole. All the surrounding circumstances have to be
          considered. Further the competing marks have to be
          compared keeping in mind a unwary purchaser of average
          intelligence and imperfect recollection. In my opinion, the
          mark used by the defendant DECITAS when compared as
          a whole is structurally and phonetically prima facie
          identical and similar to the trade mark of the plaintiff
          DECITEX. That apart, likelihood of confusion in this case
          is much more as the drugs of the respective parties deal
          with the same medical problem i.e. cancer/chemotherapy.
          Strong measures are required to prevent confusion
          arising from similarities of marks in medicines. In my
          opinion, there is no merit in the plea of the defendant that
          the mark of the defendant is not deceptively similar to that
          of the plaintiff.&quot;

<p id="p_144">It was thus sought to be submitted by the appellant that in the instant
case BEVETEX being the plaintiff&#x27;s mark and BEVATAS being the
respondent&#x27;s marks, the facts of the instant case are in pari materia
with the facts of the case in Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd. Vs. Intas

BEVETEX and that of the respondent being BEVATAS.

<p id="p_145"> 70.   Through the written submissions submitted on behalf of the
respondent, the submissions that were made through the written
statement of the respondent as defendant in TM No.146/2018 have
been reiterated. It was further submitted through the written
submissions that there was no similarity in both the marks
&quot;BEVETEX&quot; and &quot;BEVATAS&quot; which are entirely different and there
is no likelihood of confusion or deception and/or similarity between
the two marks amongst the customers and that the two marks are
totally different, dissimilar and distinct and that there cannot be any
likelihood of confusion and that the said marks are visually and
phonetically dissimilar. The respondent no.2 further submitted that
even the drugs which are sold under these marks are administered
under supervision of specialists in a different ways and there is no
likelihood of confusion at any level and in the instant case, the marks
are visually, structurally and phonetically different:
</p><p id="p_146">71.   The respondent has further submitted that the respondent had
also applied for the registration of its trade mark vide application
bearing No. 3254683 dated 09.05.2016 and that that the respondent&#x27;s
Trade Mark when examined by the Examiner of Trade marks, he did
not cite any conflicting trademark and the application was accepted for
advertisement and even the trademarks office did not find any
similarity between the trademarks of the appellant&#x27;s and of the
respondent&#x27;s. The respondent has further submitted that the appellant
was    manufacturing      a    medicine     containing   Molecule/Salt
PACLITAXEL under the mark BEVETEX as a scheduled drug for
treatment of Breast Cancer, Non-small Lung cancer and pancreatic



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">FAO 447/2018                                               Page 71 of 87</span>
 cancer and that the appellant alleges to have started selling its
medicine under the mark BEVETEX since the year 2015 though the
appellant has claimed to have invented the mark in year 1983 and that
the appellant has malafidely hoarded the said mark and that the
appellant has no alleged goodwill or recognition with the mark as the
same has been very recently adopted.
</p><p id="p_147">72.   The respondent has further submitted that both the products
were launched within a span of one year and the appellant has failed to
prove that the appellant&#x27;s trade mark has attained the reputation and
goodwill as to fall in the category of a well-known trade mark and that
the turnover of the respondent&#x27;s product BEVETAS is more than that
of the appellant and it cannot thereby be said that respondent is trying
to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the appellant&#x27;s trade
mark. The respondent has further submitted that the appellant is a
subsidiary of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited and the mark
was initially filed for registration vide application No. 410744 dated
16.09.1983 on &quot;PROPOSED TO BE USED BASIS&quot; under the
proprietorship of TAMILNADU DADHA PHARMACEUTICALS
LTD. and later allegedly transferred to Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries
Limited, who further transferred it in the name of the appellant. The
respondent has further submitted that no documents to the effect of
transfer have either been placed on record by the appellant nor are
they available on the website of the Trade Mark registry.
</p><p id="p_148">73.   The respondent has further submitted through its written
submissions that the process of infusion is a half or full day process,
depending upon the medical condition of the patient and that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">FAO 447/2018                                                Page 72 of 87</span>
 &quot;Intravenous Product&quot; and cannot be self-administered and the entire
process of infusion is done under constant monitoring, guidance and
supervision of super specialists and that Medical practitioners
prescribing or administering the drug are super specialists like
oncologists and radiologists and can be administered under their
supervision though specialized producers by trained and skilled
personnel within oncology centers. The respondent no.2 has further
submitted that the respondent&#x27;s drug costs three times the drug of the
appellant and that the drug of the respondent is a biological/biosimilar
drug which involves an extremely expensive clinical trial.
</p><p id="p_149">74.   Inter alia the respondent no.2 has further submitted that there
was no prima facie case whatsoever made out for the grant of the
interim injunction as prayed by the appellant and thus had rightly not
been granted by the learned trial Court and that there was no prima
facie evidence to show that appellant&#x27;s mark has acquired goodwill
and reputation and that rather the respondent&#x27;s brand has acquired
huge reputation and goodwill in the short span of time and the clear
motive of the appellant by filing the litigation was to curb healthy
competition in the market. The respondent has further submitted that
the launch of the respondent&#x27;s drug was aimed at making
BEVACIZUMAB accessible for Indian patients and that before the
launch of BEVATAS 400 mg, only approx. 200 patients per month
could afford the Bevacizumab therapy, however, now there has been a
phenomenal increase and roughly 700 patients get benefited of which
BEVETAS is the most preferred product.

<p id="p_150"> 75.   The respondent has further submitted that the product of the
respondent is in the market for such a long period and has created its
own goodwill and reputation over all these years and that the product
of the respondent is a lifesaving drug, essential for cancer treatment
and has proved its success and has a large reach to the number of
ailing patients across the length and breadth of the country and with
offerings of the respondent such number of patients are on rise. The
respondent has further submitted that the respondent&#x27;s product is
highly efficacious and also affordable (approx. 60% less) which is
making more and more number of ailing eligible patients to be
benefited by the said therapy and that thus, the continuity of
BEVETAS therapy is of paramount importance for survival of patients
and that if the injunction is granted it shall cause great injury to the
cancer patients in India. The respondent has further submitted that the
marks BEVETEX and BEVATAS are totally different, dissimilar and
distinct and that the drug formulations of the marks are completely
different along with mode of administration and that there cannot be
likelihood of confusion as these drugs are Schedule H drugs and
cannot be sold off the shelf and the indications and effect of both the
drugs are different and is known to the experts and medical
practitioners who prescribe these drugs.
</p><p id="p_151">76.   The respondent further submitted that the appellant had
contended in the plaint that there is likelihood of confusion between
the marks, however, in the rejoinder to the application under Order 39
Rule 1 and 2 the appellant suddenly shifted its stand in making a bald
misleading averment of actual confusion having taken place and that

 the appellant has failed to file any documentary proof establishing an
instance of actual confusion. The respondent has further submitted that
the appellant has approached this Court with unclean hands and has
suppressed the relevant information and that the appellant filed the
notice of opposition against the trademark application of the
respondent on 27.12.2016 and the respondent filed the detailed
response to the same on 28.03.2017. The respondent has further
submitted that the respondent had launched its drug in October 2016
and the said launch was extensively covered in media, and, therefore,
the appellant has been well aware of the respondent since 2016. The
respondent further submitted that the appellant has blatantly lied and
has filed the present suit on a frivolous cause of action with an ill
motive to deprive the respondent of its lawful right.
</p><p id="p_152">77.   The respondent further submitted that there is no cause of action
for the institution of the present suit and that the appellant has claimed
that the cause of action for institution of the present suit arose in the
third week of December and more specifically on 20.12.2017,
however, the appellant had opposed the respondent&#x27;s trade mark
application in 2016 and further the launch of the respondent&#x27;s drug
was in 2016 and that the appellant has been well aware of the same
and had approached the Court with unclean hands. The respondent has
further submitted that the appellant has its registered office and
principal place of business at Mumbai and the respondent has its
registered office and place of business at Ahmedabad, Gujarat and
thus, the territorial jurisdiction of this Court has not been made out by
the appellant and the appellant is in fact attempting to indulge in

</pre><p id="p_154">79.    It has been submitted on behalf of the respondent that reliance
placed on behalf of the appellant on the verdicts of this Court in Sun
Pharma Laboratories Ltd. Vs. Ajanta Pharma Ltd. (supra) and Sun
Pharma Laboratories Ltd. Vs. Intas Pharmaceuticals Limited (supra)
is misplaced as the facts of those cases are distinguishable and not in
pari materia to the facts of the instant case.
</p><p id="p_155">80.    On a consideration of the rival submissions that have been made
on behalf of either side, it is essential to observe that the suit in which
the appellant herein has had filed the application seeking an interim
restraint against the respondent is not merely for a restraint against
infringement of trade mark but also for a restraint against passing off
of the goods of the respondent claimed to be deceptively similar with
the plaintiff&#x27;s/ appellant&#x27;s trade mark of BEVETEX, the respondent&#x27;s
trade mark being BEVATAS. Thus it cannot be contended on behalf
of the appellant/ plaintiff that the suit being only one for an action for
infringement, the relevant consideration is only the similarity of the
essential features of the registered trade mark and the impugned trade
mark as opposed to an action for passing of where the defendant can
escape the liability by showing dis-similar features nor can it be

 contended that the difference between the appellant&#x27;s mark and the

<p id="p_158"> 82.   As observed vide the impugned order vide para 7 thereof that
there is no ocular/visual similarity whatsoever in the trade mark of the
appellant and the respondent prima facie. The said observations of the
impugned order have already been adverted to elsewhere hereinabove.
</p><p id="p_159">83.   The impugned order also appropriately holds that there is no
phonetic similarity in the two words BEVETEX and BEVATAS as
pronounced as a whole and do not rhyme with each other. Thus prima
facie the product trade dress of both products of the appellant and of
the respondent do not appear to be even remotely similar nor
confusing to even a layman nor is there phonetic similarity sufficiently
enough to be confusing to any consumer of the products.
</p><p id="p_160">84.   Furthermore, both the drugs BEVETEX of the appellant and
the drug BEVATAS of the respondent are schedule H, IV injection
drug and cannot be self-administered and are not over the counter
drugs nor easily readily available for self-medication and can be
administered to patients only by highly specialized, super specialized
oncologists    and     under   their   supervision   through    specialized
procedures by trained and skilled personnel within an oncology centre.
Furthermore, the two products are also sold under different
contents/weight with different prices being to the effect:
</p><pre id="pre_15">                (i)      BEVATAS - 400 mg cost : Rs.39,995/-

                                  -100 mg cost :Rs. 32,500/-

the appellant and the respondents are not unwary customers and

 illiterate persons and not layman and are rather highly specialized
oncologists and a specialized medical staff, there appears no
likelihood of any confusion. The two drugs are used for different
indications of which, the specialist oncologists have complete
information, knowledge and are aware of the same as rightly observed
vide the impugned order vide para 13 thereof.
</p><p id="p_162">86.     The drugs can also only be administered through the
intravenous mode and self-administration is not possible and can only
be administered through constant monitoring, guidance and under
supervision of the super specialists and thus there appears no
likelihood of any confusion or deception for administration of a wrong
drug.
</p><p id="p_163">87.     It is essential to observe that each case is to be determined on its
own facts and circumstances and thus the reliance placed on behalf of
the appellant on a catena of verdicts relied upon in the facts and
circumstances of the instant case does not aid the appellant in as much
as observed by the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/157791679/" id="a_30">Sun

thereof, the verdict of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Cadila (Supra)
has to be read in its entirety and the contours of the test laid down by
the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court thereby cannot be restricted by an
artificial process which focuses attention only upon the factual aspect
of both products being pharmaceutical preparations and that the
observations in para 42 of the said verdict, which has already been
adverted to elsewhere hereinabove, thus as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">FAO 447/2018                                                   Page 82 of 87</span>
 Supreme Court in Cadila (Supra) that the weightage to be given to
each of the factors in relation to the aspect of resembleness between
the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea; nature of the
goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks, similarity in
the nature character and performance of the goods of the rival traders,
the class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the
marks and the education and intelligence and a degree of care they
required and likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods
and other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the
extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks have to be
considered in each and every case.
</p><p id="p_164">88.   The other aspect which cannot be overlooked is that the
respondent&#x27;s trade mark has been derived by combining publici-juris
i.e. the abbreviation of the salt &#x27;Bevacizumab with the suffix TAS, the
abbreviated form of its trade/company name and there is prima facie
presently nothing to indicate that the appellant/ plaintiff has any
exclusive right to use the abbreviation of BEVE which it has
arbitrarily utilized in relation to the compound / salt with Paclitaxel.
The appellant/ plaintiff has thus added the suffix BEVE to the word
TEX to arrive at its trade mark BEVETEX and the respondent /
defendant has on the other hand added the suffix TAS which is a part
of its company named INTAS to arrive at the trade mark BEVATAS
and as observed hereinabove the user of the word BEVA by the
respondent being only descriptive and publici juris, in as much as the
abbreviated prefix BEVA is used for several drugs by several
prominent pharmaceutical industrialists other than the respondent i.e.

 BEVACIRE of Reliance, BEVAZZA of Lupin, BEVAREST of
Emcure and ZYBEV of Zydex US. Furthermore, as put forth on behalf
of the respondent that several trademarks have used the prefix of BEV
in the pharmaceutical trade which are already registered, as under:-

<p id="p_167"> 90.   Furthermore, presently, the appellant though it applied for
registration of the mark BEVETEX in the year 1993, which was
granted to it in the year 1999 and began its utilization only in the year
2015 and despite having learnt of the launch of the defendant&#x27;s drug in
2016 by having opposed the trade mark application of the defendant /
respondent in the year 2016 having chosen to institute the suit by
claiming that the cause of the action for the suit arose only on 20 th
December, 2017, the contention of the respondent that the suit of the
plaintiff/ appellant suffered from delay, laches would essentially have
to be considered during the trial. Undoubtedly, drugs are not sweets
but poison as observed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Cadila
(supra) as contended on behalf of the appellant, however as observed
elsewhere hereinabove as laid down also in <a href="/doc/157791679/" id="a_31">Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. Anglo Frensh Drgus &amp; Industries Ltd. &amp;
Anr</a>. (supra) by the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of this Court vide para 18

in Cadila (supra) in para 11.6 in Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd. Vs.

pharmacists are not immune to mistake, yet it cannot be overlooked
that in the instant case, the administration of the drug has to be

 respondent through their trade dress cannot even remotely be prima
facie considered to be similar.
</p><p id="p_169">92.   In the circumstances, as rightly held by the learned trial Court
vide the impugned order dated 17.09.2018, there is no prima facie case
brought forth in favour of the appellant for the grant of the interim
injunction seeking a restraint against the respondent for user of its
trade mark BEVETEX on the ground of stated similarity or deceptive
similarity with the trade mark of the appellant/plaintiff BEVETEX
which prima facie does not appear to exist. As rightly observed vide
the impugned order dated 17.09.2018, there is no balance of
convenience in favour of the appellant/ plaintiff also in as much as the
appellant has not been able to prima facie establish that its trademark
BEVETEX has acquired a reputation and goodwill so as to fall in the
category of a well known trademark and thus in the circumstances,
there is prima facie no irreparable injury likely to be caused to the
plaintiff by the user of the impugned mark by the defendant.
</p><p id="p_170">93.   It is also essential to observe that as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble
Supreme Court in Wander Ltd. and Ors. Vs. Antox India P. Ltd.
1990(2) ARBLR 399 (SC), the Appellate Court is not to re-assess the
material and seek to reach to a conclusion different from the one
reached by the Court below if one reached by that Court was
reasonably possible on the material available and the Appellate Court
would not normally be justified in interfering with the exercise of
discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered
the matter at the trial stage it would have come to contrary conclusion
and that if the discretion that has been exercised by the learned trial

 Court has been reasonably exercised and in a judicial manner that the
Appellate Court may or would have taken a different view, may not
justify interference with the trial Court&#x27;s exercise of discretion. In the
instant case, as it is apparent, it cannot be contended on behalf of the
appellant that there has been an unreasonable or un-judicious exercise
of discretion by the learned trial Court vide the impugned order dated
17.09.2018 in the non-grant of the prayer for the ad interim injunction
as prayed by the appellant in TM No.146/2017.
