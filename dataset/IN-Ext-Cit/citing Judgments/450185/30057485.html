      Heard learned counsel for the appellant as well as learned

counsel appearing for the contesting respondents.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. This writ appeal has been filed against the judgment and

order dated 30.9.2014 passed by the learned Single Judge in writ

petition No.23833 of 2014, by which judgment the writ petition

has been allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. The appellant herein we refer to as 'the Corporation' and

the writ petitioner as 'the petitioner'. The brief facts necessary to

be noted for deciding this appeal are :
</p>
<p id="p_4">The Corporation ie., Employees State Insurance Corporation

issued an admission notice on 13.8.2014 inviting applications

from wards of insured person in undergraduate course in ESIC

Medical College for the academic year 2014-15.                               The writ

petitioner claiming to be the ward of Insured Person has

submitted the application for admission under the State quota.

The parents of writ petitioner were in employment of sixth

respondent namely Marthoma Mission Hospital, Malappuram

District. The said institution was inspected and came under the

coverage of ESI Corporation and 6th respondent has paid

contribution from 6th May 2009. The Corporation in its admission

notice has laid down the admission policy for under graduate

admission. One of the criteria, clause 8 of the notice has defined

`insured person' for the purpose of availing ESIC management

quota. Clause 8 of the notice is as follows :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "8.    Insured Person for the purpose of availing
             benefit ESIC Management quota for his/her wards
             shall be, as under
             "The 'insured person' shall be an 'employee' as
             defined in the ESI Act; and he/she should have been
             in continuous insurable employment for a period of
             five years as on 1st January of the year of admission
             and should have paid at least 78 days of
             contribution in each contribution period, during this
             five year period."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">      4.    The petitioner's application was processed and the

petitioner was informed about the rejection by letter dated

19.8.2014.        The Corporation declined the request of the

petitioner's father to give a `ward of insured Person's certificate'

on the ground that he has not completed five years of

employment as on 1.1.2014. Challenging the said communication

and claiming that the petitioner is entitled for admission under

the said quota, she filed the writ petition praying for the following

reliefs:

          "i. Call for the records leading to Ext.P4 issued by the
              second respondent and quash the same by the
              issuance of a writ of certiorari or any other
              appropriate writ, order or direction;

<p id="p_8">          ii. a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ
              order or direction to the first respondent that
              consider and pass appropriate orders on Ext.P8
              representation forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         iii. a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate order or
              direction to the first respondent that allow the
              petitioner to attend counseling and admit the
              petitioner to the MBBS Degree course under the ESIC
              Management Quota reserved for the wards of
              insured persons.
</p>
<p id="p_10">         iv. a declaration that the petitioner is eligible for the
              admission to the MBBS Degree course under the
              ESIC Management Quota reserved for the wards of
              insured persons and issue a direction to the second
              and third respondents to issue Ext.P3 certificate to
              the petitioner."
</p>
<p id="p_11">      5.     The Corporation filed a counter affidavit in the writ

petition, where it was pleaded that the Corporation, as per clause

8 of the notice, has treated the ward of only those persons who

had completed continuous five years employment as insured

service as on 1.1.2014. The following was stated in paragraph 10

of the affidavit:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "It is submitted that as per the admission policy
              adopted for admission of wards of insured person for

              person shall be an employee as defined in the ESI Act
              and he/she should have been in continuous insurable
              employment for a period of five years as on the 1st

W.A. No.1412 of 2014

             January of the year of admission and should have paid
             at least 78 days of contribution in each contribution
             period during this five year period. In the instant case
             the insured person, Shri. K.K. Mathew has not qualified
             the eligibility conditions of five year continuous
             insurable employment for admission of his ward to the
             2014-15 academic sessions as the Act was applicable
             to the Hospital from 1.6.2009 onwards.           In this
             connection it is pertinent to mention here that the
             Inspectors who paid visit to the hospital on 7.8.2007
             had contacted Shri. K.K. Mathew, father of the
             petitioner for collecting the informations required for
             coverage.    Though the inspectors had advised to
             produce records for examine the applicability of the
             provisions under the Act, if implemented, he paid no
             heed to the request.       There is no merit in the
             contention of the petitioner that had the hospital been
             treated as covered from 06.09.2007 onwards based
             on the report of a prior inspection dated 07.08.2007,
             her father would have qualified the eligibility criteria
             of 5 years continuous insurable employment and she
             should have qualified for admission to MBBS course
             for 2014-15 academic sessions.         The hospital is
             coverable only from 01.06.2009 as is evident from
             the records produced herewith."</blockquote><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">      6. Learned Single Judge by the impugned judgment allowed

the writ petition and the petitioner is held to be entitled for

consideration for admission under the quota. The learned Single

Judge held that there is no mention in the prospectus that the

year has to be understood with reference to completion of 365

days. Learned Single Judge took the view that in the facts of the

case, the petitioner being the ward of a person who was insured

in the year 2009, should be treated as having fulfilled the

conditions      as  per    Employees      State    Insurance    (General)

W.A. No.1412 of 2014

Regulations, 1950. The Corporation is in appeal against the said

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       7.   Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the

Corporation has followed the terms and conditions of the

prospectus while refusing to give certificate to petitioner's father

as insured person since he has not completed five years of

insured service on 1.1.2014. It is submitted that clause 8 clearly

contemplates continuous insurable employment for a priod of five

years as on 1st January of the year of admission. He submits that

learned Single Judge has erred in holding that the petitioner has

fulfilled the conditions in clause 8.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       8. Learned counsel for the writ petitioner submits that in

clause 8, the year has not been defined and the definition of

"year" has to be taken as contained in <a href="/doc/72253990/" id="a_1">section 2(w)</a> of the

Employees State Insurance (General) Regulations, 1950. <a href="/doc/72253990/" id="a_2">Section

2(w)</a> is as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_16">           "2. Definitions.-      xx xx xx

           (w) "year" means a calendar year except when
                specifically stated otherwise."
</p>
<p id="p_17">       9. The admission notice Ext.P7 is a notice issued for laying

down the policy inviting applications for ward of insured persons

for admission to undergraduate course. The notice contains the

policy decision and guidelines finalised by the Corporation for

effecting admission.     The admission     to MBBS Course are not

undertaken under any provisions of the Regulations, 1950. The

very beginning of the words of clause 8 is "for the purpose of

availing benefit ESIC Management Quota".           The conditions of

clause 8 thus was specifically grafted for the purpose of availing

the benefit. The Corporation was free to choose any yardstick for

processing the application of the wards of insured persons. The

yardstick which has been chosen by the Corporation is "...... have

been in continuous insurable employment for a period of five

years as on the 1st January of the year of admission".

</p><p id="p_18">      10. The Two key words in clause 8 are to be specifically

noted as "continuous insurable employment" and " for a period of

five years as on the 1st January of the year of admission". The five

years has a prefix by word "period".          But 'period' has been

defined in Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar as follows :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          "Period. The word 'period' in <a href="/doc/48919051/" id="a_3">Section 11(5)</a> covers the
          whole period during which a dealer, being liable to pay
          tax, had wilfully failed to apply for registration and it
          does not mean the quarter for which return is to be filed.</blockquote><p id="p_19">

          reckoned. Seven days as a term for periodical payments
          (of wages, rent, or the like), or as a unit of reckoning for
          time of work or service".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">             15. In Webster's New World Dictionary (1962 Edition),
          the meaning of the word "week" is given as "a period of
          seven days, especially one beginning with Sunday and
          ending with Saturday; the hours or days of work in a
          seven-day period".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">             16. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Third Edition), it is
          stated that "(1) though a week usually means any
          consecutive seven days, it will sometimes be interpreted
          to mean the ordinary notion of a week reckoning from
          Sunday to Sunday and (2) probably, a week usually
          means seven clear days".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">             17. A "week" according to Halsbury's Laws of England
          (Third Edition) Vol. 37 at p. 84 is strictly the time between
          midnight on Saturday and the same hour on the next
          succeeding Saturday, but the term is also applied to any
          period of seven successive days.</blockquote><p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">             18. Bearing in mind the above mentioned dictionary or
          popular meaning of the term "week", we think that in the
          context of sub-sections (1) and (3) of <a href="/doc/103363665/" id="a_11">Section 5</a> of the Act,
          the term has to be taken to signify a cycle of seven days
          including Sundays. The language in which the aforesaid
          sub-sections are couched also shows that the Legislature
          intended that computation of maternity benefit is to be
          made for the entire period of the woman worker's actual
          absence i.e. for all the days including Sundays which may
          be wageless holidays falling within that period and not
          only for intermittent periods of six days thereby excluding
          Sundays falling within that period for if it were not so, the

          Legislature instead of using the words "for the period of
          her actual absence immediately preceding and including
          the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately
          following that day" would have used the words "for the
          working days falling within the period of her actual
          absence immediately preceding and including the day of
          her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that
          day but excluding the wageless days". Again the word
          "period" occurring in <a href="/doc/103363665/" id="a_12">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act is a strong
          word. It seems to emphasise, in our judgment, the
          continuous running of time and recurrence of the cycle of
          seven days. It has also to be borne in mind in this
          connection that in interpreting provisions of beneficial
          pieces of legislationlike the one in hand which is intended
          to achieve the object of doing social justice to women
          workers employed in the plantations and which squarely
          fall within the purview of <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_13">Article 42</a> of the Constitution,
          the beneficent rule of construction which would enable
          the woman worker not only to subsist but also to make up
          her dissipated energy, nurse her child, preserve her
          efficiency as a worker and maintain the level of her
          previous efficiency and output has to be adopted by the

<p id="p_34">      13. Admittedly, the institution from where the certificate

was applied came under the scheme only on 1.6.2009.             The

period of five years could be completed only on 31.5.2014 and 1st

January being the cut off date for scrutinising the application, no

error was committed by the Corporation in not issuing the

certificate to petitioner's parents. The learned Single Judge as

well as the writ petitioner has placed reliance on the definition of

"year" in <a href="/doc/72253990/" id="a_15">section 2(w)</a> of the Employees State Insurance

Regulation, 1950. The said definition of "year" is "year means a

calender year". The said definition in no manner militates clause

8 of the notice or on the interpretation which has been put up by

the Corporation, of the period. Where a period of continuous five

year has been contemplated in the notice, that obviously means

five completed calender years. The said definition also in no

manner help the writ petitioner.

<p id="p_35">      14.     We are of the view that the learned Single Judge

committed error in interpreting clause 8 in the manner as to hold

the writ petitioner eligible. The Corporation has formally followed

its criteria treating five years continuous period as on 1st January

with which no fault can be found.        In view of the aforesaid
