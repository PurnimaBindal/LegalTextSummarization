<p id="p_1">3/   13/12/2010               Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

                  Railways.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              The petitioner is aggrieved by order dated

                  6.10.2008     declining   to   make   a   reference   that   an

                  industrial dispute exists in exercise of powers under

                  Section-10(1) read with Section-12(5) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial

                  Disputes Act</a>, affirmed in revision by the Union of India

                  on 4.11.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                              It is submitted that the petitioner was selected

                  for appointment as Apprentice B.R.I. Grade-III in the pay

                  scale of Rs.1400-2300, but was found medically unfit.

                  Under the Railway Establishment Rules the petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                    -2-</span>




was offered an alternative post of Assistant Draftsman in

the scale of Rs.1200-2050. He accepted the same and

joined on 31.8.1988.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         Thereafter on 27.7.2000 he raised objection to

be considered for appointment on an equivalent post with

similar scale and benefits as that of B.R.I. Grade-III. The

impugned orders dated 6.10.2008 and 4.11.2009 were

unsustainable as they adopt a quasi judicial adjudicatory

approach while considering the request for a reference on

12.6.2007.   The    duties   of   the   respondents   were

administrative in nature to decide whether an industrial

dispute exists or not. By referring to matters of the

acceptance of his joining on a lower post, the authorities

have taken into consideration irrelevant materials which

vitiates the decision. Reliance is placed on AIR 1985 S.C.

860 (<a href="/doc/101565707/" id="a_2">The M.P. Irrigation Karamchari Sangh v. State of

M.P. and another</a>) and AIR 1985 S.C. 915 (<a href="/doc/455901/" id="a_3">Ram Avtar

Sharma and others v. State of Haryana and another</a>).

</p><p id="p_5">         Learned counsel for the Railways submits that

the petitioner submitted his joining on 31.8.1988, on the

alternative post offered to him in accordance with the

Railways Establishment Regulations. Once he joined the

post, he cannot be permitted to raise such issues nearly

12 years later. The order declining reference has been

considered in Revision also. The order declining the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                    -3-</span>




reference was administrative in nature and the reasons

mentioned cannot be stated to be not germane or

irrelevant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">          The petitioner was selected for the post of B.R.I.

Grade-III in the pay scale of Rs.1400-2300. Mere

selection did not vest a right to appointment in him. The

denial of appointment for medical reasons was never

questioned    by   the        petitioner.   It   stands    beyond

controversy that though he was found physically unfit to

discharge duties of a particular nature, carrying specified

duties,   considered     as     arduous     given   his   physical

condition. The respondents were under no obligation in

law to offer him an alternative employment. A person

selected but denied appointment on medical grounds

cannot claim that notwithstanding his medical disability

he still has a vested right to an alternative appointment

based on such selection. At best, he can only seek to be

considered for another post given his medical condition.

</p><p id="p_7">          The respondents offered the petitioner an

alternative   appointment        on    8.8.1998     clarifying   in

paragraph 9 of the offer that if it was acceptable to him

he should report by 22.8.1988 failing which the offer

would lapse. The petitioner had an option to deny

appointment on a lower post or submit joining under

protest. Quite obviously, conscious of his physical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         -4-</span>




infirmity the petitioner voluntarily opted to accept the

alternative appointment rather than to be faced with a

situation of no appointment at all. A bare reading of the

Railway Establishment Rules dealing with alternative

appointments       to    medically      unfit    staff      in   Clause-2

provides that any appointment is subject to the person

being medically fit for that category. It then goes on to

state that it may "consider requests" subject to fulfillment

of   prescribed          medical        standards,           educational

requirements       and        other   eligibility     criteria    in   the

alternative category. It is apparent that there is no vested

right for seeking appointment in the alternative category

and that too in the same pay scale. The candidate may

request. The respondents may or may not accept the

request. If the request is not accepted questions of

judicial review on the facts and circumstances of a case

may or may not arise. If the request is accepted and is

acted upon without protest or demur, 12 years is too long

a delay to seek to reopen issues.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            The Court has no hesitation in holding that

there existed sufficient administrative reason for which

reference    has   been        declined.    In      other    words,    the

impugned orders hold that if the petitioner was offered an

alternative employment and he accepted it, the passage

of long years when he continued on that post without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                    -5-</span>




protest was sufficient to decline a reference as being stale

in nature apart from issues of waiver.
</p>
<p id="p_9">           The case of Karamchari Sangh and Ram Avtar

(supra) relied upon by the petitioner holds that whether

to make a reference or not under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_4">Industrial Disputes

Act</a> was basically an administrative act. Therefore, if

while taking such an administrative decision, issues not

germane have been taken into consideration and relevant

materials do not find consideration, the administrative

decision   gets   vitiated   for   having    been    based    on

extraneous materials leaving out relevant considerations.

Each case therefore declining reference will have to be

decided on its own merits as to whether relevant

considerations    have   been      taken    into    account   or

extraneous materials have been relied upon. While

exercising this administrative power the appropriate

Government retains the authority to decide whether a

dispute exists or not, or whether the claims sought to be

raised in the nature of a dispute was frivolous or bogus

guided by the ultimate aim to maintain industrial peace

and harmony. Therefore, while considering a challenge to

an order declining reference it is not only the question of

the exercise of administrative discretion that has to be

kept in mind, but also the question of industrial peace. It

has also been noticed that if the appropriate Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                      -6-</span>




comes to the conclusion that the claim for a reference

was perverse or frivolous and did not merit a reference,

the appropriate Government could validly deny such

reference.
</p>
<p id="p_10">           The world today is stated to be a global village.

India is a market for the foreign economy as also a

contender for a seat in the foreign economy with its own

products. The standards that may have been relevant for

industrial adjudication years ago may not be very

relevant     today   and   may   require   rethinking   and

reconsideration so as to strike a balance between the

right of the workman and the opportunity to the industry

to flourish to meet global standards of competition.

</p><p id="p_11">           In the present case, it has already been held

that the petitioner has no vested right even under the

Railway Establishment Manual to claim an appointment

of equivalent pay-scale to B.R.I. Grade-III after he was

found medically unfit. Once he accepted the alternate

post offered on 8.8.1988 and joined on 31.8.1988,

without protest and continued to work as such till he

raised his protest, as contended on his behalf on

27.7.2000, this Court holds that 12 years was too long a

period of time to be considered adequate for reopening of

issues. At this stage, the Court is not concerned with the

correctness of the claims, but whether the claim could
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                   -7-</span>




have been raised at all. The petitioner accepted the offer

of appointment, joined the post, availed the benefits of

the post. Therefore, if he had any claims for an equivalent

post, he consciously waived it. Once he has waived it, he

cannot now urge it to question the very appointment

itself on 8.8.1988. He cannot have the benefit of the offer

of appointment, enjoy its privileges and yet challenge the

order. He is precluded from doing so.

<p id="p_12">         <a href="/doc/1821822/" id="a_5">In   State     of   Maharashtra   v.   Super   Max

International (P) Ltd</a>., reported in (2009) 9 SCC 772, at

page 794 : it has been held at paragraph-72 as follows:-

   "72. With the perspective thus adjusted, all the
   submissions made by Mr Lalit on behalf of the
   appellant have a simple answer. The interim order
   of the High Court asking the appellant to deposit
   Rs       5,40,000 from the date of the decree as
   condition for stay of the execution of the decree of
   ejectment has to be seen as one single package.
   The appellant may or may not accept the order as
   a whole. But it is not open to it to accept the order
   insofar as it stays the execution of the decree and
   to question the condition attached to it."

</p><p id="p_13">           On the question of waiver the Supreme Court

has held in <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_6">Babulal Badriprasad Varma v. Surat

Municipal Corpn</a>.,(2008) 12 SCC 401, at page 413 : at

paragraph-29 as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_14">    29. A person may waive a right either expressly or
   by necessary implication. He may in a given case
   disentitle himself from obtaining an equitable relief
   particularly when he allows a thing to come to an
   irreversible situation.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">         For like reasons, this Court does not uphold the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                      -8-</span>




submission of the petitioner that he had a right to be

considered for other equivalent posts in the scale of

1400-2300.
</p>
<p id="p_17">          The next submission of the petitioner that he

has been denied consideration for due seniority in the

category of Assistants vis-à-vis those who had joined after

him on 31.1.1988 does not impress the Court as the

Court is not satisfied that the petitioner had clearly and

explicitly raised this objection in his claim for reference.

The reliance to that effect in paragraph-7 and 8 leaves

this Court   dissatisfied that he had raised any specific

claim as an alternative for consideration of the reference

vis-à-vis his claim for appointment on equivalent post

and pay-scale as that of B.R.I. Grade-3 Assistant.

</p><p id="p_18">          In (2000) 2 SCC 455( NEDUNGADI BANK LTD.
</p>
<p id="p_19">Versus K.P. MADHAVANKUTTY AND OTHERS) the High

setting aside an order directing a reference under

Section-10 of the Industrial Disputes Act seven years

from the date of the cause of action based on a dismissal

held that though the law does not prescribe any time

limit for exercising power under Section-10 of the Act,

nonetheless, it could not have exercised it in attempt to

revive matters which have been settled. A stale dispute

could not have been revived by giving it a fresh life. What

would   be   stale    would   depend   on   the   facts   and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                        -9-</span>




     circumstances of each case as held at paragraph-7:-

</p><p id="p_20">               "In the present appeal it is not the case of
        the respondent that the disciplinary proceedings,
        which resulted in his dismissal, were in any way
        illegal or there was even any irregularity. He
        availed his remedy of appeal under the rules
        governing his conditions of service. It could not be
        said that in the circumstances an industrial
        dispute did arise or was even apprehended after a
        lapse of about seven years of the dismissal of the
        respondent. Whenever a workman raises some
        dispute it does not become an industrial dispute
        and the appropriate Government cannot in a
        mechanical fashion make the reference of the
        alleged dispute terming it as an industrial dispute.
        The central Government lacked power to make
        reference both on the ground of delay in invoking
        the power under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_7">Section 10</a> of the Act and there
        being no industrial dispute existing or even
        apprehended. The purpose of reference is to keep
        industrial peace in an establishment. The present
        reference is destructive to the industrial peace and
        defeats the very object and purpose of the Act. The
        Bank was justified in thus moving the High Court
        seeking an order to quash the reference in
        question."
</p>
<p id="p_21">              In the present case the petitioner has joined on

     31.8.1988. The request for a reference has been made on

     9.5.2007 after a delay of nearly 19 years.

</p><p id="p_22">              The Court therefore finds no merit in this

     application which is accordingly dismissed.
