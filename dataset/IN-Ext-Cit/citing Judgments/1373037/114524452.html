tribunal/ authority, whose order is assailed before the High Court.

The referral order in the present case has expressed its

disagreement            with     the   view   that    without         impleading           the

court/ tribunal/ authority passing such order, a writ of certiorari

would not be maintainable. It further holds that the observations

which are posed in negative language, have given rise to the

aforesaid question which is required to be considered by the Larger

Constitution of India in relation to a dispute between the two

private parties, (iv) in the absence of impleadment of the

Judicial/Civil Court which passed the order impugned, a petition or

an application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_8">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India cannot

be dismissed as not maintainable, and (v) the true scope of a writ

of certiorari under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is merely

to demolish the offending order and it goes against a record which

can be brought up only through human agency, from whosoever

has the custody thereof, and the presence of the offender before

the Court, though proper, is not necessary for the exercise of

jurisdiction or to render its determination effective. It is conceded

that there is an exception, where a tribunal or authority is required

to defend its own order in the proceedings as a prosecutor, in that

case, either one of the parties to the proceedings may apply for

impleadment or such a party may suo motu approach the Court for

impleadment therein or the High Court may in exercise its

discretion, direct impleadment of such tribunal or authority as the

respondent and failing to comply with it, dismiss the proceedings.

issuance of a writ of certiorari under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

of India would be maintainable against the order passed by the

Judicial/Civil Court, subordinate to the High Court. Placing reliance

to the order passed by the Judicial/Civil Court, subordinate to the

High Court, in the proceedings for execution of a decree was

negatived in a writ petition, styled as one under Articles 226 and

227 of the Constitution of India. Hence, the first question to be

considered is whether a petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is maintainable,

challenging         the         order   passed   by    the      Judicial/Civil         Court,

subordinate to the High Court, and if the answer is in the

affirmative, then only the second question would be whether in the

absence of such Judicial/Civil Court or its Presiding Officer being

joined as party respondent in the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India would be maintainable.

           (2)      If the answer is in the negative, whether the
           Judicial/Civil Court or its Presiding Officer becomes a
           necessary party and in the absence of it, a writ petition is
           required to be dismissed as not maintainable?,

Adjudication in respect of Question Nos.(1) and (2) :
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">7.         In the decision of the Apex Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/34295630/" id="a_18">Radhey Shyam and another v. Chhabi Nath and others</a>, reported in

(2015) 5 SCC 423, the question referred for the decision of the

Larger Bench of the Apex Court was whether the view taken by the

Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1016548/" id="a_19">Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai</a>,

reported in (2003) 6 SCC 675, that a writ lies under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India against the order of the Civil Court, which

has been doubted in the reference order, is the correct law.

The view taken in the case of Surya Dev Rai that - (i) the

distinction between Articles 226 and 227 stood almost obliterated,

and (ii) a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a> was maintainable against

the order of the Civil Court, has been completely overruled in

Radhey Shyam's case.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                     'it has been suggested that certiorari might be
               granted to quash them for want of jurisdiction (Kemp v.
               Balne, Dow &amp; L at p. 887), inasmuch as an error did not
               lie upon that ground. But there appears to be no
               reported case in which the judgment of an
               inferior        court    of        civil    jurisdiction            has      been
               quashed          on     certiorari,           either          for     want        of
               jurisdiction or on any other ground (Halsbury
               Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 11, p. 129)'. The
               ultimate proposition is set out in the terms:
               'Certiorari does not lie to quash the judgment of
               inferior        courts        of     civil      jurisdiction'.             These
               observations would indicate that in England the
               judicial orders passed by civil courts of plenary
               jurisdiction in or in relation to matters brought
               before them are not held to be amenable to the

          the writ jurisdiction and has dealt with the question about
          the meaning of the word 'inferior' as applied to courts of
          law in England in discussing the problem as to the issue of
          the writ in regard to decisions of certain courts. 'The more
          this     matter      was   investigated',    says      wrottesley,          L.J.:
          (KB pp. 205-06)


                     '... the clearer it became that the word 'inferior' as
               applied to courts of law in England had been used with
               at least two very different meanings.                    If, as some
               assert, the question of inferiority is determined by
               ascertaining whether the court in question can be
               stopped from exceeding its jurisdiction by a writ of
               prohibition issuing from the King's Bench, then not only
               the ecclesiastical courts, but also palatine courts and
               admiralty courts are inferior courts.                  But there is
               another test, well recognised by lawyers, by which to
               distinguish a superior from an inferior court, namely,
               whether in its proceedings, and in particular in its
               judgments, it must appear that the court was acting
               within its jurisdiction.    This is the characteristic of an
               inferior court, whereas in the proceedings of a superior
               court it will be presumed that it acted within its
               jurisdiction unless the contrary should appear either on
               the face of the proceedings or aliunde.'


          Mr Sen relied upon this decision to show that even the
          High Court of Bombay can be said to be an inferior court
          for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction by this Court
          under <a href="/doc/1566826/" id="a_24">Article 32(2)</a> to issue a writ of certiorari in respect of
          the impugned order passed by it. We are unable to see

the writ of certiorari is to quash the order and not to substitute its

own decision on merits or to give direction to comply with by a

court or a tribunal.            It merely demolishes the offending order,

which it considers to be suffering from the jurisdictional error, and

the presence of the offender before the Court, though proper, is

not necessary for the exercise of jurisdiction or to render its

determination effective.           It is directed against the record, which

can be brought up only through human agency, and merely

          adjudicating authority may be nomenclatured as a tribunal
          but the said authority(ies) are different that pure and
          simple adjudicating authorities and that is why they are
          called the authorities.        An Income Tax Commissioner,
          whatever rank he may be holding, when he adjudicates, he
          has to be made a party, for, he can defend his order. He is
          entitled to contest.        There are many authorities under
          many a statute. Therefore, the proposition that can safely
          be culled out is that the authorities or the tribunals, who in
          law are entitled to defend the orders passed by them, are
          necessary parties and if they are not arrayed as parties,

           the writ petition can be treated to be not maintainable or
           the court may grant liberty to implead them as parties in
           exercise of its discretion. There are tribunals which are not
           at all required to defend their own order, and in that case
           such tribunals need not be arrayed as parties.                  To give
           another example:--in certain enactments, the District
           Judges function as Election Tribunals from whose orders a
           revision or a writ may lie depending upon the provisions in
           the Act. In such a situation, the superior court, that is the
           High Court, even if required to call for the records, the
           District Judge need not be a party. Thus, in essence, when
           a tribunal or authority is required to defend its own order, it
           is to be made a party failing which the proceeding before
           the High Court would be regarded as not maintainable."

holds that a writ petition can be held to be not maintainable, if a

case has expressed its disagreement with such a view with reasons

in support of it and we concur with it.                     Normally, being a

co-ordinate Full Bench, it will not be open for us on judicial

discipline and propriety to hold that the Full Bench decision in

Ramchandra Rangari's case is per incuriam and we will have to

refer the matter to a larger Bench.

</p><p id="p_51">20.        In the facts and circumstances of this case and the decision

of the Apex Court in Jogendrasinhji's case rendered subsequent to

the     decision          of    the   Full   Bench     of       this      Court         in

Ramchandra Rangari's case, covering the entire controversy,

in our view, it is permissible for us to hold that the decision in

Ramchandra Rangari's case no longer remains a good law. In our

view, it depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case as

to whether the tribunal or the authority which passed an order is a

necessary party, without which the petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_78">Article 226</a> or

227 of the Constitution of India seeking a writ of certiorari is

required to be dismissed. When a tribunal or an authority is

required to defend its order, it is to be made a party, failing which

the proceedings before the High Court would be regarded as not

maintainable.          Obviously, in such a case also, the party can be

given an opportunity to join such court/ tribunal/ authority as a

party respondent.
