company and is involved in the manufacturing of a famous toilet cleaner
under the trademark ‗HARPIC&#x27; in India since 2001. It is stated that HARPIC
is a household name in the category of toilet cleaners and the most widely
used toilet cleaner brand in the country. It is pointed out that the plaintiff is
the registered proprietor of the word mark ‗HARPIC&#x27; in class 3 bearing
registration No.347055 dated 15.03.1979. Details of registrations of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                 Page 2 of 33</span>
 trademark are given in para 17 of the plaint. It is also stated that apart from
the above registrations, the plaintiff has also filed applications for
registration of the unique and distinctive bottle shape of the plaintiff&#x27;s
HARPIC branded products in India in class 1 and in class 5. The
applications are pending before the Trade Mark Registry.
</p><p id="p_4">3.     The present dispute concerns an alleged advertisement blitzkrieg by
the defendant allegedly to vilify, denigrate and defame the plaintiff&#x27;s
HARPIC toilet cleaner. It is stated that five advertisements have been
launched by the defendant over the weekend which completely trash the
plaintiff&#x27;s HARPIC brand, declaring it to be ineffective and useless for the
purposes that it is used for. It is stated that the advertisement campaign is
designed to ride upon the goodwill and reputation of the ‗HARPIC&#x27; branded
toilet cleaner of the plaintiff, a product which represents 77.2% value market
share for toilet cleaners, and inviting consumers to substitute the same with
the defendant&#x27;s DOMEX, a product which has a mere 5.3% market share.
</p><p id="p_5">4.     The first advertisement is a Television Commercial which was
launched on 23.07.2021 (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;TVC&#x27;). The

</blockquote><p id="p_6"> 5.     It is claimed that the impugned advertisement is designed to denigrate
and defame the plaintiff&#x27;s HARPIC branded toilet cleaners. The clear
portrayal is that use of HARPIC leads to bad odour and smell in the
bathroom. The impugned advertisement ridicules HARPIC consumers and
prompts them to immediately shift their preferences to DOMEX. It gives a
wrong portrayal that HARPIC has already been rejected by a majority of
consumers who have shifted their preference to DOMEX.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                It is stated that the above advertisement once again seeks

DOMEX in India in 1997 with its focus on fighting the war against India&#x27;s
sanitation issue as it aids in killing germs including bacteria, virus and fungi.
It is urged that the defendant continuously undertakes extensive research and
development to improve its products. It is stated that the defendant
recognized the consumer need in the market to tackle the issue of malodour
in toilet cleaners. In order to tackle the said issue, it is claimed that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                  Page 8 of 33</span>
 defendant in 2015 - 2016 came up with the unique technology which helps
in making the hard surfaces such as that of a toilet bowl, hydrophobic. This
technology does not let odour causing liquids to stick to the toilet bowl, and
thereby tackles the malodour emanating from such toilet bowls. Such
technology also helps in fighting with bacteria longer and thus provides a
better long lasting hygienic solution. This technology was provided by using
a chemical compound called Silane. The hydrophobic qualities of Silane are
said to be well known. It is urged that due to the novelty of the said
technology, the defendant applied for a patent for the same through its
parent company Unilever PLC and has been granted a patent registration in
relation to the same. Further, the defendant through a known independent
laboratory, TUV SUD South Asia Pvt. Ltd., tested the said product in
comparison to the plaintiff&#x27;s product. It is urged that as per the test
conducted, the defendant&#x27;s product due to its patented technology fights
odour causing fluids from sticking to the toilet bowl in turn resulting in
fighting malodour better. The plaintiff&#x27;s product does not contain any water
repellent technology. The defendant upon being satisfied with the
performance of its products, ―Domex FreshGuard‖ in order to inform the
general public about the benefits and special feature of its product, decided
to release a television commercial for the defendant&#x27;s product showcasing
and promoting the same. The story board of the TVC as released and
reproduced by the defendant in reply to the application is as follows: -

plaintiff&#x27;s toothpaste Colgate Dental Cream Strong Teeth and as to whether
the impugned advertisements tarnish, slander and defame the worth and

       he can certainly compare the advantages of his goods over the
       goods of the competitor. What is prohibited is for the trader to
       say that his competitor&#x27;s goods are bad. Defamation of the
       competitor&#x27;s goods is not permissible. Defamation can give rise
       to an action for the recovery of damages and in such

       and its detailed analysis of the words used or the expressions of
       the mothers and attributing a message to them, is in our opinion,
       not the correct way to view any advertisement. The
       advertisement must be viewed in its entirety and it is not
       necessary to dissect each word or expression. In the case of
       McDonald&#x27;s <a href="/doc/28580737/" id="a_3">Hamburgers Ltd v. Burgerking (UK) Ltd</a>.: [1986]
       F.S.R. 45, the Chancery Division stressed that the advertisement

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">       46. The relevant question to be asked is what is the story line of

       that it leaves with the consumers/prospective consumers. In the
       case of <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_4">Pepsi Co., Inc. and Ors. v. Hindustan Coca Cola Ltd.

       of the commercial and the message sought to be conveyed by
       the commercial. These factors were further clarified by a

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">           In this context it must be kept in mind that while promoting
           its product, the advertiser may, while comparing it with a

           comparison but that might not necessarily affect the story
           line and message of the advertised product or have that as its
           overall effect.

       Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>. (supra), it is also important to
       examine the storyline and the message that the impugned TVC
       conveys to an average person who is a consumer or a
       prospective consumer of the products that are advertised. An
       average person cannot be assumed to be gullible and is
       presumed to have the ability to ignore puffery. However, an
       average viewer is likely to accept the factual representations
       that are conveyed by an advertisement if the same are conveyed
       as serious statements of fact and not as hyperbole. An average
       viewer does not analyse an advertisement and is likely to be
       receptive to the message that the advertisement projects. A
       similar view has been articulated by a Single judge of this Court
       in Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Limited and others
       v. Heinz India Private Limited and another: I.A.

       is directed to be deleted from the impugned TVC or at the

marketing of a mosquito repellent cream under the brand name of odomos
by the appellant. The defendant was also manufacturing a mosquito repellent
cream under the brand name of ‗Goodnight Naturals&#x27;. The Co-ordinate
Bench of this court rejected the application for injunction and hence, the

       what is ―commercial speech‖ was not defined or explained. In

        explain ―commercial speech‖ and, in any event, for the purposes
       of this case it is not necessary for us to do so. The reason for
       this is that the Supreme Court has said in Tata Press Ltd.
       (paragraph 23 of the Report) that advertising as a ―commercial
       speech‖ has two facets thereby postulating that an
       advertisement is a species of commercial speech. The Supreme
       Court further said as follows:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">           ―23. ....Advertising which is no more than a commercial
           transaction is nonetheless dissemination of information
           regarding the product advertised. Public at large is benefited
           by the information made available through the
           advertisement. In a democratic economy free flow of
           commercial information is indispensable. There cannot be
           honest and economical marketing by the public at large
           without being educated by the information disseminated
           through advertisements. The economic system in a
           democracy would be handicapped without there being
           freedom of &quot;commercial speech&quot;.....‖

       of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council Inc.,
       (1975) 421 US 748 and observed in paragraph 15 that it is
       almost settled law in the United States that though ―commercial
       speech‖ is entitled to the First Amendment protection, the
       Government was completely free to recall ―commercial speech‖
       which is false, misleading, unfair, deceptive and which proposes
       illegal transactions.

       (1999) 7 SCC 1, the Supreme Court observed in paragraph 36
       of the Report that a distinction would always have to be made
       and latitude given for an advertisement to gain a purchaser or
       two. This latitude cannot and does not mean any permission for
       misrepresentation but only a description of permissible
       assertion. In this context, reliance was placed by the Supreme
       Court on Anson&#x27;s Law of Contract (27th Edn.) which says that
       commendatory expressions are not dealt with as serious




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                Page 21 of 33</span>
        representations of fact. The view remains the same in the 28th
       Edition (page 239). ―A similar latitude is allowed to a person
       who wants to gain a purchaser, though it must be admitted that
       the borderline of permissible assertion is not always easily
       discernible.‖

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">       13. The Supreme Court recognized and applied in Colgate
       Palmolive (India) Ltd. the rule of civil law, ―simplex
       commendatio non obligat‖ - simple commendation can only be
       regarded as a mere invitation to a customer without any
       obligation as regards the quality of goods. It was observed that
       every seller would naturally try and affirm that his wares are
       good enough to be purchased (if not better than those of a rival).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">       14. On the basis of the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the
       guiding principles for us should be the following:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">           (i) An advertisement is commercial speech and is protected
           by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_11">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">           (ii) An advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair
           or deceptive.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">           (iii) Of course, there would be some grey areas but these
           need not necessarily be taken as serious representations of
           fact but only as glorifying one&#x27;s product.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">       To this extent, in our opinion, the protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_12">Article 19(1)(a)</a>
       of the Constitution is available. However, if an advertisement
       extends beyond the grey areas and becomes a false, misleading,
       unfair or deceptive advertisement, it would certainly not have
       the benefit of any protection.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">       15. There is one other decision that we think would give some
       guidance and that is <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_13">Pepsi Co. Inc. &amp; Ors. v. Hindustan Coca
       Cola Ltd. &amp; Another</a>, 2003 (27) PTC 305 (Del.) (DB). In this

       boasting about one&#x27;s product is permissible, disparaging a rival

        product is not. The fourth guiding principle for us, therefore, is:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">       (iv) While glorifying its product, an advertiser may not
       denigrate or disparage a rival product. Similarly, in Halsbury&#x27;s
       Laws of England (Fourth Edition Reissue, Volume 28) it is
       stated in paragraph 278 that ―[It] is actionable when the words
       go beyond a mere puff and constitute untrue statements of fact
       about a rival&#x27;s product.‖ This view was followed, amongst
       others, in <a href="/doc/1357815/" id="a_14">Dabur India Ltd. v. Wipro Limited, Bangalore</a>, 2006
       (32) PTC 677 (Del). ―[It] is one thing to say that the defendant&#x27;s
       product is better than that of the plaintiff and it is another thing
       to say that the plaintiff&#x27;s product is inferior to that of the
       defendant.‖

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">       16. In Pepsi Co. it was also held that certain factors have to be
       kept in mind while deciding the question of disparagement.
       These factors are: (i) Intent of the commercial, (ii) Manner of
       the commercial, and (iii) Story line of the commercial and the
       message sought to be conveyed. While we generally agree with
       these factors, we would like to amplify or restate them in the
       following terms:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">           (1) The intent of the advertisement - this can be understood
           from its story line and the message sought to be conveyed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">           (2) The overall effect of the advertisement - does it promote
           the advertiser&#x27;s product or does it disparage or denigrate a
           rival product?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">       In this context it must be kept in mind that while promoting its
       product, the advertiser may, while comparing it with a rival or a
       competing product, make an unfavourable comparison but that
       might not necessarily affect the story line and message of the
       advertised product or have that as its overall effect.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">           (3) The manner of advertising - is the comparison by and
           large truthful or does it falsely denigrate or disparage a rival
           product? While truthful disparagement is permissible,
           untruthful disparagement is not permissible.

       notwithstanding the impact that a telecast may have, since
       commercial speech is protected and an advertisement is
       commercial speech, an advertiser must be given enough room to
       play around in (the grey areas) in the advertisement brought out
       by it. A plaintiff (such as the Appellant before us) ought not to
       be hyper-sensitive as brought out in Dabur India. This is
       because market forces, the economic climate, the nature and
       quality of a product would ultimately be the deciding factors for
       a consumer to make a choice. It is possible that aggressive or
       catchy advertising may cause a partial or temporary damage to
       the plaintiff, but ultimately the consumer would be the final
       adjudicator to decide what is best for him or her.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57">       20. Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted before us that
       since his client has over 80% of the market share in the country
       and a 100% market share in some States, the obvious target of
       the commercial is the product of the Appellant. In our opinion,
       this argument cannot be accepted. The sub-text of this argument
       is an intention to create a monopoly in the market or to entrench
       a monopoly that the Appellant claims it already has. If this
       argument were to be accepted, then no other mosquito repellant
       cream manufacturer would be able to advertise its product,
       because in doing so, it would necessarily mean that the
       Appellant&#x27;s product is being targeted. All that we are required
       to ascertain is whether the commercial denigrates the
       Appellant&#x27;s product or not. There is nothing in the commercial
       to suggest a negative content or that there is a disparagement of
       the Appellant&#x27;s product. The commercial merely gives the
       virtues of the product of the Respondents, namely, that it has
       certain ingredients which perhaps no other mosquito repellant
       cream has, such as tulsi, lavender and milk protein. While
       comparing its product with any other product, any advertiser
       would naturally highlight its positive points but this cannot be
       negatively construed to mean that there is a disparagement of a
       rival product. That being so, whether the Appellant&#x27;s product is
       targeted or not becomes irrelevant.

           better than his competitors&#x27;, say that his competitors&#x27; goods
           are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods of his

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">           (e) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the

           such defamation an action lies and if an action lies for
           recovery of damages for defamation, then the Court is also
           competent to grant an order of injunction restraining
           repetition of such defamation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_65">       These propositions have been accepted by learned Single
       Judges of this Court in several cases, but in view of the law laid
       down by the Supreme Court in Tata Press that false, misleading,
       unfair or deceptive advertising is not protected commercial
       speech, we are of the opinion that propositions (a) and (b) above
       and the first part of proposition (c) are not good law. While
       hyped-up advertising may be permissible, it cannot transgress
       the grey areas of permissible assertion, and if does so, the

        advertiser must have some reasonable factual basis for the
       assertion made. It is not possible, therefore, for anybody to
       make an off-the-cuff or unsubstantiated claim that his goods are
       the best in the world or falsely state that his goods are better
       than that of a rival.‖

of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/82898733/" id="a_16">Dabur India Limited v. Emami Ltd</a>., 2019 SCC

the ‗ZANDU CHYAVANPRASHAD&#x27; advertisement which was said to be
disparaging and injurious to the goodwill and reputation of Chyawanprash

<blockquote id="blockquote_67">           ―11. From the law discussed above it appears to me that the

<blockquote id="blockquote_68">           I) A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in
           the world, even though the declaration is untrue.

            better than his competitors&#x27;, say that his competitors&#x27; goods
           are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods of his
           competitors. In other words he defames his competitors and
           their goods, which is not permissible.

<blockquote id="blockquote_72">           V) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the
           manufacturer of such goods no action lies, but if there is
           such defamation an action lies and if an action lies for
           recovery of damages for defamation, then the Court is also
           competent to grant an order of injunction restraining
           repetition of such defamation.‖
                                       xxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">       28. From the reading of the above noted judgement, it emerges
       that the Court has to necessarily examine the intent and overall
       effect of the advertisement. The &quot;look and feel&quot; of an
       advertisement and the message conveyed by the story line to an
       average person, are the critical factors which assist the Court to
       come to a right conclusion. If one were to view the proposed
       modified print advertisement, it can be clearly discerned that the
       Plaintiff&#x27;s product is not the subject matter of comparison. The
       comparison is with Chyawanprash as a generic product. As
       discussed earlier the law permits comparison. While making a
       comparison, a competitor can declare his goods to be the best in
       the world even though the declaration is untrue, however, while
       claiming that its goods are better than his competitor, he cannot
       say that the competitor&#x27;s goods are bad. Thus, puffery is
       allowed, but slander and defamation of the goods of the
       competitor is impermissible. The proposed Print advertisement
       is only making a comparison with the generic product
       ―Chyawanprash‖ where a declaration is being given that the
       product of the Defendant does not contain sugar. The impugned
       advertisement in its modified version is highlighting the
       benefits of the sugar free variant. Plaintiff&#x27;s contention that
       Chyawanprash has been shown to be bad or unhealthy is
       misplaced. The way I see it, the modified advertisement only
       gives the information and a choice or option to the
       viewers/consumers who would like to buy a product that is
       giving the benefit of Chyawanprash without sugar. The




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                Page 27 of 33</span>
        comparison in the present case is inevitable. The benefit of a
       product without sugar can be best showcased by juxtaposing
       with the variant that has sugar in it. The question whether the
       sugar free variant is indeed a healthier option, is being left for
       the consumer to decide. But, certainly it cannot be said that the
       advertisement is in any manner implying disparagement of
       ―Chyawanprash‖ generically.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_21">21.    The broad legal position that follows from the above judgments of the
Division Bench of this court are that the advertisement must not be false,
misleading, unfair or deceptive. There may be some grey areas but these
need not necessarily be taken as serious representation of facts but only as
glorifying one&#x27;s product. If advertisement extends beyond the grey areas and
becomes false, misleading, unfair or deceptive advertisement, it would not
be entitled the benefit of any protection. In comparative advertising, the
comparing of one&#x27;s goods with that of the other and establishing the
superiority of one&#x27;s goods over the other is permissible. However one
cannot make a statement that a good is bad, inferior or undesirable as that
would lead to denigrating or defaming the goods of the other.
</p><p id="p_22">22.    I may see the facts of this case. The TVC frames have been
reproduced as above. I have also perused the TVC in court. A perusal of the
TVC as a whole shows that it essentially seeks to claim that to remove bad
odour, DOMEX is a better solution. It does not denigrate, disparage or
malign the product of the plaintiff. Vehement submissions are made by
learned senior counsel for the plaintiff to urge that the said TVC depicts a
departmental store which is virtually full of the defendant&#x27;s product
DOMEX while on the other hand, the product of the plaintiff is shown in a
small corner. It is also urged that a perusal of the TVC shows that the person




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                Page 28 of 33</span>
 in question first picks up a HARPIC bottle and on questioning from her
child is shown to get confused and picks up the DOMEX bottle. In my
opinion, the advertisement as a whole does not seek to prima facie denigrate
the product of the plaintiff, nor does it disparage the product of the plaintiff.
As noted above, an advertiser has to be given enough room to play around in
the advertisement. A plaintiff ought not to be hypersensitive to such an
advertisement. In my opinion, the plaintiff has failed to make out any prima
facie case regarding the TVC.
</p><p id="p_23">23.    The second, fourth and fifth advertisements are as follows:
</p>



<blockquote id="blockquote_74">                                                                         ,




                                                                          , and

        It is stated that in the above advertisement, the HARPIC bottle is
clearly identifiable and termed as an ‗ordinary toilet cleaner&#x27;.</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">       The said advertisement allegedly depicts an ordinary toilet cleaner
and claims that the product of the defendant is much superior. It was stated
by learned senior counsel for the defendant that the bottle represented in the
advertisement as an ordinary toilet cleaner does not in any manner pertain to
the plaintiff&#x27;s product as it is a generic bottle used by various toilet cleaners
in the market. The defendant has also sought to rely upon their patent which
is a subject matter of patent No.368377 to claim that the patent of the
defendant results in a product which is a unique solution containing Silane
which ensures that the surface of the toilet bowl becomes hydrophobic and
does not let any odour causing liquids to stick to the toilet bowl thereby
fighting malodour emanating from such toilet bowls. It is urged based on
this that the defendant is only narrating actual facts i.e. the technical
superiority of its product.
</p><p id="p_25">24.    The above plea was denied by the learned senior counsel for the
plaintiff who submitted that the said shape of the bottle is registered by the
plaintiff and that the said act clearly seeks to denigrate and defame the
product of the plaintiff. He has also stated that the alleged patented product




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                  Page 30 of 33</span>
 of the defendant does not in any manner, enhance the quality of the product
of the defendant. It is urged that the said contention of the defendant is a
false representation as no such extra cleaning takes place on account of the
noted product.
</p><p id="p_26">25.    I may look at the plaint in question. Relevant portion of para 17 of the
plaint which spells out the registration of marks by the plaintiff reads as
follows:

       A comparison of the bottles depicted in the impugned print
advertisement, being the second, fourth and the fifth advertisements, prima
facie show that the same is deceptively similar to the mark that has been
duly registered by the plaintiff in class 3 on 22.02.2017 and in class 5 on the
same date. In view of this fact, it is manifest that the said three
advertisements, namely, the second, fourth and the fifth seek to depict a
mark, which is deceptively similar to the mark of the plaintiff and further
seeks to announce that the said cleaner contained in the depicted bottle is an
ordinary toilet cleaner and is apparently unable to remove the stains /
malodour in a toilet.
</p><p id="p_30">26.    The defendant however, relies on its patented product to state that its
claim in the advertisement is correct. In my opinion, these are disputed
questions of facts. The onus to prove that the toilet cleaner of the defendant
is technically superior to that of the plaintiff is an issue for which the onus is
on the defendant. At this stage, without evidence having being led, it is not
possible to conclude that the product of the defendant is superior to that of
the plaintiff as claimed by defendant.
</p><p id="p_31">27.    A bare perusal of the second, fourth and fifth advertisements shows



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">IA No.8999/2021 in CS(COMM) 340/2021                                  Page 32 of 33</span>
 that prima facie the said advertisements seek to denigrate and malign the
product of the plaintiff as contained in the alleged generic bottle.
</p><p id="p_32">28.    As far as the 3rd print advertisement is concerned, I have already
passed an interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff on 30.07.2021. I see
no reason to change my said view.
</p><p id="p_33">29.    The averments made in the four advertisements, namely, second,
third, fourth and fifth, in my opinion, prima facie, at this stage, appear to
disparage the product of the plaintiff. As noted above, the defendant while
promoting its product cannot be permitted to denigrate or disparage the
product of a rival. Balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiff. I
accordingly restrain the defendant from publishing the four advertisements
on any forum till they remove all references to the product of the plaintiff
i.e. ‗HARPIC&#x27; or the bottle in question, which is deceptively similar to the
registered mark of the plaintiff.
