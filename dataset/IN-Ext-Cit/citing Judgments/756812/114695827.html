i.e. House no. 2448­49, Jahangir Puri, Delhi, where they found that one lady namely 

Sheetal had hanged herself after tieing one end of chunni on her neck and the other 

end of chunni from  the ceiling fan,  after bolting the door from inside, in a room on 

the   ground floor of the said house.   ASI Ram Kishan got opened the door and 

further had crime team inspect the scene of crime.  He also got photographs  of the 

body as well as spot taken by the photographer of crime team.  SDM Model Town 

was informed telephonically.  Thereafter, the dead body was brought down,  after 

untieing the chunni from ceiling fan, and the body along with chunni was shifted  to 

the   mortuary   of   BJRM   Hospital   through   Ct.   Amar   Singh.   On   31.3.2009,   SDM 

directed ASI Ram Kishan to call the relatives of the deceased and  on the same day, 

Ganga Parasad, Tau of the deceased visited the office of SDM and stated that he 

was  having  three  sons  and  as he was not having any daughter, he had adopted 

Sheetal and Rakhi, daughters of his younger brother Ranbir, since their childhood, 

in the presence of his relatives and that he got married Sheetal with accused Parveen 

Khateek  son  of Babu Ram Khateek on 18.2.2006 according to Hindu Rites and 

customs and out of the said wedlock, two children were born.  He further stated that 

in the said marriage, he gave dowry beyond his capacity, but from the very second 

day of marriage, accused Parveen, his mother Rajeshwari and his father Babu Ram 

stated harassing her daughter and taunting about the quality of the dowry articles 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 2/ 48

and this behaviour of accused persons  continued  with his daughter and that they 

used to demand a motorcycle and that all the three accused used to beat his daughter 

and all these facts were told to him via telephone and that on hearing this, he along 

with his wife and Sumitra­real  mother (biological mother) of deceased went to the 

matrimonial   house   of   deceased,   but   Parveen   and   his   parents   got   infuriated   and 

started abusing and manhandling them.   He further stated that since his daughter 

was repeatedly beaten and harassed by the accused persons, at last, on 12.11.2007, 

his daughter made a complaint to the PS Jahangir Puri and that his daughter often 

gave   him   telephone   calls   and   told   him   to   give   money   to   her     inlaws   and   she 

apprehended that otherwise they would kill her and that inlaws of his daughter  used 

to  ask her to bring a motorcycle and  money for installments of the TSR and on her 

refusal to bring money, she was beaten up by all the accused.  He further stated that 

when his daughter tried to make  the accused persons understand and expressed her 

inability to bring money from her parents, she was again beaten up.  He suspected 

that either Parveen and his parents had killed his daughter for the  greed of money, 

otherwise, Sheetal had hanged herself because of torture and harassment meted out 

to   her   by   the   accused   Parveen   and   his   parents.       He   further   deposed   that   on 

30.3.2009, at about 8.00 pm, one neighbour of accused Parveen  made a call to him 

and told him that his daughter had hanged herself and that Parveen was also lying in 

an unconscious condition and that on receiving said information, he along with his 

family members reached at the matrimonial house of his daughter and found that 

Addl. SHO had  locked the main gate of the house  and the body of his daughter had

reached BJRM Hospital and found the dead body of his daughter.  He  prayed that 

necessary   action   be   taken   against   accused   Pareveen   and   his   parents.  After 

completion of the inquest proceedings and  postmortem, the dead body of deceased 

was handed over to her relatives and thereafter, the   Executive Magistrate, vide

adopted deceased Sheetal @ Rajni and her younger sister Rakhi @ Lali, during their 

childhood.   He deposed that he had three sons, but was not having any daughter and 

thus adopted both the daughters of his younger brother Ranbir, as his said brother 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 5/ 48

did not have a good financial capacity.  He further deposed that he had married his 

daughter Sheetal to Praveen Khatik son of Babu Ram Khatik and Rajeshwari on 

18.02.2006, according to Hindu rites and customs,  and that one son and daughter 

were born from their wedlock.  He then deposed that though at the time of marriage 

of his daughter Sheetal, he had given sufficient dowry articles to accused persons, 

beyond his capacity,   at the time of departure of doli (Bidai) accused Babu Ram 

asked   PW­1, why he had not given a motorcycle in dowry.   PW­1 expressed his 

inability to arrange the same due to financial constraints and expenditures which 

were   to   be   incurred   by   him   in   the   marriage   of   his   son,   which   was   fixed   for 

19.2.2006.  At that time,  matter was settled with the intervention of their relatives 

and accused agreed to take doli of his daughter Sheetal. The PW­2 alleged that he 

was told by his daughter Sheetal on 19.2.2006, when she came to attend wedding of 

Raju   son   of   PW­1,   that   as   soon   as   doli   reached   at   matrimonial   home,   accused 

Rajeshwari taunted "Is maharani ko doli se utar kar lao, aur uski aarti utarte hai". 

Thereafter,   Sheetal   started   weeping   and   when   PW­2   asked   her   as   to   what   had 

happened,   she  told   PW­2,   when  her  doli  reached at   her  matrimonial   home,  her 

mother­in­law  started  taunting  her by saying "kaya koora kachra lekar aaye ho, 

motorcycle   kahan   hai"     The   PW­2   stated   that   he   tried   to   make   his   daughter 

understand, at the time of departure of Barat of his son, but accused Praveen became 

stubborn and did not agree to attend the marriage barat and that after the departure 

of Barat, accused persons left house of PW­2 along with his daughter Sheetal in a 

separate vehicle, but did not reach the place, where barat was to arrive,   PW­2 then 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 6/ 48

deposed   that   after   two   months   of   marriage   of   his   daughter   accused   Praveen, 

Rajeshwari and Babu Lal started harassing and taunting his daughter on account of 

insufficient dowry and that he was told about it on every occasion by his daughter 

on   telephone,   when   she   was   taunted   and   given   beatings   by   her   inlaws   due   to 

insufficient dowry.   Thereafter, PW­1 along with his wife Krishna and mother of 

Sheetal   namely   Sumitra   reached  matrimonial  home  of   his  deceased   daughter   to 

make her inlaws understand not to harass her by demanding dowry, however, the 

accused persons continued to torture and harass his daughter and on 12.11.2007, a 

complaint was filed at PS Jahangir Puri and an application was also filed before 

CAW Cell, Kirti Nagar.   The PW­2 stated that his deceased daughter used to tell 

him to give money to accused persons as they had to pay installments of TSR, 

whereupon PW­2 expressed his inability to do so and thus, accused continued to 

harass and beat his daughter.     Subsequently, a compromise took place in CAW 

Cell, Kirti Nagar and the accused persons took daughter of PW­2 to their home. 

PW_2 then stated that in the year 2007 on the occasion of Dhan Teras, when  his 

deceased daughter came to meet PW­2, she was pregnant and  told him that accused 

persons   were   still   torturing   her   and   used   to   beat   her   and   turn   her   out   of   the 

matrimonial home.  Again, accused persons were made to understand and requested 

to keep daughter of PW­2 properly and after about 15 days, or a month, accused 

Praveen took daughter of PW­2 back to her matrimonial home and for few days, 

there was no complaint from the matrimonial home of his daughter.  On 30.03.2009, 

at about 7.45 pm, one of the neighbour of the accused persons gave a telephonic call 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 7/ 48

to PW­2 and informed him that he had seen his daughter hanging from a ceiling fan. 

The said neighbour again gave a telephonic call to PW­2 that his daughter had died 

and   accused   Praveen   was   lying   unconscious.       Thereafter,   PW­2   rushed   to   the 

matrimonial home of his daughter and found a large crowd present there.     Addl. 

SHO of PS Jahangir Puri was also present there and informed PW­2 that dead body 

of their daughter had also been sent to BJRM hospital and accordingly, PW­2 and 

his family rushed to said hospital, where they saw the dead body of their daughter. 

Thereafter, they were sent back to their home by the police with instructions to 

PW­2 to come to BJRM Hospital on 31.03.2009, when executive magistrate was to 

come. On 31.03.2009, at about 10.00 am, PW­2 reached at PS Jahangir puri, where 

his   statement   Ex.   PW­2/A   was   recorded   in   a   separate   room   by   the   Executive 

Magistrate.     The   PW­2   again   expressed   suspicion   that   his   daughter   had   not 

committed suicide, but she was murdered by the accused persons and thereafter, she 

was hanged from a ceiling fan.   PW­2 also identified his signatures on the memo 

Ex. PW­1/A, vide which dead body of Sheetal was handed over to them.   

</p><p id="p_13">               From the cross­examination of PW­2, it is brought out that his family 

members and family members of accused Praveen had met each other before the 

marriage between his deceased daughter Sheetal and Praveen was fixed and that 

they   were  aware   that   accused   Praveen  used  to  drive  a  TSR  and  that  his  father 

accused   Babu   Ram   was   in   a   Govt.   Job   and   had   taken   a   house   at   Lodhi   Road 

Complex, when the marriage took place.   He termed it correct that facilities were 

better at the house of accused persons at Lodhi Road complex as compared to their 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 8/ 48

house at Nangloi.   During his cross­examination, PW­2 further stated that he was 

the first one to receive the information regarding death of his daughter and that he 

had reached matrimonial house of his deceased daughter at about 9.00 pm and that 

at that time, he did not make any complaint to the police regarding harassment 

meted out to his daughter by the accused persons.  He also deposed that on the next 

day, other relatives also reached their house after hearing the news about the death 

of his daughter and that they had deliberations with those relatives regarding his 

deceased daughter and her inlaws. PW­2 reiterated that his statement was recorded 

by SDM on 31.03.2009.  During his further cross­examination, PW­2 stated that his 

deceased daughter never wrote any letter to them regarding her harassment by the 

accused persons at the matrimonial home.   He volunteered to state that she had 

studied only upto 4th/5th  class.   When asked about complaint to the police, PW­2 

stated that no complaint had been lodged with the police as and when, their daughter 

told about her harassments and beatings at the hands of the accused persons.   He 

volunteered to state that a complaint had been made at CAW Cell by mother of 

Sheetal and her badi mummy namely Krishna.   Though, PW­2 admitted that there  

was a compromise at CAW Cell, after which, his deceased daughter went to her  

matrimonial   home,   he   denied   that   his   daughter   had   given   any   statement   in  

writing before CAW Cell in his presence to the effect that she wanted to withdraw  

the complaint against her husband and inlaws.   He admitted that no complaint  

was filed before police or court or any other Governmental authority after Dhan  

Teras in the year 2007, when deceased told him about torture and harassment,  

  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 9/ 48

she was suffering in the matrimonial home. From further cross­examination of 

PW­2, it is brought out that there were considerable exaggerations in his testimony 

(examination­in­chief) made before the court,   over and above his statement Ex. 

PW­2/A made before SDM  and that he had not stated in his statement Ex. PW­2/A 

that a demand for motorcycle had been made by accused Ram Babu at the time of 

departure of doli or that PW­2 had expressed in inability to arrange for the same due 

to   financial   constraint   on   account   of   marriage   of   his   son,   which   was   fixed   for 

19.2.2006 or that the matter was settled with the intervention of the relatives after 

which, accused agreed to take doli of Sheetal, daughter of PW­2.   The PW­2 had 

also not stated in his statement Ex. PW­2/A that when the doli reached matrimonial 

home of his daughter, accused Rajeshwari taunted her ""Is maharani ko doli se utar 

kar lao, aur uski aarti utarte hai" or that PW­2 was told about it by his daughter 

Sheetal, when she came to his house on 19.2.2006, along with her inlaws to attend 

marriage of son of PW­2.   The   PW­2 further did not state in his statement Ex. 

PW­2/A that he had tried to make his daughter understand at the time of departure 

of barat of his son, but accused Praveen become stubborn   and did not agreed to 

attend the marriage/barat.   The PW­2 however, clarified to state that he did not 

know, if these facts, had been recorded by the SDM or not.  The  PW­2  admitted 

that he had not stated in his statement to the SDM that after departure of barat, 

accused persons along with his daughter Sheetal left his house in a separate vehicle 

and that they did not reach the place, where Barat was to arrive.   He could not 

remember if he had narrated about the visit of his deceased daughter to his house on 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 10/ 48

the occasion of Dhan Teras in the year 2007 or the facts narrated by his daughter to 

him at that time or that fact that accused Praveen had taken his daughter back to the 

matrimonial home after 15 day or a month.  
</p>
<p id="p_14">               During his further cross­examination, PW­2, was given a suggestion that 

his daughter Sheetal was short tempered and   that she used to quarrel on trivial 

issues and that on account of her volatile nature, she had lodged complaint against 

accused persons at CAW Cell and   that due to her nature, her father­in­law and 

mother­in­law   had   disowned/disbarred   her   and   her   husband   from   their   house. 

PW­2 denied all these suggestions.  He however, stated that he had been informed 

by one of the relatives of accused Praveen that Praveen had been disowned by his 

parents   from   their   property   and   that   this   fact   was   also   published   by   them   in 

newspaper.   The PW­2 expressed his lack of awareness when he was questioned 

that on the day of incident i.e. 30.3.09, deceased had sold silver bowl and silver 

glass, which was gifted to her by her mather­in­law on the birth of her first child, 

and that when the accused got information about it, he slapped the deceased, due to 

which, she committed suicide.  The PW­2 denied that deceased was never harassed 

in any manner, nor was any demand made by any of the accused persons from the 

deceased.     He   also   denied   that   he   did   not   have   complaint   against   the   accused 

persons or that due to this reason, he had not made any statement to the police at the

time, Sheetal had asked PW­7  to give money to  her as her husband had to pay the 

installment of TSR but PW­7   had expressed her inability to pay the said amount 

due to financial constraints. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">               PW­7 then deposed that after receiving information about the death of

next day, she  went to the police station,  along with her relatives and other Mohalla 

people, where her statement and that of her jeth Ganga Prasad  were recorded by the

accused   persons   or   that   complaint   was   filed   against   the   accused   persons   after 

consultation and legal advice. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">               From the cross­examination of PW­7, it is brought out   that she was 

working as a maid servant while her husband was a daily wage earner.   She also 

stated that her husband and jeth Ganga Prasad were aware of  the payment of a sum 

of Rs. 20,000/­ made by her to accused Parveen.   She admitted that she had not 

shown any bank entry or any other proof regarding the said payment to SDM and 

that she had also not given any written list of articles to the SDM at the time of 

recording of her statement by him.     The PW­7 denied that she had not paid any 

amount of Rs. 10,000/­ to the accused on two occasions as stated by her.   During 

her further cross­examination, PW­7 stated that she had made a complaint against 

the accused persons regarding harassment meted out to her daughter.  However, she 

admitted that she had not given the copy of any such complaint to the SDM and 

stated that she had informed him about it.  
</p>
<p id="p_23">               As regards factum of harassment of her daughter, PW­7 stated that her 

daughter   had   not   written   any   letter   and   that   she   used  to   tell   PW­7  about  it   on 

telephone.  PW­7 however, could not remember the telephone number of Sheetal.  

She admitted that she had not handed over any call details record to the police in  


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 16/ 48

respect of telephone calls made to her by her daughter Sheetal.   As regards, the 

complaint   before   CAW   cell,   PW­7   denied   that   said   complaint   was   made   by 

deceased Sheetal at the instance of sister of PW­7.   She denied that said complaint 

had been withdrawn by her daughter on 08.01.2007, when accused Parveen agreed 

to live separately with her at Jahangir Puri.  PW­7 also denied the suggestion that 

accused Sheetal used to fight on petty issues or that on 07.11.2007, she left her  nine 

months old son in the custody of the neighbours and locked her house after having a 

fight with accused Parveen.   PW­7 expressed her lack of awareness about the fact 

that accused Parveen had lodged a missing report regarding missing of Sheetal at PS 

Jahangir Puri vide DD no. 81B.   She however, termed it correct that Sheetal was 

later on, recovered from their house.  PW­7 volunteered to state that her deceased 

daughter had left her  matrimonial home   as she was given beatings by accused 

Parveen.  Again suggestion was put to PW­7 that on the day of incident, deceased 

Sheetal had sold a silver bowl and silver glass, which had been gifted to her by her 

mother­in­law on birth of her first child and that accused Praveen had slapped the 

deceased, when he came to know about it and due to this reason, she had committed 

suicide.  However,  this suggestion was denied by PW­7. 
</p>
<p id="p_24">               From her further cross­examination, it is brought out that she had made 

considerable improvements over Ex. PW­6/B i.e. her statement recorded by SDM, 

at the time of her deposition in the court, inasmuch as is Ex. PW­6/B, she did not 

state that at the time of marriage ceremony (fera) of Sheetal, accused Babu Lal, 

father of accused Parveen had demanded scooter or had quarreled over this issue, 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 17/ 48

which was later on got pacified by his relatives.   PW­7 also did not state in her 

statement Ex. PW­6/B that she and her Jeth had given sufficient dowry articles i.e 

jewellery, almirah, furniture, TV, fridge, cooler etc, after selling of her house by 

PW­7.  It is further brought out that in Ex. PW­6/B, she did not state that  accused 

persons started harassing her daughter Sheetal for not bringing the scooter  from the 

first day of marriage and when Sheetal came to her house after two days of her 

marriage, she told these facts to PW­7 and that she also disclosed that accused Babu 

Lal had given beatings to his jija, who intervened and pacified the quarrel/issue at 

the time of Pheras during the marriage ceremony and  that Sheetal was taken back 

to her matrimonial home on the same day and that accused started harassing her 

daughter   Sheetal   mentally   and   physically   on   the   issue   of   bringing   insufficient 

dowry.  It is then, brought out that PW­7 did not state in her statement Ex. PW­6/B 

that whenever Sheetal used to visit the house of PW­7, she told her that accused 

Parveen, her father­in­law Babu Lal and her mother­in­law Rajeshwari used to beat 

her for bringing insufficient dowry and  that she had also not narrated the incident 

of Karva chauth, when during her visit to the matrimonial home of her daughter, she 

saw her daughter in an injured condition after being beaten by accused persons and 

on being asked by PW­7, she was also given beatings by accused Parveen and his 

mother Rajeshwari and that PW­7 went to the PS to report the matter and on her 

return   back   to   matrimonial   home   of   her   daughter   with   two   police   personnel, 

Sheetal was sent with PW­7 to her house without any action having been taken 

against the accused persons.  PW­7 also did not  state in her statement to SDM that 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 18/ 48

Sheetal   remained   with   her   in   her   house   for   8/10   day,   after   which,   accused 

Rajeshwari and Babu Lal visited her house and told her that accused Parveen had 

inflicted injuries on his head and upon request made by accused, she had sent her 

daughter with them and that after 2/4 days, when she visited matrimonial home of 

her daughter to see the accused Parveen, she came to know that no injury had ever 

been inflicted by accused Parveen on his head. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">               It is also brought out from the further cross­examination of PW­7 that 

though, she had mentioned the factum of giving Rs. 20,000/­ to accused Parveen, 

she had not mentioned the words for "delivery charges/japa" in her statement Ex. 

PW­6/B.   The incident, when accused Parveen is alleged to have made telephonic 

call to PW­7 asking her to come to his house and   PW­7's visit to the house of 

accused Parveen to find  her daughter in a very bad condition after being given to 

eat something by her mother­in­law was also not found mentioned in Ex. PW­6/B. 

The incident of 4/5 days prior to the death of deceased, wherein deceased Sheetal is 

stated to have asked PW­7 to give  money to her husband to pay installment of TSR 

also does not find mention in Ex. PW­6/B.   As regard  the sequences of events that 

had taken place on the day, when information of death of her daughter was received, 

there was again difference of version given in Ex. PW­6/B and deposition made by 

PW­7 in the court as in former statement, she had stated that it was her husband, 

who was admitted in Lady Harding Hospital.  The PW­7 denied that her deceased 

daughter was treated with love and affection by the accused persons or that family 

of accused was financially very well as compared to their family and as such there 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 19/ 48

was never any demand regarding any scooter or other things. The PW­7 also denied 

having made statement before SDM at the instance of her Jeth Ganga Prasad out of 

vindictiveness and after due deliberation and legal advice.

<p id="p_55">

</p><p id="p_56">25.            Ld. Addl. PP has contended that from the testimonies of the witnesses 

examined   by   the   prosecution   specially   that   of   PW­2   Ganga   Prasad   and   PW­7 

Sumitra Devi, prosecution has succeeded in proving that demands of dowry were 

made from the family of deceased at the time of marriage i.e. Phera  ceremony and 

that     as   soon   as   deceased   reached   her   matrimonial   home,   her   bitter   journey   in 

matrimonial life commenced and she was subjected to mental and physical cruelty 

to force her and her family members to meet the demand of dowry raised by the 

accused persons.     It is contended that testimony of PW­2 and PW­7 corroborates 

each other and minor contradictions and improvements, therein would not make 

their   testimonies   untrustworthy   and   unreliable.   It   is   accordingly,   prayed   that 

accused persons be convicted for the charged offence. 
</p>
<p id="p_57">

</p><p id="p_58">26.            Ld. Counsel for the accused has put forth two fold argument,  Though, 

the   fact   that   deceased   had   died   an   unnatural   death   within   seven   years   of   her 

marriage is not disputed, it is contended that the matrimonial differences between 

the deceased Sheetal and accused no. 1 were resolved during the course of pendency 

of complaint before CAW Cell and that thereafter, both of them resided happily in 

their matrimonial home and that two children were born from their wedlock.  It is 

stated that cruelty, if any, was duly condoned by the deceased and if, at all, deceased 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 29/ 48

had been aggrieved by the conduct of accused no. 1 i.e., her husband and accused 

no. 2 and 3 her parents­in­law, then she could have easily taken recourse of filing a 

fresh complaint before CAW Cell instead of committing suicide.  

</p><p id="p_59">               Secondly,  it  is  contended that  even assuming that the alleged acts of 

cruelty did not stand condoned, the last such alleged act took place as far as back on 

Dhanteras in the year 2007 and thus, the requirement of "soon before her death" as 

envisaged in <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_7">Section 304</a>­B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> is not satisfied.  
</p>
<p id="p_60">               Various contradictions in the testimony of PW­2 Ganga Prasad, adoptive 

father of the deceased and PW­7 Smt. Sumitra, biological mother of deceased have 

also been pointed out to contend that prosecution has failed to prove the charged 

offences   against   the   accused   persons.     The   conduct   of   PW­2   and   PW­7   in   not 

bothering about the children of deceased, after her death, has also been highlighted 

as   one   of   the   acts   of   unnatural   conduct   on   the   part   of   paternal   family   of   the 

deceased.  
</p>
<p id="p_61">               Lastly, it is contended that demand of money on account of financial 

stringency   i.e to  pay  installments of TSR, does not fall within the definition of 

"dowry".  On these grounds, it is contended that accused are  entitled to be acquitted 

of the charges in the present case.  Ld. Counsel for the accused has relied upon the 

following judgments in support of his contention.

               to   her   death   is   the   pivot   indicated   by   that   expression.   The  

               legislative object in providing such a radius of time by employing  

               the words   "soon before her death" is to emphasis the idea that  

               her death should, in all  probabilities, have been the aftermath of  

               such cruelty or harassment. In   other words, there should be a  

               perceptible   nexus   between   her   death   and   the       dowry   related  

               harassment   or   cruelty   inflicted   on   her.   If   the   interval   elapsed  

               between the infliction of such harassment or cruelty and her death  

               is   wide   the   court   would   be   in   a   position   to   gauge   that   in   all  

               probabilities the death would not have been the immediate cause  

               of her death. It is hence for the court to decide, on the facts and  

               circumstances   of   each   case,   whether   the   said   interval   in   that  

               particular case was sufficient to snuff its cord from the   concept  

               "soon before her death".

scrutiny, the testimonies of PW­2 Ganga Prasad and PW­7 Sumitra are found to be 

full of contradictions and inconsistencies, not only with each other testimony, but 

also with their respective statements given before the SDM.    Coming to PW Ganga 

Prasad, in his statement Ex. PW­2/A given before the SDM, PW­2 Ganga Prasad 

stated that he had given dowry much beyond his capacity in the marriage of his 

adopted daughter Sheetal, however, since the very next day of the marriage itself, 

accused Parveen, his mother Rajeshwari and father Babu Lal started harassing and 

taunting her by saying why she had brought Garbage in marriage and questioned her 

about the motorcycle and that this continued for several days.   The daughter of 

PW­2 was given beatings by all the three accused persons and she told about it to 

PW­2 on telephone.  When, PW­2  made a statement PW­6 Sh. A.Z. Ansari, ADM,

which could give a clue as to the scale (monetary), on which the marriage function 

was arranged. No list of dowry articles alleged to have been given in marriage has 

been   filed   before   the   SDM   or   handed   over   to   the   IO.       Even   the   independent 

witnesses, who had attended the marriage function have not been examined to show 

what kind of marriage ceremony had taken place and if at all, dowry articles etc 

were given in the marriage.  Since, it is alleged that a demand of scooter was made 

at the time of Phera Ceremony, a natural consequence flowing therefrom is that 

several relatives, family members and other persons, who were present in the said 

function   would   have   witnessed   the   demand   raised   by   the   accused   Babu   Ram. 

However, neither any of the persons present in the marriage/Phera ceremony have 

been named, nor have they been put forth as a witness to said demand raised by 

accused   Babu   Lal.     Moreover,   contrary   to   her   statement   Ex.   PW­6/B   and   in 

contradiction of statement of PW­2, wherein a demand of motorcycle is stated to 

have been made, the   PW­7 has stated that Babu Ram had demanded a scooter. 

Further, neither in her statement Ex. PW­6/B, nor her deposition before the court, 

PW­7 corroborates the incidents referred to in the testimony of PW­2 Ganga Parsad. 

It is noteworthy that PW­7 Sumitra Devi had a  close relationship with PW­2 Ganga 

Prasad as the latter was not only her Jeth (elder brother of her husband), but also her 

Jija (husband of her elder sister).  In these circumstances, the fact that PW­7 does 

not mention about the incident that had taken place at the time, barat of son of PW­2 

was   leaving   on   19.02.2006   or   the   alleged   conduct   of   accused   Parveen   in   not 

attending/joining the barat, becomes relevant.  Similarly, the fact that PW­2 Ganga 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 41/ 48

Prasad   does   not   mention   anything   about   sale   of   house   by   PW­7   to   make 

arrangement for finances for giving dowry to deceased Sheetal is very material. 

Further, whereas in Ex. PW­6/B,  PW­7 states that her deceased daughter used to 

narrate about instances of harassment, torture and beatings given to her by accused 

persons on the telephone in her statement as PW­7, Smt. Sumitra states that these 

facts were told to her by her deceased daughter, whenever, she came to her house. 

In   these   circumstances,   omission   to   mention   specific   dates   of   alleged   visits   by 

deceased Sheetal become very relevant.  Similarly, the fact that neither PW­2 nor 

PW­7   could   tell   the   telephone   numbers,   from   which   Sheetal   used   to   call   them, 

become very material.   Parents whose daughter is being so tortured and harassed in 

her matrimonial home are not likely to forget material details of the dates or the 

telephone number, from which their daughter called them up to share her plight and 

to seek assistance/help of her paternal family members.  The  PW­7 also mentions 

of incident of Karvachauth  in her deposition, which has not been mentioned in her 

statement Ex. PW­6/B.  While narrating the said incident, PW­7 claims that she had 

gone   to     Police   station,   narrated   all   the   facts   to   the   police   and   that   two   police 

personals had accompanied her to the house of Sheetal.  However, PW­7 does not 

give name of Police Station, where she had gone or the names of the police officials, 

who had accompanied her.  The PW­7 then mentions that after 8 to 10 days of the 

said incident, accused Rajeshwari and Babu Lal visited her house and took back 

Sheetal with them on pretext that accused Parveen had inflicted injuries on his head, 

whereas on her visit to matrimonial home of Sheetal after 2 to 4 days, PW­7 found 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.          Page Nos. 42/ 48

that accused Parveen did not have any such injury on his head.  This incident has 

also not been mentioned by PW­7 in her statement Ex. PW­6/B.     PW­2 Ganga 

Prasad   also   does   not   mention   about   the   visit   by   Sumitra   Devi   to   the   house   of 

deceased   Sheetal   on   Karvachauth,   her   going   to   PS   or   Sheetal   being   sent   with 

Sumitra Devi by the police officials or accused Rajeshwari and Babu Lal visiting 

house   of   PW­7   to   fetch   Sheetal   on   pretext   that   accused   Parveen   had   inflicted 

injuries on his head or subsequent visit of PW­7 to the house of accused Parveen, to 

find that no such self injury was made by accused Praveen.  



</p><p id="p_100">39.            The PW­7 also mentions about giving Rs. 20,000/­, Rs. 10,000/­ and Rs. 

10,000/­, respectively to accused Parveen and deceased Sheetal on three occasions. 

Again   PW­2   does   not   mention   about   giving   of   said   sums   by   PW­7   to   accused 

Parveen   and   deceased   Sheetal,     even   though,   PW­7   has   stated     in   her   cross­

examination that all her family members, including PW­2,  were aware that she had 

given   money   to   accused   Parveen.     The   incident   when   accused   Parveen   made 

telephonic   call   to   PW­7   to   come   to   his   house   and   PW­7   having   gone   there 

subsequently only to find that deceased Sheetal had been given something to eat by 

her mother­in­law, due to which her condition is deteriorated, does not find mention 

in Ex. PW­6/B.  PW­7 also mentions about a visit to her deceased daughter's house 

4/5 days prior to her death, during which, deceased Sheetal again asked her to give 

her money to pay installments of TSR of her husband.  This incident does not find 

mention in Ex. PW­6/B.     PW­2 Ganga Prasad on the other hand, does not say 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 43/ 48
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                         44</span>

anything about these facts which were revealed for the first time by PW­7 during 

her   testimony   before   the   court.     Thus,     it   is   seen   that   there   is   considerable 

discrepancy in the testimony of PW­2 Ganga Prasad, adoptive father of deceased 

Sheetal and PW­7 Sumitra Devi, biological mother of deceased Sheetal, not only 

qua each other's testimony, but also with their previous statement Ex. PW­2/A and 

Ex. PW­6/B, respectively, which were made before the SDM.   This coupled with 

the fact that there is no independent witness cited or examined to corroborate their 

respective verrsion of alleged demands of dowry, harassment, beatings and torture 

of the deceased by the accused persons ;  no documentary evidence in the form of 

photographs, receipt of purchase of articles or sale of the house by PW­7 and no 

specific dates or instances of alleged demand of dowry make the case as put forth 

by prosecution unbelievable.    It is pertinent to note that as per the PM report, no 

external injury except ligature mark was found on the dead body.     In absence of 

any   other  evidence  to   show when and by whom  the cruelty or harassment  was 

meted out to the deceased, the nature of such cruelty, i.e. beatings, or incessant 

taunts,   or  some  other  form   of   mental  torture etc., no  conclusion/presumptionu/s 

113­B of Indian Evidence Act can be drawn in the present case.  As has been laid 

down by Hon'ble Apex court in case of Hira Lal &amp; Ors. (supra), the two offences, 

i.e. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_45">Sections 498</a>­A and 304­B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_46">IPC</a> are distinct. Nevertheless, to get into the net of 

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_47">Section 304</a>­B, which is graver, and carries a harsher punishment, as is expected, 

the prosecution has to prove that the degree of cruelty or intensity was such that it 

led   to   unnatural   death­   of   course,   also   concurrently   linking   it   with   dowry 


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 44/ 48

harassment. Apart from bald and vague assertions about "cruelty in connection with 

demand for installments of the TSR" neither PW­2 nor PW­7 spell out what kind of 

demand or cruel behavior did the accused persons  indulge in vis­à­vis the deceased. 



</p><p id="p_101">40.            As far as alleged demand for payment of installment for TSR or Japa 

(delivery charges) are concerned, they do not fall within ambit of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_48">Section 498</a>­A 

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_49">IPC</a>.   <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_50">In Appasaheb and Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, AIR 2007 SC 763, the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under :­

               "........ In view of the aforesaid definition of the word "dowry" any  
               property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given  
               either   directly   or   indirectly   at   or   before   or   any   time   after   the  
               marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties.  
               Therefore, the giving or taking of property   or valuable security  
               must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a  
               correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable  
               security   with   the   marriage   of   the   parties   is   essential.     Being  a  
               penal provision, it has to be strictly construed.  Dowry is a fairly  
               well known social custom or practice in India.   It is well settled  
               principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with  
               reference to a particular trade, business or transaction and words  
               are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business or  
               transactions knows or understands to have a particular meaning in  
               it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular  
               meaning.....   A   demand   for   money   on   account   of   some   financial  
               stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for  
               purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as  
               the said word is normally understood.   The evidence adduced by  
               the   prosecution   does   not,   therefore,   show   that   any   demand   for  


  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 45/ 48

               manure."

               This judgment of Apex Court was discussed by the Hon'ble Delhi High

339­41/2005, decided on 02.03.2010, wherein it was held that :­

               ".......In order to attract criminal liability, there should be torture  
               physical or mental, by positive acts.  Such acts should be aimed at  
               persuading or compelling the woman or her relatives to meet an  
               unlawful demand of any property or valuable security or it should  
               be actuated by the failure of the woman or her relative to meet  
               such a demand.."
</p>
<p id="p_103">
          It has been further held that :­

               property or valuable security, which was not demanded, was not  
               expected to be given and also was not in contemplation of any time  
               up to solemnization of marriage, demand of such cash, property or  
               valuable   security,   etc.   cannot   be   said   to   be   in   connection   with  
               marriage and, therefore, would not constitute demand of dowry..."



</p><p id="p_104">41.            Further in the present case, the proceedings from CAW Cell have been 

produced by PW­15 ASI Rishali Yadav.  Perusal of the documents Ex. PW­15/A to 

Ex. PW­15/E reveal that thought, the deceased Sheetal had filed complaint dated 

16.11.2006 before CAW Cell, the matrimonial disputes between deceased Sheetal 

  S.C  No. 47/09                                   State vs. Parveen Kumar &amp; Ors.         Page Nos. 46/ 48

and accused Parveen were subsequently compromised, pursuant to which, she had 

withdrawn her complaint vide her request letter/statement dated Ex. PW­15/B and 

Ex. PW­15/D.   Both PW­2 Ganga Prasad and PW­7 Sumitra Devi have deposed 

about   the   complaint   Ex.   PW­15/A  filed  by  deceased  Sheetal  before  CAW  Cell. 

However,   when   it   came   to   the   question   of   withdrawal   of   the   said   complaint, 

pursuant to compromise between deceased Sheetal and her husband, both PW­2 and 

PW­7 were evasive and expressed their lack of knowledge about it, which does not 

stand explained satisfactorily, specially in view of testimony of PW­15 ASI Rishali 

Devi, who stated that parents of both Parveen i.e. accused no. 1 and Sheetal (since 

deceased) were present when the compromise between Parveen and Sheetal took 

place.     Another corollary of these proceedings before CAW Cell is that both the 

deceased Sheetal as well as her parents, adoptive and biological, knew that there 

existed a forum (CAW Cell) for redressal of grievance in case demands of dowry 

are raised by husband/in­laws of a girl or a girl was harassed or treated with cruelty 

in connection with such demands.   Equipped with such a knowledge and having 

drawn   benefit   from  it   earlier,   it  is highly improbable that  deceased would have 

continued to suffer silently in the hands of her husband and in laws i.e. accused 

persons.   Such subjugation   is unlikely from a girl who had courage to raise her 

voice and protest against persons who allegedly inflicted acts of cruelty upon her.
