    challenge to a Government Resolution dated 27 th January
    2004 followed by a Circular dated 24 th March 2011 issued by
    the Public Works Department of the State of Maharashtra
    pertaining to construction of buildings costing more than â‚¹ 1 1
    Crore.         The State Government Resolution required a
    composite tender to be floated inviting offers to execute the
    civil and electrical works. The Circular issued by the Public
    Works Department               noted that in execution of civil and
    electrical works, the Government Resolution was not being
    followed and thus required officers of the Public Works
    Department to adhere to the Government Resolution.                       The

                  any electrical contractors. The system of
                  inviting tender only through the civil
                  contractor will effectively deny any
                  opportunity to submit tender for electrical
                  contractors independently.         The civil
                  contractor will have to name the electrical
                  contractor, going by Ext.P8 circular. It is
                  therefore entirely upto the civil contractor
                  to quote the rates for execution of the work
                  and name the electrical contractors. The
                  chance of the electrical contractor getting
                  any work entirely depends upon the
                  volition of the civil contractor. The same
                  will result in absence of any competition
                  from among electrical contractors, as the
                  contractors will not be able to compete for
                  the work on their own by submitting the
                  tender. Therefore, the prospect of civil
                  contractors getting monopoly in the field is
                  writ large. They can on their own whims
                  and fancies, join along with any of the
                  electrical contractors whom they name, in
                  the tenders. Even though it is provided that
                  registration           of            electrical
                  contractor/electrician will be a precondition
                  for carrying out the electrical works in
                  PWD, that alone will not help the electrical
                  contractors to participate in the tender, as
                  pointed out already. Thus, the same violates
                  the concept of level playing field resulting
                  in violation of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_5">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the
                  Constitution, as held in Reliance Energy's

<p id="p_4">    3.            The said decision of the learned Single Judge of the

                  review must be justified by constitutional
                  principles which govern the proper exercise
                  of public power in a democracy. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_7">Article 14</a>
                  of the Constitution embodies the principle
                  of "non-discrimination". However, it is not
                  a free-standing provision. It has to be read
                  in conjunction with rights conferred by
                  other articles like <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_8">Article 21</a> of the
                  Constitution. The said <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_9">Article 21</a> refers to
                  "right to life". It includes "opportunity". In
                  our view, as held in the latest judgment of
                  the Constitution Bench of nine Judges in
                  <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_10">I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N</a>. (2007) 2 SCC
                  1, Articles 21/14 are the heart of the chapter
                  on fundamental rights. They cover various
                  aspects of like. "Level playing field" is an
                  important concept while construing <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_11">Article
                  19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. It is this
                  doctrine which is invoked by REL/HDEC
                  in the present case. When <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_12">Article 19(1)(g)</a>

                  confers fundamental right to carry on
                  business to a company, it is entitled to
                  invoke the said doctrine of "level playing
                  field". We may clarify that this doctrine is,
                  however, subject to public interest. In the
                  world of globalisation, competition is an
                  important factor to be kept in mind. The
                  doctrine of "level playing field" is an
                  important doctrine which is embodied in
                  <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_13">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. This is
                  because the said doctrine provides space
                  within which equally placed competitors are
                  allowed to bid so as to subserve the larger
                  public interest. "Globalisation", in essence,,
                  is liberalisation of trade. Today India has
                  dismantled licence raj. The economic
                  reforms introduced after 1992 have brought
                  in the concept of "globalisation". Decisions
                  or acts which result in unequal and
                  discriminatory treatment, would violate the
                  doctrine of "level playing field" embodied
                  in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_14">Article 19(1)(g).</a>       Time has come,
                  therefore, to say that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_15">Article 14</a> which refers
                  to the principle of "equality" should not be
                  read as a stand alone item but it should be
                  read in conjunction with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Article 21</a> which
                  embodies several aspects of life. There is
                  one more aspect which needs to be
                  mentioned in the matter of implementation
                  of the aforestated doctrine of "level playing
                  field".    According to Lord Goldsmith,
                  commitment to the "rule of law" is the heart
                  of parliamentary democracy. One of the

                  important elements of the "rule of law" is
                  legal certainty.   <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a> applies to
                  government policies and if the policy or act
                  of the Government, even in contractual
                  matters, fails to satisfy the test of
                  "reasonableness", then such an act or
                  decision would be unconstitutional.

</p><p id="p_7">                  38.         When tenders are invited, the
                  terms and conditions must indicate with
                  legal certainty, norms and benchmarks. This
                  "legal certainty" is an important aspect of the
                  rule of law. If there is vagueness or
                  subjectivity in the said norms it may result in
                  unequal and discriminatory treatment. It
                  may violate doctrine of "level playing field"."

    Constitution of India has the power to execute contracts in the
    realm of its activities in the commercial sphere. With a view to
    obtain the most competitive prices and obviate arbitrariness,
    the process of award of any government works to private
    players is usually made through a tender process. The intensity
    of review exercised by the Courts upon the terms comprised in
    the tender is limited and confined to examine whether the
    terms comprised therein are ex-facie            irrational and not
    germane to the subject matter of the award or if they are tailor-
    made in a manner so as to confer benefit upon one participant
    to the exclusion of others, rendering the tender-process a
    sham. The Higher Courts of the land have since time
    immemorial expressed a note of caution that the Courts would
    not sit in judgment over the terms comprised in the tender as
    "policy-makers" and embark upon the hazardous exercise to
    second-guess their efficacy. The Courts have recognised the
    element of special knowledge and expertise required in
    drafting             such eligibility criteria and other terms/
    conditions, which only the Grantor is best suited to devise
    upon taking cognizance of the peculiar requirements each
    project entails.

                  the individual against the abuse of power by a
                  wide range of authorities, judicial, quasi-
                  judicial, and, as would originally have been

                  to substitute the courts as the bodies making
                  the decisions. It is intended to see that the

<p id="p_16">    11.            Thus, the duty of the court is to confine itself to the
    question of legality.           Its concern should be: (i) Whether a
    decision-making authority              exceeded        its powers? (ii)
    Committed an error of law, (iii) committed a breach of the rules
    of natural justice, (iv) reached a decision which no reasonable
    tribunal would have reached or, (v) abused its powers.

    accompanied by an adult or not'. In an extempore judgment,
    Lord Greene, M.R. drew attention to the fact that the word
    'unreasonable' had often been used in a sense which
    comprehended different grounds of review, where it was said
    that the dismissal of a teacher for having red hair (cited by
    Warrington, L.J. in Short v. Poole Corpn. (1926) 1 Ch 66, 91:
    1925 All ER Rep 74, as an example of a 'frivolous and foolish
    reason') was, in another sense, taking into consideration
    extraneous matters, and might be so unreasonable that it could
    almost be described as being done in bad faith; see also R. v.
    Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, ex p Chetnik
    Developments Ltd., 1988 AC 858, 873: (1988) 2 WLR 654:

<p id="p_18">                 Once that question is answered in favour of the

                 come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no
                 reasonable authority could ever have come to it.
                 In such a case, again, I think the court can
                 interfere. The power of the court to interfere in
                 each case is not as an appellate authority to
                 override a decision of the local authority, but as a
                 judicial authority which is concerned, a n d
                 concerned only, to see whether the local
                 authority has contravened the law by acting in
                 excess of the power which Parliament has
                 confided in them."

                  eligibility criteria should be permitted to
                  participate in the tender. As noted in various
                  decisions, the Government and their
                  undertakings must have a free hand in setting
                  terms of the tender and only if it is arbitrary,
                  discriminatory, mala fide or actuated by bias,
                  the Courts would interfere. The Courts cannot
                  interfere with the terms of the tender
                  prescribed by the Government because it feels
                  that some other terms in the tender would have
                  been fair, wiser or logical. In the case on hand,

                 essentially a commercial transaction. In
                 arriving at a commercial decision
                 considerations which are of paramount
                 importance are commercial considerations.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                 These would be: (1) The price at which the

                 requisite specifications; (3)Whether the person
                 tendering has the ability to deliver the goods or
                 services as per specifications. When large works
                 contracts involving engagement of substantial
                 man power or requiring specific skills are to be
                 offered, the financial ability of the tenderer to
                 fulfill the requirements of the job is also
                 important; (4) the ability of the tenderer to
                 deliver goods or services or to do the work of
                 the requisite standard and quality; (5) past
                 experience of the tenderer, and whether he has

                 time which will be taken to deliver the goods or

                 give post contract services. Even when the State

                 transaction, considerations which would prevail
                 in its decision to award the contract to a given
                 party would be the same. However, because the

    meet the criteria envisaged under Clause 7.2.2.

<p id="p_23">    19.            The         decision   of   MSRDC     to    disqualify        the
    consortium was subject matter of challenge before the Court. It
    was contended that the decision of the MSRDC was arbitrary
    and unjustified inasmuch as the Pre-Qualification document
    failed to specify any Accounting Standard (AS). In view thereof,
    it was urged that it would not be open to MSRDC to disqualify
    the consortium by applying AS 26 and disregarding the
    alternate internationally acceptable Accounting Standard-
    GAPP that had been employed by the consortium.
</p>
<p id="p_24">    20.            In wake of the factual conspectus as highlighted by us
    herein above, the Apex Court observed that                    a meaningful
    reading of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article 14</a> of the Constitution in conjunction with
    <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_22">Article 21</a> led to the conclusion that the right to life would

    enwomb          within          its   fold   the   right    to    "opportunity".
    Underscoring the importance of these provisions of the
    Constitution, reference was made by Their Lordships to a
    decision of nine Judges reported as (2007) 2 SCC 1 <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_23">I.R Coelho
    v. State of T.N</a>             wherein it had been inter alia observed that
    <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_24">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_25">Article 21</a> lay at the heart of the chapter on
    Fundamental Rights.
</p>
<p id="p_25">    21.            The Court proceeded further to observe that the
    doctrine of "level playing field" as embodied under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_26">Article 19
    (1)(g)</a> was liable to be invoked in such cases, however subject to
    the caveat that it would bow to over-arching considerations of
    public interest. The Court emphasised the significance of the
    principle of "level playing field" by noting that in the era of
    globalisation it engendered fair competition amongst equally
    placed competitors to subserve the larger public good. It was
    clarified that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Article 14</a> would also apply to the policies of the
    government in contractual matters and if the decisions in such
    realm fall foul of the anvils of reasonableness, such decisions are
    liable to be declared as unconstitutional.
</p>
<p id="p_26">    22.            Significantly, the Court observed that when tenders
    are invited, the terms and conditions must indicate with legal
    certainty the norms and benchmarks required to be
    scrupulously adhered to. Such certainty was described as an

    important concomitant of the rule of law. Conversely, if
    vagueness or subjectivity creeps in such norms it would result
    in the vice of invidious discrimination and be in teeth with the
    doctrine of "level playing field".        It would be pertinent to
    highlight that the Court further held that such norms, whether
    they be legal norms or accounting norms, must be clear and
    unambiguous, capable of being properly understood by the
    decision-maker and the bidders in the same sense .
</p>
<p id="p_27">    23.            Adverting to the facts of the case the Apex Court
    observed that the accounting methods-"Reconciliation Method"
    employed by the Accountants of the consortium yielded the
    same result and only differed in the manner of presentation vis-
    Ã -vis the methodology adopted by the Consultants of MSRDC.
    The Court held that no meaningful reason was ascribed by the
    said Consultants for rejecting the course chartered by the
    Accountants of the consortium. In view thereof, the Court was
    pleased to set aside the decision of MSRDC to disqualify the
    consortium from participating further in the tender process.
</p>
<p id="p_28">    24.            A keen analysis of the said decision would evince that
    the observations of the Apex Court with regard to the
    applicability of the doctrine of "level playing field" emerge in
    context of the fact that the Court had lamented that the norms
    specified in a tender must be expressed with precise certainty so




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2019                    ::: Downloaded on - 06/09/2019 23:26:18 :::</span>

    as to obviate any scope of misunderstanding. The Court had
    observed that the Pre-Qualification document conspicuously
    omitted to prescribe any particular Accounting Standard which
    was expected to be adhered to by the bidders. Such uncertainty
    in the norms comprised in the tender document itself was solely
    attributable to the instrumentality of the State and had the
    effect on impinging upon the principle of "level playing field".
</p>
<p id="p_29">    25.            Thus, the concept of a level playing field evolved by
    the Supreme Court has obviously been misread by the learned
    Single Judge of the Kerala High Court and the Division Bench
    of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to mean that for
    electrical works only registered electrical contractors can bid
    and as a result a composite tender would violate the principle of
    a level playing field. The Supreme Court used the expression in
    the context of norms in a tender being expressed with precision
    so that a player would not be surprised by a ball suddenly
    shooting or deviating on account of the pitch not being levelled.
</p>
<p id="p_30">    26.            This misreading of the judgment of the Supreme
    Court has resulted in the conclusion being drawn and since the
    premise of the two decisions i.e. of the learned Single Judge of
    the Kerala High Court and the Division Bench of the Punjab &amp;
    Haryana High Court are flawed, the conlusions reached suffer
    from the taint.

</p><p id="p_32">    27.            With reference to the law noted by us herein above
    concerning judicial scrutiny of a tender the position would be
    that since the basic requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_28">Article 14</a> is fairness in
    action by the State, the norms specified in a tender would be
    within the domain of the executive and unless it is shown that a
    norm is malacious and intended to confer a benefit to an
    individual it would be treated as a valid norm.
</p>
<p id="p_33">    28.            The validity of a norm could be tested on the
    principle of a criteria having a reasonable nexus with the objects
    sought to be achieved. The object of a tender is to obtain the
    most competitive bid. The learned Single Judge of the Kerala
    High Court has held that a composite tender for civil and
    electrical works would have the danger of non-competitiveness
    qua the electrical works for the reason the civil contractor
    would be sub-contracting the work to the electrical contractor
    and the prospect of civil contractors getting monopoly in the
    field would be writ large. As per the learned Single Judge after
    monopolising the business the civil contractors at their whims
    and fancies would join the electrical contractors.
</p>
<p id="p_34">    29.            The reasoning of the learned Single Judge is flawed
    because it is theoritcal and overlooks the realities of life. Law of
    life is experienced and not logic. In a competitive world where
    the civil contractor would have to get executed the electrical




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">::: Uploaded on - 06/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 06/09/2019 23:26:18 :::</span>

    works through a licenced electrical contractor, all bidders would
    from the business point of view consult electrical contractors for
    the price to be quoted concerning the electrical works and since
    each would know that the others are doing so and they have to
    be competitive, the rates quoted are bound to be competitive
    and the question of any monopoly resulting does not arise. The
    observations of the learned Single Judge concerning level
    playing field have already been dealt with by us hereinabove
    and thus, we conclude that for building works of over â‚¹ 1 1 crore
    it is permissible to call for a        composite tender because
    execution of electrical works are intertwined with the execution
    of the civil works. Before a roof is cast the iron rods are bound
    over which the concrete is poured. Before pouring the concrete
    the conduits are laid. The boxes are affixed from which fans
    and hanging lights would ultimately be affixed. Similarly, after
    the brick work is completed to erect a wall, channels are cut to
    affix the conduits and the boxes for the switches and thereafter
    plastering work is done. In large works it becomes a headache
    for the owners of the work to coordinate between the civil
    contractor and the electrical contractor.           Thus,         there is
    reasonableness in the decision of the owner to have the works
    executed through a single contractor responsible to the owner
    and answerable for the works, be it civil or be it electrical.
