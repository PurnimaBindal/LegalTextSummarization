:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">(Order of the Court was made by S.MANIKUMAR,J)    

                The Government in Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department    
and the District Collector, Kanyakumari District, have come forward with the
present review application, seeking to review the order passed in Writ Appeal
(MD)No.147 of 2013, dated 22.02.2013. 
</p><p id="p_2">                2.Short facts, necessary for the disposal of the review
petitioner, as could be deduced from the materials on record, are that
respondent-1 herein  was working as Drinking Water supply Assistant in the
2nd respondent panchayat, from 14.12.1998, on daily wages, as fixed by the
2nd review petitioner, District Collector, Kanyakumari District.  However,
the 2nd respondent panchayat, without giving any notice to the 1st
respondent, revised his pay from daily wages to consolidated pay of Rs.400/-
per month.  Aggrieved by the same, respondent No.1 filed Writ Petition
No.10439 of 2002, seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the 2nd respondent
panchayat to pay salary, on daily wages basis, as fixed by the District
Collector and the said writ petition was allowed on 02.03.2002.  Writ Appeal
No.2413/2003 filed by the review petitioners was dismissed on 17.02.2004 and
the Special Leave Petition No.122380 of 2004, filed before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has also been withdrawn by the review petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                3.Thereafter, on the strength of G.O.Ms.No.528, Personnel and
Administrative Reforms Department, dated 10.10.1998, respondent No.1 
approached the review petitioners to appoint him in regular time scale of
pay.  The 2nd respondent Panchayat also recommended the case of the   
respondent No.1 for regular employment.   Since there was no response,
respondent No.1 filed Writ Petition (MD)No.4820 of 2011, seeking a direction
to the District Collector, Kanyakumari District, the 2nd review petitioner,
to consider his representation, dated 17.02.2010, based on the resolution of
the 2nd respondent panchayat, dated 26.03.2010, and to absorb him in the
regular time scale of pay, as Drinking Water Supply Assistant, in the 2nd
respondent panchayat.  However, following the order dated 18.07.2007, passed
in W.P.(MD)No.1333 of 2004,  vide order dated 17.07.2012, a learned Single
Judge of this Court dismissed the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                  4.Aggrieved by the same, respondent No.1 filed W.A.(MD)No.147 
of 2013, contending, inter alia, that as per G.O.Ms.No.528, Personnel and
Administrative Reforms Department, dated 10.10.1998, guidelines have been
issued to the effect that persons appointed on daily wages to discharge the
functions of the posts included in Tamil Nadu Basic Service, through
Employment Exchange, have to be appointed as against regular vacancies in 
regular time scale of pay, with reference to age and education
qualifications, in any one of suitable posts in the Tamil Nadu Basic Service
and further contending that a clarification has also been issued by the 1st
appellant, clarifying that part-time employees, who were employed through
Employment Exchange, should also be appointed in regular time scale of pay 
and based on the said clarification, the 2nd respondent prepared a list of
candidates and appointed some persons in regular time scale of pay.   Per
contra, it was the contention of the review petitioners that respondent No.1
was not entitled to regularization, as he was only a part-time employee and
not a full time employee.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                 5.A Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court, after adverting to the
submissions of both the parties, vide order dated 22.02.2013, allowed the
writ appeal, holding as under:
</p><p id="p_6">        ?4.1. A perusal of the order of appointment dated 15.10.1999 go to show
that the employment of the appellant/petitioner cannot be construed as a part
time employment as he has been directed to work not only in morning and
evening, but during day times if required by the panchayat. It goes without
saying that the appellant/petitioner should make himself available, awaiting
the call of the panchayat at any time during day tim, apart from discharging
his duties in the morning as well as in the evening.  The
appellant/petitioner, who is a daily wage employee is likely to lose even
that daily wage if he is not available for the call of the panchayat at any
time during the day.  Therefore, the contention that the appellant/petitioner
was a part time employee cannot be accepted.  A perusal of the order dated
15.10.1999 also go to show that he had been discharging his duties even prior
to that date.  It will be relevant to quote the order passed by this Court in
W.P.No.12332 of 2010 dated 26.11.2009 relying upon the norms laid down under  
the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishment (Conferment of permanent status to
workmen) Act and also relying upon the decision reported in 1991 WDR 417 
(K.DURAISAMY  ..vs.. TAMIL NADU ELECTRICITY BOARD, REP.BY ITS CHAIRMAN,             
CHENNAI AND TWO OTHERS0, ordering regularization of the services of a water   
supply attender in a village panchayat.  This decision would apply to the
case of the appellant/petitioner also.
</p><p id="p_7">        5.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that
already there is an order passed by this Court in W.A.No.2413 of 2003 and as
against which, SLP preferred by the Government wa also withdrawn and 
therefore, the only course open to the Government is to obey the orders
passed by this Court and to appoint the petitioner in the regular time scale
of pay based on the resolution of the panchayat.  It is also contended that
as per the resolution of the panchayat, it is the right of the petitioner to
get appointment as full time worker on regular basis.
</p><p id="p_8">        5.1.When it is an admitted fact that the Special Leave Petition was
withdrawn by the Government itself and consequently, the order of the Writ
Appeal in W.A.No.2413 of 2003 has become final, it is not open to the
Government to contend tht they will not consider the case of the petitioner.
Moreover, when persons similarly placed have been favourably considered and
they have been appointed in the regular time scale of pay, there is no reason
as to why this petitioner alone should be singled out and should not be
appointed, especially when there is a resolution dated 26.3.2010 passed by
the third respondent panchayat.  Therefore, the claim of the appellant/writ
petitioner has to be accepted.  If so, the order passed by the learned Single
Judge has to be set aside and accordingly, the same is set aside.
</p><p id="p_9">        6.In the result, the Writ Appeal is allowed and the order passed in the
Writ Petition is set aside.  The connected Miscellaneous petition is closed.
No costs.
</p><p id="p_10">        7.The Government is directed to pass orders regularizing the services
of the appellant/petitioner in the regular time scale of pay within a period
of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.?
</p>
<p id="p_11">                6.The abovesaid order is sought to be reviewed by the review
petitioners, contending, inter alia, that the appointment order of the 1st
respondent itself would go to show that he was appointed only on daily wages
basis and further he was not a full time employee and therefore G.O.Ms.No.22,
P &amp; AR Department, dated 28.02.2006 and G.O.Ms.No.144, Rural Development and     
Panchayat Raj Department, dated 09.09.2008, which provide for regularisation
of temporary employees, working as full time employees, on completion of 10
years of service, in rgular time scale of pay, are not applicable to the 1st
respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                7.Per contra, learned counsel for 1st respondent contended that
the review application is not at all maintainable, as there is no error
apparent on the face of the order sought to be reviewed.  He further
contended that there is a specific finding by the Hon'ble Division Bench that
the appointment of the 1st respondent was on daily wages basis, as a full
time employee and if at all, the review petitioners are aggrieved, they ought
to have challenged the order in the writ appeal before the Supreme Court, by
way of special leave.  It is the further submission of the learned counsel
for the 1st respondent that the earlier round of litigation, upto the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, ended in favour of the 1st respondent and therefore the review
petitioners are bound to implement the order in the writ appeal.
Accordingly, the learned counsel prayed for dismissal of the review
application.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                8.Before adverting to the contentions raised by the counsel on
either either side, we would like to reiterate that review is not an appeal
in disguise.  Review can be made only if there is any mistake or apparent on
the face of the record or there is any clerical error in the order sought to
be reviewed .  Useful reference can be made to a few decisions on the point
of review.
</p><p id="p_14">                (i)The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/80351/" id="a_1">Lily Thomas v. Union of India</a>,
reported in 2000 (6) SCC 224, while considering the scope of review and the
limitations imposed on its exercise under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_2">Article 137</a> of the Constitution of
India, held as follows:
</p><p id="p_15">        ?52.    The dictionary meaning of the word "review" is the act of
looking, offer, something again with a view to correction or improvement. It
cannot be denied that the review is the creation of a statute. This Court in
Patel Narshi Thakershi &amp; Ors. Vs. Pradyunmansinghji Arjunsinghji [AIR (1970)
SC 1273], held that the power of review is not an inherent power. It must be
conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication. The review
is also not an appeal in disguise. It cannot be denied that justice is a
virtue which transcends all barriers and the rules or procedures or
technicalities of law cannot stand in the way of administration of justice.
Law has to bend before justice. If the Court finds that the error pointed out
in the review petition was under a mistake and the earlier judgment would not
have been passed but for erroneous assumption which in fact did not exist and
its perpetration shall result in miscarriage of justice nothing would
preclude the Court from rectifying the error. This Court in S.Nagaraj &amp;
Ors.etc. Vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Anr.etc. [1993 Supp. (4) SCC 595] held:
</p><p id="p_16">                "19. Review literally and even judicially means re- examination
or re-consideration. Basic philosophy inherent in it is the universal
acceptance of human fallibility. Yet in the realm of law the courts and even
the statutes lean strongly in favour of finality of decision legally and
properly made. Exceptions both statutorily and judicially have been carved
out to correct accidental mistakes or miscarriage of justice. Even when there
was no statutory provision and no rules were framed by the highest court
indicating the circumstances in which it could rectify its order the courts
culled out such power to avoid abuse of process or miscarriage of justice. In
Raja Prithwi Chand Law Choudhury v. Sukhraj Rai [AIR 1941 FC 1] the Court 
observed that even though no rules had been framed permitting the highest
Court to review its order yet it was available on the limited and narrow
ground developed by the Privy Council and the House of Lords. The Court
approved the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Rajunder Narain Rae
v. Bijai Govind Singh (1836) 1 Moo PC 117 that an order made by the Court was
final and could not be altered:
</p><p id="p_17">                '...nevertheless, if by misprision in embodying the judgments, by
errors have been introduced, these Courts possess, by Common Law, the same   
power which the Courts of record and statute have of rectifying the mistakes
which have crept in.... The House of Lords exercises a similar power of
rectifying mistakes made in drawing up its own judgments, and this Court must
possess the same authority. The Lords have however gone a step further, and
have corrected mistakes introduced through inadvertence in the details of
judgments; or have supplied manifest defects in order to enable the decrees
to be enforced, or have added explanatory matter, or have reconciled
inconsistencies.?
</p><p id="p_18">Basis for exercise of the power was stated in the same decision as under:
</p><p id="p_19">                'It is impossible to doubt that the indulgence extended in such
cases is mainly owing to the natural desire prevailing to prevent
irremediable injustice being done by a Court of last resort, where by some
accident, without any blame, the party has not been heard and an order has
been inadvertently made as if the party had been heard.'
Rectification of an order thus stems from the fundamental principle that
justice is above all. It is exercised to remove the error and not for
disturbing finality. When the Constitution was framed the substantive power
to rectify or recall the order passed by this Court was specifically provided
by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_3">Article 137</a> of the Constitution. Our Constitution-makers who had the
practical wisdom to visualise the efficacy of such provision expressly
conferred the substantive power to review any judgment or order by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_4">Article
137</a> of the Constitution. And clause (c) of <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_5">Article 145</a> permitted this Court
to frame rules as to the conditions subject to which any judgment or order
may be reviewed. In exercise of this power Order XL had been framed
empowering this Court to review an order in civil proceedings on grounds
analogous to Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code. The expression,
for any other sufficient reason in the clause has been given an expanded
meaning and a decree or order passed under misapprehension of true state of
circumstances has been held to be sufficient ground to exercise the power.
Apart from Order XL Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules this Court has the
inherent power to make such orders as may be necessary in the interest of
justice or to prevent the abuse of process of Court. The Court is thus not
precluded from recalling or reviewing its own order if it is satisfied that
it is necessary to do so for sake of justice."
</p><p id="p_20">The mere fact that two views on the same subject are possible is no ground to
review the earlier judgment passed by a Bench of the same strength.
</p><p id="p_21">                53. This Court in M/s.Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. Vs.
Lt.Governor of Delhi [AIR 1980 SC 674] considered the powers of this Court
under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_6">Article 137</a> of the Constitution read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC and Order
40 Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules and held:
</p><p id="p_22">                "It is well settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review
of a judgment delivered by this Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing
and a fresh decision of the case. The normal principle is that a judgment
pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is
justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character
make it necessary to do so. <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_7">Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a>, (1965) 1 SCR
933 at p.948. For instance, if the attention of the Court is not drawn to a
material statutory provision during the original hearing. <a href="/doc/64654035/" id="a_8">G.L. Gupta v. D.N.
Mehta</a>, (1971) 3 SCR 748 at p.760. The Court may also reopen its judgment if a
manifest wrong has been done and it is necessary to pass an order to do full
and effective justice. O.N.Mohindroo v. Dist. Judge, Delhi, (1971) 2 SCR 11
at p.27. Power to review its judgments has been conferred on the Supreme
Court by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_9">Art.137</a> of the Constitution, and that power is subject to the
provisions of any law made by Parliament or the rules made under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_10">Art.145.</a> In
a civil proceeding, an application for review is entertained only on a ground
mentioned in O. XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in a
criminal proceeding on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the
record. (Order XL, R.1, Supreme Court Rules, 1966). But whatever the nature
of the proceeding, it is beyond dispute that a review proceeding cannot be
equated with the original hearing of the case, and the finality of the
judgment delivered by the Court will not be reconsidered except where a
glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier
by judicial fallibility. <a href="/doc/1626241/" id="a_11">Chandra Kanta v. Sheikh Habib</a> (1975) 3 SCR 935."
</p><p id="p_23">                54.     <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_12">Article 137</a> empowers this Court to review its judgments
subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or any rules made
under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_13">Article 145</a> of the Constitution. The Supreme Court Rules made in
exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_14">Article 145</a> of the Constitution prescribe that
in civil cases, review lies on any of the ground specified in Order 47 Rule 1
of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides:
</p><p id="p_24">                "Application for review of judgment -(1) Any person considering
himself aggrieved -
</p><p id="p_25">                (a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but
from which, no appeal has been preferred.
</p><p id="p_26">                (b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or
</p><p id="p_27">                (c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes,
and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which,
after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could
not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, 
or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or
for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree
passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the
Court which passed the decree or made the order."
</p><p id="p_28">Under Order 40 Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules no review lies except on the
ground of error apparent on the face of the record in criminal cases.?
</p>
<p id="p_29">                (ii)<a href="/doc/622454/" id="a_15">In Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aibam Pishak Sharma</a> , reported
in AIR 1979 SC 1047, the Supreme Court has held that, 
        "there is nothing in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to preclude a High
Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of
plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave
and palpable errors committed by it. But, there are definitive limits to the
exercise of the power of review. The power of review may be exercised on the
discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise
of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the
review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made;
it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the
record is found; it may also be exercised on any analogous ground. But, it
may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.
That would be the province of a court of appeal. A power of review is not to
be confused with appellate powers which may enable an appellate court to
correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court."
</p>
<p id="p_30">                (iii)In yet another decision in RAJINDERSINGH Vs. Lt. GOVERNOR,   
reported in 2005 (13) SCC 289, at paragraph Nos.15 and 16, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that law is well settled that the power of judicial review
of its own order by the High Court inheres in every Court of plenary
jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice.  Power of judicial review
extends to correct all errors to prevent miscarriage of justice.   It was
further held that Courts should not hesitate to review their own earlier
order, when there exists an error on the face of record and the interest of
justice so demands in appropriate cases.        
</p><p id="p_31">                (iv)<a href="/doc/1316559/" id="a_17">In Union of India v. Kamal Sengupta</a> reported in 2008 (8) SCC
612, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, at Paragraphs 14 and 15, has held that, 
        "14. At this stage it is apposite to observe that where a review is
sought on the ground of discovery of new matter or evidence, such matter or
evidence must be relevant and must be of such a character that if the same
had been produced, it might have altered the judgment. In other words, mere
discovery of new or important matter or evidence is not sufficient ground for
review ex debito justiciae. Not only this, the party seeking review has also
to show that such additional matter or evidence was not within its knowledge
and even after the exercise of due diligence, the same could not be produced
before the Court earlier.
</p><p id="p_32">        15. The term `mistake or error apparent' by its very connotation
signifies an error which is evident per se from the record of the case and
does not require detailed examination, scrutiny and elucidation either of the
facts or the legal position. If an error is not self-evident and detection
thereof requires long debate and process of reasoning, it cannot be treated
as an error apparent on the face of the record for the purpose of Order 47
Rule 1 CPC or Section 22(3)(f) of the Act. To put it differently an order or
decision or judgment cannot be corrected merely because it is erroneous in
law or on the ground that a different view could have been taken by the
Court/Tribunal on a point of fact or law. In any case, while exercising the
power of review, the concerned Court/Tribunal cannot sit in appeal over its
judgment/decision."

<p id="p_33">                (v)A Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court, in <a href="/doc/1398449/" id="a_18">Infant Jesus
Teacher Training  vs. M.Manikandan (Rev.Appn.No</a>.38 of 2010 in W.A.No.1145 of  
2009, dated 31.08.2010), referring to various decisions of the Hon'ble Apex
Court as well as this Court, has considered the scope of review and held as

</p><p id="p_34">        ?14.Considering the scope of review jurisdiction and holding "mistake

require a process of reasoning, in <a href="/doc/1673497/" id="a_19">Parsion Devi v. Sumitri Devi</a>, ((1997) 8
SCC 715), the Supreme Court has held as under: 
</p><p id="p_35">"7. It is well settled that review proceedings have to be strictly confined
to the ambit and scope of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. <a href="/doc/1536859/" id="a_20">In Thungabhadra Industries
Ltd. v. Govt. of A.P</a>.(AIR 1964 SC 1372 = (1964) 5 SCR 174) (SCR at p. 186)
this Court opined:
</p><p id="p_36">?What, however, we are now concerned with is whether the statement in the
order of September 1959 that the case did not involve any substantial
question of law is an error apparent on the face of the record. The fact that
on the earlier occasion the Court held on an identical state of facts that a
substantial question of law arose would not per se be conclusive, for the
earlier order itself might be erroneous. Similarly, even if the statement was
wrong, it would not follow that it was an error apparent on the face of the
record, for there is a distinction which is real, though it might not always
be capable of exposition, between a mere erroneous decision and a decision
which could be characterised as vitiated by error apparent. A review is by no
means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and
corrected, but lies only for patent error.?
</p><p id="p_37">......
</p><p id="p_38">31. The review proceeding is not by way of an appeal. Holding that the review
must be confined to error apparent on the face of the record and re-appraisal
of the entire evidence on record for finding the error would amount to
exercise of Appellate Jurisdiction, which is not permissible, in <a href="/doc/139654/" id="a_21">Meera Bhanja
v. Nirmala Kumari Choudhury</a>, (1995) 1 SCC 170, the Supreme Court held as  
under:
</p>
<p id="p_39">"8. It is well settled that the review proceedings are not by way of an
appeal and have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order 47,
Rule 1, CPC. In connection with the limitation of the powers of the court
under Order 47, Rule 1, while dealing with similar jurisdiction available to
the High Court while seeking to review the orders under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, this Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/622454/" id="a_23">Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v.
Aribam Pishak Sharma</a> ((1979 (4) SCC 389), speaking through Chinnappa Reddy,   
J., has made the following pertinent observations: (SCC p. 390, para 3) ?It
is true as observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/1415584/" id="a_24">Shivdeo Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (AIR
1963 SC 1909), there is nothing in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to
preclude the High Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in
every Court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to
correct grave and palpable errors committed by it. But, there are definitive
limits to the exercise of the power of review. The power of review may be
exercised on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which,
after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the
person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when
the order was made; it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent 
on the face of the record is found; it may also be exercised on any analogous
ground. But, it may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was
erroneous on merits. That would be the province of a court of appeal. A power
of review is not to be confused with appellate power which may enable an
appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate
court.
</p>
<p id="p_40">9. Now it is also to be kept in view that in the impugned judgment, the
Division Bench of the High Court has clearly observed that they were
entertaining the review petition only on the ground of error apparent on the
face of the record and not on any other ground. So far as that aspect is
concerned, it has to be kept in view that an error apparent on the face of
record must be such an error which must strike one on mere looking at the
record and would not require any long-drawn process of reasoning on points
where there may conceivably be two opinions. We may usefully refer to the
observations of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1346544/" id="a_26">Satyanarayan Laxminarayan Hegde v.
Mallikarjun Bhavanappa Tirumale</a> (AIR 1960 SC 137), wherein, K.C. Das Gupta, 
J., speaking for the Court has made the following observations in connection
with an error apparent on the face of the record:
</p><p id="p_41">        ?An error which has to be established by a long-drawn process of
reasoning on points where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be
said to be an error apparent on the face of the record. Where an alleged
error is far from self-evident and if it can be established, it has to be
established, by lengthy and complicated arguments, such an error cannot be
cured by a writ of certiorari according to the rule governing the powers of
the superior court to issue such a writ."
</p>
<p id="p_42">        32. As held by the Supreme Court in AIR 1960 SC 137, (SATYANARAYAN      
LAXMINARAYAN HEGDEVS. MALLIKARJUN BHAVANAPPA TIRUMALE), the error must be                 
apparent on the face of the record i.e., error must be self-evident and not
which has to be established by a long drawn process of reasoning or which has
to be searched. In other words, it must be an error and it must be one which
must be manifest on the face of the record. Under the guise of review,
parties are not entitled to rehearing of the same issue. An error can be said
to be apparent on the face of the record only if such error is patent and can
be located without any elaborate argument and without any scope for
controversy with regard to such error, which stares at the face even by a
mere glance of the judgement. The said position of law is reiterated in the
decisions reported in (1997) 8 SCC 715, DELHI ADMINISTRATION VS. GURDIP SINGH       
UBAN AND OTHERS (2001(1) MLJ 45 (SC)), KERALA STATE ELECTRICITY BAORD VS.              
HITECH ELECTROTHERMICS HYDROPOWER LTD. AND OTHERS ((2005) 6 SCC 651), HARIDAS                   
DAS VS. USHA RANI BANK (2006(4) SCC 78) and STATE OF WEST BENGAL AND OTHERS                 
VS. KAMAL SENGUPTA ((2008) 8 SCC 612).?      
</p>
<p id="p_43">                9.Reverting to the case on hand,  going through the order of the
Hon'ble Division Bench in W.A.(MD)No.147 of 2013, dated 22.02.2013,  we do 
not find any mistake or error apparent on the face of it, warranting
interference by way of review.  Review petitioners seek to review a factual
finding given in the writ appeal, wherein it has been categorically held that
the respondent No.1 was employed only as daily wage worker, on full time
basis.  It cannot be done in review.  In view of the above discussion and
decisions referred,  the review application is dismissed.  No order as to
costs.
