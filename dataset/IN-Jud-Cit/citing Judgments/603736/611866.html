ACT:
     Swadeshi Cotton  Mills Company Limited (Acquisition and
<a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_1">Transfer of  Undertakings) Act</a>, 1986-Whether under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_2">section 3</a>
thereof	 equity	 shares	 in  Swadeshi  Polytex	Limited	 and
Swadeshi  Mining  and  Manufacturing  Company  vest  in	 the
Central Govt. and whether the immovable properties have also
vested in the Govt. under the said section.



HEADNOTE:
%
     What fell for consideration in all these matters, viz.,
(i) SLPs.  (civil) Nos.	 4826 and  7045 of  1987,  (ii)	 SLP
(civil) No. 5240 of 1987, (iii) C.M.Ps. Nos. 12029-31/87 (in
CAs Nos.  577-79 of  1987),  (iv)  C.M.Ps.  Nos.  16635	 and
16918/87 (in  S.L.P. (c)  No. 4826/87)	and (v)	 Transferred
Cases Nos.  13 and  14 of 1987 (with CMPs. Nos. 16887-89 and
17018/87), was	a  common  question  of	 law-whether  equity
shares in  two companies,  i.e. 10,00,000 shares in Swadeshi
Polytex Ltd.  and 17,18,344  shares in	Swadeshi Mining	 and
Manufacturing Company  Ltd., held  by  the  Swadeshi  Cotton
Mills, vested  in the  Central Government under section 3 of
the Swadeshi  Cotton Mills  Company  Ltd.  (Acquisition	 and
<a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_3">Transfer of  Undertakings) Act</a>,	 1986. The  other subsidiary
question  was  whether	the  immovable	properties,  namely,
bungalow  No.  1  and  Administrative  Block,  Civil  Lines,
Kanpur, had also vested in the government.
     There  were   six	original  proceedings  initiated  by
various parties	 which gave  rise to  these  civil  appeals,
special leave  petitions and  transferred cases	 before this
Court. These were:
     On 18th  February, 1987,  a suit  was filed  before the
Delhi High  Court by one Naresh Kumar Barti against Dr. Raja
Ram Jaipuria, Swadeshi Polytex and others, for an injunction
restraining the company from holding the 17th annual general
meeting on  the ground	that  34%  shares  in  the  Swadeshi
Polytex vested	in the National Textile Corporation (N.T.C.)
in view	 of <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_4">sections  3</a> and  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_5">4</a> of  the Act.  In the suit, an
application was	 also filed praying that in the event of the
annual general	meeting of  the company	 being allowed to be
held, an independent Chairman should be appointed to conduct
the meeting. The High Court
963
refused to  pass any  order (in	 view of  an  order  already
passed by  the Allahabad  High Court). Against this order of
the Delhi High Court, two special leave petitions were filed
in this	 Court one  by Doypack	Systems Pvt. Ltd. (defendant
No. 10 in the Delhi Suit), which came to registered as Civil
Appeal No. 577 of 1987 after the grant of special leave, and
the other, by Naresh Kumar Barti, the plaintiff in the Delhi
Suit, which came to be registered as Civil Appeal No. 578 of
1987 after the grant of special leave.
     On 24th  February, 1987, one Bari Prasad Aggarwal filed
a suit	in the	court of  the Third  Additional Civil Judge,
Kanpur praying inter alia that Shri Raja Ram Jaipuria should
not preside  over the  17th annual  general meeting  of	 the
company. The  application for an interim injunction filed in
the suit  was dismissed.  In the  appeal  preferred  by	 the
plaintiff before  the Allahabad	 High Court,  an  order	 was
passed by the High Court on 2nd March, 1987, appointing Shri
M.P. Wadhawan  as the  Chairman of  the said  annual general
meeting. Against this order dated 2nd March, 1987, passed by
the Allahabad  High Court  M/s. Doypack	 System	 Pvt.  Ltd.,
preferred a  special leave  petition in	 this  Court,  which
after the grant of leave, was registered as Civil Appeal No.
577 of	1987. The  three special  leave petitions were heard
together as  Civil Appeals Nos. 577, 578 and 579 of 1987 and
disposed of  by this  Court by	a common order on 6th March,
1987, appointing  Shri Jaswant	Singh as the Chairman of the
said annual general meeting.
     On 26th  February, 1987,  another suit-Suit  No. 506 of
1987-was filed	in the Delhi High Court by Mukesh Bhasin for
a declaration  that Swadeshi  Cotton and Swadeshi Mining had
no right in respect of 34% of the share-holdings in Swadeshi
Polytex and  that the  said shares were vested in the N.T.C.
by virtue  of the  said Act. By order dated 9th March, 1987,
the High  Court disposed  of that  application	and  granted
injunction restraining	defendants Nos. 3 and 4 in that suit
from exercising	 any right  whatsoever attached	 to the	 34%
shares of  defendant No. 2 held by them and particularly any
voting right  in the  annual general meeting scheduled to be
held on	 the 9th March, 1987, till the decision of the suit.
This order was brought to the notice of this Court by C.M.P.
forming part  of the  Civil Appeals Nos. 577-579 of 1987. On
9th March,  1987, on  that C.M.P. this Court passed an order
directing that NTC, Swadeshi Cotton and Swadeshi Mining, all
shall be  entitled to vote at the annual general meeting and
the question  as to  who were  the rightful  voters would be
decided by  the Chairman  of the  meeting, etc. This was the
Transferred Case No. 14 of 1987.
964
     One Mukesh	 Jasmani, a  shareholder in Swadeshi Polytex
filed a	 writ petition in the Allahabad High Court. The High
Court by  its order dt. 7th March, 1987, dismissed that writ
petition, observing that Swadeshi Cotton and Swadeshi Mining
would be entitled to vote at the 17th annual general meeting
in respect  of their  shares which, according to N.T.C., had
vested	in   them.  Against   this  order,  Doypack  Systems
preferred the  Special Leave  Petition (civil)	No. 3112  of
1987. This  Court passed  orders on this petition, directing
that the  meeting would	 be held  under the  chairmanship of
Shri Jaswant  Singh notwithstanding  any order	made by	 any
Court. This  Court also vacated the operative portion of the
directions contained  in the  order dated 7th March, 1987 of
the Allahabad High Court.
     On	 6th   April,  1987,   M/s.  Swadeshi	Mining	 and
Manufacturing  Company	filed  a  civil	 writ  petition-Writ
Petition No.  2214  of	1987-in	 the  Allahabad	 High  Court
(Lucknow Bench)	 for stay  of the  operation of	 the letters
dated 24/30 March, 1987, addressed by NTC to Swadeshi Mining
and Manufacturing  Company and Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company
Limited, calling for an Extraordinary General Meeting of the
Shareholders for removal of the Directors of Swadeshi Mining
and Manufacturing  Company Ltd.	 The High  Court  passed  an
order on  the 6th  April, 1987, staying the operation of the
said letters.  Against that order, M/s. Doypack Systems Pvt.
Ltd. filed  Special Leave  Petition No. 4826 of 1987 and NTC
also filed a Special Leave Petition No. 5240 of 1987 in this
Court. By  an order dated 5th May, 1987, this Court directed
that Suit  No. 506  of 1987  in the Delhi High Court and the
Writ Petition  No. 2214	 of 1987 in the Allahabad High Court
be transferred	to this Court, which were registered in this
Court  as   Transferred	 cases	 Nos.  14  and	13  of	1987
respectively.
     NTC filed	a civil	 suit in  the District	Court Kanpur
seeking declaration of its title in respect of the shrubbery
property in  Kanpur. The  court	 refused  any  interlocutory
injunction in the suit against which an appeal was preferred
before	the  High  Court  of  Allahabad	 and  the  same	 was
dismissed. Consequently,  NTC filed a Special Leave Petition
No. 7045 of 1987 in this Court.
     Disposing of the matters, the Court,
^
     HELD: Swadeshi  Mining and	 Manufacturing Co.  Ltd. and
Others submitted that the shares in question did not vest in
the Central Government. [976B]
965
     <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_6">By	 the   Act</a>-Swadeshi  Cotton   Mills   Company	Ltd.
(Acquisition and  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_7">Transfer of Undertakings) Act</a>, 1986-on the
appointed day  "every textile  undertaking" and	 the "right,
title and  interest of	the company  in	 relation  to  every
textile mill  of such textile undertakings" were transferred
to and	vested in  the Central	Government and	such textile
undertakings would be deemed to include "all assets". In the
context of  this provision,  the reliance on the decision of
this Court  in <a href="/doc/1169064/" id="a_8">Balkrishnan  Gupta  and	Others	v.  Swadeshi
Polytex Ltd.  and Others</a>,  [1985]  2  S.C.R.  854,  was	 not
appropriate. [978D-E]
     It appears	 from the  written statement filed by NTC on
8th February,  1987, in the suit filed by one G.G. Bakshi in
Ghaziabad Court,  it was  claimed that	NTC was	 entitled to
take over  company's  shares  and  investments.	 On  24/30th
March, 1987,  NTC issued  notice to  the petitioners 1 and 2
stating that  they were	 entitled to shares. It was urged by
Shri Nariman,  counsel for Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing
Co. Ltd.  &amp; Ors., that this belated assertion indicated that
the shares were not intended to be taken over. The Court was
unable to  accept this suggestion or to draw that inference.
It did not logically follow. [979G-H; 980A]
     Before  dealing  with  the	 main  question,  the  Court
considered an  application made	 by  Shri  Nariman  for	 the
production  of	 certain  documents.   The   petitioner	  in
Transferred Case No. 13 of 1987 had sought production of the
documents. It  was contended  inter alia that the production
of those  documents was	 necessary  to	establish  that	 the
shares were  never intended  to be taken over and these were
never considered  as part  of the  textile undertaking,	 and
that the  documents were  definitely relevant  as they would
throw light on the merits of the case. The production of the
documents was  resisted by the Attorney-General on behalf of
the Union of India on the ground that the documents were not
relevant and in any event most of them were privileged being
part of the documents leading to the tendering of the advice
by the	Cabinet to the President, as contemplated by <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_9">Article
74(2)</a> of the Constitution. [989B, C; 990A]
     Having considered	the facts  and circumstances  of the
case as	 well as  the decisions of this Court in a number of
cases, the  Court was  of the  opinion that the documents in
question were not relevant, and also that the Cabinet papers
are  protected	from  disclosure  not  by  reason  of  their
contents but  because of the class to which they belong; the
Cabinet papers	also include  papers brought  into existence
for the	 purpose of preparing submission to the Cabinet, and
it is the duty of this Court to
966
prevent disclosure  where <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_10">Article  74(2)</a> is  applicable. The
Court was  unable to  accept the prayer of the petitioner to
direct disclosures  and production  of the  documents sought
for. [993F-G; 994H]
     Coming to	the  main  question  involved,	reading	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_11">section 3(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_12">section 4(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/980787/" id="a_13">section 2(k)</a> of
the Act,  each throwing light on the other, it follows that-
(a) under  the first  limb of <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_14">section 3(1)</a> of the Act, every
textile undertaking;  (b) under	 the second  limb of <a href="/doc/461982/" id="a_15">section
3(2)</a>, every  right, title  and interest	 of the	 company  in
relation to  every  such  undertaking,	is  transferred	 and
vested, (c)  the deeming provision of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_16">section 4(1)</a> amplifies
and enlarges  both the	limbs of  the vesting section, being
<a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_17">section 3(1)</a>, (d) the definition of the section is read into
these provisions,  to give  a wider meaning and scope to the
vesting provision  and to  what is  transferred	 or  vested.
[997G-H; 998A]
     <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_18">Sections 7</a>	 and  <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_19">8</a>	 of  the  Act  relied  upon  by	 the
petitioners, being provisions for payment of amounts and for
the issue  of shares  by  NTC  respectively,  will  have  no
bearing on  the scope  of the  vesting provision. As to what
properties have vested cannot proceed on the hypothesis that
there is  a clear numerical or mathematical link between the
quantum of  compensation and  the items	 of property vested.
This correlation  with regard  to such	legislation  is	 not
available. [998B]
     <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_20">Section 8</a>	refers to  the payments	 of the	 amounts  by
Union of  India to  the company. It has no bearing either on
the vesting  section or	 on <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_21">section 7</a> except that the figure
of Rs.24  crores 32  lakhs was	introduced into	 <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_22">section  7</a>.
[998C-D]
     In this  case, a  nationalisation statute is concerned.
Even with  other independent management statutes, in respect
of textile  undertakings a  series of  decisions have upheld
the view  that	the  shares  vest  in  the  Government.	 <a href="/doc/1531491/" id="a_23">See
National Textile  Corporation Ltd.  v. Sitaram Mills</a>, [1986]
Supp. S.C.C.  117, <a href="/doc/1939993/" id="a_24">Minerva Mills v. Union of India</a>, [1986] 4
S.C.C. 222,  Goverdhan Das  Narasingh Das  Daga v.  Union of
India, [1986]  4 S.C.C.	 276, <a href="/doc/1335460/" id="a_25">Vidharba	Mills Berar  Ltd. v.
Union of  India</a>, [1986]	 4 S.C.C.  248 and <a href="/doc/822927/" id="a_26">Fine Knitting Co.
Ltd. v.	 Union of  India</a>, [1986]  4 S.C.C.  276.  The  above
provide	 the   informed	 basis	on  which  the	Court  makes
construction of	 <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_27">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_28">4</a> of the Act. [998G-H; 999A-
B]
     The expressions  "and all	other rights and interest in
or arising  out of such property, as were immediately before
the appointed  day, in	the ownership,	possession, power or
control	 of   the  company   in	  relation   to	  the	said
undertakings", appearing  in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_29">section 4</a> of
the
967
Act indicates  that the shares which have been purchased out
of the funds of the textile undertakings and which have been
held for the benefit of the said textile undertakings, would
come within the scope of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_30">section 4</a> of the Act and thus would
also vest  in the  Central Government  under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_31">section  3</a>. The
origin of these shares and their connection with the textile
undertakings  had   been  fully	 corroborated.	The  textile
business was the only business of the Swadeshi Cotton Mills.
There was  inter-connection and	 inter-relation between	 all
the  six   undertakings.  Investments  in  Swadeshi  Polytex
Limited from  the funds	 of Kanpur  undertaking were  always
made.  Investments  in	Swadeshi  Mining  and  Manufacturing
Company Ltd.  were always  made from the funds of the Kanpur
undertaking.  Assets/investments   held	 and  used  for	 the
benefit of  the textile	 business of  SCM were carried on in
its textile undertakings. [999B-E]
     The words	in the	statute must  Prima facie  be  given
their ordinary	meaning. Where	the grammatical construction
is clear  and manifest	and without doubt, that construction
ought to  prevail unless  there are  some strong and obvious
reasons to  the contrary.  Nothing was shown to warrant that
literal construction  should not  be given  effect  to.	 See
Chandavarkar S.R.  Rao v.  Asha Lata, [1986] 4 S.C.C. 447 at
476, approving	44  Halsbury's	Laws  of  England,  4th	 ed.
paragraph  856,	 p.  552,  Nokes  v.  Doncaster	 Amalgamated
Colliery Ltd.,	[1940] Appeal Cases 1014 at 1022. It must be
emphasised that	 interpretation must  be in  consonance with
the Directive  Principles of  the State	 Policy in  Articles
39(b) and (c) of the Constitution.[999E-G]
     The  object  of  interpretation  of  a  statute  is  to
discover the intention of the Parliament as expressed in the
Act. The  dominant purpose  in constructing  a statute is to
ascertain the  intention of  the legislature as expressed in
the statute,  considering it  as a whole and in its context.
That intention and, therefore the meaning of the statute are
particularly to	 be sought  in the words used in the statute
itself, which  must, if	 they are  plain and unambiguous, be
applied as  they stand.	 In the present case, the words used
represented the	 real intention	 of the	 Parliament  as	 the
Court found not only from the clear words used but also from
the very  purpose of  the vesting of the shares. If the fact
is borne in mind that these shares were acquired from out of
the investments	 made by these two companies and furthermore
that the assets of the company as such minus the shares were
negative and  further the Act in question was passed to give
effect to  the principles  enunciated in clauses (b) and (c)
of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_32">Article  39</a> of  the Constitution,  no doubt was left that
the shares  vested in the Central Government by operation of
<a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_33">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_34">4</a> of the
968
Act. See  in this connection, the observations of Halsbury's
Laws of	 England, 4th  Edition, Volume 44, paragraph 856, p.
522 and the cases noted therein. [999G-H; 1000A-C]
     There is  no exact	 correlation between  the figure  of
capital reserve	 and the  figure of  investments. That could
not be.	 These could  never be	equal. The submission of the
petitioners  failed  to	 take  into  account  the  fact	 the
undertakings, other  than the  Kanpur undertaking,  also had
capital reserve,  even though  there was  no obligation that
these were  excluded assets in respect of other undertakings
and there were no figures of investments therein. [1000D-E]
     Contemporanea Expositio  is a well-settled principle or
doctrine which applies only to the construction of ambiguous
language in  old statutes.  Reliance might be placed in this
connection  on	Maxwell,  13th	Ed.  page  269.	 It  is	 not
applicable to modern statutes. Reference may be made to G.P.
Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 3rd Ed. pages
238,239. The  leading case  on	Contemporanea  expositio  is
Comppell College  Belfast v.  Commissioner of  Valuation for
Northern Ireland,  [1964] 1  W.L.R. 912,  in which  House of
Lords made  it clear that the doctrine is to be applied only
to the	construction of	 ambiguous language  in the very old
statutes. Lord	Watson said  in Clyde Navigation Trustees v.
Laird, [1983]  8 A.C. 658 that Contemporanea expositio could
have no	 application to	 a modern Act. The Court, therefore,
rejected the attempt of the petitioners to lead the Court to
this forbidden	track by  referring  to	 various  extraneous
matters. Furthermore,  those external aids sought before the
Court did  not support	the petitioners'  approach  to	this
question at all. [1000F-H; 1001A]
     <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_35">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_36">4</a> of the Act evolve a legislative policy
and set	 out the  parameters  within  which  it	 has  to  be
implemented. The  Court could  not find	 that there  was any
special intention  to exclude  the shares  in this  case, as
seen from  the existence  of at least four other <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_37">Acquisition
Act</a>s which  used identical  phraseology in  <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_38">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_39">4</a>
and the	 other sections	 as  well-Aluminium  Corporation  of
India  Ltd.   (Acquisition   and   Transfer   of   Aluminium
Undertakings) Act, 1984, Amritsar Oil Works (Acquisition and
<a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_40">Transfer of  Undertakings) Act</a>,	 1982, Britannia Engineering
Company (Mohmeh	 Unit) and  the Arthur	Butler	and  Company
(Muzaffarpore)	 Ltd.	 (Acquisition	and    <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_41">Transfer	  of

Limited (Acquisition  and  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_42">Transfer  of	 Undertakings)	Act</a>,
1984. [1001E-F]
969
     It appeared  to the  Court that the expression "forming
part of"  appearing in	<a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_43">section 27</a> could not be so read with
<a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_44">section 4(1)</a>  as would	have the  effect of  restricting  or
cutting down  the scope	 and ambit of the vesting provisions
in <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_45">section 3(1)</a>. The expression "pertaining to" did not mean
"forming  part	 of".  Even  assuming  that  the  expression
"pertaining to"	 appearing in the first limb of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_46">section 4(1)</a>
means "forming part of", it would mean that only such assets
as had	a direct  nexus with  the textile  mills, would fall
under the first limb of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_47">section 4(1)</a>. The shares in question
would still  vest in the Central Government under the second
limb of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_48">section 4(1)</a> of the Act since the shares were bought
out of	the income of the textile mills and were held by the
company in  relation to	 such mills.  The shares  would also
fall in	 the second  limb of  <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_49">section 3(1)</a>  being right	 and
title  of   the	 company   in  relation	  to   the   textile
mills.[1002C-E]
     On the construction of <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_50">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_51">4</a>, the Court came
to the	conclusion that	 the shares  vested in	the  Central
Government even if <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_52">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_53">4</a> were read in conjunction
with <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_54">sections  7</a> and  <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_55">8</a>	 of  the  Act  on  the	well-settled
principles.  The   expression  'in  relation  to'  has	been
interpreted  to	 be  words  of	the  widest  amplitude.	 <a href="/doc/1531491/" id="a_56">See
National Textile  Corporation Ltd. and Ors. v. Sitaram Mills
Ltd</a>. (supra).  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_57">Section 4</a> appears to be an expanding section.
It introduces  a deeming  provision, which  is	intended  to
enlarge the  meaning of a particular word or include matters
which  otherwise  may  or  may	not  fall  within  the	main
provisions. It	is well-settled	 that the word 'includes' is
an inclusive definition and expands the meaning. [1002F-G]
     To leave  a  company,  the	 net  wealth  of  which	 was
negative at  the time  of take-over  of the management, with
the shares  held by  it as  investment in the other company,
was,  in  the  Court's	opinion,  not  only  to	 defeat	 the
principles of  Articles 39(b)  and (c)	of the Constitution,
but it	would permit  the company  to reap the fruits of its
mismanagement. That  would be an absurd situation. It had to
be borne  in mind  that the net wealth of the company at the
time of take-over was negative; hence <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_58">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_59">4</a> could
be meaningfully	 read if all the assets including the shares
were considered	 to be	taken over  by the acquisition. That
was the	 only irresistible conclusion that followed from the
construction of	 the documents	and the	 history of the Act,
which expressly recites that it was to ensure the principles
enunciated in  clauses (b)  and (c)  of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_60">Article	 39</a>  of	 the
Constitution. <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_61">The  Act</a> must  be	 so  read  that	 it  further
ensures such  meaning and  secures the ownership and control
of the	material resources  to the community to subserve the
common good to see that the operation of the economic system
does not result in injustice. [1003F-H; 1004A]

     The  shares   vested   in	 the   Central	 Government.
Accordingly, the  shares in  question  were  vested  in	 the
N.T.C. and  it had  right over	the said  34 per cent of the
share-holdings. [1004B]
     The 10,00,000  shares in  the Swadeshi Polytex Ltd. and
17,18,344 in  the Swadeshi  Mining and Manufacturing Company
Ltd. held by the Swadeshi Cotton Mills vested in the Central
Government under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_62">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_63">4</a> of the Act. [1004B-C]
     In view  of the  amplitude of  the language  used,	 the
immovable properties,  namely, the  Bungalow No.  1 and	 the
Administrative Block,  Civil Lines,  Kanpur, also  vested in
the NTC. [1004C-D]
     In that  view of the matter, in Transferred Case No. 13
of 1987,  the Writ  Petition No. 2214 of 1987 was dismissed.
All interim  orders were  vacated. This would dispose of the
various other  SLPs and CMPs connected with the Lucknow writ
petition, being	 SLP (Civil)  No.  4826	 of  1987  filed  by
Doypack Systems	 Pvt. Ltd.,  SLP (Civil)  No. 5240  of	1987
filed by  NTC. CMPs  16918 and 16919 of 1987 in SLP No. 4826
of 1987	 would stand disposed of in the above light. [1004D-
F]
     In the Transferred Case No. 14 of 1987 (in Suit No. 506
of 1987),  the Court  held that 10 lakhs and 17 lakhs equity
shares and  the Swadeshi House at Kanpur and all the rights,
title  and  interest  attached	therewith,  related  to	 the
textile undertaking  of defendant  No. 3  and they vested in
NTC with  effect from 1st April, 1985, and defendants Nos. 3
and 4  were restrained	by a  decree of permanent injunction
from dealing  with them	 in any manner whatsoever. Defendant
No.  2	 was  restrained   by  permanent   injunction	from
recognising defendants	Nos.  3	 and  4	 as  owners  of	 the
aforesaid shares and the Swadeshi House. [1004F-G]
     Defendant No.  2 was  directed to	enter  the  name  of
defendant No.  1, namely, NTC in its register of members and
to treat  the said  defendant  No.  1  as  its	share-holder
instead of  defendants Nos. 3 and 4 in respect of the shares
of defendant  No. 2  held by them. In view of the provisions
of law	under <a href="/doc/1935707/" id="a_64">section 108</a> of the Companies Act, as there was
transmission of	 shares by  operation of  law, rectification
was not necessary.[1004H; 1005A-B]
     Civil Appeals  Nos. 577 to 579 of 1987 were disposed of
in the	above terms and it was directed that the 17th annual
general meeting	 be held in accordance with law after giving
proper notice under the
971
Chairmanship of Shri Jaswant Singh. [1005C]
     CMPs Nos. 12760 of 1987 in Civil Appeal No. 577 of 1987
would stand  disposed of  in terms  of	the  orders  in	 the
Transferred Case No. 14 of 1987 and it was directed that the
Chairman  should   act	in  accordance	with  the  aforesaid
decision and  NTC should  be considered	 to be	entitled  to
vote. CMP 16887 of 1987 was rejected. [1005D]
     CMP 16888 of 1987 was an application by Doypack Systems
Ltd.  to   be  impleaded   as  a   party-respondent  in	 the
Transferred  Case  No.	13  of	1987.  Doypack	Systems	 was
permitted to  argue and	 was heard  as a  party. No  further
order was necessary. [1005E]
     CMPs Nos. 16889 and 17018 of 1987 were allowed. CMP No.
18268 of  1987 was  disposed of	 with the  direction that no
further documents  needed to  be inspected.  In view  of the
orders, the  other CMPs	 were  no  longer  necessary  to  be
disposed of. [1005F]
     Irrespective of any order passed by any court, the 17th
annual general	meeting should	be held	 in accordance	with
law, to	 be presided over by Shri Jaswant Singh, recognising
NTC as the rightful owner of the disputed shares. [1005G]

(Civil) No. 4826 of 1987 etc.
     From the  Judgment and  order  dated  6.4.1987  of	 the
Allahabad High	Court in C.M.A. No. 4555 (W) of 1987 in W.P.
No. 2214 of 1987.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">973</span>
<p id="p_3">     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. What falls for consideration in
all these  matters is  a common	 question  of  law,  namely,
whether equity	shares in  the two  companies i.e. 10,00,000
shares in  Swadeshi Polytex  Limited and 17,18,344 shares in
Swadeshi Mining	 and Manufacturing  Company Limited, held by
the Swadeshi  Cotton Mills,  vest in  the Central Government
under Section 3 of the Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Limited
(Acquisition  and   <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_88">Transfer  of   Undertakings)  Act</a>,	1986
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'). The other subsidiary
question is  whether the  immovable properties,	 namely, the
bungalow No.  1 and  the Administrative	 Block, Civil Lines,
Kanpur have  also vested  in the Government. The question as
to one	more property known as Shrubbery property whether it
has been  taken over or not is still to be argued and is not
covered by this judgment.
</p><p id="p_4">     In order to appreciate the question in these matters it
has to	be borne  in  mind  that  there	 were  six  original
proceedings initiated  by various parties which gave rise to
these  civil   appeals,	 special  leave	 petitions  and	 the
transferred  cases   to	 this	Court.	These  six  original
proceedings are as follows:
</p><p id="p_5">     (1) On  18th of February, 1987 Suit No. 418 of 1987 was
filed before  the Delhi High Court by one Naresh Kumar Parti
against Dr.  Raja Ram Jaipuria, Swadeshi Polytex and others,
praying for  an order  of injunction restraining the company
from holding  the 17th	annual general meeting on the ground
that 34%  shares in Swadeshi Polytex have vested in National
Textile Corporation  (briefly referred to as NTC) in view of
<a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_89">sections  3</a>  and  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_90">4</a>  of	 the  said  Act.  In  this  suit  an
application for	 grant of  interim injunction was also filed
praying that  in the event the annual general meeting of the
company is  allowed to	be  held,  an  independent  Chairman
should be  appointed  to  conduct  the	meeting.  Notice  in
respect	 of   the  said	 application  was  served  upon	 the
respondents on	20th of	 February, 1987.  On 4th March, 1987
the Delhi  High Court  refused to  pass any order in view of
the  order  already  passed  by	 the  Allahabad	 High  Court
mentioned hereinafter.	Against this order of the Delhi High
Court, two  special leave petitions were filed in this Court
one by Doypack Systems Pvt. Ltd., which was defendant No. 10
in the	Delhi suit.  (Consequent upon  grant of	 leave,	 the
special leave petition came to be registered as Civil Appeal
No. 577 of 1987). The other special leave petition was filed
by the	plaintiff in  the Delhi	 suit, Naresh  Kumar  Parti.
(Consequent upon  grant of leave, the special leave petition
came to be registered as Civil Appeal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">974</span>
No. 578	 of 1987). On 24th of February, 1987 one Hari Prasad
Aggarwal, filed	 a suit	 being Case  No. 183  of 1987 in the
Court of Third Additional Civil Judge, Kanpur praying, inter
alia, that  Shri Raja  Ram Jaipuria  should not preside over
the 17th  annual general  meeting of the Company. On 27th of
February, 1987, the application for interim injunction filed
in the	said suit  was dismissed by the learned trial Judge.
In appeal  which  is  not  yet	numbered  preferred  by	 the
plaintiff before  the Allahabad	 High  Court  an  order	 was
passed by  the Court on 2nd March, 1987 appointing Shri M.P.
Wadhawan as the Chairman of the said annual general meeting.
The consenting	parties to  the said  proceedings before the
Allahabad  High	 Court	were  Shri  Raja  Ram  Jaipuria	 and
Swadeshi Polytex  Limited. Against  this order of 2nd March,
1987 passed by the Allahabad High Court M/s. Doypack Systems
Private Limited	 preferred a  special leave petition in this
Court. Leave  was granted  and as  mentioned hereinbefore it
was registered	as Civil  Appeal No.  577 of 1987. The three
special leave petitions were heard together as Civil Appeals
Nos. 577,  578 and  579 of  1987 and  were disposed  of by a
common order  on 6th  March, 1987  by this  Court appointing
Shri Jaswant  Singh as	the  Chairman  of  the	said  annual
general meeting.
</p><p id="p_6">     On 26th  of February,  1987 another suit being Suit No.
506 of 1987, was filed in the Delhi High Court by one Mukesh
Bhasin praying,	 inter alia, for a declaration that Swadeshi
Cotton and Swadeshi Mining had no right in respect of 34% of
the shareholdings  in Swadeshi	Polytex and  that  the	said
shares were  vested in	NTC by virtue of the said Act. By an
order dated 9th March, 1987 the Delhi High Court disposed of
that application.  The learned	Judge in that case was prima
facie satisfied that the plaintiff in that case was entitled
to an  injunction claimed  by  him  in	the  meeting  to  be
presided over  by Shri	Jaswant Singh. He granted injunction
restraining the	 defendants Nos.3  and 4  in that  suit from
exercising any	right whatsoever  attached to  34% shares of
defendant No.2	held by	 them and  particularly	 any  voting
rights in  the annual general meeting which was scheduled to
be held	 on 9th	 of March,  1987 till decision of that suit.
This order  was brought	 to the	 notice of this Court by CMP
forming part  of Civil Appeal Nos. 577-79 of 1987. On 9th of
March, 1987 on that CMP this Court passed an order directing
that NTC,  Swadeshi Cotton and Swadeshi Mining, all shall be
entitled to  vote at  the annual  general  meeting  and	 the
question as to who were the rightful voters would be decided
by the Chairman of the meeting. It was further directed that
the Chairman  would keep these votes separately. This is the
Transferred Case  No. 14  of 1987  herein. On  7th of March,
1987 one Mukesh Jasnani a shareholder in Swadeshi
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">975</span>
Polytex filed  a writ  petition in  the Allahabad High Court
(Lucknow Bench).  The High  Court by  its order dated 7th of
March, 1987  dismissed that writ petition. The High Court in
the said  order observed  that Swadeshi	 Cotton and Swadeshi
Mining would  be entitled to vote at the 17th annual general
meeting in  respect of	their shares which, according to NTC
had vested  in them.  Against this  order dated	 7th  March,
1987, Doypack  Systems preferred  a special  leave  petition
being SLP  (Civil) No. 3112 of 1987. On 9th March, 1987 this
Court passed orders in this special leave petition directing
that the  meeting would	 be held  under the  Chairmanship of
Shri Jaswant  Singh notwithstanding  any order	made by	 any
court, including  the order  dated 3rd March, 1987 passed by
the Division  Bench of	the Allahabad High Court. This Court
also  vacated	the  operative	portion	 of  the  directions
contained in  the order	 dated 7th March, 1987 passed by the
Allahabad High Court.
</p><p id="p_7">     On	 6th   of  April,  1987	 M/s.  Swadeshi	 Mining	 and
Manufacturing Company  filed a	civil writ petition No. 2214
of 1987 in the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) praying,
inter alia,  for stay  of the operation of the letters dated
24/30th March,	1987 addressed by NTC to Swadeshi Mining and
Manufacturing and  Swadeshi Cotton  Mills  Company  Limited,
calling	 for   an  Extraordinary   General  Meeting  of	 the
shareholders for removal of the Directors of Swadeshi Mining
and Manufacturing Company Limited. The Division Bench of the
High Court  (Lucknow Bench) passed an order on 6th of April,
1987, staying the operation of the said letters addressed by
NTC to	the companies.	Against	 that  order,  M/s.  Doypack
Systems Pvt. Ltd. filed a Special Leave Petition No. 4826 of
1987. NTC  also filed  a special  leave petition against the
said order,  being SLP	No. 5240 of 1987 in this Court. Both
these petitions	 were heard  by this Court on 5th May, 1987.
By an order passed on 5th May, 1987 this Court directed that
Suit No.  506 of 1987 filed in the Delhi High Court and Writ
Petition No.  2214 of  1987 pending  in the  Allahabad	High
Court  (Lucknow	  Bench)  be   transferred  to	this  Court,
(subsequently, registered  as Transferred  Cases Nos. 14 and
13 of  1987 respectively).  Consequent upon leave granted by
this Court  by the  order dated	 21st of  January, 1987	 NTC
filed a civil suit in the District Court at Kanpur.seeking a
declaration of its title in respect of Shrubbery property in
Kanpur. The  learned Trial  Judge refused  any interlocutory
injunction in  the said	 suit against  which an	 appeal	 was
preferred before  the High Court of Allahabad which was also
declined and, consequently, NTC filed Special Leave Petition
No. 7045  of 1987  in this  Court. This application is still
pending and  is awaiting  disposal. In this background these
matters will have to be disposed of.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">976</span>
<p id="p_8">     Swadeshi Mining  and Manufacturing	 Co. Ltd. and others
submitted that	these shares  did not  vest in	the  Central
Government. The	 main thrust  of Shri  Nariman's contention,
who appeared  on their behalf, was that <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_91">section 3</a> of the Act
provided that every textile undertaking and right, title and
interest of  the company, i.e. Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company
Limited vested	in  the	 Central  Government.  The  "textile
undertakings" mentioned	 in <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_92">section  3</a> included	 all  assets
'pertaining' to	 the textile undertaking as per <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_93">section 4</a> of
the Act. It is common ground that whether a particular asset
is part of the textile undertaking and vests under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_94">section 3</a>
or not,	 has to be considered in the context of the Act with
reference to the language used in <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_95">section 4</a> of the Act. Shri
Nariman submitted  that there  are different  modes by which
Parliament  can	 resort	 to  nationalisation.  These  modes,
according to him, are:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (a) acquisition of 100% shares of the Company;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (b) all assets under the ownership, possession or
     control of the company being vested in the Government;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (c) only  those assets  in the ownership, possession or
     control of	 the company in relation to the undertakings
     which are	taken over  or "all properties pertaining to
     the undertaking"  vest in	the Government. According to
     him, the  expressions "pertaining	to" or	"in relation
     to" are  expressions of  limitation and restriction, in
     the absence  of which  each  and  every  asset  of	 the
     company  would  have  vested  in  the  Government.	 The
     background	 and  sequence	of  events  leading  to	 the
     enactment of  this Act  through which Shri Nariman took
     us in  detail and	it is  useless to  set	them  up  in
     extenso, he  submitted that the shares in question were
     all  along	  being	 considered   and  treated   as	 not
     comprising part of the textile undertaking.</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">     He referred  to the  order dated  13th of	April,	1978
issued by  the Central	Government under <a href="/doc/1850645/" id="a_96">section 18AA</a> of the
Industries   (Development    and   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_97">Regulation)	 Act</a>,	1951
(hereinafter referred  to as  'the IDR Act'). This order did
not purport  to take  over those  shares  held	in  the	 two
companies by  the Swadeshi  Cotton Mills Company Limited. He
also drew our attention to Volume III pages 53 and 54 of the
present volumes	 before	 us,  which  is	 the  reply  of	 the
Minister  of  Law,  Justice  and  Company  Affairs.  It	 was
clarified to  the Parliament  that the	shares were distinct
from the  undertakings of  the company	whose management was
taken over. On 27th of March, 1979 in answer to a question
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">977</span>
the Minister  stated that  apart from  the six	undertakings
taken  over  and  presently  run  by  the  National  Textile
Corporation Limited,  the business  of the company comprised
of:
</p><p id="p_10">     (i) Investments in Swadeshi Polytex Limited, Ghaziabad.
</p><p id="p_11">     (ii) Investments  in Swadeshi  Mining and Manufacturing
Company Limited, a subsidiary company.
</p><p id="p_12">     (iii) Land development business.
</p><p id="p_13">     He drew our attention to the letter dated 9th of April,
1979 from  the Chairman,  Cotton Mills	Ltd. in	 answer to a
letter by  the	Director,  Department  of  Company  Affairs,
stating that the shares in question and the voting rights in
respect thereof	 continued to  vest  in	 the  company,	i.e.
Swadeshi Cotton	 Mills Limited in spite of the taken over of
the management.
</p><p id="p_14">     Before  we	 proceed  further  we  must  deal  with	 the
decision of  this Court	 in <a href="/doc/1169064/" id="a_98">Balkrishan	Gupta and  others v.
Swadeshi Polytex Ltd. and others</a>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 854. There
it was	observed that the fact that 3,50,000 shares had been
pledged in  favour of  the Government of Uttar Pradesh would
not make  any difference.  The contention  that was urged on
behalf of  the appellant  therein, namely  Balkrishan  Gupta
related to  the effect	of an  order  made  by	the  Central
Government on  13th of	April, 1978 under section 18AA(1)(a)
of the IDR Act taking over the management of Swadeshi Cotton
Mills along  with five	other industrial  units belonging to
the Company  which was	the subject  matter  of	 dispute  in
<a href="/doc/859161/" id="a_99">Swadeshi Cotton Mills v. Union of India</a>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 533
and the	 order of extension passed by the Central Government
on 26th	 November, 1983	 which was  the	 subject  matter  of
dispute in  that case  before this  Court It  was  urged  in
<a href="/doc/1169064/" id="a_100">Balkrishan v.  Swadeshi Polytex</a>	 (supra) on  behalf  of	 the
appellants therein  that on  the passing of the above orders
under <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_101">Section  18AA(1)(a)</a>, the Cotton Mills Company lost its
voting rights  in respect  of the  shares in  question. This
Court held  that was not so. This Court emphasised that what
was taken  over was  the management  of the  six  industrial
units referred	to therein  and not  all the  rights of	 the
Cotton Mills  Company. The shares belonged, it was observed,
to the	company and  the orders	 referred to above could not
have any  effect on  these. In that context, it was observed
that the  Department of Company Affairs, Government of India
rightly expressed  its view  in the  letter written  by	 the
Director in  the Department  of Company	 Affairs on  9th  of
April, 1979 to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">978</span>
Chairman of  the Cotton Mills Company that the voting rights
in respect of these shares continued to vest with the Cotton
Mills Company  and the	manner in  which those voting rights
were to	 be exercised  was to  be determined by the Board of
Directors of  the Cotton Mills Company. Hence the passing of
the orders  under section  18AA(1)(a) of  the IDR Act had no
effect on  the voting rights of the Cotton Mills Company. It
was further  observed that  the Polytex	 Company had in that
case rightly  treated the  registered holder i.e. the Cotton
Mills Company  as the owner of the shares in question and to
call the  meeting in accordance with the notice issued under
<a href="/doc/926793/" id="a_102">section	 169</a>  of  the  Companies  Act,	1956.  Therefore,  a
challenge to  the validity  of the meeting was negatived. As
good  deal   of	 reliance   was	 placed	 on  behalf  of	 the
petitioners on this decision, it must be emphasised that the
decision must,	however, be understood in the context of the
facts and  the language	 used  in  the	order  passed  under
section 18AA  of the IDR Act whereby only the management had
been taken  over and  not the rights of the company therein.
But by	the present  Act in  question on  the appointed	 day
"every	textile	 undertaking"  and  "the  right,  title	 and
interest of the company in relation to every textile mill of
such textile undertakings" were transferred to and vested in
the Central  Government and  such textile undertakings would
be deemed  to include  "all assets" and so in the context of
this  provision	 the  reference	 and  the  reliance  on	 the
decision of  the  <a href="/doc/1169064/" id="a_103">Balkrishan  Gupta  &amp;	others	v.  Swadeshi
Polytex Ltd.  and others</a>  (supra) is  not, in  our  opinion,
appropriate. It	 is true  by the IDR Act only management was
taken over, but a further point was sought to be built up on
behalf of  the petitioners  that the  Act  in  question	 was
passed to regularise what was taken over. So because of this
decision shares	 were not  taken over by the Act. In view of
the significant	 difference between  the objects  of  taking
over of	 the assets  and the  taking over  of the management
this submission has to be stated to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_15">     Reliance was  also placed	before us on the decision of
the Delhi  High Court  in Writ Petition No. 408 of 1978. The
Delhi High  Court held	that the  shares did not vest in the
Government under  the order dated 13th of April, 1978 issued
under section  18AA of	the IDR	 Act. This  judgment of	 the
Delhi High Court was challenged in appeal before this Court.
This Court in its judgment in <a href="/doc/859161/" id="a_104">Swadeshi Cotton Mills v. Union
of India</a> (supra) set aside the order of take-over dated 13th
April, 1978  for violation  of	the  principles	 of  natural
justice. But  this Court  did not  give any finding or order
with regard to the finding of the High Court that the shares
were not included in the take-over order.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">979</span>
<p id="p_16">     It was  further urged  before  us	that  this  Act	 was
preceded by  an	 ordinance  namely,  Swadeshi  Cotton  Mills
Company Limited	 (Acquisition and  Transfer of Undertakings)
Ordinance, 1986	 which was  promulgated on  19th  of  April,
1986.  <a href="/doc/1819093/" id="a_105">Section	 10</a>  of	  the  ordinance  entitled,  it	 was
submitted, NTC	to exercise control over the business of the
undertakings taken  over. the  NTC passed  an order  to this
effect on 25th April, 1986, but did not purport to take over
the shares, according to Shri Nariman. We cannot attach much
significance to that fact as Shri Nariman sought us to do.
</p><p id="p_17">     Shri Nariman  referred us	to the	Statement of Objects
and Reasons  appended to  the Bill and urged that it was not
intended that  the shares  were included in the undertaking.
He submitted  that the	Statement  of  Objects	and  Reasons
showed that  the acquisition  of the  undertaking had  to be
resorted to since the order of taking over the management of
the company  issued under  section 18AA of the IDR Act could
not be continued any further.
</p><p id="p_18">     The preamble  to the  Act, however, reiterated that the
Act provided  for the  acquisition and	transfer of  textile
undertakings and  reiterated only  the historical facts that
the management	of the	textile undertakings  had been taken
over by the Central Government under section 18AA of the IDR
Act and	 further that  large sums of money had been invested
with a view to making the textile undertakings viable and it
was necessary  to  make	 further  investments  and  also  to
acquire the  said  undertakings	 in  order  to	ensure	that
interests of general public are served by the continuance of
the undertakings.  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_106">The Act</a>  was passed to give effect to the
principles specified in clauses (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_107">Article 39</a> of
the Constitution. In our opinion, this was indicative of the
fact that shares were intended to be taken over.
</p><p id="p_19">     Shri Nariman, however, contended that NTC on 17th June,
1986 had  issued an  order under  <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_108">section 6</a> of the Ordinance
transferring  four   of	 the  textile  undertakings  to	 its
subsidiary, the	 NTC, U.P.  Limited. According	to him,	 the
shares were  not purported  to	be  transferred	 under	this
Order. This, however, in our opinion, is non sequitur.
</p><p id="p_20">     It appears	 from the  written statement filed by NTC on
8th of	February, 1987	in the suit filed by one G.G. Bakshi
in Ghaziabad  Court, it was claimed that NTC was entitled to
take over  company's  shares  and  investments.	 On  24/30th
March, 1987  NTC issued	 notice to  the petitioners  1 and 2
stating that  they were	 entitled to shares. It was urged by
Shri Nariman that this belated assertion indicated that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">980</span>
shares were  not intended to be taken over. We are unable to
accept this  suggestion or  to draw  that inference. It does
not logically follow.
</p><p id="p_21">     On the  date of  the  take-over  of  the  undertakings,
according to  Shri Nariman,  10,00,000	shares	in  Swadeshi
Polytex Limited	 were attached	for recovery  of electricity
dues of	 Swadeshi Cotton  Mills	 and  3,50,000	shares	were
already pledged	 with  the  State  Government  of  U.P.	 for
securing the loans and advances made by the State Government
for payment  of wages.	These dues  fall in  Part II  of the
Schedule to  the Act and are not payable under <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_109">section 25</a> of
the Act	 by the	 Government.  Shri  Nariman  submitted	that
compensation payable under the Act was not enough to pay all
the dues  falling in  Part I.  He drew	our attention to the
Financial Memorandum  of the  Bill  which  showed  that	 the
Government would  have to pay a further sum of Rs. 15 crores
over and  above the  compensation amount.  It could not have
been  the   intention  of   the	 Act   to  discharge   these
encumbrances, according	 to him, if they were to vest in the
Central Government under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_110">section 3</a> of the Act and the result
of which would be that the State of U.P. and the Electricity
Board would  not get  anything towards	their large dues. We
are unable  to accept this submission. This, in our opinion,
is not the proper approach to the construction of the Act on
the question whether the shares were taken over or not.
</p><p id="p_22">     Shri Nariman submitted that while applying the rules of
construction of	 contemporanea expositio,  it must  be	held
that the  shares in  question did  not vest  in the  Central
Government under  <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_111">section 3</a>  of the Act. This contention was
to  be	 supported  from  the  external	 aids,	namely,	 the
background  and	 history  of  the  legislation.	 There	were
internal aids  in the Act itself to support this contention.
The internal  aids, according to Shri Nariman, were-(a) long
title of  the Act which used the expression "certain textile
undertakings"	and    "ensuring   contiuned	manufacture,
production and	distribution of different varieties of cloth
and yarn";  (b) the  Preamble to  the Act  also	 emphasises,
according to  Shri Nariman,  that the  textile	undertakings
which were taken over under <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_112">section 18AA</a> should be continued
for purposes  of manufacture, production and distribution of
cloth and  yarn; (c)  He further  submitted that the Objects
and Reasons  appended to  the Bill also supported that view;
</p><p id="p_23">(d) <a href="/doc/980787/" id="a_113">section  2(k)</a> of  the Act  enumerated only	six  textile
undertakings which alone were taken over by the order issued
under <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_114">section  18AA</a>; (e)  <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_115">sections 7</a>  and <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_116">8</a> also provided an
intrinsic aid to the construction of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_117">section 4</a>, according to
him. <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_118">Section 7</a> provided that an amount equal to the value of
the assets which will vest in the NTC, would be deemed to be
the Central Government's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">981</span>
contribution to	 the equity  capital of	 NTC and  NTC  shall
issue shares  to the Government having a face value equal to
the amount  specified in  <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_119">section 8</a>. The amount equal to the
value of the assets was Rs.24.32 crores, which was the share
capital of  the Government  in NTC.  This figure of Rs.24.32
crores does  not take  into account  the value of the shares
and hence  the shares did not vest under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_120">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_121">4</a> of
the Act,  according to	him. (f)  the expression "pertaining
to" appearing  in <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_122">section  4(1)</a>	 means	"forming  part	of".
Therefore, only	 those	assets	which  formed  part  of	 the
textile undertakings  could vest  in the Central Government,
it was	submitted by  Shri Nariman.  It was  for this reason
that <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_123">section  25</a> of  the Act,  while dealing with penalties,
used the  expression "assets  forming part  of" the  textile
undertakings.
</p><p id="p_24">     Shri Nariman  further submitted  that Swadeshi  Polytex
Limited	 and   Swadeshi	 Mining	 and  Manufacturing  Company
Limited were two separate undertakings distinct from the six
textile undertakings  belonging	 to  Swadeshi  Cotton  Mills
Company	 Limited.   Acquisition	 of   these  shares   having
controlling interests  in the  said two	 companies was never
intended and  could never  be said to be within the scope of
the Act.  The expression  "in relation	to the	six  textile
undertakings" appearing	 in <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_124">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_125">4</a> of the Act, was
an expression of limitation, according to him, indicative of
the intention  of acquiring of only the textile undertakings
and no	other. There existed no public purpose, according to
Shri  Nariman,	 for  acquiring	 these	shares.	 The  public
purposes mentioned  in the  Act with  reference	 to  <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_126">Article
39(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_127">(c)</a> related to the acquisition of only the textile
undertakings of Swadeshi Cotton Mills and not acquisition of
the synthetic  fibre undertakings  of  Swadeshi	 Polytex  or
sugar undertakings  of	Swadeshi  Mining  and  Manufacturing
Company Limited.
</p><p id="p_25">     Dr. Chitale  appearing on behalf of Swadeshi Mining and
Manufacturing Company  Limited (as respondent in SLP (Civil)
No. 5240  of 1987  in which NTC is the petitioner) supported
Shri  Nariman  and  advanced  certain  arguments.  His	main
arguments were:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (1) Swadeshi  Polytex Limited  and Swadeshi  Mining and
     Manufacturing  Company   Limited  were   two   distinct
     undertakings   different	 from	the    six   textile
     undertakings belonging to Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company
     Limited. <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_128">Section  3</a> of the Act, therefore, according to
     him, could	 not  be  so  construed	 as  to	 enable	 the
     Government to  indirectly acquire	altogether different
     undertakings belonging to a different company.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">982</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (2) Swadeshi  Mining and  Manufacturing Company Limited
     had also  coal-mines. <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_129">When Coal-mines (Nationalisation)
     Act</a>, 1973 was passed with reference to <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_130">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1309466/" id="a_131">6</a>
     thereof, it  were the  coal-mines belonging to the said
     company along with the right, title and interest of the
     owners in	relation to  the coal-mines  which vested in
     the Central Government by operation of the Act, we were
     reminded.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     (3) Dr.  Chitale submitted	 that the  Act with which we
     are concerned  uses the  expression "pertaining  to" in
     <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_132">section 4</a>,	 which according to him is narrower than the
     expression "in  relation to"  used in  <a href="/doc/956071/" id="a_133">section 3</a> of the
     Coal-mines (Nationalisation)  Act, 1973. When the coal-
     mines were	 nationalised,	the  sugar  undertakings  of
     Swadeshi  Mining	were  not  taken  over	since  these
     constituted separate  undertakings	 distinct  from	 the
     coal-mines. He  referred to Entries 655, 656 and 657 of
     the Schedule  to the  <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_134">Coal-mines (Nationalisation) Act</a>,
     1973.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (4)  Dr.	Chitale	 submitted   that   the	  expression
     "investment" may belong to a fund which may be created,
     the interests  of which  may be  used  for	 payment  of
     gratuity  or  provident  fund  to	the  employees.	 The
     expression	 "investment"	cannot	be  applied  in	 the
     context of the shareholdings of a separate undertaking,
     according to him.</blockquote>
<p id="p_26">     Shri S.B.	Mukerjee, appearing  on behalf	of  Swadeshi
Cotton Mills  had relied  on the  decision of the Delhi High
Court, See  Volume III	pages 64  to 169, which according to
him, clearly  held that the shares in question were not part
of the	textile undertakings  and, in  fact, the said shares
were not  taken over along with the six textile undertakings
belonging to  Swadeshi Cotton  Mills Limited,  which we have
discussed. Shri Mukerjee further relied on the clarification
given by  the Company Law Board which showed that the voting
rights in  respect  of	the  shares  continued	to  vest  in
Swadeshi Cotton	 Mills and  not in  NTC. He  referred to the
decision in  <a href="/doc/1169064/" id="a_135">Balkrishan Gupta and others v. Swadeshi Polytex
Ltd. and another</a> (supra), which has also been discussed. The
expression "relating  to" and  "pertaining to"	are words of
limitation and they cannot be so construed as to take within
their  fold   shares  held  by	Swadeshi  Cotton  Mills,  an
independent company doing its business, according to him.
</p><p id="p_27">     Learned Solicitor	General of India appearing on behalf
of the	National Textile  Corporation  in  all	these  cases
submitted that the facts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">983</span>
stated by way of background and the sequence of events up to
the date  of enactment	of the	Act were not relevant to the
decision as  to the  scope, ambit  and effect of the vesting
provisions contained  in <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_136">sections  3</a> and  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_137">4</a> of	the Act. The
sequence of  events narrated by the petitioners prior to the
enactment of  the Act  all related to the order of take-over
of the	undertakings of Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company issued
on 13th April, 1978 by the Central Government in exercise of
its powers under section 18AA of the IDR Act. The object and
purpose of  the said order of take-over of management of the
textile	 undertakings  was  completely	different  from	 the
object and  purpose of	the Act which related to acquisition
and transfer of the undertakings. We agree. The scope of the
vesting provisions  contained in  <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_138">section 3</a> of the Act would
have to be determined per force of its own language employed
by Parliament  and not	with reference	to  what  transpired
either before  or  after  the  order  of  take-over  of	 the
management dated  13th April, 1978 passed under section 18AA
of the IDR Act. <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_139">Section 3</a> of the Act, according to Solicitor
General, contained  the vesting	 provisions as	was  evident
from its  own language	and  also  from	 the  marginal	note
appended thereto.
</p><p id="p_28">     For determining the question involved in these matters,
it is  necessary to  bear in mind the relevant provisions of
law. The  preamble  to	the  Act  in  question	provided  as
indicated before  that this  was an  Act for the acquisition
and transfer of certain textile undertakings of the Swadeshi
Cotton Mills  Company Limited  with a  view to	securing the
proper management of such undertakings so as to subserve the
interests of  the general  public by  ensuring the continued
manufacture,  production   and	distribution   of  different
varieties of cloth and yarn. The preamble further reiterated
that it	 was to	 give effect  to the  policy  of  the  State
towards securing the principles specified in clauses (b) and
</p><p id="p_29">(c) of	<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_140">Article 39</a>  of the  Constitution. It reiterated that
large sums  of money had been invested with a view to making
the said  textile undertakings viable. It further reiterated
that large  sums of  money were necessary for the purpose of
securing  the	optimum	  utilisation	of   the   available
facilities.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">986</span>
Private Limited in Transferred Case No. 13 of 1987 submitted
that  the  present  case  is  directly	covered	 by  several
decisions of  this  Court.  He	referred  to  the  following
decisions National  Textile Corporation	 v. Sita  Ram Mills,
[1986] Suppl.  S.C.C. 117;  <a href="/doc/1939993/" id="a_156">Minerva Mills v. Union of India</a>,

Knitting Co. Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, [1986] 4 S.C.C. 276.
</p><p id="p_35">     It was  emphasised that  <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_159">section 3</a>	 of the Act provided
that in	 addition to  the textile  undertaking	"the  right,
title and  interest of the company in relation to every such
textile undertaking  is to vest". Therefore, it was urged by
Shri Venugopal	that so	 applying the  five decisions  cited
earlier, if  the shares	 were held for the benefit of and/or
utilised for the textile undertakings they would vest in the
Government under  the provisions  of <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_160">section  3</a> of  the	 Act
itself. He emphasised like others that "pertaining to" would
mean "in relation to" in the species of properties mentioned
in <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_161">section 4(1)</a> of the Act. He further submitted that if the
amount	of  compensation  declared  to	be  payable  to	 the
erstwhile owners  of the  undertakings acquired,  was a test
for deciding  whether a	 particular piece  of property	also
stood acquired	or not, then it was submitted that it may be
open to	 the erstwhile	owners to  contend that even what is
expressly stated  to have  been vested	in  the	 Government,
would not vest in the absence of compensation paid. That was
untenable.
</p><p id="p_36">     In any  event as  against the clear words, according to
Shri Venugopal, of <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_162">section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_163">section 4</a> read with <a href="/doc/980787/" id="a_164">section
2(k)</a>, the  failure to provide for compensation for three out
of the six undertakings would not result in three out of six
undertakings  being  not  vested  in  the  Government.	Shri
Venugopal submitted that the antecedent computation of value
by the	executive is  wholly irrelevant	 for determining the
intention of Parliament. Reference was made to <a href="/doc/1330761/" id="a_165">Kumari Sunita

not  admissible	  as  aids   to	 construction  since  it  is
impossible to  contend that  the Objects  and Reasons in the

of <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_169">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_170">4</a> of the Act was totally misconceived. See

urged that  the material not availed by the Parliament could

submitted that	the documents  which were  prepared for	 the
submission to  the Cabinet  and which  related to  the inner
working	 of   the  Government  were  not  admissible  and/or
legitimate aids to the construction of statute and therefore
not relevant  in deciding  which assets of SCM vested in the
Central Government under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_174">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_175">4</a> of the Act. It was
further submitted that etymological and plain meaning of the
word  "relation"   is  relation	 by  birth  or	relation  by
sacrament like	marriage or relation in the form of business
connection or  dealings. It  was further  submitted that  an
asset or  investment which  is created	from the earnings of
the undertakings  is clearly  related to the undertakings by
its inception or birth. An asset or investment, according to
Shri Anil  B. Diwan,  which is	utilised to  preserve and/or
give vitality  to  an  undertaking  is	equally	 related  or
pertained to the same.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">988</span>

part of"  the textile  undertakings on	the date  of the Act
when <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_193">section 27</a> came into force (i.e. w.e.f. 30.5.1986). The

other than  those permissible  under  the  Act.	 <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_194">Section  27</a>
containing the	penalty provisions could, therefore, validly
and justifiably	 be given effect to after it came into force

expression "pertaining	to" appearing  in the  first limb of
<a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_195">section	 4(1)</a>,	 therefore,  cannot  be	 gathered  from	 the

<p id="p_44">     It was contended that production of these was necessary
to establish that the shares were never intended to be taken
over and  these were never considered as part of the textile
undertaking. It	 was urged  that the  shares were  not taken
into  account	in  computing  the  figure  of	compensation
amounting to Rs.24.32 crores referred to in <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_206">section 8</a> of the
Act. It	 was submitted	that these  documents are definitely
relevant as  they would	 throw light  on the  merits of	 the
case. They  would advance  the case  of the  petitioners and
destroy, according  to the  petitioners,  the  case  of	 the
respondent. It	was submitted  that <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_207">sections  7</a> and <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_208">8</a> of the
said Act,  were intrinsic  aids to  construe <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_209">section  4</a>. The
factual foundation  necessary  for  the	 argument  based  on
<a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_210">sections 7</a>  and <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_211">8</a> of the said Act, was that the shares etc.,
were excluded  in computing  the figures of 24.32 crores. It
was  submitted	 that  these   documents  were	required  to
establish this	factual foundation.  The petitioner  alleged
that  shares   had  been  excluded  in	the  computation  of
compensation and  the petitioner had been so informed by the
Hon'ble Minister.  In reply  the Central Government asserted
that  compensation   has  been	 computed  lumpsum  and	 not
itemwise. According  to the  petitioner, the  stand  of	 the
Government that	 the compensation  was computed lumpsum, was
not borne out by the documents. It was, therefore, necessary
to seek	 production of	those documents. It was submitted by
Shri Nariman  that the	submissions of the Solicitor General
in so far as these dealt with the balance-sheet made it even
more important	that the  Government should  be directed  to
produce	 these	documents.  The	 calculations  made  by	 the
petitioner had	merely been  denied by	NTC which had in its
possession the	books of  account as also all balance-sheets
prior to  the balance-sheet  as on  April  1,  1985.  It  is
wrongly suggested that the calculations are hypothetical. It
was urged  by the  petitioner that  the calculations made by
the petitioners	 were not  hypothetical. The  correctness or
otherwise of  the said figure, according to the petitioners,
would be demonstrated from the said documents.
</p><p id="p_45">     On behalf	of the	Union of India, the learned Attorney
General	 submitted   that  records   and   documents   whose
production was	sought for,  were not  relevant for deciding
the matters of controversy in the instant case.
</p><p id="p_46">     In our  opinion <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_212">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_213">4</a> of the Act interpreted
either on their own language or along with <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_214">sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_215">8</a>,
are not	 ambiguous; so	documents are  not relevant.  It was
further urged,	that even if to consture the language is not
clear and  there is  need to resort to aids of construction,
it is  clear that  such	 aids  can  be	either	internal  or
external.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">991</span>
<p id="p_47">Internal aids  of construction	are definitions, exceptions,
explanations,  fictions,   deeming   provisions,   headings,
marginal notes,	 preamble,  provisos,  punctuations,  saving
clauses, non-obstante  clauses etc. The notings in the files
of various officials do not fall in the category of internal
aids for  consideration. Dictionaries, earlier acts, history
of   legislation,   Parliamentary   history,   parliamentary
proceedings, state  of law  as it  existed when	 the Act was
passed, the  mischief sought to be suppressed and the remedy
sought	to  be	advanced  by  the  Act	are  external  aids.
Documents which have been required to be produced do not, in
our view  fall within  the  category  of  external  aids  as
indicated. Having  considered the facts and circumstances of
the case,  we  are  unable  to	accept	the  prayer  of	 the
petitioner  to	direct	disclosure  and	 production  of	 the
documents sought  for. In  our opinion, the language used in
<a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_216">section 4</a> of the Act, is clear enough read with <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_217">section 3</a> of
the Act.  We have  set out  the provisions  of the  said two
sections. <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_218">Section  3</a> states that "on the appointed day every
textile undertaking and the right, title and interest of the
Company in relation to every textile undertaking shall stand
transferred to	and shall  vest in  the Central Government".
<a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_219">Section 4</a>  says that  "<a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_220">section 3</a>  shall be deemed to include
all assets,  leaseholds, powers, authorities, privileges and
all properties,	 movable and immovable ... pertaining to the
textile undertakings  and all  other rights and interests in
or arising out of such property".
</p><p id="p_48">     Francis  Bennion	in  "Statutory	Interpretation	1984
Edition page  526 para	238 states that Hansard reports, and
other reports of parliamentary proceedings on the Bill which
became the  Act in question, are of obvious relevance to its
meaning. They  are often  of doubtful  reliability  however.
(emphasis supplied)  The documents  in	question  which	 are
sought for do not relate to the enacting history or any past
enactment or  the present  enactment. The  notings  made  in
various	 Departments  at  various  levels  by  the  officers
namely,	 the   Under  Secretary,   Deputy  Secretary,  Joint
Secretary; Secretary  etc., whatever their view might be, is
not the	 view of the Cabinet. The ultimate decision is taken
by the	Cabinet. So the notings cannot and are not guides as
to what	 decision the Cabinet took. See for example the Task
Force report  referred to  in <a href="/doc/1531491/" id="a_221">National	Textile	 Corporation
Ltd. v. Sitaram Mills Ltd. &amp; others</a> (supra). This Task Force
Report	demonstrated   the  irrelevancy	  of  the  documents
summoned to  be produced.  The Task  Force Report manifested
that certain  mills were  viable. But  from the circumstance
under which  managements of  these mills were taken over, it
was clear  that the  Cabinet had taken the decision contrary
to what	 was contained	in the	Task Force  Report.  But  it
appears
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">992</span>
that the  decision of  the Cabinet  was different  from	 the
views of  the Officers	at various  levels. As	Bennion	 has
stated at  para 261  (page 560	of the	same book)  that  in
interpreting an enactment a two stage approach is necessary.
Here there is no real doubt on an informed basis as we shall
indicate hereafter  about the real meaning of the enactment.
There is  therefore no	question of resolving the doubt. The
second stage does not arise here.
</p><p id="p_49">     This Court	 in <a href="/doc/1195357/" id="a_222">Sanjeev  Coke Manufacturing	 Company  v.
Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. and another</a> (supra) held that no one
may speak  for the Parliament and Parliament is never before
the Court.  After the Parliament has said what it intends to
say, only  the Court  may say  what the	 Parliament meant to
say. None  else. See  also in  this  connection	 <a href="/doc/1333274/" id="a_223">Dr.  (Mrs.)
Sushma Sharma  and others  v. State  of Rajasthan and others</a>
(supra).  The	objects	 and  purposes	of  the	 person	 who
initiated  the	 Bill  are   not  admissible   as  aids	  to
construction since  it is  impossible to  contend that	such
purposes in  the minds	of some	 officials of the Government
before the  matter is discussed by the Cabinet, would at all
be relevant.  See in this connection <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_224">State of West Bengal v.
Union of  India</a> (supra) where this Court reiterated that the
Statement  of	Objects	 and   Reasons,	 accompanying	when
introduced in the Parliament cannot be used to determine the
true meaning and effect of the substantive provisions of the
statute. Such  statement cannot	 be used  to show  that	 the
legislature did	 not intend  to	 take  over  any  particular
property. See  also <a href="/doc/384084/" id="a_225">The	 Central  Bank	of  India  v.  Their
Workmen</a> (supra).
</p><p id="p_50">     It has  to be  reiterated, however that the objects and
reasons of  the Act  should be	taken into  consideration in
interpreting the provisions of the statute in case of doubt.
This is	 the effect  of the  decision of  this Court in <a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_226">K.P.
Verghese v.  The Income</a>	 tax Officer, Ernakulam and another,
[1982] 1  S.C.R. 629,  where this  Court reiterated that the
speech made  by the  Mover of the Bill explaining the reason
for the introduction of the Bill could certainly be referred
to for the purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be
remedied by  the legislation  and the object and purpose for
which the  legislation was  enacted. It	 has been reiterated
that interpretation  of a  statute being  an exercise in the
ascertainment of  meaning,  everything	which  is  logically
relevant should	 be admissible.	 See in	 this connection the
observations of	 this Court in Chern Taong Shang &amp; anr. etc.
etc. v.	 Commander S.D. Baijal &amp; Ors., J.T. 1988 1 S.C. 202.
The documents  now sought  for by the petitioner do not fall
within this category. It is neither the object and scheme of
the enactment nor the language used therein, that is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">993</span>
sought for  in the instant case. It is certainly relevant to
know the  mischief that	 was intended to be remedied. But in
the documents in question which the petitioner is seeking no
such correlation has been established. These are, therefore,
not relevant. We reiterate that no officer of the Department
can speak  for the  Parliament even  after the	Act has been
passed. This  Court has to interpret the Act on the basis of
informed basis by applying external and internal aids if the
language is  ambiguous. In the words of Lord Scarman "We are
to  be	governed  not  by  Parliament's	 intentions  but  by
Parliament's	enactments".	 See	Cross	  "Statutory
Interpretation" 2nd  Edition  page  22.	 Blackstone  in	 his
"Commentaries on the Laws of England" (Facsimile of 1st edn.
1765, University  of  Chicago  Press  1979)  Vol.  1  at  59
suggests "The  fairest and most rational method to interpret
the will  of the legislator is by exploring his intention at
the time  when the  law was  made, by signs most natural and
probable. And  these signs  are the  words, the context, the
subject matter,	 the effect  and consequence,  or the spirit
and reason  of the  law." The  documents whose production is
sought for  are none  of these.	 So in our opinion these are
not relevant.  We must further reiterate that the Members of
Parliament had before them only the Bill. The notings of the
various	 officials   in	 the   files  were  not	 before	 the
Parliament. Therefore  members could  not be attributed with
the knowledge  of the  notings in  the files. Therefore, the
notings made  by the  officials are  not relevant.  In	this
connection reliance  may be  placed  on	 the  principles  of
interpretation	as   enunciated	 by  the  Federal  Court  in
Auckland Jute  Co. Ltd.	 v. Tulsi  Chandra  Goswami,  [1949]
F.C.R. 201  at 244.  It is trite saying that the interpreter
of the	statute must  take note of the well known historical
facts. In  conventional language  the interpreter  must	 put
himself in  the arm  chair of those who were passing the Act
i.e. the  Members of  the Parliament.  It is  the collective
will of	 the Parliament	 with which we are concerned. See in
this connection	 the observations  of the  Federal Court  in
<a href="/doc/814692/" id="a_227">RM.AR.AR.R.M.AR. Umayhal  Achi v.  Lakshmi Achi	 and others</a>,
[1945] F.C.R.  1. We  are therefore, of the opinion that the
documents sought  for are  not relevant	 for the purpose for
which they  were sought	 for. In  this case we are concerned
only with  the construction  of	 the  statute  to  determine
whether the  shares vested in the Government or not. As Lord
Reid  has   said  in  Black-Clawson  International  Ltd.  v.
Papierwerke Waldhof Achaffenburg A G, [1975] A.C. 591 at 613
"We often  say that  we are  looking for  the  intention  of
Parliament, but	 that is  not quite accurate. We are seeking
the meaning  of the  words which  Parliament  used.  We	 are
seeking not  what Parliament  meant but	 the true meaning of
what they  said." See  in this	connection the discussion in
Cross Statutory Interpretation-2nd Edition, pages 20-30.

<p id="p_51">     The next question for consideration is that by assuming
that these  documents are  relevant, whether  the  Union  of
India is  liable to  disclose these  documents. Privilege in
respect of these documents has been sought for under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_228">Article
74(2)</a> of  the Constitution  on behalf  of the  Government by
learned Attorney General.
</p><p id="p_52">     Shri Nariman however, submitted on the authority of the
decision of  this Court	 in <a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_229">S.P. Gupta v. Union of India and
others</a>, [1982]	2 S.C.R.  365 at page 594 that the documents
sought for  herein were	 not privileged. The context and the
nature of  the documents  sought for  in S.P.  Gupta's	case
(supra)	 were	entirely  different.   In  this	 case  these
documents as  we see  are part	of the	preparation  of	 the
documents leading to the formation of the advice tendered to
the President  of India	 and as	 such these  are  privileged
under <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_230">Article  74(2)</a> of the Constitution which provides that
the question  whether  any,  and  if  so  what,	 advice	 was
tendered by Ministers to the President shall not be enquired
into in	 any court.  This Court is precluded from asking for
production of  these documents. In S.P. Gupta's case (supra)
the question  was not  actually what  advice was tendered to
the President on the appointment of Judges. The question was
whether there  was  the	 factum	 of  effective	consultation
between the  relevant  constitutional  authorities.  In	 our
opinion that  is not the problem here. We are conscious that
there  is   no	sacrosanct  rule  about	 the  immunity	from
production of  documents and  the privilege  should  not  be
allowed in  respect of each and every document. We reiterate
that the  claim of immunity and privilege has to be based on
public interest.  Learned Attorney  General  relied  on	 the
decision of  this Court	 in the case of <a href="/doc/438670/" id="a_231">State of U.P. v. Raj
Narain</a>, [1975]	3 S.C.R.  333. The principle or ratio of the
same is	 applicable here. We may however, reiterate that the
real damage  with which	 we are concerned would be caused by
the publication	 of the	 actual documents of the Cabinet for
consideration and  the minutes	recorded in  its discussions
and its	 conclusions. It  is well settled that the privilege
cannot be  waived.  In	this  connection,  learned  Attorney
General drew  our attention to an unreported decision in The
Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving Mills Company Ltd. v. Union
of India  and others,  Writ Petition  No. 2401 of 1983. This
resulted ultimately  in Sitaram	 Mills's case  (supra).	 The
Bombay High  Court held	 that  the  Task  Force	 Report	 was
withheld deliberately  as it  would support the petitioner's
case. It is well to remember that in Sitaram Mills's (supra)
this Court  reversed the  judgment of  the Bombay High Court
and upheld the take over. Learned Attorney General submitted
that the  documents there  were not tendered voluntarily. It
is well to remember that it is duty of this Court to prevent
disclosure where <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_232">Article 74(2)</a> is applicable. We are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">995</span>
convinced that	the notings  of the  officials which lead to
the Cabinet note leading to the Cabinet decision formed part
of the	advice tendered	 to the	 President as  the  Act	 was
preceded by an ordinance promulgated by the President.
</p><p id="p_53">     We respectfully  follow the  observations in S.P. Gupta
and others  v. Union  of India	and others  (supra) at pages
607, 608 and 609. We may refer to the following observations
at page 608 of the report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "It  is   settled  law   and	it  was	 so  clearly
	  recognised in Raj Narain's case (supra) that there
	  may be  classes of documents which public interest
	  requires should  not be  disclosed, no matter what
	  the individual  documents  in	 those	classes	 may
	  contain or in other words, the law recognises that
	  there may  be classes	 of documents  which in	 the
	  public interest  should be immune from disclosure.
	  There is  one such  class of	documents which	 for
	  years has  been recognised  by the law as entitled
	  in the  public interest  to be  protected  against
	  disclosure and  that class  consists of  documents
	  which	 it  is	 really	 necessary  for	 the  proper
	  functioning of the public service to withhold from
	  disclosure.  The  documents  falling	within	this
	  class are  granted immunity  from  disclosure	 not
	  because of their contents but because of the class
	  to which  they belong. This class includes cabinet
	  minutes, minutes  of discussions  between heads of
	  departments,	 high	 level	  inter-departmental
	  communications  and  despatches  from	 ambassadors
	  abroad (vide Conway v. Rimmer, [1969] Appeal Cases
	  910 at  pp. 952,  973, 979, 987 and 993 and Reg v.

<p id="p_54">     Cabinet   papers	are,   therefore,   protected	from

</p><p id="p_58">     In	 view	of  the	  language  used   in  the  relevant
provisions, it	appears to  us that <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_234">section 3</a> has two limbs:
</p><p id="p_59">(i) textile undertakings; and (ii) right, title and interest
of  the	  company  in	relation  to   every  such   textile
undertaking. The  expression "textile  undertaking" has been
defined in <a href="/doc/980787/" id="a_235">section 2(k)</a> to mean the six textile undertakings
of the company specified therein. The definition of the said
expression in  <a href="/doc/980787/" id="a_236">section 2(k)</a>  is,  however,  subject  to	 the
opening words  of the  section which  provide, "In this Act,
unless the  context otherwise  requires". In  the context of
the expression	"textile undertakings"	employed in  <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_237">section
3(1)</a> of	 the Act,  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_238">section 4(1)</a>	 provides that	the  textile
undertakings referred  to in  <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_239">section 3</a>	 shall be  deemed to
include all  assets, rights, leaseholds, powers, authorities
and privileges	and all	 property,  movable  and  immovable,
including   lands,   buildings,	  workshops,   stores	....
investments  and   book	 debts	pertaining  to	the  textile
undertakings and  all rights and interests in or arising out
of such	 property as  are, immediately	before the appointed
day, in	 the ownership,	 possession, power or control of the
company in relation to all six undertakings. The expressions
"pertaining to", "in relation to" and "arising out of", used
in the	deeming provision,  are used in the expansive sense,
as per	decisions of  courts,  meanings	 found	in  standard
'dictionaries, and  the	 principles  of	 broad	and  liberal
interpretation in  consonance with  <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_240">Article 39(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_241">(c)</a> of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_60">     The words	"arising out of" have been used in the sense
that it	 comprises purchase  of shares and lands from income
arising out of the Kanpur undertaking. We are of the opinion
that the words "pertaining to" and "in relation to" have the
same wide  meaning and	have been  used interchangeably	 for
among other reasons, which may include
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">997</span>
avoidance of  repetition of  the same  phrase  in  the	same
clause or  sentence, a method followed in good drafting. The
word "pertain"	is synonymous  with the	 word "relate",	 see
Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume 17, page 693.
</p><p id="p_61">     The expression  "in relation  to" (so  also "pertaining
to"), is  very broad  expression which	pre-supposes another
subject matter.	 These are  words of comprehensiveness which
might have both a direct significance as well as an indirect
significance depending	on the context, see <a href="/doc/26264/" id="a_242">State Wakf Board
v. Abdul  Aziz</a>, A.I.R.	1968 Madras  79, 81 paragraphs 8 and

Assuming that  the investments in shares and in lands do not
form part  of the  undertakings but  are  different  subject
matters, even then these would be brought within the purview
of the	vesting by  reason of the above expressions. In this
connection reference may be made to 76 Corpus Juris Secundum
at pages  620 and  621 where  it is  stated  that  the	term
"relate"  is   also  defined   as  meaning   to	 bring	into
association  or	  connection  with.   It  has  been  clearly
mentioned that	"relating to" has been held to be equivalent
to  or	 synonymous  with   as	to   "concerning  with"	 and
"pertaining  to".  The	expression  "pertaining	 to"  is  an
expression of expansion and not of contraction.
</p><p id="p_62">     As to  what an undertaking means, has been clarified in
R.C. Cooper  v. Union of India, [1970] 3 S.C.R. 530 at pages
567, 568,  635, where the Act of 1969 was challenged. It was
held that  the meaning	of the expression "undertaking" is a
going concern  as distinct  from its assets and liabilities.
It was	also  observed	that  it  covered  every  corner  of
property, right,  title and  interest  therein.	 This  Court
rejected one  of the  grounds of  challenge as	there was no
evidence that  the named  banks	 held  any  assets  for	 any
distinct non-banking  business, which  finding gives an idea
as to  what could have been excluded from the acquisition of
the undertaking.
</p><p id="p_63">     Reading the  provisions of	 <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_244">section 3(1)</a>,	<a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_245">section 4(1)</a>
and <a href="/doc/980787/" id="a_246">section  2(k)</a> of  the Act,	each throwing  light on	 the

petitioners, being provisions for payment of amounts and for
the issue  of shares  by  NTC  respectively,  will  have  no
bearing on  the scope  of the  vesting provision. As to what
properties have vested cannot proceed on the hypothesis that
there is  a clear numerical or mathematical link between the
quantum of  compensation and  the items	 of property vested.
This correlation  with regard  to such	legislation  is	 not
available. In  this connection	reference may be made to the
decision of  this Court	 in Khajamian  Wakf Estates  etc. v.
State of  Madras &amp;  another, [1971] 2 S.C.R. 790 at page 796
B-E.
</p><p id="p_65">     <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_253">Section 8</a> refers to payments of amounts by the Union of

Rs.24 crores  32 lakhs mentioned therein was introduced into
<a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_255">section 7</a>.  The provisions  of this section are no different
from the  provisions of	 the similar sections in the earlier

Textile Undertakings  Nationalisation Act,  1974 (page 59 of
Vol. X),  the amount  mentioned is  specified in  the  first
schedule as  there are	a number of companies involved. This
provision cannot  be the starting point for investigation as
to which  amount relates  to which property or as a guide to
construction.
</p><p id="p_66">     It appears	 to us	from the  Delhi High  Court decision
(supra) and the decision of this Court in Balkrishan Gupta's
case (supra)  as well  as the  statement of  the Minister in
December,  1985	 that  there  were  legal  difficulties,  in
respect of  taking over, under the 1951 IDR Act. The IDR Act
was-(a)	 concerned   with  the	 management   of   scheduled
industries in, inter alia, running of factories, where there
was no	deeming provision  in such  wide terms;	 (b) it	 was
concerned with setting up of machinery for imposing controls
on  industrial	 undertakings,	see   Harakchand  Ratanchand
Banthia and others etc. v. Union of India and others, [1970]
1 S.C.R. 479 at page 496 F and G.
</p><p id="p_67">     We are  further of	 the opinion  that the	decision  in
Harakchand Ratanchand  (supra) would  not be  applicable. In
this case,  the Court  is concerned  with a  nationalisation
statute. Even with other independent management statutes, in
respect of  textile undertakings  a series of decisions have
upheld the  view that the shares vest in the Government. <a href="/doc/1531491/" id="a_257">See

</p><p id="p_69">     The expression  "and all  other rights and interests in

undertakings", appearing  in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_263">section 4</a> of
the Act	 indicates that the shares which have been purchased
from out  of the funds of the textile undertakings and which
have  been   held  for	the  benefit  of  the  said  textile
undertakings, would  come within  the scope  of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_264">section 4</a> of
the Act	 and thus  would also vest in the Central Government
under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_265">section  3</a>. The  origin  of  these  shares  and  their
connection with	 the textile  undertakings have	 been  fully
corroborated. The  textile business  is the only business of
Swadeshi Cotton	 Mills. There is inter-connection and inter-
relation between  all the  six undertakings.  Investments in
Swadeshi  Polytex   Limited  from   the	 funds	 of   Kanpur
undertaking have  always been  made. Investments in Swadeshi
Mining and  Manufacturing Company Ltd. were always made from
the funds of the kanpur undertaking. Assets/investments held

were carried on in its textile undertakings.

that literal construction should not be given effect to. See

</p><p id="p_71">     It	 has   to  be	reiterated  that   the	 object	  of
interpretation of  a statute is to discover the intention of
the Parliament as expressed in the Act. The dominant purpose
in construing a statute is to ascertain the intention of the
legislature as expressed in the statute, considering it as a
whole and  in its context. That intention, and therefore the
meaning
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">1000</span>
of the	statute, is primarily to be sought in the words used
in the	statute itself,	 which must,  if they  are plain and
unambiguous, be	 applied as they stand. In the present case,
the  words   used  represent   the  real  intention  of	 the
Parliament as  we have	found not  only from the clear words
used but  also from  the very  purpose of the vesting of the
shares. If  we bear  in mind the fact that these shares were
acquired from  out of  the investments	made  by  these	 two
companies and  furthermore that the assets of the company as
such minus  the shares	were negative and further the Act in
question  was  passed  to  give	 effect	 to  the  principles
enunciated in  clauses (b)  and (c)  of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_268">Article	 39</a>  of	 the
Constitution, we  are left  with no  doubt that	 the  shares
vested in  the Central Government by operation of <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_269">sections 3</a>
and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_270">4</a>  the Act.	 See in	 this connection the observations of
Halsbury's  Laws   of  England,	  4th  Edition,	 Volume	 44,
paragraph 856 at page 522 and the cases noted therein.
</p><p id="p_72">     There is  no exact	 correlation between  the figure  of
capital reserve	 and the figure of investments. That, in our
opinion cannot	be. These  can never  be exactly  equal. The
submission of  the petitioner fails to take into account the
fact  that   the  undertakings	 other	 than	the   kanpur
undertaking, also have capital reserve, even though there is
no allegation  that these were excluded assets in respect of
other undertakings  and there were no figures of investments
therein. The  covering letter  for these documents, page 408
of Volume  II, itself  stated that  the provisional balance-
sheet shows  investments which included these shares as part
of assets.  With regard	 to the figure of Rs. 11 lakhs taken
in the calculation filed by the petitioner, we find that the
calculations filed by the petitioner were not supportable.
</p><p id="p_73">     Contemporanea Expositio, is a well-settled principle or
doctrine which applies only to the construction of ambiguous
language in  old statutes.  Reliance may  be placed  in this
connection  on	 Maxwell  13th	Ed.  page  269.	 It  is	 not
applicable to modern statutes. Reference may be made to G.P.
Singh, Principles  of  Statutory  Interpretation,  3rd	Edn.
pages 238 and 239. As noted in Maxwell on The Interpretation
of Statutes,  12th Edition  at page  269  that	the  leading
modern case  on	 contemporanea	expositio  is  the  case  of
Campbell College,  Belfast v.  Commissioner of Valuation for
Northern Ireland,  [1964] 1  W.L.R. 912	 in which  House  of
Lords has  made it  clear that the doctrine is to be applied
only to	 the construction  of ambiguous language in the very
old statutes.  It is  therefore well  to remember  what Lord
Watson said  in Clyde Navigation Trustees v. Laird, [1983] 8
A.C.  658   that  contemporanea	  expositio  could  have  no
application to	a modern  Act.	We,  therefore,	 reject	 the
attempt on the part of the petitioners to lead us to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">1001</span>
this forbidden	track by  referring  to	 various  extraneous
matters which  we have	indicated before.  Furthermore those
external  aids	 sought	 before	  us  do   not	support	 the
petitioners' approach to this question at all.
</p><p id="p_74">     It appears	 that the shares held in SPL themselves were
the subject  matter of	both pledge and attachment to secure
loans from the U.P. State Government of about Rs.66 lacs for
payment of  wages to  workers of  the Kanpur undertaking and
Rs.95 lacs  being electricity dues of the Kanpur undertaking
owing to  the U.P.  State Electricity Board. From all these,
the acceptance of the petitioner's case, would mean that the
State would  pump in Rs.15 crores of public money to release
the shares from its liabilities and thereafter hand over the
shares free from such liability back to the company when the
net worth  of the  company at  the  time  of  take  over  of
management was	negative and  in the  teeth of	the  present
financial liabilities  built up	 by the	 company the  shares
would inevitably  have sold  in discharge of its liabilities
and in	any event  the shares  stood charged  with the	very
liabilities which related to the undertakings of the company
which were taken over by the Government.
</p><p id="p_75">     It appears	 to us	that <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_271">sections  3</a> and  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_272">4</a> of  the	 Act
evolve a  legislative policy  and  set	out  the  parameters
within which  it has  to be implemented. We cannot find that
there was  any special	intention to  exclude the  shares in
this case  as seen from the existence of at least four other
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_273">Acquisition  Act</a>s   which  used	  identical  phraseology  in
<a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_274">sections 3</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_275">4</a>  and	 in  the  other	 sections  as  well.
Reference was  made to	the Aluminium  Corporation of  India
Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of Aluminium Undertakings)
Act, 1984,  the Amritsar Oil Works (Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_276">Transfer
of  Undertakings)   Act</a>,  1982,	 the  Britannia	 Engineering

Limited (Acquisition  and  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_278">Transfer  of	 Undertakings)	Act</a>,
1984.
</p><p id="p_76">     In the present case we are satisfied that the shares in
question were  held and	 utilised for  the  benefit  of	 the
undertakings for the reasons that (a) the shares in Swadeshi
Polytex Limited	 were acquired from the income of the kanpur
Unit. Reference may be made to page 23 of Compilation D-III,
</p><p id="p_77">(b) the	 shares held  in Swadeshi  Mining and  Manufacturing
Company were  acquired in  1955. Originally  there were four
companies and  their acquisition has been explained fully in
the Compilation D-III with index, (c) the shares held in SPL
were pledged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">1002</span>
or attached  for running the Kanpur undertaking, for payment
of ESI and Provident Fund dues for the workers of the Kanpur
undertaking, for  wages and  for payment of electricity dues
of the	Kanpur undertaking, (d) the shares held in SMMC were
pledged for  raising monies  and loans of Rs. 150 lakhs from
the Punjab National Bank for running the Kanpur undertaking.
These loans  fall in  category II  of Part I of the Schedule
which liabilities  have been  taken over  by the Government,
</p><p id="p_78">(e) the shares held in SPL were offered for sale by SCM from
time to	 time and  to utilise  the sale	 proceeds thereof by
ploughing them	back into  the textile business for reviving
the textile undertakings acquired under the Act.
</p><p id="p_79">     It appears	 to us that the expression "forming part of"
appearing in  <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_279">section 27</a> cannot be so read with <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_280">section 4(1)</a>
as would  have the effect of restricting or cutting down the
scope and  ambit of  the vesting provisions in <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_281">section 3(1)</a>.
The expression	"pertaining to"	 does not mean "forming part
of". Even  assuming  that  the	expression  "pertaining	 to"
appearing in  the first	 limb of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_282">section 4(1)</a> means "forming
part of",  it would  mean that only such assets which have a
direct nexus  with the textile mills as would fall under the
first limb  of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_283">section	4(1)</a>. The  shares in  question would
still vest  in the  Central Government under the second limb
of <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_284">section  4(1)</a> of the Act since the shares were bought out
of the	income of  the textile	mills and  were held  by the
company in  relation to	 such mills.  The shares  would also
fall in	 the second  limb of  <a href="/doc/1784730/" id="a_285">section 3(1)</a>  being right	 and
title of the company in relation to the textile mills.
</p><p id="p_80">     On the construction of <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_286">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_287">4</a> we have come to
the  conclusion	  that	the   shares  vest  in	the  Central
Government even	 if we	read <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_288">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_289">4</a> in conjunction
with <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_290">sections  7</a> and  <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_291">8</a> of  the	 Act  on  the  well  settled
principles which  we have  reiterated before. The expression
'in relation  to' has  been interpreted	 to be	the words of
widest amplitude.  <a href="/doc/1531491/" id="a_292">See National Textile Corporation Ltd. and
others v.  Sitaram Mills  Ltd</a>. (supra). <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_293">Section 4</a> appears to
us to  be an  expanding section.  It  introduces  a  deeming
provision. Deeming  provision is  intended  to	enlarge	 the
meaning of  a particular  word or  to include  matters which
otherwise may or may not fall within the main provisions. It
is well	 settled that  the word	 'includes' is	an inclusive
definition and	expands the  meaning. <a href="/doc/1733637/" id="a_294">See The Corporation of
the City of Nagpur v. Its Employees</a>, [1960] 2 S.C.R. 942 and
<a href="/doc/1296130/" id="a_295">Vasudev Ramchandra  Shelat  v.	Pranlal	 Javanand  Thakarand
others</a>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 534. The words 'all other rights and
interests' are	words of  widest amplitude.  <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_296">Section 4</a>	also
uses the  words "ownership,  possession, power or control of
the Company
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">1003</span>
in relation to the said undertakings". The words 'pertaining
to' are not restrictive as mentioned hereinbefore.
</p><p id="p_81">     <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_297">Section 8</a>	provides  for  payment	of  compensation  in
lumpsum	 and   the  transfer  and  vesting  of	whatever  is
comprised in  <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_298">section 3</a>.  As <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_299">section  4</a> expands the scope of
<a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_300">section 3</a>,  the compensation  mentioned in  <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_301">section 8</a> is for
the property mentioned in <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_302">section 3</a> read with <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_303">section 4</a>. The
compensation provided  in <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_304">section  8</a> is	 not calculated as a
total of  the value of various individual assets in the Act.
It is  a lumpsum  compensation. See  in this  connection the
principles  enunciated	by  this  Court	 in  Khajamian	Wakf
Estates etc.  v. State of Madras and another (supra). There,
it was held that even if it was assumed that no compensation
was provided  for particular  item, the	 acquisition of	 the
'inam' is  valid. In the instant case <a href="/doc/1323102/" id="a_305">section 8</a> provides for
compensation to	 be paid  to the undertakings as a whole and
not separately	for each  of the  interests of	the company.
Therefore, it  cannot  be  said	 that  no  compensation	 was
provided for the acquisition of the undertaking as a whole.
</p><p id="p_82">     <a href="/doc/920978/" id="a_306">Section 7</a>	of the Act, in our opinion, neither controls
<a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_307">sections 3</a>  and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_308">4</a>  of the  Act nor creates any ambiguity. It
was highlighted	 before us  and in  our opinion rightly that
this sum  of Rs.24.32  crores paid  by way  of	compensation
comes out of the public exchequer. The paid-up shares in its
equity capital can necessarily have a face value only of the
amounts so  paid, irrespective	of whatever may be contended
to be  the value  of the  assets and irrespective of whether
any asset  or property	in relation to the undertakings, was
taken into  account. After  providing  for  compensation  of
Rs.24.32 crores	 to be paid to the Commissioner for payments
to discharge part I liabilities, Government has to undertake
an additional  15 crores  at  least  for  discharging  those
liabilities. To	 leave a company, the net wealth of which is
negative at  the time  of take-over  of the management, with
the shares held by it as investment in other company, in our
opinion, is  not only  to defeat  the principles of Articles
39(b) and  (c) of  the Constitution  but it  will permit the
company to  reap the fruits of its mismanagement. That would
be an  absurd situation. It has to be borne in mind that the
net wealth  of the  company at	the time  of take-over,	 was
negative, hence <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_309">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_310">4</a> can be meaningfully read if
all the	 assets including  the shares  are considered  to be
taken over by the acquisition. That is the only irresistible
conclusion  that   follows  from  the  construction  of	 the
documents and  the history  of this  Act. We have to bear in
mind the Preamble of the Act which expressly recites that it
was to	ensure the  principles enunciated in clauses (b) and
</p><p id="p_83">(c) of	<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_311">Article 39</a>  of the  Constitution. <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_312">The Act</a> must be so
read that it further ensures such meaning and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">1004</span>
secures the  ownership and control of the material resources
to the community to subserve the common good to see that the
operation of economic system does not result in injustice.
</p><p id="p_84">     We therefore,  reiterate that  the shares vested in the
Central Government.  Accordingly the  shares in question are
vested in  NTC and it has right over the said 34 per cent of
the shareholdings.
</p><p id="p_85">     In the  aforesaid view  of the  matter we hold that the
10,00,000 shares  in Swadeshi  Polytex Limited and 17,18,344
shares in  Swadeshi Mining and Manufacturing Company Limited
held by	 the Swadeshi  Cotton Mills  vested in	the  Central
Government under <a href="/doc/240172/" id="a_313">sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/930771/" id="a_314">4</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_86">     We are  further of	 the opinion  that in  view  of	 the
amplitude of  the language  used, the  immovable properties,
namely, the  Bungalow No.  1 and  the Administrative  Block,
Civil Lines, Kanpur have also vested in NTC.
