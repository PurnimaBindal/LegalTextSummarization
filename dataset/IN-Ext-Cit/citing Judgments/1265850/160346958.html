<p id="p_1">K.S. Radhakrishnan, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.    Leave granted.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.    The appellant herein preferred an  application  before  the  Assistant
Registrar of Trade Marks, Delhi for rectification of  entry  in  respect  of
Registered Trade Mark “KOHINOOR” in Class  30  registered  in  the  name  of
Respondent No.1 on the ground of non-usage for a period in  excess  of  five
years.  The application was  allowed  by  the  Registrar  vide  order  dated
18.6.1992 and the entry in respect of registered trademark 274006  in  Class
30 registered in the names of Respondent No.1 was modified by  amending  the
specification of goods to read as “Rice for sale in the cities of  Faizabad,
Maunath Bhanjan, Jaunpur, Shahganj and Agra in the State of Uttar  Pradesh”.
 Respondent No.1 therein then filed an application for review of  the  order
dated 18.6.1992 which was partly allowed  vide  order  dated  15.02.1993  by
Assistant Registrar, adding the town of Saharanpur in  the  State  of  Uttar
Pradesh, in  which  Respondent  No.1  was  allowed  to  use  his  trademark.
Consequently Respondent No.1 was allowed to use the trademark “KOHINOOR”  in
six cities in the State of Uttar Pradesh.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    Respondent No.1 then filed CMM No.303 of 2003 before Delhi High  Court
against the rectification and review order dated  18.06.1992  and  15.2.1993
respectively passed by the Assistant  Registrar  of  trademarks  restricting
the use of trademark only in few cities  of  the  State  of  Uttar  Pradesh.
Respondent No.1  also  filed  CMM  No.313  of  1996  against  the  grant  of
trademark registration of all kinds of rice for the purpose  of   export  in
favour of the appellant.  Respondent No.1 also preferred CMM No.327 of  1993
against the grant of trademark  registration  in  favour  of  the  appellant
throughout India.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    All the above-mentioned applications  were  clubbed  together  and  an
order was passed by the learned  Single  Judge  on  11.09.2003  whereby  CMM
No.303 of 1993 was allowed to the extent of  permitting  the  Respondent  to
use trademark for the entire state of Uttar Pradesh.   CMM  No.313  of  1996
was also partly allowed.  CMM No.327 of 1993 was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    The appellant then preferred OCJA No.5 of  2003  before  the  Division
Bench against the order of the learned Single Judge passed in CMM No.313  of
1996 and OCJA No.6 was preferred against the order  of  the  learned  Single
Judge passed in CMM No.303 of 1993.  The appellant,  alleging  violation  of
the order passed by the Division Bench on 10.11.2003, staying the  operation
of  the  order  passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge,  filed  a  Contempt
Application No.928 of 2006.  The Division Bench  of  the  Delhi  High  Court
passed a common order on 15.05.2007 upholding all the findings  recorded  by
the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    Appellant herein then preferred three  Special  Leave  Petitions.  SLP
(C) NO.15496 of 2007 was preferred against the order in OCJA No.6  of  2003,
SLP(C) No.18213 of 2007 was preferred against the  order  in  OCJA  No.5  of
2003 and SLP(C)  No.18212  of  2007  was  preferred  against  the  order  in
Contempt Application No.928 of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.    The appellant has  urged  in  the  appeal  that  the  High  Court  has
committed an error in permitting the second respondent to use the  trademark
“KOHINOOR” in the entire State of Uttar Pradesh, especially in the  wake  of
the registration of trade mark in favour  of  the  appellant  under  Section
12(3) read with Section 46(2) of the Trademark Act.  Further,  it  was  also
pointed  out  that  the  High  Court  was  not  justified  in  applying  the
geographical limitations thereby permitting the  second  respondent  to  use
the trademark “KOHINOOR” in the entire State of  Uttar  Pradesh,  while  the
Assistant Registrar of Trademark permitted to use the trademark only in  six
cities, which was later on extended to another  District,  entertaining  the
review petition filed by the respondents.   Further,  it  was  also  pointed
out that under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_1">Section 12(3)</a> of the Trade and  <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_2">Merchandise
Marks Act</a>, 1958, the honest  and  concurrent  use  is  permissible  and  the
Deputy Registrar of Trademark has  rightly  allowed  the  Appellant  to  use
concurrently the registered  trademark  No.274996  KOHINOOR  in  the  entire
State of Uttar Pradesh for sale except the six cities mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.    Learned counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that  the  High
Court was right in holding the second respondent is entitled to  benefit  of
Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_3">Section 12</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_4">Merchandise Act</a>  since  there
is ample evidence on record to show that the second respondent bonafide  and
honestly adopted the word “KOHINOOR” as its trademark.   The High Court  has
rightly held that the  invoices  produced  in  evidence  by  the  respondent
showing sale of rice to distributors and dealers in various  cities  in  the
State of Uttar Pradesh and they in turn were making deliveries to  retailers
in smaller towns, would clearly  indicate  user  of  the  trademark  by  the
respondent.  Learned  counsel  also  pointed  out  that   the   geographical
limitations incorporated by way of  an  amendment  are  based  on  practical
consideration of facts and trade practices.  The impugned order  was  passed
by the High Court noticing that the respondent has been using the  trademark
“KOHINOOR” since the year 1961 and had obtained the registration thereof  in
the year 1971 and that the appellant got registration only  subsequently  on
24.2.1981.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.    We notice, the appellant herein applied for registration of  trademark
“KOHINOOR”  only  in  July,  1985.  The  application  was  allowed  and  the
trademark  was  advertised  in  Trademark  Journal  in  1985.   Yet  another
application was  filed  by  the  appellant  for  registration  of  trademark
“KOHINOOR” in respect of rice for export included in class 30 on  3rd  July,
1985.  The said trademark was published in the  Trademark  Journal  on  11th
October,  1989.   The  appellant   filed   rectification   application   for
deregistration of trademark  “KOHINOOR”  in  favour  of  the  respondent  in
respect of rice in class 30 on the plea that  the  respondent  had  got  the
trademark “KOHINOOR” registered without bonafide intention  to  use  it  and
there was no bonafide use of the trademark by the respondent  for  a  period
of 5 years and 1 month preceding the date of filing of the  application  for
rectification.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.   We are, in this case, primarily concerned with the  interpretation  of
provisions of <a href="/doc/602173/" id="a_5">Section 46(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1472348/" id="a_6">46(2)</a>  of  the  Act,  which  are  reproduced
hereinbelow :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      46(1). Subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_7">section  47</a>,  a  registered  trade
      mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the  goods  in
      respect  of  which  it  is  registered  on  application  made  in  the
      prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar  by  any  person
      aggrieved on the ground either—


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (a)  that the trade mark was registered without any bonafide intention
           on the part of the applicant for registration that it should  be
           used in relation to those goods by him or, in a  case  to  which
           the provisions of <a href="/doc/1047150/" id="a_8">section 45</a> apply, by  the  company  concerned,
           and that there has, in fact, been no bona fide use of the  trade
           mark in relation to those goods by any  proprietor  thereof  for
           the time being up to a date one month before  the  date  of  the
           application; or


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (b)   that up to a date one month before the date of the  application,
           a continuous period of five years or longer had  elapsed  during
           which the trade mark was registered and during which  there  was
           no bona fide use thereof in  relation  to  those  goods  by  any
           proprietor thereof for the time being:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      Provided that, except where the applicant has been permitted under sub-
       section (3)  of  <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_9">section  12</a>  to  register  an  identical  or  nearly
      resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the
      tribunal is of opinion that he  might  properly  be  permitted  so  to
      register such a trade mark, the tribunal  may  refuse  an  application
      under clause (a) or clause (b) in relation to  any  goods,  if  it  is
      shown that there has been, before the  relevant  date  or  during  the
      relevant period, as the case may be, bona fide use of the  trade  mark
      by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to  goods  of
      the same description, being goods in respect of which the  trade  mark
      is registered.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (2) Where in relation to any goods in respect of which a trade mark is
      registered—


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      (a)   the circumstances referred to in clause (b) of sub- section  (1)
           are shown to exist so far as regards non- use of the trade  mark
           in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded  in,  in  a
           particular place  in  India  (otherwise  than  for  export  from
           India), or in relation to goods to be exported to  a  particular
           market outside India; and


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (b)  a person has been permitted under sub- section (3) of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_10">section  12</a>
           to register an identical or  nearly  resembling  trade  mark  in
           respect of those goods under a registration extending to use  in
           relation to goods under to be sold, or otherwise traded  in,  or
           in relation to goods to be so exported, or the  tribunal  is  of
           opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register  such
           a trade mark;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      on application by that person in the prescribed manner to a High Court
      or to the Registrar, the tribunal may impose on  the  registration  of
      the first- mentioned trade mark such limitations as it  thinks  proper
      for securing that registration shall cease to extend to such use.”

</blockquote><p id="p_12">11.   <a href="/doc/1678966/" id="a_11">Section 46(1)(b)</a> provides that that up to a date one month before  the
date of the application, a continuous period of five  years  or  longer  had
elapsed during which the trademark was registered  and  during  which  there
was no bonafide use thereof in relation  to  the  goods  for  which  it  was
registered by the proprietor for the registered trademark.   Onus  to  prove
non-use  rests  upon  the  applicant  who  has  filed  the  application  for
rectification.   Of course, it is sufficient  that  the  applicant  who  has
filed the application for rectification to give  prima  facie  evidence  for
non-use of the mark during the relevant period of five years from  the  date
of one month before the date of the application for rectification.  Once  it
is prima facie shown, then the onus shifts to the registered  proprietor  to
prove the use of the trademark during the relevant period.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.   The scope of the above-mentioned provision came up  for  consideration
before this Court in <a href="/doc/1874558/" id="a_12">Hardie Trading  Ltd.  &amp;  Anr.  V.  Addisons  Paint  and
Chemicals Ltd</a>. [(2003) 11 SCC 92], wherein in the Court has taken  the  view
that where the evidence  on  record  does  not  show  absolute  non-user  of
trademark during  the  period  of  5  years  and  one  month  prior  to  the
application for rectification and it was not economically possible  for  the
owner of the registered trademark  to  put  its  goods  manufactured  abroad
immediately  due  to  restrictions  imposed  by  the  Import  Trade  Control
Policies for the relevant years, the  application  for  rectification  could
not be allowed on the ground of alleged non-user  as  the  case  is  covered
under the term “special circumstances”.   Reference may also be made to  the
judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1265850/" id="a_13">Cycle Corporation of India Ltd. v.   T.I.  Raleigh
Industries Pvt. Ltd</a>.  [(1996) 9 SCC 430], wherein this Court held  that  the
initial burden is on the applicant seeking rectification to  show  that  the
registered owner has no intention to use the trademark during  the  relevant
period and, in fact, has failed to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.    We  find,  in  this  case  on  facts,  the  Assistant  Registrar   of
Trademarks, after perusing the various documents found  that  there  was  no
non-user of the trademark ‘KOHINOOR” in respect of  rice  in  class  30  for
five  years  and  one  month  prior  to  the  date  of   the   rectification
application.  That finding is purely a question of fact, which was  affirmed
by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division  Bench.    The  Division
Bench has also found no error in the inclusion of another District also  for
selling the rice and later extending the benefit of  the  trademark  to  the
respondents to the whole State of Uttar Pradesh.   Cogent reasons have  been
stated for extending the trademark so far as the respondents  are  concerned
in the whole of the State  of  Uttar  Pradesh.   It  was  pointed  out  that
restricting the trademark to few cities would create  lot  of  complications
and litigations as to the exact boundary of a particular city  or  District.
It will also be impossible for the respondents to ensure that  its  products
are not sold to retailers  outside  the  six  cities.  Putting  geographical
restrictions was rightly held to be unjust.  In  our  view,  reasons  stated
above cannot be said to be arbitrary or perverse  calling  for  interference
by this Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_14">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.   In the circumstances, we find no error in  the  order  passed  by  the
Division Bench of the High Court.   Appeals lack  merit  and  are  dismissed
with no order as to costs.
