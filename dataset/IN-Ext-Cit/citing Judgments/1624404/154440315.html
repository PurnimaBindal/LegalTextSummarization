therefore, became necessary for this court to consider what was
permissible in order to comply with the statutory and judicial
mandate. Was it permissible for this court as the appellate or

of compensation payable to them thereof.

         We now propose to discuss the above issues in seriatim :
</p>
<p id="p_55">I.       Statutory provisions and jurisprudence              regarding
         imposition of the death penalty
</p><p id="p_56">32.      In the administration of criminal justice, sentencing is as
important a function to be discharged by the court as adjudication
of culpability. Before considering the adequacy of the sentences
imposed in the present cases, we may briefly notice the principles
for sentencing. The sentences which the trial court may impose
stand prescribed under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_47"> the Indian Penal Code</a> in the several
provisions conferring discretion on the sentencing court with
regard to the punishment which may be handed out to the convict.

</p><p id="p_58"> 33.      So far as the conviction for the offence of murder is
concerned, under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_48">Section 302</a> IPC, a sentence of death or
imprisonment for life is prescribed. The statute also mandates that
the convict ―shall also be liable to fine‖.
</p><p id="p_59">34.      For commission of the offence of kidnapping or abducting in
order to murder, <a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_49">Section 364</a> IPC prescribes that the convict shall
be punished with imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment
which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.
<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_50">Section 34</a> of the IPC is concerned with acts done by several
persons in furtherance of their common intention and mandates that
the person, who is one of several persons who have committed a
criminal act in furtherance of the common intention of all, is liable
for that act in the same manner as if it was done by him alone.
</p><p id="p_60">35.      <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_51">Section 201</a> of the IPC deals with causing disappearance of
evidence of the offence or giving false information to screen an
offender.       If the convict is held guilty of causing evidence of
commission of a capital offence to disappear with the intention of
screening the offender for legal punishment, the statute prescribes
that such convict shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years and shall
also be liable to fine.
</p>
<p id="p_61">         If evidence of commission of an offence punishable with
imprisonment for life or with imprisonment which may extend to
ten years has been caused to disappear, the convict shall be

 punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
</p><p id="p_62">36.      It is also essential to consider the statutory requirements as
well as the jurisprudence on the subject which has to guide our
consideration. <a href="/doc/940370/" id="a_52">Section 367</a> (5)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_53"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure,
1898 (as it stood prior to the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_54">Amending Act</a> of 26 of 1955)
enjoined upon the trial court not inflicting upon a person guilty of a
capital offence, to give reasons why imprisonment of life instead of
the death sentence was being awarded. Thus, if a person was found
guilty of murder, the sentence of death was the rule and the
sentence of imprisonment for life was an exception.            <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_55">By the
Amending Act</a> 26 of 1955, <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_56">Section 235(2)</a> was incorporated while
<a href="/doc/940370/" id="a_57">Section 367(5)</a> of the Cr.P.C., 1898 was deleted from the law. As a
result, discretion was conferred upon the trial court to impose
either the death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment upon
conviction of a person for murder. The requirement of recording
reasons for not imposing the death sentence was thus obviated.
</p><p id="p_63">37.      Another amendment<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_58"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure
came into effect on the 1st of April, 1974 (what came to be known
as Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) whereby <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_59">Section 354(3)</a> was
incorporated into the law. After this amendment, the following
statutory provision came to be added into the enactment:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">         ―354 (3) When the conviction is for an offence
         punishable with death or, in the alternative, with
         imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of
         years, the judgment shall state the reasons for the



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          sentence awarded, and, in the case of sentence of death,
         the special reasons for such sentence.‖
                               (Emphasis by us)

</blockquote><p id="p_64">38.      Thus, upon conviction for murder, imprisonment for life
became a rule while death sentence was an exception.                More
importantly for imposing a death sentence, ―special reasons had to
be recorded‖.
</p><p id="p_65">39.      Before embarking on a factual analysis, it is necessary to
briefly examine the jurisprudence on award of death penalty of the
Supreme Court of India.
</p><p id="p_66">40.      Prior to the coming into force of <a href="/doc/324405/" id="a_60">Section 354(3)</a> of the
Cr.P.C., a question of lack of principled approach in imposing the
death penalty was raised in (1973) 1 SCC 20, <a href="/doc/71095988/" id="a_61">Jagmohan Singh v.
The State of U.P.               It</a> was contended that there was excessive
delegation of legislative function as the legislature had failed to lay
down standards or policy to guide the judiciary in imposing its
discretion. Rejecting this contention, the Supreme Court had held
that :
</p>
<p id="p_67">(i)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62">      The Penal Code</a> provided a frame work which prescribes the
maximum punishment and provides a wide discretion to the judge
in deciding on the sentence for the individual offender.
</p>
<p id="p_68">(ii)     It was impossible to lay down the standards which led to the
conferment of the wide discretion.
</p>
<p id="p_69">(iii)    An adequate safeguard with respect to the exercise of
sentencing discretion existed as the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_63">Cr.P.C</a>. provided the right to



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                      pg. 22
 appeal and, therefore, if an error was committed by the court in
exercise of the such discretion, the appellate court would correct
the error.
</p>
<p id="p_70">(iv)     The exercise of judicial discretion on ―well recognized
principles is in the final analysis, the safest possible safeguard for
the accused". (Para - 27)

</p><p id="p_71">41.      Another notable challenge to the death penalty was
considered by the Supreme Court in the judgment reported at
(1979) 3 SCC 646, <a href="/doc/1309719/" id="a_64">Rajendra Prasad v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>.
Writing for the Bench, Justice Krishna Iyer in para 7 cautioned that
―Guided missiles, with lethal potential, in unguided hands, even
judicial, is a grave risk where peril is mortal though tempered by
the appellate process‖.
</p><p id="p_72">         The court was of the view that the meaning of ―well
recognized principles" as articulated in Jagmohan Singh was
unclear. In para 15, the Supreme Court noted that unless principles
are expressly articulated, judicial discretion in sentencing is
‗dangerous'.
</p><p id="p_73">42.      The two considerations by the Supreme Court in Jagmohan
Singh and Rajendra Prasad provided the framework for the
change in law and the amendments to the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_65">Cr.P.C</a>. (known as<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_66"> the
Criminal Procedure Code</a>, 1973) noted by us.
</p><p id="p_74">43.      In the judgment of the Constitution Bench in (1980) 2 SCC
684, <a href="/doc/1201493/" id="a_67">Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, the challenge to the
constitutionality of the death penalty was rejected. The court held



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 23
 that sentencing discretion in the context of the death penalty is not
unguided.          The court expanded the meaning of the expression
‗well recognized principles' (noted in Jagmohan Singh) to mean
‗aggravated and mitigating circumstances‟ identified by the court
in its previous decisions. The court recast the propositions (iv)(a)
and (v)(b) in Jagmohan stating thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">         "164. xxx xxx xxx
               ―(a) The normal rule is that the offence of murder
               shall be punished with the sentence of life
               imprisonment. The court can depart from that rule
               and impose the sentence of death only if there are
               special reasons for doing so. Such reasons must
               be recorded in writing before imposing the death
               sentence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">               (b) While considering the question of sentence to
               be imposed for the offence of murder under
               <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_68">Section 302</a> of the Penal Code, the court must
               have regard to every relevant circumstance
               relating to the crime as well as the criminal. If the
               court finds, but not otherwise, that the offence is
               of an exceptionally depraved and heinous
               character and constitutes, on account of its design
               and the manner of its execution, a source of grave
               danger to the society at large, the court may
               impose the death sentence.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_75">44.      In Bachan Singh, the court observed that by virtue of
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_69">Section 354(3)</a>, the courts were required to provide ‗special
reasons' for imposing the death penalty and that through the
enactment of <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_70">Section 235(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_71">345(3)</a>, the legislature had laid the
following two principles:-
</p>


<p id="p_76">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

</p><p id="p_77">          (i)      The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted
         except in gravest cases of extreme culpability;
</p>
<p id="p_78">         (ii)     Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances
         of the ‗offender' also require to be taken into consideration
         along with the circumstances of the ‗crime'.
</p>
<p id="p_79">45.      Disagreeing with the ruling in Rajendra Prasad, as well as
Jagmohan Singh, the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh held
that the court must give equal emphasis to both the crime and the
criminal. It was noted that often the circumstance with relation to
the crime are intertwined with the circumstances relating to the
criminal.
</p><p id="p_80">         The Constitution Bench also refused to be drawn into the
standardization or categorization of cases for awarding the death
penalty observing in para 201 that ―it is not desirable to consider
the circumstances of the crime and the circumstances of the
criminal in two separate water tight compartments".
</p><p id="p_81">46.      In Bachan Singh, the following circumstances referred to by
counsel were noted as may be considered aggravating (para 202):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         (a)      If the murder is pre-planned, and involves extreme
         brutality;

</p>
<p id="p_84">47.      Possible mitigating circumstances noted by the Supreme
Court (in para 206) are :
</p>

         extreme emotion or mental disturbance;

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">         g)       That the accused was mentally defective and that
         defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of

<p id="p_85">48.      Of course a clarification had been given by the Bench in
Bachan Singh that the above lists are not exhaustive but were


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 26
 relevant and that it is not desirable to consider the circumstances of
the crime and the circumstances of the criminal in two separate
water tight compartments.                  The need for principled sentencing
based on special reasons has been strongly emphasized.
</p><p id="p_86">         In this pronouncement, while reiterating that the court must
give equal emphasis to both the crime and the criminal, the court
did not suggest a ‗balance sheet' approach which was suggested in
later jurisprudence. The constitutionality of the death penalty was
upheld as a framework for principled sentencing, based on
providing special reasons, was already in place.
</p><p id="p_87">49.      The exercise of identifying the guidelines (from which the
court refrained in Bachan Singh) was undertaken by the Supreme
Court in the judgment reported at (1983) 3 SCC 470, <a href="/doc/545301/" id="a_74">Machhi
Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab</a> (paras 32 - 39) which was
decided by a three judge bench of the Supreme Court. Reference
was made to this formulation as the ―rarest of rare case‖ principle
holding that if certain factors were present in a particular case, the
court would have to impose the death penalty since the collective
conscience of the community would be shocked. Thus, we see the
evolution of the ―balance sheet‖ approach. The five factors
(extracted from paras               32 to 37 of the pronouncement) would
include:
</p>
<p id="p_88">         (i)      If the crime is committed in an extremely brutal,
         grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or dastardly manner;
</p>

</p><p id="p_90">          (ii)     When the murder is committed with a motive that
         evinces total depravity and meanness;
</p>
<p id="p_91">         (iii)    When the crime is of an anti-social or socially
         abhorrent nature;
</p>
<p id="p_92">         (iv)     When the crime is enormous in proportion

</p><p id="p_93">         (v)      When the victim is a child, a helpless woman or an
         old/infirm person, when the victim a person vis-a-vis whom
         the murderer is in a position of trust or authority, when the
         victim is a public figure who has been murdered because of
         political or similar reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_94">50.      The Supreme Court also culled out the following principles
and guidelines:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">         (i)      The death sentence should be imposed only in the
         gravest cases;

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">         (ii)     The circumstances of the offender also need to be
         taken into consideration, and not only the circumstances of
         the crime;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">         (iii)    Life imprisonment is the rule, and death sentence the
         exception. The death sentence should be imposed if the

         punishment in the light of the nature and circumstances of
         the crime;

</p><p id="p_96">          (iv)     A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating
         circumstances should be drawn up and equal importance
         should be given to both aggravating and mitigating
         circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_97">51.      Further attempts to get the capital punishment declared
unconstitutional and a reconsideration of the view taken in Bachan
Singh was rejected by the Supreme Court in (1992) 1 SCC 96;
(1992) SC 395, <a href="/doc/626102/" id="a_75">Shashi Nayar v. Union of India</a>. In AIR 1989 SC
1335 : (1989) 1 SCC 678 <a href="/doc/751831/" id="a_76">Triveniben v. State of Gujarat</a> (paras 10
and 11), the Supreme Court referred to the balance sheet theory
propounded in Machhi Singh and again observed that there can be
no enumeration of circumstances in which the extreme penalty
should be inflicted given the complex situation, society and
possibilities in which the offence could be committed.           The
Supreme Court again approved the discretion left by the
Legislature to the judicial decision as to what should be the
appropriate sentence in the particular circumstances of the case.
</p><p id="p_98">52.      The Supreme Court has expressed grave concern with the
manner in which question of sentence is dealt with by the courts in
the judgment reported at (1994) 4 SCC 381, <a href="/doc/1196110/" id="a_77">Anshad &amp; Ors. v.
State of Karnataka</a> (para 17), the court criticized the cryptic
manner in which the trial court dealt with the question of sentence
as, after pronouncing the order of conviction, on the same day itself
it passed a one paragraph order dealing with the question of
sentence.        In para 17, the Supreme Court observed that this



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 exposed the lack of sensitiveness on the part of the Sessions Judge
while dealing with the question of sentence. In para 14, the court
also faulted the reasons given by the High Court for awarding the
death sentence and observed that for determining the proper
sentence in a case like the one under consideration, the court while
taking into account the aggravating circumstances should not
overlook or ignore the mitigating circumstances.
</p><p id="p_99">53.      The Supreme Court observed that principles of deterrence
and retribution are the cornerstones of sentencing in (1994) 2 SCC
220, Dhananjoy Chatterjee Vs. State of West Bengal and (1996) 6
SCC 241, <a href="/doc/1517391/" id="a_78">Gentela Vijayavandhan Rao v. State of Andhara
Pradesh</a>. It was also observed that these principles also cannot be
categorised as right or wrong as much depends upon the belief of
the judges.         The court extracted the following portion of the
decision of the Supreme Court in (2006) 2 SCC 359, <a href="/doc/1694996/" id="a_79">Shailash
Jasvantbhai v. State of Gujarat</a> :

Death sentence jurisprudence - divergence in views

         The discussion on this subject is being considered under the
following sub-headings:
</p><p id="p_101">(i)      Consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances
         I.       Cases where the Supreme Court imposed the death
                  penalty
         II.      Cases where the Supreme Court did not impose the
                  death penalty

</p><p id="p_102">54.      Unfortunately, the Indian judicial system has not been able
to develop legal principles as regards sentencing and superior
courts have repeatedly made observations with regard to the
purport, object for and manner in which punishment is imposed on
an offender.
</p><p id="p_103">55.      In the judgment reported at (2007) 12 SCC 288, <a href="/doc/989335/" id="a_80">Swamy
Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka</a>, the two Judges Bench of the
Supreme Court differed on whether the appellant should be given
the death sentence or sentenced to imprisonment for life. As a
result, a Bench of three Judges of the Supreme Court was
constituted to decide the issue of sentence. In para 42 of the
judgment reported at (2008) 13 SCC 767, <a href="/doc/989335/" id="a_81">Swamy Shraddhananda
v. State of Karnataka</a>, it was again observed that the two earlier
Constitution         Benches          had      resolutely   refrained   from      the
standardization and classification of the circumstances in which



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                                 pg. 31
 death sentence could be imposed. However, in Machhi Singh, the
court had grafted some categories in which the community should
demand the death sentence. Noting the variations on account of
the passage of time since 20th July, 1983 when Machhi Singh was
decided, the Court held that though the categories framed in
Machhi Singh are useful, they cannot be taken as ―inflexible,
absolute or immutable‖ (para 28). It further ruled that the ―rarest
of rare case‖ formulation is a relative theory which requires
comparison with other cases of murder; Machhi Singh translated
this relative category into absolute terms by framing five
categories. In Swamy Shraddananda, the court observed that in
interpreting Bachan Singh, Machhi Singh had actually enlarged
the scope of cases by which the death penalty should be imposed
beyond what the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh had
envisaged. Machhi Singh laid down the rarest of rare criteria (para
</p><p id="p_104">27).
</p>
<p id="p_105">         The court reviewed its previous decisions observing the
inconsistency in the death sentencing decisions; noting that the
imposition of this penalty was not free from the subjective element
and the confirmation of death sentence or its commutation depends
a good deal on the personal predilection of the Judges constituting
the Bench (para 33).
</p>
<p id="p_106">56.      In the judgment reported at (2007) 12 SCC 230, <a href="/doc/1522913/" id="a_82">Aloke Nath
Dutta v. State of West Bengal</a>, the Supreme Court reviewed a
series of cases where the option to impose the death sentence was



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                               pg. 32
 available to the Supreme Court. It was noted that in cases with
similar facts, while death sentence was imposed in some of the
cases, in other cases with similar facts, life imprisonment was
imposed.         The court listed various cases where the murder is
committed in a brutal manner. In some of these cases, the Supreme
Court had imposed death penalty whereas in others, life
imprisonment was imposed on the convicted person. Similarly in
cases involving rape and murder, while death sentence was
imposed in some cases, the offenders were sentenced to life
imprisonment in others.
</p><p id="p_107">57.      In Aloke Nath Dutta, even though the murder had been
committed in a brutal manner, the court did not uphold the death
sentence imposed by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High
Court. One of the factors that weighed with the court was that the
case had been proved on the basis of circumstantial evidence and it
was required that in cases where offence is proved on the basis of
circumstantial evidence, the death penalty ought not to be imposed.
</p><p id="p_108">58.      In the judgment reported at (2008) 7 SCC 550, <a href="/doc/1889684/" id="a_83">State of
Punjab v. Prem Sagar &amp; Ors</a>., the Supreme Court expressed
serious concern in this behalf pointing out the recommendations of
committees as the Madhava Menon Committee &amp; the Malimath
Committee for framing of sentencing guidelines. It was, however,
observed that while awarding a sentence, whether the court would
take recourse to the principles of deterrence or reform, or invoke
the doctrine of proportionality, would depend upon the facts and
circumstances of each case.                    While the nature of the offence


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                           pg. 33
 committed by the accused plays an important role, the sociological
background and the age of the convicts, the circumstances in which
the crime has been committed, his mental state are also relevant
factors in awarding the sentences.
</p><p id="p_109">         In Prem Sagar, the Supreme Court emphasised that while
imposing the death sentence, the courts must take into
consideration the principles applicable thereto, the purpose of
imposition of sentence and impose a death sentence              after
application of mind.
</p><p id="p_110">59.      Strong articulation for the essentiality of a proper pre-
sentencing hearing is to be found in the pronouncement of the
Supreme Court reported at (2009) 6 SCC 498, <a href="/doc/1312651/" id="a_84">Santosh Kumar
Satish Bhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra</a>. The Supreme
Court has been deeply concerned about emphasizing three broad
points on death penalty i.e. the difficulty on account of judge
centric sentencing (paras 46 to 52); the importance of the ―rarest
of rare case‖ (paras 53 to 59) formulation which placed ―extreme
burden‖ on a court and the requirement of the court to conform to
the highest standards of judicial rigor and thoroughness to ensure
pre-sentencing (paras 90 to 93). The court held that an effective
compliance of sentencing procedure under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_85">Section 354(3)</a> and
<a href="/doc/729076/" id="a_86">Section 235(2)</a> Cr.P.C and existence of sufficient judicial
discretion is a pre-condition. A scrupulous compliance with these
statutory provisions is essential so that an informed selection of an
adequate sentence could be based on information collected at the
pre-sentencing stage.

<p id="p_111">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                 pg. 34
</p><p id="p_112"> 60.      In Santosh Kumar Satish Bhushan Bariyar, the court also
declared as per incuriam the decision of the Supreme Court in
(1996) 2 SCC 175, AIR 1996 SC 787 <a href="/doc/622480/" id="a_87">Ravji v. State of Rajasthan</a>
and the decisions which followed it for the reason that while
considering the sentence they took notice of only the characteristics
relating to the crime, to the exclusion of the ones relating to the
criminal being contrary to the rule enunciated by the Constitutional
Bench in Bachan Singh that equal weight must be given to both
crime and the criminal.
</p><p id="p_113">         The Supreme Court clearly declared that equal weight
should be given to both the aggravating and mitigating
circumstances and reiterated the principle that the principled
approach of sentencing applies equally to heinous crimes as well as
to ‗relatively less brutal murders'.
</p><p id="p_114">61.      At this stage, it is necessary to refer to the two Judge Bench
pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2013) 2 SCC
452 : (2012) 11 SCALE 140, <a href="/doc/174283964/" id="a_88">Sangeet &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana</a>
wherein the court held that the considerations for mitigating and
aggravating circumstances are distinct and unrelated elements and
cannot be compared with each other. In para 29 of the report, it
was clearly stated by the Bench that a "balance sheet cannot be
drawn up of two distinct and different constituents of an incident".
The judgment further notes that there was lack of evenness in the
sentencing process; that the rarest of rare principle as well as the
balance sheet approach has been followed on a case by case basis
which has not worked sufficiently well. In para 33, the court also


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                   pg. 35
 observed that even though Bachan Singh intended "principled
sentencing", the sentencing had become judge-centric as had also
been highlighted in Swamy Shraddananda (2) and Santosh
Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar.
</p><p id="p_115">62.      In Sangeet, it was noted that „rarest of rare case‟ doctrine
had been inconsistently applied by the High Courts as well as the
Supreme Court, thereby implying that the aggravating and
mitigating circumstances approach had not been effectively
interpreted. It was observed that Bachan Singh did not endorse
the aggravating and mitigating circumstances approach. In this
judgment, the Supreme Court therefore, emphasized the necessity
of a fresh look at the approach as well as the necessity of adopting
the same.
</p><p id="p_116">63.      In this evaluation of the jurisprudence, it is essential to note
the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2013) 5 SCC
546, <a href="/doc/79577238/" id="a_89">Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra</a> in which
the appellant, a man of 52 years, had been convicted for murder
and strangulation of an 11 year old minor girl with intellectual
disability after repeated rape and sodomy. Despite the satisfaction
of the crime test, the criminal test and the rarest of rare case test,
the court was of the view that the extreme sentence of death
penalty was not warranted. The court therefore, directed the life
sentence awarded for rape and murder to run consecutively. It was
noted in the judgment of Radhakrishnan, J. that in similar
circumstances of rape and murder of minor girls, there had been
inconsistency in the award of death penalty. While in 10 cases,


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 36
 death penalty had been awarded, in eight others, it had been
commuted. In the concurring judgment of Madan B. Lokur, J. an
exhaustive list of cases was set out in para 106 where the death
penalty stood commuted to life imprisonment. In para 49, the
Bench reiterated the aggravating circumstances (crime test) and the
mitigating circumstances (criminal test) as illustrations. It was
pointed out in Bachan Singh that for the fourth mitigating
circumstance enumerated therein i.e. the ―chance of the accused of
not indulging in commission of the crime again and the probability
of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated‖, the State ought
to produce evidence.
</p><p id="p_117">64.      Before us, Mr. Sumeet Verma has staunchly emphasized
para 52 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade which reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">         "52. Aggravating circumstances as pointed out above,
         of course, are not exhaustive so also the mitigating
         circumstances. In my considered view, the tests that we
         have to apply, while awarding death sentence are ―crime
         test‖, ―criminal test‖ and the ―R-R test‖ and not the
         ―balancing test‖. To award death sentence, the ―crime
         test‖ has to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and
         ―criminal test‖ 0%, that is, no mitigating circumstance
         favouring the accused. If there is any circumstance
         favouring the accused, like lack of intention to commit
         the crime, possibility of reformation, young age of the
         accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track
         record, etc. the ―criminal test‖ may favour the accused
         to avoid the capital punishment. Even if both the tests
         are satisfied, that is, the aggravating circumstances to
         the fullest extent and no mitigating circumstances
         favouring the accused, still we have to apply finally the
         rarest of the rare case test (R-R test). R-R test depends
         upon the perception of the society that is ―society-

          centric‖ and not ―Judge-centric‖, that is, whether the
         society will approve the awarding of death sentence to
         certain types of crimes or not. While applying that test,
         the court has to look into variety of factors like society's
         abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to certain
         types of crimes like sexual assault and murder of
         intellectually challenged minor girls, suffering from
         physical disability, old and infirm women with those
         disabilities, etc. Examples are only illustrative and not
         exhaustive. The courts award death sentence since
         situation demands so, due to constitutional compulsion,
         reflected by the will of the people and not the will of the
         Judges.‖
                             (Emphasis supplied)

         Mr. Sumeet Verma emphasises the 100% crime test and 0%
criminal test evaluation as pointed out in para 52 above urging that
even if there was a single mitigating circumstance (young age or
probability of reformation, etc.), the convict would not be
sentenced to death.
</p><p id="p_119">65.      Mr. Sumeet Verma would submit that post Shinde (D.O.D.
27th February, 2014), para 52 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade has
been followed in (2014) 8 SCALE 365, <a href="/doc/1759750/" id="a_90">Santosh Kumar Singh v.

 criminal and 100% crime theory concept has not been followed. It
is noteworthy that in Dharam Deo Yadav, the Supreme Court
awarded rigorous imprisonment of 20 years over and above the
period already undergone by the accused without any remission.
So far as Lalit Kumar Yadav @ Kuri is concerned, in para 46, the
Supreme Court has discussed the balancing of the circumstances.
If the absolute test of 0% and 100% had to be applied, obviously
there would not be any question of the balancing exercise which
stands undertaken. In Santosh Kumar Singh, though reference has
been made to para 52 of Shankar Kisanrao Khade but it does not
appear as if the 0% criminal test and 100% crime test was actually
applied.

Shankar Kisanrao Khade has been followed. We have however,
extracted all the judgments hereafter while listing the based on
consideration of relevant circumstances in the several precedents.
</p><p id="p_126">72.      We hereafter set down in extenso the words of the Supreme
Court in (2014) 4 SCC 317 <a href="/doc/119404246/" id="a_108">Sushil Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>)
after noticing the several pronouncements placed on either side
before it on the manner in which circumstances in the cases would
deserve to be evaluated to arrive at a conclusion as to whether
death penalty was warranted in the case or not:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">         "100. In light of the above judgments, we would now
         ascertain what factors which we need to take into
         consideration while deciding the question of sentence.
         Undoubtedly, we must locate the aggravating and
         mitigating circumstances in this case and strike the right
         balance. We must also consider whether there is
         anything uncommon in this case which renders the
         sentence to life imprisonment inadequate and calls for
         death sentence. It is also necessary to see whether the
         circumstances of the crime are such that there is no
         alternative but to impose death sentence even after
         according maximum weightage to the mitigating
         circumstances which speak in favour of the offender.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">         101. We notice from the above judgments that mere
         brutality of the murder or the number of persons killed
         or the manner in which the body is disposed of has not
         always persuaded this Court to impose death penalty.</blockquote>
<p id="p_127">         Similarly, at times, in the peculiar factual matrix, this
         Court has not thought it fit to award death penalty in
         cases, which rested on circumstantial evidence or solely
         on approver's evidence. Where murder, though brutal, is
         committed driven by extreme emotional disturbance and



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                   pg. 42
          it does not have enormous proportion, the option of life
         imprisonment has been exercised in certain cases.
         Extreme poverty and social status has also been taken
         into account amongst other circumstances for not
         awarding death sentence. In few cases, time spent by the
         accused in death cell has been taken into consideration
         along with other circumstances, to commute death
         sentence into life imprisonment. Where the accused had
         no criminal antecedents; where the State had not led any
         evidence to show that the accused is beyond reformation
         and rehabilitation or that he would revert to similar
         crimes in future, this Court has leaned in favour of life
         imprisonment. In such cases, doctrine of proportionality
         and the theory of deterrence have taken a back seat. The
         theory of reformation and rehabilitation has prevailed
         over the idea of retribution.
</p><p id="p_128">         102. On the other hand, rape followed by a cold-blooded
         murder of a minor girl and further followed by
         disrespect to the body of the victim has been often held
         to be an offence attracting death penalty. At times, cases
         exhibiting premeditation and meticulous execution of
         the plan to murder by levelling a calculated attack on the
         victim to annihilate him, have been held to be fit cases
         for imposing death penalty. Where innocent minor
         children, unarmed persons, hapless women and old and
         infirm persons have been killed in a brutal manner by
         persons in dominating position, and where after ghastly
         murder displaying depraved mentality, the accused have
         shown no remorse, death penalty has been imposed.
         Where it is established that the accused is a confirmed
         criminal and has committed murder in a diabolical
         manner and where it is felt that reformation and
         rehabilitation of such a person is impossible and if let
         free, he would be a menace to the society, this Court has
         not hesitated to confirm death sentence. Many a time, in
         cases of brutal murder, exhibiting depravity and sick
         mind, this Court has acknowledged the need to send a
         deterrent message to those who may embark on such


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          crimes in future. In some cases involving brutal
         murders, society's cry for justice has been taken note of
         by this Court, amongst other relevant factors. But, one
         thing is certain that while deciding whether death
         penalty should be awarded or not, this Court has in each
         case realising the irreversible nature of the sentence,
         pondered over the issue many times over. This Court
         has always kept in mind the caution sounded by the
         Constitution     Bench      in <a href="/doc/307021/" id="a_109">Bachan      Singh [Bachan
         Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC
         (Cri) 580] that Judges should never be bloodthirsty but
         has wherever necessary in the interest of society located
         the rarest of the rare case and exercised the tougher
         option of death penalty.
</p><p id="p_129">         103. In the nature of things, there can be no hard-and-
         fast rules which the court can follow while considering
         whether an accused should be awarded death sentence
         or not. The core of a criminal case is its facts and, the
         facts differ from case to case. Therefore, the various
         factors like the age of the criminal, his social status, his
         background, whether he is a confirmed criminal or not,
         whether he had any antecedents, whether there is any
         possibility of his reformation and rehabilitation or
         whether it is a case where the reformation is impossible
         and the accused is likely to revert to such crimes in
         future and become a threat to the society are factors
         which the criminal court will have to examine
         independently in each case. Decision whether to impose
         death penalty or not must be taken in the light of
         guiding principles laid down in several authoritative
         pronouncements of this Court in the facts and attendant
         circumstances of each case."

</p><p id="p_133">73.      For the purposes of convenience and consideration, the
Supreme Court's approach to death sentencing may thus be divided
into phases. The decision of the Supreme Court's three Judge
Bench in May, 2008 in Swamy Shraddananda (2) marks the
commencement of one such phase. Taking this as the focal point,
we propose to consider cases decided by the Supreme Court post
May, 2008 where factors similar to the ones identified by the
learned Additional Sessions Judges in the instant case as well as
the parties were present. This would assist this court in assessing
an appropriate sentence to be imposed on the defendants. Mr.
Rajesh Mahajan, Mr. Sumeet Verma and Mr. P.K. Dey, Advocates
have painstakingly taken us through the jurisprudence on these
issues. We first propose to list circumstances and some of the
cases wherein existence thereof led to the court imposing death
penalty and thereafter where the court imposed life imprisonment.

<p id="p_134">I.       Cases where the Supreme Court imposed the death penalty.

case fitted the "rarest of rare" category.

 imprisonment should be given for "ordinary murders" and death
sentence for gruesome, ghastly and horrendous murders. Death
sentence was imposed on the appellant.

Six people were locked in their house, which was doused with
petrol and set on fire. Four of them (including a 16 year old girl)
were burnt alive. One managed to escape from the burning house
but was attacked with a sword and killed by a blow which nearly
decapitated him. Brutality of the murder was considered the
aggravating factor.

The victims were young female university students whose bus was
stopped by political workers organizing a 'rasta roko'. The
appellant and accomplices threw petrol into the bus and set it on
fire leading to the death of three girls. It was held that since the
murder of three unarmed women was brutal, grotesque,
unprovoked and pre-planned, the appellant should be sentenced to
death.

Maharashtra : The appellant, a 31 year old man, was convicted for
raping and murdering a three year old girl. Bite marks on the chest
of the child and various injuries to her private parts were found.
Her naked body was left in the open fields. The appellant belied
the human relationship of trust and confidence and worthiness
leaving the deceased in a badly injured condition in open fields
without even clothes reflective of most unfortunate abusive facet of
human conduct. The brutal manner of commission of the offences
and the above circumstances led the court to conclude that the
appellant deserved to be sentenced to death.

the victim's uncle's house and therefore, when asked to do so, she
willingly accompanied the appellant. "Breach of trust" was
considered an aggravating factor. The victim also had multiple
injuries on her face which indicated the brutality of the crime. The
vulnerability of the victim who was of a small built was also
factored by the court and it was held that the appellant was a

Supreme Court has held to be per incuriam. Mohan Anna Chavan
was convicted for raping and murdering two girls aged 5 and 10.
He had two prior convictions for raping under age girls. Shivaji
was convicted for raping and murdering a nine year old girl. Death
penalty was imposed in both these cases because of the depraved

six people of a family by gunning them down to be brutal and
diabolic, especially since women and children had also been shot.

Court of Karnataka : The appellant had a prior conviction for
robbery, dacoity and rape which was the primary factor that led to
the court imposing death sentence on the appellant. Extreme
depravity, the manner in which the crime was committed and the
fact that the appellant had raped and murdered a helpless woman
also influenced the court decision. The court also considered the
unproven fact that the appellant had attempted to rape another
woman subsequent to the incident and that he had committed

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">         "27. The plea that in a case of circumstantial evidence
         death should not be awarded is without any logic. If the
         circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable
         character in establishing the guilt of the accused, that
         forms the foundation for conviction. That has nothing to
         do with the question of sentence as has been observed by
         this Court in various cases while awarding death
         sentence. The mitigating circumstances and the
         aggravating circumstances have to be balanced. In the
         balance sheet of such circumstances, the fact that the case
         rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to play. In
         fact in most of the cases where death sentences are
         awarded for rape and murder and the like, there is
         practically no scope for having an eyewitness. They are
         not committed in the public view. But the very nature of
         things in such cases, the available evidence is
         circumstantial evidence. If the said evidence has been
         found to be credible, cogent and trustworthy for the
         purpose of recording conviction, to treat that evidence
         as a mitigating circumstance, would amount to
         consideration of an irrelevant aspect. The plea of the
         learned amicus curiae that the conviction is based on
         circumstantial evidence and, therefore, the death sentence
         should not be awarded is clearly unsustainable."

rested on circumstantial evidence. Death sentence was confirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_171">(b) So far as the argument of learned counsels for the convicts
that they were all young persons with families are concerned, we
propose to refer to the observations in (1991) 3 SCC 471, <a href="/doc/800569/" id="a_136">Sevaka
Perumal &amp; Anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> reflecting a similar plea in
the following terms:

         appellants are young men. They are the bread winners
         of their family each consisting of a young wife, minor
         child and aged parents and that, therefore, the death
         sentence may be converted into life. We find no force.
         These compassionate grounds would always be present

</p>
<p id="p_185">         Before going any further, it is necessary to examine some
cases where instead of imposing the death sentence, the Supreme
Court has sentenced the convict to imprisonment for life. In some
of the cases, the court has instructed the Executive not to release
the convict before he had served out a certain number of years in
prison. We propose to examine factors on the basis of which the
Supreme Court has concluded that a particular case did not fall in
the "rarest of rare" category.
</p><p id="p_186">(A)      YOUNG AGE AS A MITIGATING FACTOR
</p><p id="p_187">(a) (2014) SCC OnLine SC 538 : (2014) 8 SCALE 365,

<a href="/doc/1982060/" id="a_150">450</a> of the IPC and sentenced to death by the trial court and the
High Court. The Supreme Court considered that the appellant was
an educated person, about 26 years of age, at the time of
committing the offence and was a tutor in the family of the
deceased who was acquainted with the deceased as well as her
family members. It was not the case of the prosecution that the
appellant could not be reformed or that he was a social menace.
The appellant had no criminal antecedents. Though he had
committed a heinous crime but it could not be held with certainty
that the case fell in the "rarest of rare" category. The death
sentence was therefore, commuted to life.

 offence; belong to the economically, socially and educationally
deprived section of the population. They were living in acute
poverty which possibly led to a yearning for quick money and
these circumstances had led to commission of the crimes. The
court also noted their conduct in the jail when they had enrolled
themselves for further education and were on the verge of
acquiring the B.A. degree. Three of the appellants had participated
in different programmes of Gandhi and thoughts and had been
awarded certificates of such participation. One of the convicts in
association with another appellant had written a book. The court
noted that there was no material or information to show any
condemnable or reprehensible conduct on the part of the
appellants during their period of custody. It was noted that these
circumstances pointed to the possibility of the appellants being
reformed and living a meaningful and constructive life if they
were given a second chance. It was therefore, held that the option
of life sentence "was not unquestionably foreclosed" and the
sentence of death was commuted to life imprisonment, the custody
of the appellants for the rest of their lives would be subject to
remissions, if any, strictly subject to provisions to <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_152">Sections 432</a> and

court observed that the circumstances indicated that the appellant

therefore, it was not possible to conclude that the death penalty was
the only punishment which would serve the ends of justice. The
court held that there was possibility of the convict being

not a "rarest of rare" case since there was possibility of the convicts
being reformed; since they were young (being between 21 to 30
years old); did not have a prior criminal record; and that they could
not be considered a menace to society. They were therefore,

by the High Court. A two judge bench of the Supreme Court
upheld the conviction but differed on the sentence to be awarded
by the judgments dated 25th February, 2009. The matter was heard
by a bench of three judges wherein the court held that as the
appellant was a young man of only 27 years of age, it was
obligatory on the trial court to have given a finding as to a
possible rehabilitation and reformation and the possibility that he
could still become a useful member of the society in case he was
given a chance to do so. Such finding had not been returned.
The court also considered the uncertainty due to nature of the
circumstantial evidence. It was also held that "the gravity of the
offence, the behaviour of the appellant and the fear and concern
such incidents generate in ordered society, cannot be ignored".
Relying on two prior pronouncements, the court substituted the
death penalty with life penalty directing that "the life sentence
must extend to the full life of the appellant but subject to any
remission or commutation at the instance of the government for
good and sufficient reasons".

<p id="p_198">(k) (2009) 6 SCC 498, Santoshkumar Bariyar v. State of
Maharashtra : In this case, the deceased was a friend of the
appellants who was kidnapped for ransom and murdered by them
after planning. Despite these factors, the court held that the death
penalty was not an appropriate sentence. The young age of the
appellants, the fact that they had no prior criminal history, and that
they were unemployed were considered mitigating factors.
</p>
<p id="p_199">(B)      POSSIBILITY OF REFORM
         The consideration that young age may be considered as a
mitigating factor rests on the theory of rehabilitation of the
criminal and that if he/she is younger, the possibility of reforming
is higher.        It has been repeatedly held that the possibility of
reformation is a mitigating factor. In Bachan Singh, it was laid
down that death penalty should only be imposed if the court
reaches a conclusion that a person is beyond reform. This was a
primary reason which weighed with the court in not imposing the
death penalty on offenders despite brutality in commission of the
crimes in the following cases:

that the brutal and inhuman manner of committing the murder
alone could not justify the death sentence and that the court's
consideration should not be confined to principally or mere
circumstances connected with a particular crime but should also

 further held that the appellant was not a dangerous man and sparing
his life would not cause danger to the community. The fact that the
appellant had spared the life of one of his other daughters who was
at home at the time of the incident, was considered a mitigating
factor.

<p id="p_221">(b) AIR 2012 SC 968, <a href="/doc/28477471/" id="a_182">Absar Alam v. State of Bihar</a> : The
Supreme Court noted that the appellant was an illiterate, rustic man
who cut off his mother's head as he believed that she was
responsible for his wife's desertion. The mental condition of the
appellant was held to be a relevant factor for not imposing a death
sentence.

by cutting their throats and setting them on fire using petrol for the
reason that his wife had an extra-marital relationship with a
neighbour. The Supreme Court did not sentence him to death
holding that the appellant appeared repentant and was suffering
because he had lost his entire family; and had committed the crime
at the spur of the moment. It was further held that merely because
the crime is committed in a heinous matter, is not reason enough to
sentence a person to death. Other factors and circumstances need
to be considered.

<p id="p_223">(d) (2011) 10 SCC 389, <a href="/doc/1456974/" id="a_184">Sham v. State of Maharashtra</a> : The
appellant was convicted of a triple murder of his brother, brother's
wife and son because of a property dispute. Upon conviction, the
trial court sentenced him to imprisonment for life. The High Court
dismissed the appellant's appeal; allowed the State appeal and
enhanced the sentence of life imprisonment to death. The Supreme
Court noted that the appellant was 38 years of age; no weapon
much less dangerous was used in the commission of the offence; he
was 38 years of age; his antecedents were unblemished; it could
not be said that the appellant would be a menace to society or that
he could not be reformed or rehabilitated or would constitute a
continued threat to society. It was further noted that the appellant
was unemployed and that he had spent 10 years in prison, out of

 which five were in the death cell. The court also noted that while
enhancing the sentence, the High Court had not assigned adequate
and acceptable reasons while the trial court had opportunity of
noting the demeanour of witnesses as well as the accused. The
court therefore, restored the sentence imposed by the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_224">(e) (1999) 6 SCC 60, <a href="/doc/171202/" id="a_185">Akhtar v. State of U.P</a>. : The appellant
was found guilty of murder of a young girl after raping and
sentenced to death by the Sessions Judge which was confirmed by
the High Court. The two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court
(Laxman Naik and Kamta Tiwari) was of the view that the
appellant did not intentionally commit the murder of the girl and
that there was no premeditation. On the other hand, he found her
alone in a lonely place and picked her up for committing rape.
While committing rape, by way of gagging, she had died on
account of asphyxia. It was held that this was not one of the ―rarest
of rare‖ cases inviting death penalty.
</p>
<p id="p_225">(E)      AGGRAVATING FACTORS NEGATIVED

         Several precedents have been placed before us wherein
though aggravating factors were present, the court did not sentence
the offender to death.                   Instead the court opted to impose
imprisonment for life.                 We enumerate some of these cases
hereafter:
</p><p id="p_226">(a) (2013) 2 SCC 452 : (2012) 11 SCALE 140, <a href="/doc/174283964/" id="a_186">Sangeet &amp; Anr.
v. State of Haryana</a> : Despite the murder of four people (including
two women and a four year old child), the court did not impose the
death penalty on the ground that there was uncertainty created by
the court's own jurisprudence as to whether the death penalty
should be imposed or whether a person convicted for murder
should be sentenced to imprisonment for life.
</p>
<p id="p_227">(b) (2009) 14 SCC 31, <a href="/doc/157976839/" id="a_187">State of Punjab v. Manjit Singh</a> :
Although the Supreme Court held that the murder of four people
while they were sleeping by the appellant had been committed in a


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                       pg. 63
 cruel and barbaric manner, other circumstances could not be lost
sight of and the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for life.
</p>
<p id="p_228">(c) (2009)15 SCC 51, <a href="/doc/286262/" id="a_188">Haru Ghosh v. State of West Bengal</a> :
The offence of murder of two people (a woman aged and her 12
year old son) as well as an attempt to murder of a sixty year old
man was committed by the appellant when he was in fact serving
out a sentence in another case and had been released on bail. It
was held by the Supreme Court that this was not a "rarest of rare"
case and that although the murder had been committed in a brutal
manner, that was not sufficient to impose the death penalty. The
court noted that the appellant had not come prepared with a
weapon to commit the murder and that the reason for the offence
was bitterness towards the woman and her husband. The appellant
was sentenced to imprisonment for 30 years.
</p>
<p id="p_229">(d) (2008) 16 SCC 372, <a href="/doc/986284/" id="a_189">Aqeel Ahmad v. State of Uttar
Pradesh</a>: It was held by the Supreme Court that the number of
victims is not the determinative factor in imposing the death
penalty. Though two persons had been shot to death, it was held
that this was not a "rarest of rare" case and the appellant was
sentenced to imprisonment for life.
</p>
<p id="p_230">(e) (2012) 6 SCC 107, <a href="/doc/31929238/" id="a_190">Sandeep v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a> : The
Supreme Court held that the "rarest of rare" case formulation
applies when the accused is a menace to society, and would
threaten its peaceful and harmonious coexistence. It rules that a
crime may be heinous or brutal, but that in itself is not sufficient to
make the case a "rarest of rare" one. Although the court imposed a
life sentence, it held that the death sentence may be justified in
cases where murder is committed in a grotesque, diabolical and
revolting manner.
</p>
<p id="p_231">(f)   (2011) 7 SCC 437, <a href="/doc/1460234/" id="a_191">State of Maharashtra v. Goraksha
Ambajai Adsul</a> : The Supreme Court opined that lust for property
had driven the respondent to committing the offence. It was held
that although crime was committed in a brutal manner, other
circumstances need to be considered as well and that constant

 nagging by the deceased persons (his father, step mother and step
sister) was a mitigating factor.
</p>
<p id="p_232">(g) AIR 1998 SC 2726, <a href="/doc/225119/" id="a_192">Panchhi v. State of U.P</a>. : It was held
that brutality of the manner in which a murder was perpetrated may
be a ground but not the sole criteria for judging whether the case is
one of the "rarest of rare" cases as indicated in Bachan Singh's
case that in a way every murder is brutal and the difference
between one from the other may be on account of mitigating or
aggravating features surrounding the murder. In this case, four
persons including a child were murdered due to rivalry between
families.
</p>
<p id="p_233">(h) We now note two cases of rape and murder that came up
before the Supreme Court where the court sentenced the offender
to imprisonment for life. In (2012) 5 SCC 766, <a href="/doc/78732952/" id="a_193">Neel Kumar v.
State of Haryana</a>, the appellant was convicted for the rape and
murder of his four year old daughter. Holding that this was not a
"rarest of rare" case, the Supreme Court sentenced the appellant to
imprisonment for a period of 30 years, instructing the State not to
provide the option of remission till that time.
</p>
<p id="p_234">(i)    The second case is reported at (2010) 1 SCC 58, <a href="/doc/223583/" id="a_194">Sebastian
@ Chevithiyan v. State of Kerala</a> wherein the appellant had raped
and murdered a two year old child after kidnapping her from her
house. The appellant was 24 years old at that time. It was again
held that this was not a "rarest of rare" case and the appellant was
sentenced to imprisonment for the rest of his life.
</p>
<p id="p_235">(j)    (2002) 1 SCC 622, <a href="/doc/985843/" id="a_195">State of Maharashtra v. Bharat Fakira
Dhiwar</a> : A three year old girl was raped and murdered by the
accused who was convicted and awarded the death sentence. The
High Court set aside the conviction. On scrutiny, the Supreme
Court illustrated the conviction observing that ―we would have
concurred with the Sessions Court's view that the extreme penalty
of death can be chosen for such a crime‖. It was further held that
in spite of the fact that the case was ―perilously near the region of
rarest of the rare cases‖, the Supreme Court was refraining from



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                 pg. 65
 imposing the extreme penalty once the accused was stood acquitted
by the High Court. Placing reliance on Bachan Singh, it was
observed that the lesser option was not unquestionably foreclosed
and so the sentence was ―altered‖ in regard to the offence under
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_196">Section 302</a> to imprisonment for life.
</p>
<p id="p_236">(k) (1998) 2 SCC 372, <a href="/doc/25945/" id="a_197">State of Tamil Nadu v. Suresh and Anr</a>.:
The accused was guilty of rape and murder of a helpless young
pregnant housewife who was sleeping in her own apartment with
her little baby by her side during the absence of her husband. The
High Court upset the conviction and death sentence awarded by the
trial court. The Supreme Court was of the view that the High
Court had erred, restored the conviction but ―at this distance of
time‖ was not inclined to restore the sentence of death.
</p>

<p id="p_237">(F)      PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY

       In (2014) 3 SCC 421 : 2014 (2) SCALE 293, <a href="/doc/170017286/" id="a_198">Birju v. State
of M.P</a>., the court held that the accused had only been charge-
sheeted in earlier cases but not convicted. Hence, that factor is not
a relevant factor to be taken note of while applying the R-R test so
as to award capital punishment. Maybe, in a given case, the
pendency of large number of criminal cases against the accused
person might be a factor which could be taken note of in
awarding a sentence but, in any case, not a relevant factor for
awarding capital punishment. It was further observed that there
were more than two dozen cases, of which three relate to the
offence of murder, the usual plea of false implication by the
defence has to be put on the back seat, and may have an impact on
the sentencing policy, since the presence of the accused could be a
continuing threat to the society and hence calls for longer period of
incarceration.
</p>
<p id="p_238">75.        The various decisions bring out one or the other
circumstances, listing out the same to be an aggravating or

 aggravating circumstances and thereafter to award an appropriate
sentence, is rendered difficult. We find an illuminating exercise
undertaken by the Division Bench of this court in the judgment
reported at (2009) 164 DLT 713, <a href="/doc/177807969/" id="a_199">State v. Raj Kumar Khandelwal</a>

has been made to enumerate the circumstances under six different
illustrative heads for guidance. The enumeration by the Bench is
best extracted in extenso and reads as follows:

</p><p id="p_265"> 76.      In Swamy Shraddananda (2), the Supreme Court had
pointed out that there was a small band of cases where the
convicted person is sentenced to death by the Supreme Court,
However, there was a wide range of cases where the offender was
sentenced to imprisonment for life where the facts were similar or
more revolting, relative to the cases where the death sentence was
imposed.
</p><p id="p_266">77.      The Supreme Court has therefore, noted and highlighted the
inconsistency and arbitrariness in the death penalty jurisprudence.
It was observed that different criteria had been utilized by different
Benches of the court in determining whether the case before them
fell within the ―rarest of rare‖ category and that a consistent and
clear sentencing policy had not been evolved by it.         Thus the
inconsistency in sentencing received a recognition in the judicial
pronouncements.
</p><p id="p_267">78.      The precedents of the Supreme Court indicate the change in
the trend for evaluation of circumstances pointed out in Bachan
Singh.        While the Supreme Court has observed the lack of
evenness in the sentencing policy and its application in Swamy
Shraddananda (2), in Bariyar, the court expressed ―unease and
sense of disquiet‖ with regard to the varied and inconsistent
application of the rarest of rare case threshold.

 Court has applied the "doctrine of proportionality" directing as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">         "23. The survival of an orderly society demands the
         extinction of the life of a person who is proved to be a
         menace to social order and security. Thus, the courts for
         the purpose of deciding just and appropriate sentence to
         be awarded for an offence, have to delicately balance the
         aggravating and mitigating factors and circumstances
         in which a crime has been committed, in a dispassionate
         manner. In the absence of any foolproof formula which
         may provide a basis for reasonable criteria to correctly
         assess various circumstances germane for the
         consideration of the gravity of the crime, discretionary
         judgment, in relation to the facts of each case, is the only
         way in which such judgment may be equitably
         distinguished. The Court has primarily dissected the
         principles into two different compartments--one being
         the ―aggravating circumstances‖ and, the other being the
         ―mitigating circumstance‖. To balance the two is the
         primary duty of the court. The principle of
         proportionality between the crime and the punishment is
         the principle of ―just deserts‖ that serves as the
         foundation of every criminal sentence that is justifiable.</blockquote>
<p id="p_269">         In other words, the ―doctrine of proportionality‖ has
         valuable application to the sentencing policy under the
         Indian criminal jurisprudence. While determining the
         quantum of punishment the court always records
         sufficient reasons. (<a href="/doc/800569/" id="a_219">Vide Sevaka Perumal v. State of

         position in law as regards the nature of punishment
         involved in a sentence of imprisonment for life is well
         settled and the sentence of imprisonment for life has to
         be equated to rigorous imprisonment for life. In this
         view of the matter, the recommendation of the Law
         Commission contained in its 39th and 42nd Reports
         suggesting a suitable amendment in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_260"> the Indian Penal

         for a purpose of removal of doubts and clarifying or
         declaring the existing legal position. Presumably for that
         reason the suggested amendment has not been regarded
         as absolutely necessary and therefore not put through so

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">         ―10. ... Imprisonment for life is a class of punishment
         different from ordinary imprisonment which could be of
         two descriptions, namely, ―rigorous‖ or ―simple‖. It was
         unnecessary for the legislature to specifically mention
         that the imprisonment for life would be rigorous
         imprisonment for life as it is imposed as punishment for
         grave offences.‖

         to curtail remission is not available to all courts.
</p>
<p id="p_292">93.      In the present cases, this court is considering the adequacy of
the sentences of life imprisonment on the three defendants. The
State has sought imposition of death sentences on all the
defendants while the complainant seeks enhancement of the
sentence on two of them to death. The question that this court is
therefore, called upon to answer is as to whether the case falls in
the rarest of rare category or, as noted in para 92 of Swamy
Shraddananda (2) above, whether the case is an ordinary murder
or the case "just falls short of the rarest‖? If the case just falls short
of rarest of rare category, whether imposition of the sentence of life
imprisonment subjected to normal remissions etc., working out to a
total term of 14 years of imprisonment, be adequate to meet the
ends of justice or would it be permissible to impose a mandatory
prison term sentence beyond fourteen years before an application
for remission on behalf of the defendants could be considered?
</p><p id="p_293">94.      Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav has
emphatically contended that only Supreme Court has the power to
impose mandatory term imprisonments restricted to those cases
where the court is commuting a death sentence to life. Mr. Verma
emphatically argued that mandatory term sentences by the High
Courts are legally impermissible, resting his submission on the
pronouncements of the Supreme Court reported at (2013) 9 SCC
778, <a href="/doc/42650836/" id="a_262">Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jain v. State of Rajasthan</a> and

 2013), <a href="/doc/32917452/" id="a_263">Gurvail Singh @ Gala v. State of Punjab</a>. In other words,
Mr. Verma presses an absolute right of a defendant to seek and
secure remission after undergoing the statutory minimum period of
imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_294">95.      Contesting the position, Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned
Additional Standing Counsel for the State has also placed before
this Court the decision dated 17th April, 2014 in Death Sentence
Ref.No.5/<a href="/doc/146415370/" id="a_264">2012, State v. Om Prakash</a> whereby the Division Bench
of this court did not confirm the death sentence. Instead after
considering the entire jurisprudence on award of term sentence, the
court was of the considered opinion that the ends of justice would
be met if two of the convicted appellants were awarded a sentence
of imprisonment for life which would not be less than 20 years
actual.      The third appellant being a young man who was not
married, was awarded a sentence of imprisonment of life subject to
remissions as available.

2014 and Death Sentence Ref.No.7/<a href="/doc/357748/" id="a_266">2013, State v. Bharat Kumar</a>

however submit that in this case also death sentence awarded by

following observations with regard to life imprisonment because of
the exercise of power of remission:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">    ―14. xxx xxx xxx In the context of our Criminal Law which
    punishes murder, one cannot ignore the fact that life
    imprisonment works out in most cases to a dozen years of
    imprisonment and it may be seriously questioned whether
    that sole alternative will be an adequate substitute for the
    death penalty. We have not been referred to any large-scale
    studies of crime statistics compiled in this country with the
    object of estimating the need of protection of the society
    against murders. xxx xxx xxx‖

undergoing a life sentence? In the judgment reported at AIR 1961
SC 600, <a href="/doc/245622/" id="a_293">Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra</a>, the
Constitution Bench was seized of a habeas corpus petition by the
petitioner who sought his release from prison claiming that he had
justly served his sentence. In para 5, it was held that there was no
provision of law whereunder a sentence for life imprisonment
without any formal remission by the appropriate government, can
be automatically treated as one for a definite period. A sentence of
imprisonment for life must prima facie be treated as imprisonment
for the whole of remaining period of convict's natural life. It has
been further held in para 8 that unless that the sentence of life
imprisonment is commuted or remitted by the appropriate

to serve the life term in prison.</blockquote>
<p id="p_334">         Therefore, it is well settled that life imprisonment means that
the prisoner will remain in prison for the rest of his life. It is only
if imprisonment is for a definite period, that credit for remission
given or awarded has a meaning. Since life imprisonment is for an
indefinite period, remissions earned or awarded are really
theoretical.

Gopal Vinayak Godse was reiterated in the judgment reported at
(1981) 1 SCC 107, <a href="/doc/1222748/" id="a_294">Maru Ram v. Union of India</a>. In para 25 of
Maru Ram, it was observed as follows:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_336">107. Before proceeding to deal with the argument raised, it is
necessary to consider whether a convict has an absolute right to
claim remission. This issue has been answered by the courts when
convicts pressed for entitlement to remission upon expiry of the
period of 14 years or 20 years of imprisonment before the courts.
Reference can usefully be made to the pronouncement of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in AIR (32) 1945 PC 64,

         therefore rightly dismissed but, in saying this, their
         Lordships are not to be taken as meaning that a life
         sentence must and in all cases be treated as one of not
         more than 20 years or that the convict is necessarily
         entitled to remission.‖

</p><p id="p_339">         It is therefore, well settled that a convict is not as of right
entitled to remission of the sentence. A convict is therefore, only
entitled to a non-arbitrary consideration of his application for
remission based on all relevant concerns.
</p><p id="p_340">109. It is equally well settled that the exercise of the power of
remission has to be by a decision which is fair to all concerned,
well informed and reasonable, that it cannot be exercised arbitrarily

simple reason that this sub-section is only an enabling provision‖.
The section is set into motion only on receipt of an application for
remission by the convict or on his behalf. Each release requires a
case by case scrutiny. In paras 65 and 66 of Sangeet, the court
dealt with the substantive check on arbitrary remissions by virtue
of <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_300">Section 433A</a> of the Cr.P.C. which mandated the requirement of
a minimum 14 years incarceration relaxable only in exercise of the
constitutional power under <a href="/doc/1008926/" id="a_301">Article 72</a> or <a href="/doc/873751/" id="a_302">Article 161</a> of the

<p id="p_342">(iii)    Experience of exercise of power of remission of sentence

</p><p id="p_343">111. The working of the power of remission is best stated by the
Supreme Court in (1981) 1 SCC 107, <a href="/doc/1222748/" id="a_304">Maru Ram v. Union of
India</a>. The Court reiterated the position that a sentence for life
would enure till the life time of accused as it was not possible to fix
particular period of the prisoner's death and the remissions given
under the rules could not be regarded as substitute for the sentence
for transportation for life.               It was observed that the inevitable
conclusion was that <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_305">Section 433A</a> only dealt with life sentences
and that remission vests no right to release when sentence is life
imprisonment nor is any vested right to remission cancelled by the
compulsory 14 years jail life. Since a life sentence is a sentence for
life, thus the remissions lead nowhere and cannot entitle the person
to release. This position was stated by the Supreme Court in para

 23 of the judgment reported at (1981) 1 SCC 107, <a href="/doc/1222748/" id="a_306">Maru Ram v.
Union of India</a> wherein it was held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">         ―23. Sentencing is a judicial function but the execution
         of the sentence, after the courts pronouncement, is
         ordinarily a matter for the executive under<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_307"> the
         Procedure Code</a>, going by Entry 2 in List III of the
         Seventh Schedule. Keeping aside the constitutional
         powers under Articles 72 and 161 which are
         ―untouchable‖ and ―unapproachable‖ for any
         legislature, let us examine the law of sentencing,
         remission and release. Once a sentence has been
         imposed, the only way to terminate it before the
         stipulated term is by action under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_308">Sections 432</a>/<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_309">433</a> or
         Articles 72/161. And if the latter power under the
         Constitution is not invoked, the only source of salvation
         is the play of power under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_310">Sections 432</a> and <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_311">433(a)</a> so
         far as a ―lifer‖ is concerned. No release by reduction or
         remission of sentence is possible under the corpus juris
         as it stands, in any other way. The legislative power of
         the State under Entry 4 of List II, even if it be stretched
         to snapping point, can deal only with Prisons and
         Prisoners, never with truncation of judicial sentences.
         Remissions by way of reward or otherwise cannot cut
         down the sentence as such and cannot, let it be
         unmistakably understood, grant final exit passport for
         the prisoner except by government action under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_312">Section
         432(1)</a>. The topic of Prisons and Prisoners does not
         cover release by way of reduction of the sentence itself.</blockquote>
<p id="p_344">         That belongs to criminal procedure in Entry 2 of List III
         although when the sentence is for a fixed term and
         remission plus the period undergone equal that term the
         prisoner may win his freedom. Any amount of remission
         to result in manumission requires action under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_313">Section
         432(1)</a>, read with the Remission Rules. That is why
         Parliament, tracing the single source of remission of
         sentence to <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_314">Section 432</a>, blocked it by the non-obstante
         clause. No remission, however long, can set the

         the inference is inevitable, even if the contrary

SC 420, <a href="/doc/1078432/" id="a_335">Ram Raj v. State of Chhattisgarh</a>, also the Supreme Court
was concerned with the issue of duration of the sentences. The
court observed that the convict had undergone about 14 years of
actual imprisonment which with remission amounted to about 17
years. In para 5, the court discussed the ratio of the judgment in
Gopal Vinayak Godse and Dalbir Singh in para 6 wherein the
option of the convicting court to impose a sentence of
imprisonment which shall last as long as life lasts, where there are
exceptional         indications        of     murderous   recidivism and      the
community cannot run the risk of the convict being at large. In this
case also, it was found that it was not a fit case for release on
completion of 14 years. The petitioner's case for premature release
was directed to be taken up by the authorities concerned after he
had completed 20 years imprisonment including remissions.

punishment of live imprisonment, rather than death would serve
the ends of justice.              A further declaration was made that the

<p id="p_359">    3-1994 and submitted that by virtue of the provisions
    relating to remission, the sentence of life imprisonment,
    without any qualification or further direction would, in all
    likelihood, lead to his release from jail in the first quarter
    of 2009 since he has already completed more than 14 years
    of incarceration. This eventuality is simply not acceptable
    to this Court. What then is the answer? The answer lies in
    breaking this standardisation that, in practice, renders the
    sentence of life imprisonment equal to imprisonment for a
    period of no more than 14 years; in making it clear that
    the sentence of life imprisonment when awarded as a
    substitute for death penalty would be carried out strictly
    as directed by the Court. This Court, therefore, must lay
    down a good and sound legal basis for putting the
    punishment of imprisonment for life, awarded as

     substitute for death penalty, beyond any remission and to
    be carried out as directed by the Court so that it may be
    followed, in appropriate cases as a uniform policy not
    only by this Court but also by the High Courts, being the
    superior courts in their respective States. A suggestion to
    this effect was made by this Court nearly thirty years ago in
    <a href="/doc/388259/" id="a_343">Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab</a> [(1979) 3 SCC 745 : 1979
    SCC (Cri) 848] . In para 14 of the judgment this Court held
    and observed as follows: (SCC p. 753)
             ―14. The sentences of death in the present appeal are
         liable to be reduced to life imprisonment. We may add a
         footnote to the ruling in Rajendra Prasad case[<a href="/doc/1309719/" id="a_344">Rajendra
         Prasad v. State of U.P</a>., (1979) 3 SCC 646 : 1979 SCC
         (Cri) 749] . Taking the cue from the English legislation
         on abolition, we may suggest that life imprisonment
         which strictly means imprisonment for the whole of the
         men's life but in practice amounts to incarceration for a
         period between 10 and 14 years may, at the option of
         the convicting court, be subject to the condition that
         the sentence of imprisonment shall last as long as life
         lasts, where there are exceptional indications of
         murderous recidivism and the community cannot run the
         risk of the convict being at large. This takes care of
         judicial apprehensions that unless physically liquidated
         the culprit may at some remote time repeat murder.‖

    We think that it is time that the course suggested in Dalbir
    Singh [(1979) 3 SCC 745 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 848] should
    receive a formal recognition by the Court.
</p><p id="p_360">    57. As a matter of fact there are sufficient precedents for
    the Court to take such a course. In a number of cases this
    Court has substituted death penalty by life imprisonment or
    in some cases for a term of twenty years with the further
    direction that the convict would not be released for the rest
    of his life or until the twenty-year term was actually served
    out.‖

    IPC. They were also convicted under the provisions of the
    Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
    (TADA) with different terms of imprisonment for those
    offences. This Court, however, commuted the death
    sentence of the three appellants but having regard to the
    gravity of the offences and the dastardly nature of their acts
    directed for their incarceration for a period of 20 years with
    the further direction that the accused-appellants would not
    be entitled to any remission from the term of 20 years.
    Reference was made to the earlier decisions in <a href="/doc/290765/" id="a_348">Ashok

         Bihar remission is granted to life convicts
         by deemed conversion of life imprisonment into a fixed
         term of 20 years. The deemed conversion of life
         imprisonment into one for fixed term by executive
         orders issued by the State Governments apparently flies
         in the face of a long line of decisions by this Court and
         we are afraid no provision of law was brought to our
         notice to sanction such a course. It is thus to be seen that
         life convicts are granted remission and released from
         prison on completing the fourteen-year term without any
         sound legal basis. One can safely assume that the
         position would be no better in the other States. This

         remission is allowed to life convicts in the most
         mechanical manner without any sociological or
         psychiatric appraisal of the convict and without any
         proper assessment as to the effect of the early release of

thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_69">         ―92. The matter may be looked at from a slightly
         different angle. The issue of sentencing has two aspects.
         A sentence may be excessive and unduly harsh or it may
         be highly disproportionately inadequate. When an
         appellant comes to this Court carrying a death sentence
         awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High
         Court, this Court may find, as in the present appeal, that
         the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare
         category and may feel somewhat reluctant in
         endorsing the death sentence. But at the same time,
         having regard to the nature of the crime, the Court may
         strongly feel that a sentence of life imprisonment
         subject to remission normally works out to a term of 14
         years would be grossly disproportionate and
         inadequate. What then should the Court do? If the
         Court's option is limited only to two punishments, one
         a sentence of imprisonment, for all intents and
         purposes, of not more than 14 years and the other
         death, the Court may feel tempted and find itself
         nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course
         would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable
         and proper course would be to expand the options and
         to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs
         to the Court i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years'
         imprisonment and death. It needs to be emphasised that
         the Court would take recourse to the expanded option
         primarily because in the facts of the case, the sentence
         of 14 years' imprisonment would amount to no
         punishment at all.</blockquote>
<p id="p_368">         93. Further, the formalisation of a special category of
         sentence, though for an extremely few number of
         cases, shall have the great advantage of having the
         death penalty on the statute book but to actually use it

         and further to direct that the convict must not be

         Court seems to suggest that the remission power of the
         appropriate Government has effectively been nullified
         by awarding sentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some
         cases without any remission. Is this permissible? Can
         this Court (or any court for that matter) restrain the
         appropriate Government from granting remission of a
         sentence to a convict? What this Court has done
         in Swamy Shraddananda [(2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3
         SCC (Cri) 113] and several other cases, by giving a
         sentence in a capital offence of 20 years' or 30 years'
         imprisonment without remission, is to effectively
         injunct the appropriate Government from exercising its
         power of remission for the specified period. In our
         opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion,
         but as at present advised, we are of the opinion that this
         is not permissible. The appropriate Government cannot
         be told that it is prohibited from granting remission of a
         sentence. Similarly, a convict cannot be told that he
         cannot apply for a remission in his sentence, whatever
         be the reason.‖

Constitution Bench pronouncement in AIR 1961 SC 600, <a href="/doc/245622/" id="a_359">Gopal
Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra</a> observing as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_375">         ―68. Briefly stated the legal position is this: <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_360">Before Act</a>
         26 of 1955 a sentence of transportation for life could be



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                      pg. 105
          undergone by a prisoner by way of rigorous
         imprisonment for life in a designated prison in India.
         After the said Act, such a convict shall be dealt with in
         the same manner as one sentenced to rigorous
         imprisonment for the same term. Unless the said
         sentence is commuted or remitted by appropriate
         authority under the relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_361"> of the Penal
         Code</a> or<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_362"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, a prisoner
         sentenced to life imprisonment is bound in law to serve
         the life term in prison. The rules framed under the
         <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_363">Prisons Act</a> enable such a prisoner to earn remissions--
         ordinary, special and State--and the said remissions
         will be given credit towards his term of imprisonment.
         For the purpose of working out the remissions the
         sentence of transportation for life is ordinarily equated
         with a definite period, but it is only for that particular
         purpose and not for any other purpose. As the
         sentence of transportation for life or its prison
         equivalent, the life imprisonment, is one of indefinite
         duration, the remissions so earned do not in practice
         help such a convict as it is not possible to predicate the
         time of his death. That is why the rules provide for a
         procedure to enable an appropriate Government to
         remit the sentence under <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_364">Section 401</a> [now <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_365">Section
         432</a>]<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_366"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure on a

</p><p id="p_377">127. In para 69 of Sangeet, the Bench considered the issue as to
whether there is any provision of law whereunder the sentence of
life imprisonment, without any final remission by the appropriate
government, can be automatically treated as one for the definite
period? It was observed in Gopal Vinayak Godse that no such
provision was to be found in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_367"> the Indian Penal Code</a>, Code of
Criminal Procedure or the Prisoner's Act. The Constitution Bench


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 had also ruled in Gopal Vinayak Godse that a prisoner sentenced
for transportation for life had no indefeasible right to unconditional
release on the expiry of a particular term including the remissions.
It was declared in Gopal Vinayak Godse that ―the rules under the
<a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_368">Prisons Act</a> do not substitute a lesser sentence for a sentence of
transportation for life‖.
</p><p id="p_378">128. In para 70 of Sangeet, the court has set out the reiteration of
the view taken in (1976) 3 SCC 470, <a href="/doc/1040415/" id="a_369">State of Madhya Pradesh v.
Rattan Singh</a> wherein (following Gopal Vinayak Godse), it was
observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_70">         ―70. ... In other words, this Court has clearly held that
         a sentence for life would enure till the lifetime of the
         accused as it is not possible to fix a particular period of
         the prisoner's death and remissions given under the
         Rules could not be regarded as a substitute [of a lesser
         sentence] for a sentence of transportation for life. In
         these circumstances, therefore, it is clear that the High
         Court was in error in thinking that the respondent was
         entitled to be released as of right on completing the
         term of 20 years including the remissions."

to a convict serving a definite term imprisonment is different from

―additional‖ remission, that is, for a period over and above the
remission granted or awarded to a convict under the Jail Manual or

imprisonment), the power under <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_373">Section 432</a> CrPC can certainly be
exercised but not on the basis that life imprisonment is an arbitrary
or notional figure of twenty years of imprisonment. (para 77.6)

</p><p id="p_383">(v)      In case of a convict undergoing life imprisonment, he will be
in custody for an indeterminate period.                Therefore, remissions

reduce the period of such incarceration, a specific order under
<a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_374">Section 432</a> of the Cr.P.C. will have to be passed by the
appropriate government. Such reduced period cannot be less than

has been commuted under <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_415">section 433</a> into one of imprisonment

<p id="p_430">         It is evident that by virtue of <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_416">Section 433A</a>, the legislature
has restricted the power to release a person sentenced to life
imprisonment from prison in two eventualities. The first being if
he has been sentenced to imprisonment for life for an offence for
which death is one of the punishments provided by law. The
second is where a sentence of death imposed on a person has been
commuted under <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_417">Section 433</a> into one of the imprisonments for
life. The statute therefore, draws no distinction as is urged by

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">         ―156. It may be recalled that in Jagmohan [(1973) 1
         SCC 20 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 169 : (1973) 2 SCR 541] this
         Court had observed that, in practice, life imprisonment
         amounts to 12 years in prison. Now, <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_419">Section 433-A</a>

          commuted to imprisonment for life must serve actual
         imprisonment for a minimum of 14 years.‖
                            (Emphasis by us)
         Therefore, while considering an offence for which death is
one of the punishments, the legislature itself has equated the
considerations for imposition of life imprisonment to a case where
a death sentence has been commuted to life imprisonment.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_432">137. The defendants do not dispute that the High Court is
competent to enhance a sentence of imprisonment awarded by the
Trial Court to a death sentence. In fact, a death sentence awarded
by the trial judge has to be referred for confirmation by the High
Court under <a href="/doc/1822802/" id="a_422">Section 28(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
</p><p id="p_433">138. It also cannot be disputed that a fixed term sentence or
minimum imprisonment prescription is a lesser sentence than the
death sentence. It has been so observed in several cases by the
Supreme Court (including Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of
Karnataka) wherein it is recognized as a third option.
</p><p id="p_434">139. In the given circumstances, in view of the principles laid
down in Swamy Shraddananda (2), does a convicting and
sentencing court not have three sentencing options instead of two?
We have discussed above the several precedents wherein the court
has carved out a third category of cases, one being an ordinary
murder case where sentence of life imprisonment seems to be
adequate punishment for the offence of murder; the second being a
case which falls in the rarest of rare category inviting the death
penalty and the third which falls just short of 'rarest of rare' but



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                 pg. 116
 would be more heinous than an ordinary murder, for which the
normal sentence of life imprisonment subject to remissions etc.
would not be adequate punishment.
</p><p id="p_435">140. In para 92 of Swamy Shraddananda (2), the Supreme Court
noted that if the court's option is limited only to two punishments,
one being a sentence of imprisonment which practically works to
not more than 14 years and the other is death, more courts would
be pursuaded into endorsing death penalty which would work
grave injustice. The court thus provided the third option as the vast
hiatus between 14 years' imprisonment and death as "special
category of sentence" (para 92). We also find that the Supreme
Court has carefully referred to this court as well as the court clearly
underlining the fact that the third option was available to any court
which is undertaking the exercise of sentencing (para 94). It is
also recognized that the sentencing court would be empowered to
direct that the convict would not be released from the prison "for
the rest of his life" or "for the actual term as specified in the
order", as the case may be.
</p><p id="p_436">141. In exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1934622/" id="a_423">Section 28</a> of the Cr.P.C., the
High Court also has the power to commute death sentence to life
imprisonment. If this be the statutory power of the High Court,
then it certainly has the power to impose a term sentence which,
though lesser than the death sentence, is graver than a sentence of
life imprisonment which is subjected to the application of <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_424">Section
433A</a> of the Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_438"> 142. The submission of the respondents, therefore, is that though
the High Court is competent to award the death sentence, it cannot
award the lesser sentence of a fixed term imprisonment! Such a
submission certainly is beyond logic and is completely
unreasonable.
</p><p id="p_439">143. It is trite that a larger or wider power necessarily includes the
lesser, narrower, incidental or ancillary power [Ref. : (1997) 3

14 of the pronouncement reported at (1979) 3 SCC 745, <a href="/doc/388259/" id="a_426">Dalbir
Singh v. State of Punjab</a> are relevant and deserve to be considered
in extenso. Para 14 thereof reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">         ―14. The sentences of death in the present appeal are
         liable to be reduced to life imprisonment. We may add a
         footnote to the ruling in Rajendra Prasad case. Taking
         the cue from the English legislation on abolition, we
         may suggest that life imprisonment which strictly means
         imprisonment for the whole of the man's life, but in
         practice amounts to incarceration for a period between
         10 and 14 years may, at the option of the convicting
         court, be subject to the condition that the sentence of
         imprisonment shall last as long as life lasts where there
         are exceptional indications of murderous recidivism and
         the community cannot run the risk of the convict being
         at large. This takes care of judicial apprehensions that
         unless physically liquidated the culprit may at some
         remote time repeat murder.‖

have the power to grant such lesser sentence, the consequences
could be drastic. As observed in para 92 of Swamy Shraddananda
(2), if sentencing courts did not have a third option and had to
choose between a 14 year life sentence and the death punishment,
for a serious crime, more courts would be persuaded to impose the
death sentence.

Mr. Verma, learned counsel for the defendant. In the judgment
reported at (2013) 9 SCC 778, <a href="/doc/42650836/" id="a_427">Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jain v.
State of Rajasthan</a>, the Supreme Court was called upon to decide
inter alia whether the High Court was justified in ordering that the
appellants should be sentenced to 20 years of actual imprisonment
without remissions. The Supreme Court noted the decisions in
some cases where the court had awarded minimum years of
imprisonment of 20, 25, 30 or 35 years. The Supreme Court took
judicial notice of the fact that remission is allowed to life convicts
in a most mechanical manner without any sociological or
psychiatric appraisal of the convict and without any proper
assessment as to the effect of the earlier release of the particular
convict on the society. We also set down para 29 of the judgment
hereunder as it cites the precedent in (2009) 15 SCC 551, <a href="/doc/286262/" id="a_428">Haru

         In the light of the detailed discussion by the larger

</p><p id="p_449">147. The above extracted judgment in Sahib Hussain @ Sahib
Jain does not support the contention on behalf of the defendants.
On the contrary, it reiterates the position that the High Court also
has available a third sentencing option so far as a murder case
falling in the ‗rare' description (i.e. more heinous than the ordinary


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 murder but falling short of the rarest of rare category), a third
category of cases. This third option ('via media') enables the court
to impose a life imprisonment sentence beyond 14 years
imprisonment (at which cases of life convicts may be considered
for commutation) or beyond twenty years. In this case, it was not
the Supreme Court which was commuting a death sentence to life.
It was the High Court which had committed the sentence to life
imprisonment with condition. The Supreme Court was considering
a challenge by the appellant to the imposition by the High Court of
the sentence of the life imprisonment with restrictions.                    The
challenge was repelled by the Supreme Court.                      This decision
reiterates the legal position that so far as sentencing is concerned,
all courts, be it trial courts, the Sessions Courts, the High Courts as
well as the Supreme Court have the same powers, of course subject
to    statutory        restrictions        regarding   limits   and   procedural
requirements (as confirmation of the death sentence by the High
Court if imposed by the trial court).

@ Gala v. State of Punjab</a>. Upon the petitioner's conviction for
killing four persons, the trial court sentenced Gurvail Singh to

direction that the petitioner shall serve 30 years in jail without

The petitioner then filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court
seeking a direction to convert the sentence of 30 years in jail
without remission to a sentence of simple life imprisonment and
further to declare that the Supreme Court was not competent to fix
a particular number of years (with or without remission) when
commuting the death sentence to life imprisonment while
upholding the conviction of the accused under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_438">Section 302</a> of the

had imposed the penalty of death on the respondent which was

         light of drawing distinctions between what would be
         rare and what would be the rarest of the rare. A sentence
         of life imprisonment can thus be classified in two
         categories i.e. the ordinary category whereby the Court
         leaves the exercise of executive power at the discretion
         of the executive, to be so exercised after 14 years of

         extended by directing that the accused shall undergo an
         actual sentence for a higher period or even for the

         the category of rare cases with appropriate direction of
         not being entitled to the benefit of remission till a fixed
         term of imprisonment is undergone. Only after
         carrying out such an exercise should the Court take
         resort to the extreme action in a case which would be in

</blockquote><p id="p_460">157. The above jurisprudence would show that the Supreme
Court has noted that on several occasions, while a murder may not
fall in the rarest of rare category, it is just short of it, or, is certainly
more serious than what has been termed as an 'ordinary murder
case'. The Supreme Court has thus categorized murder cases into
‗ordinary' and ‗rarest of rare'. It has also recognized an in between
category of just short of 'rarest of rare' cases. Thus murder cases,
for sentencing purposes can be classified into three categories -
‗ordinary', ‗rarest of rare' and a third category ‗just short of rarest
of rare' i.e. ‗rare' category. The sentence of life imprisonment
also is classified into two categories. The first is the ordinary
category whereby the executive has the discretion to grant
remission after 14 years of imprisonment. The courts have the
jurisdiction, in a case falling 'just short of rarest of rare' (or rare)
category, to make an appropriate direction that the offender will
not be entitled to the benefit of remission till he has undergone a
fixed term of imprisonment.

distinction be drawn between a case where a death sentence stands
imposed and a challenge thereto is being considered, that too by no
court other than the Supreme Court as against a case where the
court is considering imposition of any appropriate sentence. The
distinction being drawn by Mr. Verma, to say the least, is an
erroneous reading of the jurisprudence on the issue. First and
foremost, imposition of a minimum prison term would arise only in
cases where life imprisonment is an option and the court formed a
view that if the case was taken up for remission under <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_443">Section 432</a>
in accordance with <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_444">Section 433A</a> of the Cr.P.C., the fourteen year
imprisonment would not be commensurate with the gravity of the
offence. This issue would also arise where the court is called upon
to consider whether an offence of murder falls in the rarest of rare
category or it does not.

508, <a href="/doc/1277706/" id="a_445">Mulla v. State of U.P</a>. that ―it is open to the sentencing court
to prescribe the length of incarceration‖. The Supreme Court
further observed that this was ―especially true in cases where
death sentence has been replaced by life imprisonment. The
court should be free to determine the length of imprisonment
which will suffice the offence committed. In the case in hand, it
was observed that despite the nature of the crime, the mitigating
circumstances can allow us to substitute the death penalty with
life imprisonment‖.

          The Supreme Court has thus clearly stated that the length of
incarceration has to be fixed by the "sentencing court".
</p><p id="p_465">160. Will not the considerations for commuting death to life be
the same when considering imposition of the sentence in an appeal
for enhancement?              Or for that matter, by the trial court when
imposing the sentence upon returning the finding of guilt?
</p><p id="p_466">161. It is essential to note that the first level of consideration of
the aptness of the sentence is at the trial court. It is the trial judge
who is required to hear the accused after pronouncing conviction,
and conclude on the gravity of the offence and adequacy of the
sentence. In a trial for offences punishable with death, it is the trial
judge who would consider whether the case falls in the rarest of
rare formulation and also whether a prison term is commensurate
with the offence? The trial judge also has to examine the length of
the prison term to befit the offence.
</p><p id="p_467">162. The parameters on which a case is evaluated from the
perspective of whether the capital punishment is warranted,
remains the same, be it any court in the country.              It is also
necessary to point out that there is no difference between the
parameters on which the power to commute the death sentence to
life imprisonment would be exercised by the Supreme Court or the
High Court or in the scope of consideration while doing so.
</p><p id="p_468">163. While examining the legality, proportionality and adequacy
of the sentence, the consideration by the high court as the appellate
court into the sentencing, has to remain the same. It would be
preposterous to thus hold that the power to hand down a fixed term

 sentence beyond 14 years is not available to the trial courts or the
high court or that even the power of the Supreme Court to do is
confined to cases of commutation of the death sentence to life
imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_469">164. The submission as pressed by learned counsel for the
defendants would require us to hold that the trial court can impose
a life sentence for an ordinary murder, the death sentence for the
rarest of rare case but it has no jurisdiction to consider as to
whether the case falls in the intermediate 'rare' category inviting
mandatory tenure imprisonment as an adequate sentence. Or that,
on the same facts and evidence, the trial court (or for that matter,
the high court) has no power to do so, and that only the Supreme
Court has the jurisdiction to do so, which jurisdiction is also
limited to when it is commuting a death sentence to life not to
restrict power of the executive to remit the sentence. Such is not
the legislative intent.
</p><p id="p_470">165. There is no dichotomy between the power of the High Court
when confirming a death sentence and its power when considering
an appeal for enhancement under <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_446">Section 377</a> read with <a href="/doc/1256523/" id="a_447">Section
386</a> of the Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_471">166. It is also important to note that as per Swamy Shraddananda
(2), the third option is available to the "convicting court" (as
recommended in Dalbir Singh) which is not only the Supreme
Court but also the High Courts and the trial courts.
</p><p id="p_472">167. We therefore, conclude that a third sentencing option is
available to the sentencing court in all cases where death penalty is


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 one of the options. It would be exercised if the court is of the view
that death sentence ought not to be imposed and that, given the
power of remission of the life sentence, if exercised on completion
of fourteen years of imprisonment, the imprisonment would be
inadequate. The court is therefore, free to determine the length of
imprisonment which would be commensurate for the offence.

has to be consistent with the relevant substantive provisions of the

E.S.P. Rajaram; M.S. Ahlawat)
</p><p id="p_474">169. In para 101 of Kirloskar Pneumatic Co. Ltd. case, it was
held that even under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_452">Article 226</a>, no direction to act contrary to law
can be given. There can be no dispute at all with this well settled
principle. In fact, it is premised on this principle that we have held
that the power to impose a fixed term sentence on the convict is
derived from <a href="/doc/1934622/" id="a_453">Section 28</a> of the Cr.P.C.                 The argument of the

 Supreme Court is commuting death sentence to life imprisonment
is clearly contrary to this well settled principle.
</p><p id="p_475">170. Thus the restriction on the power of the courts which Mr.
Verma is pressing is unwarranted. It is not supported by either the
statutory provisions or the judicial precedents. It is clearly
permissible for the sentencing court to judicially regulate the power
of the executive to remit the sentence of the convict and while
imposing a life sentence, direct a minimum term of imprisonment
which may be in excess of fourteen years imprisonment depriving
the convict of the benefit of remissions till expiry of such period.
It can also be lawfully awarded by the High Court while
commuting the death sentence awarded by the trial court upon
conviction for such offence. In the light of the above discussion,
we also find no legal prohibition upon the high court in handing
out such sentence when adjudicating upon a prayer for
enhancement of the sentence by the prosecution or the
complainant/victim.
</p><p id="p_476">171. Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsel has also urged that the High
Court does not have any power to interfere with the discharge of
the executive function to grant remission. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan,

imprisoned for his entire life unless remission of the sentence in
accordance with <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_454">Section 433A</a> CrPC is granted for good reasons,
on an application by the convict. The convicting or confirming
court retains the power to recommend to the government that the
sentence be not remitted till a fixed term of imprisonment has been
undergone or consideration of the remission be postponed.
</p><p id="p_480">(ii)     A prisoner serving a life sentence does not have an
indefeasible right to release under <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_455">Section 432</a> CrPC after serving
out, either a 14 or 20 years of his prison term.
</p><p id="p_481">(iii)    Before actually exercising the power of remission of the
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_456">Cr.P.C</a>., the appropriate government must obtain the opinion (with
reasons) of the presiding Judge of the convicting or confirming
court. The remissions, therefore, be given only on a case by case
basis and not for a wholesale manner [Sangeet para 80(7)].

view that the question as to whether after the Supreme Court

that the appellant had entered the house of the deceased with the

have been exactly aware of the consequences of his acts in injuring
the deceased and committing the offences on PW-2. For these
reasons, while upholding the convictions of the appellant, the

following directions:

imprisonment sentences, but three sentences - each for life
imprisonment - to run consecutively. The effect would be that
upon a favourable consideration of an application for remission of

the prohibition under <a href="/doc/626516/" id="a_510">Section 433A</a>, the second application could at

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_92">         "Consecutive sentence cases
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_93">         138. <a href="/doc/1822033/" id="a_521">Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal v. State of
         Maharashtra</a> [(1996) 4 SCC 148 : 1996 SCC (Cri)
         608], is perhaps among the earliest cases where
         consecutive sentences were awarded. This was not a
         case of rape and murder but one of causing a dowry
         death of his pregnant wife. It was held that it was not the
         ―rarest of rare‖ cases ―because dowry death has ceased
         to belong to that species of killing‖. The death sentence
         was, therefore, not upheld. Since the accused had
         attempted to cause disappearance of the evidence by
         severing the head and cutting the body into nine pieces,
         this Court directed that he should undergo the
         sentence for that crime after serving out his life
         sentence. It was held: (SCC p. 151, paras 10-12)
                  ―10. We have given considered thought to the

                  case in that category which could be regarded as
                  the ‗rarest of the rare' type. This is so because
                  dowry death has ceased to belong to that species
                  of killing. The increasing number of dowry deaths
                  would bear this. To halt the rising graph, we, at
                  one point, thought to maintain the sentence; but
                  we entertain doubt about the deterrent effect of a
                  death penalty. We, therefore, resist ourselves
                  from upholding the death sentence, much though
                  we would have desired annihilation of a

                  atrocious way in which the head was severed and
                  the body was cut in nine pieces. These cry for

         Since imprisonment for life means that the convict will
         remain in jail till the end of his normal life, what this
         decision mandates is that if the convict is to be
         released earlier by the competent authority for any

         625 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 859] is also among the earliest
         cases in the recent past where consecutive sentences
         were awarded. The three accused, aged about 35 years
         (two of them) and 25/27 years had committed three
         murders and a gang rape. This Court converted the
         death sentence of all three to imprisonment for life since
         it was not possible to identify whose case would fall in
         the category of the ―rarest of rare‖ cases. However, after
         awarding a sentence of life imprisonment, this Court
         directed that they would all undergo punishment for the
         offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1284610/" id="a_531">Section 376(2)(g)</a> IPC
         consecutively, after serving the sentences for other

                  factors, it cannot be said that the offences were
                  committed under the influence of extreme mental
                  or emotional disturbance for the whole thing was
                  done in a pre-planned way; having regard to the
                  nature of offences and circumstances in which
                  they were committed, it is not possible for the
                  Court to predict that the appellant would not
                  commit criminal act of violence or would not be a
                  threat to the society. A-1 is 35 years old, A-2 is
                  35 years old and A-3 is 25 (sic 27) years old. The
                  appellants cannot be said to be too young or too
                  old. The possibility of reform and rehabilitation,
                  however, cannot be ruled out. From the facts and
                  circumstances, it is not possible to predict as to
                  who among the three played which part. It may
                  be that the role of one has been more culpable in

         punishments provided by law, is remitted or commuted,
         such person shall not be released unless he has served at
         least fourteen years of imprisonment. In the case of the
         respondent herein, second life imprisonment is under

         alternate punishment. However, the sentence may even
         be for life or for a term which may extend to ten years.
         Of the three options thus available, in view of the brutal
         rape of a minor girl child, the Sessions Court has chosen

&amp; Anr. v. State of U.P</a>. [referred to in para 10 of Chatar Singh] is
concerned, this was also not a case involving imposition of life
imprisonment. Upon conviction, the appellants in this case had
been sentenced by the Sessions Judge to 14 years rigorous
imprisonment under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_592">Section 120B</a> of the IPC; to another term of 14
years rigorous imprisonment under <a href="/doc/64934656/" id="a_593">Section 3</a> of the Official Secrets
Act. The Sessions Judge had directed that the sentences of the
appellants shall run consecutively. The appellants did not assail the
findings of the Trial Court. They however, urged that the offences
proved against them did not warrant the maximum sentences for
offences for which they had been convicted and that, in any case,
the sentences ought not to have been directed to run consecutively
when the result of such a direction is that the appellant's sentence
of imprisonment exceeds 14 years rigorous imprisonment which is
the longest period of imprisonment for a person for any offence. In
para 13 of Zulfiqar Ali, the court observed that ―it is no doubt true
that the normal rule for punishment as provided in <a href="/doc/1915240/" id="a_594">Section 31(1)</a> is
that the sentences should run consecutively but it is also provided

                The Words ―unless the Court directs that such

         for some object. These words clearly indicate that the
         punishments can be directed to run concurrently in an
         appropriate case. In other words, there may be a case
         where only concurrent punishments can meet the ends of
         justice. Therefore, it has to be examined in this case
         whether on the facts proved in the case, concurrent
         punishment is called for. If once it is concluded that this
         case warrants concurrent punishments, the order of the
         trial Judge directing the punishments to be consecutive
         cannot be upheld.‖
                              (Emphasis by us)

         It is noteworthy that the Allahabad High Court held that
evaluation of the facts of the case had to be undertaken to conclude
whether the sentences should run concurrently. The court also did
not consider any precedent in which life imprisonment had been
awarded.
</p><p id="p_530">194. So far as the present consideration is concerned, the
submission on behalf of the State in para 20 and the findings of the

         (1) of <a href="/doc/1915240/" id="a_598">Section 31</a> which contains the normal rule that the
         sentences should be consecutive. Since this sub-section

<blockquote id="blockquote_110">         21. We do not subscribe to the above view. Sub-
         section (1) of <a href="/doc/1915240/" id="a_599">Section 31</a> no doubt says that the sentences
         should normally be consecutive but it has further
         provided that in appropriate cases the sentences may be
         made to run concurrently. The object of this sub-section
         is clearly to emphasise that the court must expressly
         direct whether the sentences awarded in a trial are to run
         concurrently or consecutively. This has been emphasized
         by providing that normally the sentences should be made
         to run consecutively and they may be made to run
         concurrently only if there is a reason for giving such a
         direction. By making such a provision, this sub-section
         has not provided any maximum term of punishment
         when the court directs the sentences to run consecutively.

         section (2).</blockquote>

         sentences‖ in sub-<a href="/doc/1915240/" id="a_600">section 31(2)</a> make it clear that this
         sub-section refers to a case in which ―consecutive
         sentences‖ are ordered. After providing that in such a
         case if an aggregate of punishment for several offences is
         found to be in excess of punishment which the Court is
         competent to inflict on a conviction of single offence, it
         shall not be necessary for the Court to send the offender
         for trial before a higher Court. After making such a
         provision, proviso (a) is added to this sub-section to limit
         the aggregate of sentences which such a Court passes
         while making the sentences consecutive. That is this
         proviso has provided that in no case the aggregate of
         consecutive sentences passes against an accused shall
         exceed 14 years. In the instant case the aggregate of the
         two sentences passed against the appellant being 28 years
         clearly infringes the above proviso. It is accordingly not
         liable to be sustained.‖

by clear statutory provisions which cannot be ignored. We are
compelled to point out that unfortunately in both Chatar Singh and
Zulfikar Ali, a primary submission that sub-section 2 of Section 31
was restricted in its applicability to courts with limited
competency, that is to say, that <a href="/doc/1915240/" id="a_601">Section 31(2)</a> refers to a sentencing
court which is not competent to impose life imprisonment (which
means that the remainder of the person's life and therefore, has no
outside limits), was not placed before the court. In Zulfikar Ali,
the court had proceeded to hold that it was not just and appropriate
that the sentences be made to run consecutively in the facts and
circumstances of the case.

and under <a href="/doc/244673/" id="a_619">Section 27</a> to R.I. of three years and fine of Rs.2,000/-.
The sentences were ordered to run consecutively on the ground that
the appellant was a previous convict for committing an identical
offence and that in the present case, he had committed the heinous
crime of shooting in court premises. The appellant's appeal against
conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court. In the
appeal before the Supreme Court, learned senior counsel for the
appellant placed reliance on the pronouncements reported at (2006)

concurrently and that the consecutive sentences awarded in the
present case were disproportionate to the facts of the case. The
Supreme Court accepted this submission of learned senior counsel
for the appellant observing in para 14 as follows:

contrary to the proviso to Sub-Section 2 of Section 31<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_633"> of the Code</a>

Court had directed the substantive sentences of the appellant to run
consecutively.          Notice in the appeal was issued limited to the
question as to whether the sentence can be made to run
concurrently instead of running consecutively. In the referral order

</p><p id="p_541">201. The Supreme Court separately noted the working out of the
sentences if upon conviction for several offences, in a single trial,
one of the punishments imposed on the convict is a life sentence.
The discussion, findings and the law laid by the Supreme Court in
this regard deserve to be extracted and read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_119">         ―13. ... Difficulties arise when the Courts impose
         sentence of imprisonment for life and also sentences of
         imprisonment for fixed term. In such cases, if the Court
         does not direct that the sentences shall run concurrently,
         then the sentences will run consecutively by operation
         of <a href="/doc/1838917/" id="a_659">Section 31(1)</a> Cr.P.C. There is no question of the
         convict first undergoing the sentence of imprisonment for
         life and thereafter undergoing the rest of the sentences of
         imprisonment for fixed term and any such direction
         would be unworkable. Since sentence of imprisonment
         for life means jail till the end of normal life of the
         convict, the sentence of imprisonment of fixed term has
         to necessarily run concurrently with life imprisonment.
         In such case, it will be in order if the Sessions Judges
         exercise their discretion in issuing direction for
         concurrent running of sentences. Likewise if two life
         sentences are imposed on the convict, necessarily, Court
         has to direct those sentences to run concurrently.</blockquote>

         sentences‖ in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_660">Section 31</a> Cr.P.C. make
         it clear that this sub-section refers to a case in which
         ―consecutive sentences‖ are ordered. The provision says
         that if an aggregate punishment for several offences is

         competent to inflict on a conviction of single offence, it
         shall not be necessary for the Court to send the offender
         for trial before a higher court. Proviso (a) is added to sub-
         section (2) of <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_661">Section 31</a> Cr.P.C. to limit the aggregate of
         sentences - that in no case, the aggregate of consecutive
         sentences passed against an accused shall exceed
         fourteen years. ―Fourteen years rule‖ contained in
         clause (a) of the proviso to <a href="/doc/471567/" id="a_662">Section 31(2)</a> Cr.P.C. may
         not be applicable in relation to sentence of

declared that the restriction therein would not apply to life

</p><p id="p_545">203. We find that in para 15 of O.M. Cherian@ Thankachan, it
is noted that the court in Ramesh Chilwal v. State of Uttarakhand,



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 164
 (2012) 11 SCC 629, considered the fact that the trial court had
awarded life sentence under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_674">Section 302</a> and as such, the sentences
imposed on the convict were directed to run concurrently.
</p><p id="p_546">204. In para 16 (of O.M. Cherian), the court noted that in <a href="/doc/168419569/" id="a_675">V.K.
Bansal v. State of Haryana &amp; Anr</a>. (2013) 7 SCC 211, it was
observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_120">         ―... we may say that the legal position favours exercise
         of discretion to the benefit of the prisoner in cases where
         the prosecution is based on a single transaction no matter

         filed as is the position in cases involving dishonour of
         cheques issued by the borrower towards repayment of a
         loan to the creditor.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_547">205. The judgment in V.K. Bansal thus offers guidance in cases
as cheques bouncing. Where the prosecution is based on a single
transaction, it may not matter that different complaints in relation
thereto may have been filed. The judgment notes that judicial
discretion would be exercised to the benefit of the prisoner in such
cases where the prosecution is based on a single transaction. The
court also noted that Mohd. Akhtar Hussain @ Ibrahim Ahmed
Bhatti as well as (2014) 2 SCC 153, <a href="/doc/126419811/" id="a_676">Manoj @ Panu v. State of

contrary, in para 20 of the pronouncement, the Supreme Court has
noted the object, spirit and intendment of <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_678">Section 31</a> of the Cr.P.C.
in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_121">         ―20. Under <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_679">Section 31</a> Cr.P.C. it is left to the full
         discretion of the Court to order the sentences to run
         concurrently in case of conviction for two or more
         offences. It is difficult to lay down any straitjacket
         approach in the matter of exercise of such discretion by
         the courts. By and large, trial courts and appellate courts
         have invoked and exercised their discretion to issue
         directions for concurrent running of sentences, favouring
         the benefit to be given to the accused. Whether a
         direction for concurrent running of sentences ought to
         be issued in a given case would depend upon the nature
         of the offence or offences committed and the facts and
         circumstances of the case. The discretion has to be
         exercised along the judicial lines and not mechanically.

<blockquote id="blockquote_122">         21. Accordingly, we answer the Reference by holding
         that <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_680">Section 31</a> Cr.P.C. leaves full discretion with the
         Court to order sentences for two or more offences at
         one trial to run concurrently, having regard to the
         nature of offences and attendant aggravating or
         mitigating circumstances. We do not find any reason to
         hold that normal rule is to order the sentence to be
         consecutive and exception is to make the sentences
         concurrent. Of course, if the Court does not order the
         sentence to be concurrent, one sentence may run after

          Paras 20 and 21 of O.M. Cherian @ Thankachan thus
unequivocally declare that it has been left to the full discretion of
the court awarding the sentences to direct that they would run
concurrently or consecutively.
</p><p id="p_550">207. It is also manifest from the above that if by exercise of
judicial discretion, a sentence of life imprisonment is imposed
upon a convict for commission of one out of several offences, then
the court would not direct the multiple sentences to run
consecutively as life imprisonment actually means imprisonment
for the remainder of a person's life.                  Inherent therein is the
jurisdiction of the court that, if life imprisonment is not for the
remainder of the person's life, because of intervention of the event
of the exercise of the discretion under <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_682">Sections 432</a>, <a href="/doc/1275473/" id="a_683">433</a> and <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_684">433A</a>
of the Cr.P.C. resulting in remission or the commutation of the life
sentence, the sentencing court can anticipate such an eventuality
and direct a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment before
the appellant's case for remission or commutation in exercise of
the statutory power, could be considered by the authorities of the
State. There is nothing in <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_685">Section 31</a> which prohibits the court
from doing so.
</p><p id="p_551">208. The above conclusion is supported by some important
features of <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_686">Section 31</a> which have otherwise escaped notice. When
examined closely, the drafting and the statutory scheme of <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_687">Section
31</a> reveals important aspects of the legislative intent and objective.
Let us examine the proviso contained in <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_688">Section 31</a>. Does the
proviso govern both sub-<a href="/doc/217640/" id="a_689">section 1</a> as well as sub-<a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_690">section 2</a> or is it

 restricted in its application to sub-<a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_691">section 2</a> thereof?             The
legislature has affixed punctuations carefully in this enactment.
We find that a full stop is affixed at the end of sub-<a href="/doc/217640/" id="a_692">section 1</a>
manifesting the legislative intent that the sub-section was complete
by itself. As against this, at the end of sub-<a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_693">section 2</a>, before the
incorporation of the proviso, the legislature has used a colon,
thereby unequivocally declaring that the sub-section had not
concluded but was governed by the proviso which follows. This
intent is also manifested from the contents of the proviso as would
be evident from the following discussion.
</p><p id="p_552">209. Are we placing unnecessary importance on punctuation? On
the question of significance of punctuation for statutory
interpretation, in the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported
at AIR 1952 SC 369, <a href="/doc/350457/" id="a_694">Aswini Kumar Ghose &amp; Anr. v. Arabinda
Bose &amp; Anr</a>., the court observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_123">         ―56. ... Punctuation is after all a minor element in the
         construction of a statute, and very little attention is paid
         to it by English courts. Cockburn, C.J. said in (1861) 1 B
         &amp; Sp. 101, Stephenson v. Taylor. ―On the Parliament
         Roll there is no punctuation and we therefore are not
         bound by that in the printed copies.‖ It seems, however,
         that in the Vellum copies printed since 1850 there are
         some cases of punctuation, and when they occur they can
         be looked upon as a sort of contemporanea exposition.</blockquote>
<p id="p_553">         When a statute is carefully punctuated and there is doubt
         about its meaning, a weight should undoubtedly be given
         to the punctuation. I need not deny that punctuation may
         have its uses in some cases, but it cannot certainly be
         regarded as a controlling element and cannot be allowed
         to control the plain meaning of a text.‖

enunciation of principles in Aswini Kumar Ghose &amp; Anr. as well
as Full Bench judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court
reported at AIR 1972 Calcutta 160, <a href="/doc/605193/" id="a_696">Rajinder Singh v. Kultar
Singh</a>. In this case, the court was concerned with the use of a
‗semicolon' and it was held that the punctuation should not be
discarded as being inappropriate and that the punctuation has been
put with a definite object of making the topic as distinct and not
having relation only to the topic that follows thereafter.         The
expression ―administration of justice‖ in Entry 3 List II (now Entry
11A of List III) of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the use of
the ‗full-stop' after sub-section 1 of Section 31 and the ‗colon' at
the end of sub-<a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_697">section 2</a> have to be given their correct and
complete import.

be resorted to for purposes of construction‖. This text notes the
judgment of the Supreme Court reported at AIR 1979 SC 564,

sale or distributes' a drug without a licence, is liable for

 punishment. In holding that mere stocking is not an offence within
the section, the Supreme Court pointed out the presence of comma
after ‗manufactures for sale' and ‗sells' while there is absence of
any comma after ‗stocks'. It was, therefore, held that only stocking
for sale could amount to offence and not mere stocking.
</p><p id="p_556">212. We also find the reference to the pronouncement reported at
AIR 1988 SC 1841, <a href="/doc/490863/" id="a_701">M.K. Salpekar (Dr.) v. Sunil Kumar
Shamsunder Chaudhari</a> in this authoritative text. In this case, the
court was construing Clause 13(3)(v) of the C.P. and Berar Letting
of Houses and Rent Control Order.                        This provision permits
ejectment of a tenant on the ground that ―the tenant has secured
alternative accommodation, or has left the area for a continuous
period of four months and does not reasonably need the house‖. In
holding that the requirement that the tenant ‗does not reasonably
need the house' has no application when he ‗has secured
alternative accommodation' the court referred and relied upon
punctuation,           the      comma           after   the   words   alternative
accommodation.

the construction of legislation, however, assistance can certainly be
taken from it in construing the prescription and intent of the

<a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_705">Section 31</a>, which is the jurisdictional limitation on the hierarchy of

in our view is at the core of the interpretation and working of

which such offence is shown in the First Schedule to be triable.

pass any sentence of imprisonment up to 7 years. The court of

have the same powers as the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate
while that of Metropolitan Magistrate shall have those of the court

</p><p id="p_561">         It is evident from the above, that as per the statutory scheme,
there is limitation on the power to impose imprisonment on all
magistrates.
</p><p id="p_562">217. It is significant that <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_718">Section 31</a> of the Cr.P.C. is placed in
Chapter III which is captioned ―Power of Courts‖. <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_719">Section 31</a> is
placed just after the aforenoticed statutory provisions setting out
the limits on sentencing powers of the courts. It is extremely
pertinent that sub-section 1 of Section 31 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_720">Cr.P.C</a>. makes no
reference to a maximum sentence which the court in question may
award. On the other hand, sub-<a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_721">section 2</a> makes a clear reference to
competency of the court to impose a sentence. It further refers to
the aggregate punishment for the several offences being in ―excess
of the punishment which the trial court had the competency to

 inflict‖.     Competency has to relate to a limit on the power to
impose punishment.
</p><p id="p_563">218. The sub-section (2) also refers to ―trial before higher
court‖. Such limit on competency is obviously relatable only to
offences which are punishable with term imprisonments not
extending to life as life means the rest of the convicts' life or death
penalty. There is therefore, no ―limit‖ on punishment if the court is
competent to hand out the life sentence. The concept of ―excess
....of competency...‖ would therefore, not apply to trials and
convictions for offences punishable with life sentences and
consequently to trials by Sessions Courts. For this reason as well,
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_722">Section 31</a> refers to trials by the Magistrates
while sub-section 1 of Section 31 clearly refers to Sessions trials.
</p><p id="p_564">219. Even para 27 of Duryodhan Rout notes that the proviso in
<a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_723">Section 31</a> is relatable to sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_724">Section 31</a>. We find
that if the absolute prohibition urged by Mr. Verma was accepted,
sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_725">Section 31</a> would be rendered otiose which
cannot be the legislative intent.
</p><p id="p_565">220. There is yet another reason for so construing these sub-
sections of <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_726">Section 31</a>. Under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_727">Cr.P.C</a>., trials are conducted
either before the Magistrate or the Sessions Judge. Some trials
may be placed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Sub-
<a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_728">section 2</a> refers to a "trial before a higher court" (which given the
scheme of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_729">Cr.P.C</a>., could be the court of the Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate or Sessions court). Sub-section 1 of Section 31 on the
other hand makes no such reference to any higher court. In the


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 hierarchy of courts (below the high court) conducting criminal
trials, the Sessions Court stands at the highest. It is therefore,
apparent that sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_730">Section 31</a> is confined in its
application to courts other than Sessions courts.
</p><p id="p_566">221. We now propose to examine yet another reason to support
the view which we have taken.                            It is settled law that life
imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the
person's life unless remitted under the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_731">Section 433</a> etc. of the
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_732">Cr.P.C</a>.        Proviso (a) in <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_733">Section 31</a> restricts the sentence of
imprisonment for a period up to fourteen years. If it were held that
proviso (a) applies to cases of life imprisonment it would follow
that even for committing multiple offences punishable with death
(where life was awarded) or life sentences, the convict could
undergo a maximum of 14 years imprisonment only. Any such
restriction is contrary to the several provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_734"> of the Indian Penal
Code</a>, the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_735">Cr.P.C</a>. as well as binding judicial pronouncements
which we have noticed above.                           Therefore, proviso (a) is not
concerned with life imprisonments.
</p><p id="p_567">222. So far as proviso (b) is concerned, it refers to "amount of
punishment which the court is competent to inflict for a single
offence". The proviso (b) restricts the maximum imprisonment to
twice the amount of such punishment. This obviously also does
not refer to the life imprisonment which means remainder of the
person's life. If life means remainder of the person's life, there can
certainly be no "twice" of such life imprisonment.

</p><p id="p_569"> 223. The proposition pressed by Mr. Sumeet Verma results in the
completely unacceptable position for one more reason.          While
trying a single offence attracting the punishment up to 20 years
imprisonment, (say the offence under <a href="/doc/668689/" id="a_736">Section 376A</a> of the IPC
which prescribe a minimum sentence of 20 years), the Sessions
Court would have the power to incarcerate the convict for 20 years
imprisonment. However, if the Sessions Court was concerned with
the case involving the multiple offences of rape under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_737">Section 376</a>
as well as the offence of murder for which life imprisonment was
considered appropriate, the Sessions Court would be empowered to
impose a maximum sentence of 14 years. This could never have
been the legislative intent.
</p><p id="p_570">224. The absurd result on accepting the proposition pressed on
behalf of the convicts is also illustrated in a case involving a
conviction for offence under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_738">Section 376</a> which prescribes a
minimum sentence of 10 years which may extend to imprisonment
for life meaning imprisonment for the remainder of the person's
life and the conviction for the offence under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_739">Section 326</a> of the
IPC. To accept the proposition that the proviso under <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_740">Section
31(2)</a> applies to the sessions trial, the Sessions Court would be
empowered to award a maximum of 14 years imprisonment. This
is in clear contradiction to the statutory prescription.
</p><p id="p_571">         For all these reasons as well, the proviso in <a href="/doc/718023/" id="a_741">Section 31</a> does
not govern sub-section 1 of Section 31 whereunder life
imprisonment is imposed. The proviso is restricted to sub-section

extracted and reads as follows:

in <a href="/doc/1326470/" id="a_746">Section 427</a> of the Cr.P.C. In fact, judicial discretion for
awarding consecutive sentence for a repeat offender while
undergoing a sentence in a prior conviction has been taken away.

</p><p id="p_575">228. Bachan Singh has suggested the option of imposing death
punishment as a penalty of last resort when any other alternative

Bachan Singh opting for the alternative punishment.

 courts. It is the larger Bench decision which thus has to guide
adjudication in the present case.
</p><p id="p_578">231. It is therefore, trite that while awarding a sentence of
imprisonment for life, the court can direct a fixed term of
imprisonment exceeding 14 or 20 years with or without remissions
instead of a death sentence. In a trial where the defendant has been
tried for multiple offence, the sentencing court has another option
to direct sentences for different offences to run consecutively.
</p><p id="p_579">232. The jurisprudence extracted above, most importantly also
illustrates that, if a person stands convicted for several offences,
each of which is punishable with death or life imprisonment, if the
life sentence means the remainder of the convicts' life, two life
sentences could also be directed to run concurrently.
</p><p id="p_580">233. If the executive is considering remittance of the remainder of
a life sentence imposed on a convict at any stage, in order to ensure
a minimum imprisonment, the sentencing court is also amply
empowered to direct that the punishment for other convictions
including two life sentences, shall run consecutively.        (Ref. :
(2013) 3 SCC 52 : (2013) 2 SCALE 505, <a href="/doc/145276691/" id="a_753">Sanaullah Khan v. State
of Bihar</a> wherein two life sentences stood imposed.) The court is
thereby able to ensure adequacy of the punishment for grievous
offences.
</p><p id="p_581">234. To conclude, therefore, so far as sentencing for offences
punishable with death or life imprisonment is concerned, four
options of punishments are recognised: the first, death penalty; the
second, life imprisonment subject to Sections 432 to 433A of

of life, or, a mandatory fixed term of imprisonment before which

<p id="p_582">VII. Honour killing - whether penalty of only the death
     sentence
</p><p id="p_583">235. We now turn to the submissions premised on the motive for
the crime as an indicator for imposition of the death penalty. This
time an absolute proposition is urged by Mr. Rajesh Mahajan,
learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State and Mr. P.K.
Dey, learned counsel appearing for the complainant - Nilam
Katara. Their contention is that the murder of Nitish Katara falls in
the class of offences categorized as ―honour killing‖.          Such a
killing does not stop at being a criminal offence but is a sufficient
evil sans rationale or logic. It is submitted that the killing of Nitish
Katara rested in the sense which obtained with the defendants that
he had to be killed to save the ―honour of their family‖. Our
attention is drawn to paras 2012 to 2026 (pages 1106 to 1116) of
our judgment dated 2nd April, 2014 as well as para 32 of the trial
court judgment wherein it has been held that Nitish's killing fell in
the honour killing category.
</p><p id="p_584">236. Mr. Dey would urge that this offence falls in the category of
the extreme social evils which include bride burning; dowry death;
untouchability; sati; human sacrifices. It epitomises prejudices and
social structures which have to be broken. Learned counsel has


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                    pg. 179
 reminded us of our finding that the murder of Nitish Katara in fact
violated Bharti Yadav's absolute right to choose her life partner, an
integral part of her right to life apart from also violating the right to
life of the deceased.
</p><p id="p_585">237. Mr. Dey urges that the killing for honour in the instant case
ipso facto thus falls into the category of rarest of rare cases and that
the convicts have displayed extreme depravity which is not only
extremely revolting for the immediate family but has shocked the
collective conscience of the society.                  Given the caste structure
which the convicts were trying to protect, it is urged that their acts
in abducting; throttling; brutally murdering Nitish Katara and
thereafter burning his dead body beyond identification in the name
of honour was a gruesome, merciless and brutal act for which death
penalty was inevitable.               In support of this submission, learned
counsel has placed reliance on the pronouncements reported at
(2007) 12 SCC 654, <a href="/doc/1782717/" id="a_755">Mayakaur Baldevsingh Sardar &amp; Anr. v.
State of Maharashtra</a>; (2011) 6 SCC 396, <a href="/doc/1422914/" id="a_756">Bhagwan Dass v. State

v. State of Maharashtra</a>.
</p><p id="p_586">238. On the other hand, Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel
arguing for the defendant- Vikas Yadav has contended that none of
these judgments support the submissions propounded by learned
counsel for the complainant. It is contended that either the case
does not relate to honour killing, or, where the case relates to

 honour killing, the court has not awarded or approved of an award
of death sentence.
</p><p id="p_587">239. We propose to consider these cases in the seriatum as
submitted by learned counsel before us. In (2007) 12 SCC 654,
<a href="/doc/1782717/" id="a_758">Mayakaur Baldevsingh Sardar &amp; Anr. v. State of Maharashtra</a>,
enraged by the victim girl's secret marriage with a boy belonging
to a lower caste despite resistance and threats by her parents,
members of her parental family came to her in-laws house in a pre-
planned manner where she was living. On 30th May, 1999, after
recovering the jewellery which she had taken with her, they made a
murderous attack on her and killed other members of the house
including her husband.                 In this attack, Rajvinder Kaur, though
grievously hurt but survived in the incident, went crawling to the
house of a neighbour, and informed him of the assault on her
family on which he called the police. By the judgment dated 21st
December, 2001, the Additional Sessions Judge awarded death
sentence to four of the accused. The Division Bench of the High
Court of Judicature at Bombay gave divergent judgments on 26 th
February, 2003 when the case was heard for confirmation of the
death sentence. The judgment of the third judge was delivered on
25th April, 2003 reaffirming the sentences which directed the
convicts to undergo imprisonment for life under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_759">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_760">34</a>
IPC. In these circumstances, all the convicts who were undergoing
life sentences imposed by the High Court, challenged their
conviction and sentences. The State also filed an appeal praying
for award of death sentence before the Supreme Court. The

 observations of the court on the imposition of death penalty, its
efficacy especially in the context of the honour killing involved,
deserve to be extracted and read as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_127">         ―25. We have something to say on this aspect. The
         efficacy or otherwise of the death penalty is a matter of
         much debate in legal circles--with two diametrically
         opposite views on the subject. However, as<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_761"> the Penal
         Code</a> visualises the imposition of this penalty, the
         circumstances under which it should be imposed are
         also a matter of discussion, the broad principle being its
         award in the rarest of rare cases. Undoubtedly also
         while categorising a case the facts would predominate
         but the predilection of a judge, is a human factor (and a
         factor whose importance cannot be minimised) but as
         judges applying the law we must also be alive to the
         needs of society and the damage which can result if a
         ghastly crime is not dealt with in an effective and proper
         manner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_128">         26. We also notice that while judges tend to be
         extremely harsh in dealing with murders committed on
         account of religious factors they tend to become more
         conservative and almost apologetic in the case of
         murders arising out of caste on the premise (as in this
         very case) that society should be given time so that the
         necessary change comes about in the normal course.</blockquote>
<p id="p_588">         Has this hands-off approach led to the creation of the
         casteless utopia or even a perceptible movement in that
         direction? The answer is an emphatic ‗No' as would be
         clear from mushrooming caste-based organisations
         controlled and manipulated by self-appointed
         commissars who have arrogated to themselves the right
         to be the sole arbiters and defenders of their castes with

whether it fell under the category of awarding death sentence, in
para 30 of the judgment, the court held as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_129">         ―30. We are of the opinion that strictly speaking the
         present case would fall within the parameters
         visualised in Bachan Singh [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980
         SCC (Cri) 580] and Machhi Singh [(1983) 3 SCC 470 :</blockquote>
<p id="p_590">         1983 SCC (Cri) 681] cases. The diabolical nature of the
         crime and the murder of helpless individuals committed
         with traditional weapons with extreme cruelty and
         premeditation is exacerbated by the fact that Maya Kaur
         and Nirmal Kaur had come upstairs and recovered the
         jewellery and clothes from Rajvinder Kaur just before
         the actual murders.‖
                           (Emphasis supplied)

         The Supreme Court, therefore, examined beyond the caste
basis for the crime and then concluded that the crime fell in the
'rarest of rare' category. The premeditation, the manner in which it
was committed, the nature of weapons used, the helpless state of
the victims, the extreme cruelty perpetrated were some of the
circumstances which persuaded the court to so conclude.
</p><p id="p_591">         Despite these observations, in para 31, the court noted the
time which had gone since the death sentence had been awarded to
four of the convicts by the trial court which weighed with it. The

now face', the Supreme Court was ‗not inclined to reverse the life
sentences awarded by the High Court and to reimpose the death
penalty on the accused'.

         the matter. The nation is passing through a crucial
         transitional period in our history, and this Court cannot

         violence, or violence is actually committed on them. In
         our opinion, such acts of violence or threats or
         harassment are wholly illegal and those who commit
         them must be severely punished. This is a free and
         democratic country, and once a person becomes a major

         will see to it that if any boy or girl who is a major
         undergoes inter-caste or inter-religious marriage with a
         woman or man who is a major, the couple is not
         harassed by anyone nor subjected to threats or acts of
         violence, and anyone who gives such threats or harasses
         or commits acts of violence either himself or at his
         instigation, is taken to task by instituting criminal

Harnamsingh Gujral v. State of Maharashtra</a>.            In this case, the
appellant burnt his wife and three grown up children in his flat by
splashing petrol on them. A quarrel between the appellant and his
wife was heard by some persons sleeping outside prior to the fire in
the house between 4:00 A.M. to 4:30 A.M. The appellant and his

 the incident in another city and a large amount of cash (more than
Rs.7,00,000/-) and other belongings were found on him at the time
of his arrest. It was these facts which indicated that the appellant
had made necessary preparation to flee. The bucket with which
petrol was splashed upon the victims was also recovered at
appellant's instance and his alibi was found incredible. The court
considered the entire jurisprudence on award of death sentences.
In para 91, the court observed that "a person like the appellant who
instead of doing his duty of protecting his family kills them in such
a cruel and barbaric manner cannot be reformed or rehabilitated.
The balance sheet is heavily against him and accordingly we
uphold the death sentence awarded to him".
</p><p id="p_600">         In para 93, the court reiterated the enunciation of principles
in its prior judicial precedent as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_133">         ―93. In our opinion a distinction has to be drawn
         between ordinary murders and murders which are
         gruesome, ghastly or horrendous. While life sentence
         should be given in the former, the latter belongs to the
         category of the rarest of rare cases, and hence death
         sentence should be given. This distinction has been
         clarified by a recent judgment of my learned brother
         Hon'ble C.K. Prasad, J. in <a href="/doc/625626/" id="a_766">Mohd. Mannan v.State of
         Bihar</a> [(2011) 5 SCC 317 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 626] ,

         23-24)
                ―23. It is trite that death sentence can be inflicted
                only in a case which comes within the category of
                the rarest of rare cases but there is no hard-and-
                fast rule and parameter to decide this vexed issue.</blockquote>
<p id="p_601">                This Court had the occasion to consider the cases
                which can be termed as the rarest of rare cases


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 187
                   and although certain comprehensive guidelines
                  have been laid to adjudge this issue but no hard-
                  and-fast formula of universal application has been
                  laid down in this regard. Crimes are committed in
                  so different and distinct circumstances that it is
                  impossible to lay down comprehensive
                  guidelines to decide this issue. Nevertheless it is
                  widely accepted that in deciding this question the
                  number of persons killed is not decisive.
</p><p id="p_602">                  24. Further, the crime being brutal and heinous
                  itself does not turn the scale towards the death
                  sentence. When the crime is committed in an
                  extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting
                  or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and
                  extreme indignation of the community and when
                  collective conscience of the community is
                  petrified, one has to lean towards the death
                  sentence. But this is not the end. If these factors
                  are present the court has to see as to whether the
                  accused is a menace to the society and would
                  continue to be so, threatening its peaceful and
                  harmonious coexistence. The court has to
                  further enquire and believe that the accused
                  condemned cannot be reformed or rehabilitated
                  and shall continue with the criminal acts. In this
                  way a balance sheet is to be prepared while
                  considering the imposition of penalty of death of
                  aggravating and mitigating circumstances and a
                  just balance is to be struck. So long the death
                  sentence is provided in the statute and when
                  collective conscience of the community is
                  petrified, it is expected that the holders of
                  judicial power do not stammer dehors their
                  personal opinion and inflict death penalty.
                  These are the broad guidelines which this Court
                  had laid down for imposition of the death
                  penalty.‖

         wipes out his entire family, then this will come in the
         category of the ―rarest of rare cases‖ deserving death

 The Supreme Court has reiterated the recommendation in
precedents that amongst others, honour killings, where the motive
for killing tantamounts to reinforcing caste structures in society,
falls in the category of ―rarest of rare cases‖ which deserves the
ultimate sentence i.e. of death penalty.
</p><p id="p_606">247. Mr. Sumeet Verma has vehemently urged that the judgment
of the Supreme Court in (2011) 6 SCC 396, <a href="/doc/1422914/" id="a_770">Bhagwan Dass v.
State (NCT of Delhi</a>) does not relate to imposition of a death
sentence.        According to learned counsel, this judgment is per
incuriam for the reason that it ignores the Constitutional Bench
pronouncement in Bachan Singh. Learned counsel would also
submit that this pronouncement ought not to be considered by this
court for the reason that it is a solitary case which has not been
relied upon in any subsequent pronouncements of the Supreme
Court except the above reference in Ajitsingh Harnamsingh
Gujral.
</p><p id="p_607">248. In Bhagwan Dass, the case of the prosecution was that the
appellant was very annoyed with his daughter, who had left her
husband Raju and was living in an incestuous relationship with her
uncle, Sriniwas. This had infuriated the appellant as he believed
that his daughter Seema's conduct had dishonoured his family.
The appellant therefore, strangulated her with an electric wire. The
court reiterated the observations in para 8 of Arumugam Servai as
well as those in para 9 of Lata Singh. We set out hereunder the
observations of the court in para 28 of the pronouncement which

 we propose to deal with in some detail at a later stage in this
pronouncement:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_137">         ―28. Before parting with this case we would like to state
         that ―honour‖ killings have become commonplace in
         many parts of the country, particularly in Haryana,
         western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Often young
         couples who fall in love have to seek shelter in the
         police lines or protection homes, to avoid the wrath of
         kangaroo courts. We have held in Lata Singh
         case [(2006) 5 SCC 475 : (2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 478] that
         there is nothing ―honourable‖ in ―honour‖ killings, and
         they are nothing but barbaric and brutal murders by
         bigoted persons with feudal minds. In our opinion
         honour killings, for whatever reason, come within the
         category of the rarest of rare cases deserving death
         punishment. It is time to stamp out these barbaric,
         feudal practices which are a slur on our nation. This is
         necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous,
         uncivilised behaviour. All persons who are planning to
         perpetrate ―honour‖ killings should know that the
         gallows await them.‖
                           (Emphasis supplied)

         The Supreme Court thus upheld the conviction of the
appellant as well as the death sentence imposed on him. We find
that the Supreme Court in fact directed that the copy of the
judgment be sent to the Registrar General/Registrars of all High
Courts for circulation to all judges as well as copies of the same to
all Sessions Judges/Additional Sessions Judges in States as well as
the Union Territories apart from Chief Secretaries, Home
Secretaries and police authorities.

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_772">Section 302</a> of the IPC which was upheld by the court.                No
principle of law is either discussed or laid down in this case.
</p><p id="p_611">251. We must also deal with Mr. Sumeet Verma's arguments that
in para 52 of Sangeet, the court said that there must be no
standardization/categorization of crimes. It is argued that to hold
that a death sentence must be imposed in every case involving an
honour killing is therefore, impermissible.
</p><p id="p_612">252. So far as the murder which is referred to as an honour killing
is concerned, it refers to the motive for the offence. The offence
emanates from a perverted bias of the offender/convict against
persons of a particular caste, community or economic strata




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                    pg. 192
 resulting in a heinous crime. The bias obviously is in favour of the
particular caste or group to which the convict belongs.
</p><p id="p_613">253. We may note that standardization or categorization of crimes
for which death sentence must be mandatorily imposed is
unconstitutional and legally impermissible for the reason that it
absolutely excludes the judicial discretion in sentencing for such
crimes. Statutory provisions mandating the death sentence have
been struck down as unconstitutional being violative of Articles 14
and 21 of the Constitution by the Constitution Bench
pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (1983) 2 SCC
277, <a href="/doc/590378/" id="a_773">Mithu v. State of Punjab</a> and the recent decision reported at
(2012) 3 SCC 346, <a href="/doc/166513655/" id="a_774">State of Punjab v. Dalbir Singh</a>. There can be
no dispute that the proposition that no standardization or
categorization of offences inviting death penalty mandatorily is
constitutionally permissible.
</p><p id="p_614">254. We have noted above that a misplaced sense of 'honour' in a
caste structure is the motive in the crime labelled as an 'honour
killing'. Therefore, the question which arises is as to what is the
relevance of this motive for commission of murder so far as
sentencing is concerned?
</p><p id="p_615">255. In Machhi Singh, reprisal was motive for commission of the
crime. A feud between two families resulted in murders in which
17 lives (including men, women and children related to one Amar
Singh and Piaro Bai) were tragically lost in a course of series of
five incidents occurred in quick succession in five different villages
in the vicinity of each other, in Punjab, on the night intervening


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 193
 12th/13th August, 1977.               The murderers, Machhi Singh and his
eleven companions, close                       relatives and   associates were
prosecuted in the imposition of death sentence on Machhi Singh.
</p><p id="p_616">256. Amongst the circumstances which so shock the collective
conscience of the community that it would expect holders of the
judicial power centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of their
personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining
death penalty, several circumstances have been enumerated
including ―motive for commission of murder‖. In para 34 of the
judgment, the circumstance that a ―murder is committed for a
motive which evince total depravity and meanness‖ is noted which
is illustrated when the crime is ―a cold-blooded murder‖...... ―with
a deliberate design‖ ....... in order to ―gain control over a person
under the control of the murderer or vis-a-vis whom the murderer
is in a dominating position or in a position of trust‖.
</p><p id="p_617">257. Another circumstance to so shock the collective conscience
of the community is the ―anti-social or socially abhorrent nature
of the crime‖. Under this heading, murders of a scheduled caste or
minority community committed in circumstances which arouse
social wrath as well as cases of bride burning and what are known
as dowry death have been cited. The court has also referred to
―magnitude of crime‖ as such a circumstance enumerating multiple
murders, say of large number of persons of a particular caste or
community. We also find that in Machhi Singh, reference is made
to ―personality of victim of the murder‖ which is illustrated by the




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                           pg. 194
 victim of a murder being one who ―has not provided even an
excuse, much less a provocation, for the murder‖.
</p><p id="p_618">258. We have extracted the above opinion of the Supreme Court
about the divisive effect of the caste system and that it deserves to
be destroyed at the earliest. The Supreme Court has noted that
intercaste marriages were in fact in national interest as they would
have the effect of removing caste barriers leading to social
integration. It is therefore, apparent that honour killings arise out
of deep sense of caste affiliations and indubitably reinforce such
divisions in social structures. Such crimes not only violate the
constitutional mandate but also impinge on <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_775">Article 21</a> rights of two
individuals to choose their life partners. It is in this background,
that the Supreme Court has considered the caste basis of the honour
killing as motivating the crime to be an important circumstance for
imposing the harsh punishment of death sentence. Such an offence
has been labelled as an ―act of barbarism and feudal mentality‖.
</p><p id="p_619">259. The judicial precedents noted above have considered all
relevant factors including the brutality of the crime, etc. including
its motive being to prevent intercaste alliance or to stamp out an
intercaste relationship before concluding whether the crime fell
within the rarest of rare category in terms of the Constitution
Bench pronouncements. We therefore, find no illegality in
considering a murder motivated by the consideration that murdered
person/persons must be eliminated because they belong/(do not
belong) to a particular caste is an important circumstance for

category.

          disposal of a particular case by the subordinate court
         prompt remedial action on the part of the High Court for
         the ultimate social good of the community, even though
         the State may be slow or silent in preferring an
         appeal provided for under the new Code. The High
         Court in a given case of public importance e.g. in now
         too familiar cases of food adulteration, reacts to public
         concern over the problem and may act suo motu on
         perusal of newspaper reports disclosing imposition of
         grossly inadequate sentence upon such offenders. This
         position was true and extant in the old Code of 1898 and
         this salutary power has not been denied by Parliament
         under the new Code by rearrangement of the sections. It
         is true the new Code has expressly given a right to the
         State under <a href="/doc/195753/" id="a_803">Section 377</a> CrPC to appeal against
         inadequacy of sentence which was not there under the

         is an appropriate case has to be left to the discretion of

         Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, has abolished the
         High Court's power of enhancement of sentence by
         exercising revisional jurisdiction, suo motu. The
         provision for appeal against inadequacy of sentence by
         the State Government or the Central Government does
         not lead to such a conclusion. The High Court's power of
         enhancement of sentence, in an appropriate case, by
         exercising suo motu power of revision is still extant

         'by itself' call for the record of proceedings of any
         inferior criminal court under its jurisdiction. The
         provision of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_832">Section 401(4)</a> is a bar to a party, who does
         not appeal, when appeal lies, but applies in revision.
         Such a legal bar under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_833">Section 401(4)</a> does not stand in
         the way of the High Court's exercise of power of

High Court can do so only after issuing a specific show cause

court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_148">         ―10. ...The question then is what procedure does the
         judge follow for determining the punishment to be
         imposed in each case to fit the crime?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_149">         ... The requirement of hearing the accused is intended to
         satisfy the rule of natural justice. ...To assist the court in
         determining the correct sentence to be imposed the
         legislature introduced sub-section (2) to <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_843">Section 235</a>.</blockquote>
<p id="p_657">         The said provision therefore satisfies a dual purpose; it
         satisfies the rule of natural justice by according to the
         accused an opportunity of being heard on the question

         choose the sentence to be awarded. Since the provision
         is intended to give the accused an opportunity to place
         before the court all the relevant material having a
         bearing on the question of sentence there can be no
         doubt that the provision is salutary and must be strictly
         followed. It is clearly mandatory and should not be
         treated as a mere formality. ....We think as a general

         upon both the prosecution as well as the defence to
         place the relevant material bearing on the question of
         sentence before it and thereafter pronounce the
         sentence to be imposed on the offender. xxx‖

         accused is entitled to an opportunity to adduce
         evidence and if need be the case is to be adjourned to
         another date. It is illegal to convict, an accused and to
         impose sentence on the same day. It is true as
         contended for the State that under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_846">Section 309</a>, third
         proviso brought by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_847">Amendment Act</a>, 1978 that no

         be heard on the question of sentence it is a valuable

         given an opportunity to adduce evidence on the nature
         of the sentence. The hearing may be on the same day if
         the parties are ready or be adjourned to a next date but
         once the court after giving opportunity propose to
         impose appropriate sentence again there is no need to

         Sessions Judge needed to adjourn the case under
         <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_849">Section 235(2)</a> to next date but in the High Court the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_152">         ―3. xxx The reason is that a proper sentence is the

         aggravating--of the offence, the prior criminal record',
         if any, of the offender, the age of the offender, the
         record of the offender as to employment, the
         background of the offender with reference to
         education, home life, society and social adjustment,
         the emotional and mental condition of the offender,
         the prospects for the rehabilitation of the offender, the
         possibility of return of the offender to a normal life in
         the community, the possibility of treatment or training
         of the offender, the possibility that the sentence may
         serve as a deterrent to crime by the offender or by
         others and the current community need, if any, for
         such a deterrent in respect to the particular type of
         offence. These are factors which have to be taken into
         account by the court in deciding upon the appropriate
         sentence, and there- fore, the legislature felt that, for this
         purpose, a separate stage should be provided after
         conviction when the court can bear the accused in
         regard to these factors bearing on sentence and then
         pass proper sentence on the accused. Hence the new

         the court in order to enable the court to pass an
         appropriate sentence. This material may be placed
         before the court by means of affidavits, but if either
         party disputes the correctness or veracity of the
         material sought to be produced by the other, an
         opportunity would have to be given to the party
         concerned to lead evidence for the purpose of bringing
         such material on record. The hearing on the question
         of sentence, would be rendered devoid of all meaning
         and content and it would become an idle formality, if it
         were confined merely to hearing oral submissions

         opportunity for leading "evidence on the question" of

         and if they are contested by either side, then to

         cannot be totally brushed aside. The principle of just

          proportionality allows a significant discretion to the
         Judge but the same has to be guided by certain
         principles. In certain cases, the nature of culpability,
         the antecedents of the accused, the factum of age, the
         potentiality of the convict to become a criminal in
         future, capability of his reformation and to lead an
         acceptable life in the prevalent milieu, the effect-
         propensity to become a social threat or nuisance, and
         sometimes lapse of time in the commission of the
         crime and his conduct in the interregnum bearing in
         mind the nature of the offence, the relationship between
         the parties and attractability of the doctrine of

         mainstream may be the guiding factors. Needless to

         be dependant on the facts of the case and rationalized
         judicial discretion. Neither the personal perception of a
         Judge nor self-adhered moralistic vision nor
         hypothetical apprehensions should be allowed to have
         any play. For every offence, a drastic measure cannot be
         thought of. Similarly, an offender cannot be allowed to
         be treated with leniency solely on the ground of
         discretion vested in a Court. The real requisite is to
         weigh the circumstances in which the crime has been
         committed and other concomitant factors which we
         have indicated hereinbefore and also have been stated in
         a number of pronouncements by this Court. On such
         touchstone, the sentences are to be imposed. The
         discretion should not be in the realm of fancy. It should
         be embedded in the conceptual essence of just
         punishment.</blockquote>

         has conferred discretion on the Judge who is guided by
         certain rational parameters, regard been had to the
         factual scenario of the case. In certain spheres the
         legislature has not conferred that discretion and in
         such circumstances, the discretion is conditional. In
         respect of certain offences, sentence can be reduced by
         giving adequate special reasons. The special reasons
         have to rest on real special circumstances. Hence, the
         duty of Court in such situations becomes a complex
         one. The same has to be performed with due reverence

         oversee comprehensive compliance with both the

         nature, motive and impact of crime, culpability of

         relevant factor. For instance, extent of reliance on
         circumstantial evidence or child witness plays an
         important role in the sentencing analysis. But what is
         sorely lacking, in most capital sentencing cases, is
         information relating to characteristics and socio-
         economic background of the offender. This issue was
         also raised in the 48th Report of the Law Commission.

v. State of M.P</a>. wherein the court has considered the impact of
previous criminal record of the accused on sentencing. In this case,
Birju was involved in 24 criminal cases of which three were filed
for the offence of murder. The court awarded sentence of 20 years
rigorous imprisonment without remission over the period he had
already undergone. It was observed that the motive for committing
the murder in the case was for getting money to consume liquor for
which a child of one year became casualty. The trial court had
imposed death sentence upon the appellant which was confirmed
by the High Court holding that there was no probability that the
accused would not commit the act of violence in future and his
presence would be a continuing threat to the society. The High
Court had also taken a view that there was no possibility of
reformation or rehabilitation of the accused (para 4). So far as
prior record of implication in criminal cases is concerned, in para
15, the court observed as follows:

</blockquote><p id="p_670">275. In para 17 of Birju, the court has emphasized that prior
record of conviction in heinous crimes like murder, rape, armed
docoity etc. will be a relevant factor but that conviction should
have attained finality so as to treat it as aggravating circumstance
for awarding death sentence. Paras 17, 18 and 19 of the judgment
shed light on the issue under consideration and read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_163">         "17. We have in Shankar Kisanrao Khade case [<a href="/doc/79577238/" id="a_869">Shankar

         546 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 402] dealt with the question as
         to whether the previous criminal record of the accused
         would be an aggravating circumstance to be taken note
         of while awarding death sentence and held that the mere
         pendency of few criminal cases, as such, is not an
         aggravating circumstance to be taken note of while
         awarding death sentence, since the accused is not found
         guilty and convicted in those cases. In the instant case, it
         was stated, that the accused was involved in 24 criminal
         cases, out of which three were registered against the
         accused for murder and two cases of attempting to
         commit murder and, in all those cases, the accused was
         charge-sheeted for trial before the court of law. No
         materials have been produced before us to show that the
         accused stood convicted in any of those cases. The
         accused has only been charge-sheeted and not
         convicted, hence, that factor is not a relevant factor to be
         taken note of while applying the R-R test so as to award
         capital punishment. Maybe, in a given case, the

          pendency of large number of criminal cases against the
         accused person might be a factor which could be taken
         note of in awarding a sentence but, in any case, not a

         longer period of incarceration.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_164">         18. We also notice, while laying down various criteria for
         determining the aggravating circumstances, two aspects,

         Punjab</a> [(1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri)

         (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 30] , are (1) the offences relating to
         the commission of heinous crime like murder, rape,
         armed dacoity, kidnapping, etc. by the accused with a
         prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences
         committed by the person having a substantial history of
         serious assaults and criminal conviction; and (2) the
         offence was committed while the offender was engaged
         in the commission of another serious offence. The first
         criterion may be a relevant factor while applying the R-R
         test, provided the offences relating to heinous crimes like
         murder, rape, dacoity, etc. have ended in conviction.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_165">         19. We may first examine whether ―substantial history
         of serious assaults and criminal conviction‖ is an
         aggravating circumstance when the court is dealing with
         the offences relating to the heinous crimes like murder,
         rape, armed dacoity, etc. Prior record of the conviction,
         in our view, will be a relevant factor, but that conviction
         should have attained finality so as to treat it as
         aggravating circumstance for awarding death sentence.</blockquote>
<p id="p_671">         The second aspect deals with a situation where an

          offence was committed, while the offender was engaged
         in the commission of another serious offence. This is a
         situation where the accused is engaged in the commission
         of another serious offence which has not ended in

</p><p id="p_672">                              (Emphasis by us)

         Therefore, pendency of other criminal cases against a
convict is a relevant factor for sentencing but not for awarding the
death sentence. It is conviction in serious offences which has
attained finality which would be treated as an aggravating
circumstance for awarding capital punishment.

</p><p id="p_675">277. After an elaborate discussion, the court provided the
following framework for pre-sentencing in Bariyar :
</p>
<p id="p_676">(i)      The trial court; high court as well as the Supreme Court have
         the same powers and responsibilities. (para 69)
</p><p id="p_677">(ii)     Aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case before
         the sentencing court should first be identified.
</p><p id="p_678">(iii)    The second step would be to compare the aggravating and
         mitigating circumstances in the case before the court with a
         pool of comparable cases. This would ensure that the court
         considers similarly placed cases together. In this exercise,
         similarity with respect to gravity of the crime, nature of the
         crime, and the motive of the offender might be considered.
         On this basis, the sentencing court might be able to identify
         how a similar case has been dealt with by the Supreme Court
         in a previous instance.
</p><p id="p_679">(iv)     The court further held that the weight that the sentencing
         court gives to each individual aggravating or mitigating
         factor might vary from case to case.           However, it is
         imperative that the sentencing court provide legal reasons for


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          the weight that it has accorded to each such aggravating or
         mitigating factor. The court opined that this exercise may
         point out excessiveness, and at the same time reduce
         arbitrariness in sentencing. The court further noted that this
         exercise should definitely be undertaken in cases where the
         sentencing court opts to impose the death sentence on the
         convicted person.
</p><p id="p_680">(v)      Though Bariyar involves a death sentence, however, the
         principles laid down (or reiterated) by the court with regard
         to nature of the pre-sentencing hearing, the considerations
         which must weigh as well as the responsibility of the trial
         courts and high courts would apply to pre-sentencing hearing
         in other offences and sentences as well.
</p><p id="p_681">278. An essential requirement laid down in all the judgments
considering imposition of the death penalty is the requirement of
being satisfied about the probability that the accused would not
commit criminal acts of violence and the probability that the
accused could not be reformed and rehabilitated. A difference of
opinion arose between the two learned judges on the award of
death penalty in the consideration which was reported at (2009) 5
SCC 740, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (1) v. State of
Gujarat. The matter was thereafter taken up for consideration by a
three Judge Bench which decision was reported at (2011) 2 SCC
764, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) v. State of Gujarat
wherein the court favoured the commutation. Most important is

convict would be likely to indulge in criminal activity or whether
there is any possibility of his being reformed or rehabilitated. The

In para 69, the court had noted certain points for guidance of the
probation officer about the manner in which he should go for his
task of preparing and presenting his report and in para 70 had
pointed out the handbook on the ―Prevention of Recidivism and
Social Integration of Offenders‖ brought out by United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crimes in December, 2012 as well as other
documents which would be useful in ascertaining the recent trend
in assessment of an offender's risk of re-offending and the "risk-
needs-responsivity framework" which helps such evaluation.

the State in the trial as well as the court to ensure that the State
places materials before the trial court regarding the probability that
the convict could be reformed and rehabilitated and that he would
not commit criminal acts. However, the State may, as in most
cases, fail to do so. What is the court required to do? This issue
has been deliberated upon by the Supreme Court in Birju wherein
guidance on the manner in which the court may obtain additional
material relevant for sentencing is given. In this case, the Supreme
Court has made it mandatory for the courts to call for a report from
the probationary officer in the following terms wherein the court

         responsible. Sentencing process should be so complied
         with, that enough information is generated to
         objectively inform the selection of penalty. The

         of sentence of death ―depends a good deal on the
         personal predilection of the Judges constituting the

         are no strict guidelines. But a sentencing procedure is

         remand to that Court for elaboration upon its conclusion
         in awarding the death sentence for the reason that while
         exercising appellate jurisdiction, the superior Court
         could have dealt into such reasons. Further the

         has been ignored. However, we find that there is no
         additional material on record placed by the State in the

 X.       Concerns for the victims - award of compensation to heal
         and as a method of reconciling victim to the offender
         The discussion on this subject is being considered under the

         the convict, not ancillary to it.

Iyer, J. declared that while "social responsibility of the criminal to
restore the loss or heal the injury is part of the punitive exercise
but the length of the prison term is no reparation to the crippled or
bereaved but is futility compounded with cruelty. Victimology...
must find fulfilment, not through barbarity but by compulsory
recoupment by the wrongdoer of the damage inflicted not by giving
more pain to the offender, but by lessening the loss of the forlorn".

in its judgment reported at (1978) 4 SCC 111, <a href="/doc/320833/" id="a_914">Sarwan Singh &amp;
Ors. v. State of Punjab</a> when it extracted the following statement
of the Joint Select Committee:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_191">         ―10. The law which enables the Court to direct
         compensation to be paid to the dependants is found in
         <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_915">Section 357</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
         (Act 2 of 1974). The corresponding provision in the 1898
         Code was <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_916">Section 545</a>. <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_917">Section 545</a> of Code of Criminal
         Procedure, 1898 (Act 5 of 1898) was amended by Act 18
         of 1923 and by Act 26 of 1955. The amendment which is
         relevant for the purpose of our discussion is 545(1)(bb)
         which, for the first time inserted by Act 26 of 1955. By
         this amendment the court is enabled to direct the accused,
         who caused the death of another person, to pay
         compensation to the persons who are, under the <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_918">Fatal
         Accidents Act</a>, entitled to recover damages from the
         persons sentenced, for the loss resulting to them from
         such death. In introducing the amendment, the Joint
         Select Committee stated ―when death has been caused
         to a person, it is but proper that his heirs and
         dependants should be compensated, in suitable cases,
         for the loss resulting to them from such death, by the
         person who was responsible for it. The Committee
         proceeded to state that though <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_919">Section 545</a> of the Code as
         amended in 1923 was intended to cover such cases, the
         intention was not however very clearly brought out and
         therefore in order to focus the attention of the courts on
         this aspect of the question, the Committee have amended
         <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_920">Section 545</a> and it has been made clear that a fine may

          form a part of any sentence including a sentence of
         death and it has also been provided that the persons who
         are entitled under the <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_921">Fatal Accidents Act</a>, 1855, to
         recover damages from the person sentenced may be
         compensated out of the fine imposed. It also expressed its
         full agreement with the suggestion that at the time of
         awarding judgment in a case where death has resulted
         from homicide, the court should award compensation to
         the heirs of the deceased. The Committee felt that this
         will result in settling the claim once for all by doing away
         with the need for a further claim in a civil court, and
         avoid needless worry and expense to both sides. The
         Committee further agreed that in cases where the death is
         the result of negligence of the offender, appropriate
         compensation should be awarded to the heirs. By the
         introduction of clause (bb) to <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_922">Section 545(1)</a>, the
         intention of the legislature was made clear that, in
         suitable cases, the heirs and dependants should be
         compensated for the loss that resulted to them from the
         death, from a person who was responsible for it. The
         view was also expressed that the court should award
         compensation to the heir of the deceased so that their
         claims would be settled finally. This object is sought to
         be given effect to by <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_923">Section 357</a> of the new Code (Act 2
         of 1974). xxx         xxx          xxx‖

compensation is specifically conferred in inter alia the following
statutory provisions:

judgment, order that the whole or any part of the recovered fine to

legislation contemplates a second contingency, that is, when a

a part. This is provided for under Sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_933">Section 357</a> of

         practice is the plight of the victims. It is a recent trend in
         the sentencing policy to listen to the wailings of the
         victims. Rehabilitation of the prisoner need not be by
         closing the eyes towards the suffering victims of the
         offence. A glimpse at the field of victimology reveals
         two types of victims. The first type consists of direct
         victims, i.e., those who are alive and suffering on
         account of the harm inflicted by the prisoner while
         committing the crime. The second type comprises of
         indirect victims who are dependants of the direct victims
         of crimes who undergo sufferings due to deprivation of
         their breadwinner.

         criminal act of the convict. The victim is certainly
         entitled to reparation, restitution and safeguard of his

         not done to the victim of the crime. The subject of
         victimology is gaining ground while we are also
         concerned with the rights of the prisoners and prison

         in the criminal justice system. It is he who has suffered
         the most. His family is ruined particularly in case of
         death and other bodily injury. This is apart from the

         apply its mind to the question of awarding
         compensation in every criminal case. We say so because
         in the background and context in which it was
         introduced, the power to award compensation was
         intended to reassure the victim that he or she is not
         forgotten in the criminal justice system. The victim
         would remain forgotten in the criminal justice system if
         despite the legislature having gone so far as to enact
         specific provisions relating to victim compensation,
         courts choose to ignore the provisions altogether and do
         not even apply their mind to the question
         of compensation. It follows that unless <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_972">Section 357</a> is
         read to confer an obligation on the courts to apply their
         mind to the question of compensation, it would defeat

         tyranny at the hands of men with whom they, fortunately,
         under the Constitution enjoy equal status. Women also
         have the right to life and liberty; they also have the right
         to be respected and treated as equal citizens. Their
         honour and dignity cannot be touched or violated. They
         also have the right to lead an honourable and peaceful
         life. Women, in them, have many personalities combined.
         They are mother, daughter, sister and wife and not
         playthings for centre spreads in various magazines,
         periodicals or newspapers nor can they be exploited for
         obscene purposes. They must have the liberty, the
         freedom and, of course, independence to live the roles
         assigned to them by Nature so that the society may

         of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1007">Section 357</a> only provides for application of amount of
         fine which may be in respect of the entire amount or in
         respect of a part thereof. Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1008">Section 357</a>

         a way it seeks to achieve the same purpose. An amount
         of compensation can be directed to be recovered as a
         ―fine‖ but the legal fiction raised in relation to recovery
         of fine only, it is in that sense ―fine‖ stands on a higher
         footing than compensation awarded by the court.

guilty under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1016">Section 302</a> IPC. Appellants 1 and 2 were sentenced
to death while others were sentenced to life imprisonment.
Varying prison sentences were imposed for commission of other
offences.        The death sentences were put up for confirmation.
Appeals challenging the convictions and sentences were filed by
the appellants. The complainant filed a revision petition praying
for inter alia compensation. The High Court rejected the challenge
to the convictions, but did not agree with the imposition of the
death sentence as well as the guilt of the three more persons. It
was also concluded that this was a fit case for the exercise of its
jurisdiction under section 357 Crl. and directed each of the accused

precedents on the issue of the jurisdiction of the High Court in an
appeal to award compensation, even if no fine is imposed or vice

         in a somewhat different fact situation: (SCC pp. 669-70,

                ―11. In the present case, sentence of fine has also
                been imposed, as indicated in the earlier part of
                this judgment. Out of the fine, a sum of Rs 1000
                each had been ordered to be given to the three
                injured persons, namely, Dalip Singh, Amarjit
                Kaur and Gurmeet Kaur. The balance amount is to
                go to the legal heirs of Jagjit Singh. We had heard
                the learned counsel for both parties on this aspect.

                brother in the incident and now she is alone and
                would have become of marriageable age or may
                have to start some work of her own. She would
                need some money. In case she cannot be
                compensated, the amount of fine may be enhanced

                has, however, submitted that out of seven acres of
                land belonging to his father, the same has been
                divided into three equal shares and some of it is
                also under mortgage and he has got two daughters
                and a son and his wife. He has also submitted that

                met Gurmeet Kaur and his wife also keeps on
                going to meet her. Their relations are normal and

</p><p id="p_815">         The court notes that if a person who caused injury by
negligence or vicariously is made to pay compensation (for
instance in motor accident cases), then a person who causes injury
with mens rea must compensate the victim. In this regard, in para
11 of <a href="/doc/320833/" id="a_1061">Sarwan Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab</a>, the court is further
stated thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_233">         ―10. xxx xxx xxx <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1062">Section 357</a> (3) provides that
         when a court imposes a sentence, of which fine does not
         form a part, the Court may, when passing judgment,
         order the accused person to pay, by way of
         compensation, such amount, as may be specified in the
         order, to the person who has suffered any loss or injury
         by reason of the act for which the accused person has
         been so sentenced. The object of the section therefore, is
         to provide compensation payable to the persons who are
         entitled to recover damage from the person sentenced
         even though fine does not form part of the sentence.</blockquote>
<p id="p_816">         Though <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1063">Section 545</a> enabled the court only to pay
         compensation out of the fine that would be imposed
         under the law, by <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1064">Section 357(3)</a> when a Court imposes a
         sentence, of which fine does not form a part, the Court
         may direct the accused to pay compensation. In
         awarding compensation it is necessary for the court to
         decide whether the case is a fit one in which
         compensation has to be awarded. If it is found that
         compensation should be paid, then the capacity of the
         accused to pay a compensation has to be determined. In
         directing compensation, the object is to collect the fine
         and pay it to the person who has suffered the loss. The
         purpose will not be served if the accused is not able to
         pay the fine or compensation for, imposing a default

          sentence for non-payment of fine would not achieve the
         object. If the accused is in a position to pay the
         compensation to the injured or his dependents to which
         they are entitled to, there could be no reason for the
         court not directing such compensation. When a person,
         who caused injury due to negligence or is made
         vicariously liable is bound to pay compensation it is
         only appropriate to direct payment by the accused who
         is guilty of causing an injury with the necessary mens
         rea to pay compensation for the person who has suffered
         injury."
</p>
<p id="p_817">323. We find that in Sarwan Singh, the court cautioned
against first ascertaining the compensation and then imposing
an equivalent fine. In para 11, the Supreme Court further stated
the relevant circumstances which must be taken into
consideration in the following terms :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_234">         "11. In awarding compensation as cautioned by this
         Court in <a href="/doc/662559/" id="a_1065">Palianappa Gounder v. State of T.N</a>. [(1977) 2
         SCC 634 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 397 : (1977) 3 SCR 132] the
         Court should not first consider what compensation
         ought to be awarded to the heirs of the deceased and
         then impose a fine which is higher than the
         compensation. It is the duty of the court to take into
         account the nature of the crime, the injury suffered, the
         justness of the claim for compensation, the capacity of
         the accused to pay and other relevant circumstances in
         fixing the amount of fine or compensation. After
         consideration of all the facts of the case, we feel that in
         addition to the sentence of 5 years rigorous
         imprisonment, a fine of Rs 3500 on each of the accused
         under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_1066">Section 304(1)</a> IPC should be imposed. The fine
         will be paid as compensation to the widow of the
         deceased, Mewa Singh. In default of payment of fine, the

          accused will undergo further simple imprisonment for 6
         months.‖
                          (Emphasis supplied)

         It is therefore, well settled that the courts must conduct an
enquiry, even a summary one into, fitness of the case for award of
fine and compensation, persons entitled to compensation, paying
capacity of the accused and any other relevant factor.
</blockquote><p id="p_818">337. We have till here examined the procedure which courts
would be required to follow for awarding compensation under
<a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1067">Section 357</a> Cr.P.C. Having found the persons who are entitled to
compensation, thereafter having ascertained the means and paying
capacity of the defendants, it is necessary to determine
quantification of compensation payable to them as would be just
and adequate. The legislation gives no guidance at all on this
question as well.
</p><p id="p_819">338. Let us briefly examine some judicial precedents placed
before us regarding quantum of compensation. In para 11, the
judgment reported at (1988) 4 SCC 551 <a href="/doc/212245/" id="a_1068">Hari Singh v. Sukhbir
Singh</a>, the Supreme Court also stated that the payment by way
of compensation must, however, be reasonable; what is
reasonable, may depend upon the facts and circumstances of
each case. No hard and fast rule can therefore be laid.
</p><p id="p_820">339. We may also refer to the pronouncements of the Supreme
Court reported at (1995) 6 SCC 593, <a href="/doc/127827057/" id="a_1069">Baldev Singh v. State of
Punjab</a>. In para 17, for the purposes of sentencing, the court took
into consideration the circumstances that the arms possessed by the

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 267
 accused as not being inherently dangerous to infer their intention
was to cause death or that the accused had knowledge that by
inflicting the injuries as was done, death was likely to be caused.
The court also noted that the appellants had inflicted injuries only
on the thigh and at the back and that there was no evidence or
finding as to who caused the fatal injuries which resulted in the
death of Balbir Singh; that the incident happened almost 11 years
ago as well as the fact that the injuries inflicted on the thigh of
Amrik Singh resulting in the death of the victim by the appellant
were not proved to be serious or fatal and that the incident arose
out of a property dispute. In these circumstances, the Supreme
Court observed that the widow and children of the deceased, Balbir
Singh are the persons to suffer and they should not be forgotten
and that by merely maintaining the sentence of imprisonment on
the accused, the victim or his heirs are not benefitted. Observing
the near relationship of the accused and the victim as well as the
fact that the appellants were in a position to pay, the court was of
the view that it was a fit case in which <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1070">Section 357(3)</a> of the
Cr.P.C. could be invoked and a just and reasonable compensation
given to the family of the deceased. The court accordingly directed
the appellants to pay by way of compensation Rs.35,000/- each to
the widow of the deceased and the children within three months of
the date of order failing which they would be entitled to recover the
amount as if the direction to pay compensation was a decree passed
against them by the court. In case, the appellants did not pay, the

 appellants were liable to undergo the remainder of the sentence
awarded by the trial court.
</p><p id="p_821">340. We have noted above the statutory position whereunder no
outer limit is prescribed for award of compensation. In para 68 of
(2007) 6 SCC 528, <a href="/doc/795674/" id="a_1071">Dilip S. Dahanukar v. Kotak Mahindra Co</a>.
the Supreme Court has stated that the very fact that the Parliament
did not think it fit to put a ceiling in regard to the amount of
compensation leviable upon an accused, the discretionary
jurisdiction thereto must be exercised judicially. The observations
of the Supreme Court throw valuable light on the issue deserve to
be extracted in extenso and read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_235">         "39. If a fine is to be imposed under the Act, the amount
         of which in the opinion of Parliament would be more
         than sufficient to compensate the complainant; can it be
         said, that an unreasonable amount should be directed to
         be paid by the court while exercising its power under
         sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1072">Section 357</a>? The answer thereto must
         be rendered in the negative. Sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1073">Section
         357</a> also provides for some guidelines. Ordinarily, it
         should be lesser than the amount which can be granted
         by a civil court upon appreciation of the evidence
         brought before it for losses which might have
         reasonably been suffered by the plaintiff. Jurisdiction of
         the civil court, in this behalf, for realisation of the
         amount in question must also be borne in mind. A
         criminal case is not a substitution for a civil suit, far
         less execution of a decree which may be passed.‖

          It is therefore evident that the quantum of fine and
compensation rests on the facts and circumstances of each case. It
has to be rationally and reasonably fixed, not in the manner of a
civil suit does after appreciation of evidence.

court reiterated the principles laid down in <a href="/doc/320833/" id="a_1075">Sarwan Singh v. State
of Punjab</a> in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_236">         "14. However, in awarding compensation, it is necessary

         quantum of compensation is to be determined by taking
         into consideration the nature of the crime, the injury
         suffered and the capacity of the convict to pay
         compensation, etc. It goes without saying that the
         amount of compensation has to be reasonable, which
         the person concerned is able to pay. If the accused is not
         in a position to pay the compensation to the injured or his
         dependents to which they are held to be entitled to, there
         could be no reason for the court to direct such

<p id="p_824">         The amount of compensation sought to be imposed,

          an enquiry in this behalf even in a summary way, may be
         necessary. Some reasons, which may not be very
         elaborate, may also have to be assigned; the purpose
         being that whereas the power to impose fine is limited
         and direction to pay compensation can be made for one
         or the other factors enumerated out of the same; but

         the necessary material which it would evaluate to arrive
         at a fair and reasonable conclusion. It is also beyond
         dispute that the occasion to consider the question of

         regrettable that our courts do not exercise their salutary
         powers under this section as freely and liberally as could
         be desired. The section has, no doubt, its limitations. Its
         application depends, in the first instance, on whether the
         court considers a substantial fine proper punishment for
         the offence. In the more serious cases, the court may
         think that a heavy fine in addition to imprisonment for
         a long term is not justifiable, especially when the Public
         Prosecutor ignores the plight of the victim of the offence
         and does not press for compensation on his behalf.‖

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_248">               ―When compensation orders may possibly be
               made the most careful examination is required.
               Documents should be obtained and evidence
               either on affidavit or orally should be given. The
               proceedings should, if necessary, be adjourned,
               in order to arrive at the true state of the
               defendant's affairs.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_249">               Very often a compensation order is made and a
               very light sentence of imprisonment is imposed,
               because the court recognizes that if the defendant
               is to have an opportunity of paying the
               compensation he must be enabled to earn the
               money with which to do so. The result is therefore
               an extremely light sentence of imprisonment. If
               the compensation order turns out to be virtually
               worthless, the defendant has got off with a very
               light sentence of imprisonment as well as no
               order of compensation. In other words, generally
               speaking, he has got off with everything.‖

certainly result in miscarriage of justice. The submissions of Mr.

<p id="p_834">(vii) Quantification of compensation
</p><p id="p_835">351. We now come to the critical question - having ascertained
the paying capacity of the defendants, the particulars and
circumstances of the crime, the victims, dependants and all other
relevant information, how is the compensation to be awarded?
This question is not unique to <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1091">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. No fault
liability for compensation is awarded under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1092">Motor Vehicles
Act</a>. It is also to be found in the <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1093">Fatal Accidents Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_1094">Workmen
Compensation Act</a>. Public law remedies provide compensation for
violation of constitutional rights and even tortious actions of public
authorities are legally recognised.                    There are several judicial
precedents wherein compensation stands awarded therein. What
was the basis for the orders passed in these jurisdictions? Can we
draw on the experience of awarding compensation in these
jurisdictions and under these enactments for the purposes of
awarding compensation under <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1095">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C.?

custodial violations including torture, rape, death in police
custody/lock-up which not only infringed <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1098">Article 21</a> rights but also
basic human rights and struck a blow on the rule of law. The
Supreme Court issued mandatory directions in the shape of
'requirements' for compliance by police personnel while arresting
or detaining any person in addition to constitutional and statutory
safeguards as well as previous directions of the Supreme Court
which were to govern all enforcement agencies.         It was while
dealing with these issues that the Supreme Court in para 41,
observed as follows"

         established, therefore, cannot stop by giving a mere
         declaration. It must proceed further and give

no express provision in the Constitution of India for grant of
compensation for violation of a fundamental right to life and that
the court had judicially evolved a right to compensation in cases of
established unconstitutional deprivation of personal liberty or life.
</blockquote><p id="p_841">On the question of relegating a victim of a criminal offence for
compensation from the offender to a civil remedy, which is under
consideration by us, the following observations of the Supreme
Court, though rendered in the context of State responsibility for
infringements by public servants are illuminating and would guide
our consideration as well:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_254">         ―45. The old doctrine of only relegating the aggrieved to
         the remedies available in civil law limits the role of the
         courts too much, as the protector and custodian of the
         indefeasible rights of the citizens. The courts have the
         obligation to satisfy the social aspirations of the citizens
         because the courts and the law are for the people and
         expected to respond to their aspirations. A court of law
         cannot close its consciousness and aliveness to stark
         realities. Mere punishment of the offender cannot give
         much solace to the family of the victim -- civil action
         for damages is a long drawn and a cumbersome judicial
         process. Monetary compensation for redressal by the
         court finding the infringement of the indefeasible right
         to life of the citizen is, therefore, useful and at time
         perhaps the only effective remedy to apply balm to the

         who may have been the breadwinner of the family.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_256">         54. xxx xxx xxx the citizen must receive the amount of
         compensation from the State, which shall have the right
         to be indemnified by the wrongdoer. In the assessment of
         compensation, the emphasis has to be on the
         compensatory and not on punitive element. The
         objective is to apply balm to the wounds and not to
         punish the transgressor or the offender, as awarding
         appropriate punishment for the offence (irrespective of
         compensation) must be left to the criminal courts in
         which the offender is prosecuted, which the State, in
         law, is duty bound to do. The award of compensation in
         the public law jurisdiction is also without prejudice to
         any other action like civil suit for damages which is
         lawfully available to the victim or the heirs of the
         deceased victim with respect to the same matter for the
         tortious act committed by the functionaries of the State.
         The quantum of compensation will, of course, depend
         upon the peculiar facts of each case and no strait-jacket
         formula can be evolved in that behalf. The relief to
         redress the wrong for the established invasion of the
         fundamental rights of the citizen, under the public law
         jurisdiction is, thus, in addition to the traditional
         remedies and not in derogation of them. The amount of
         compensation as awarded by the Court and paid by the
         State to redress the wrong done, may in a given case, be
         adjusted against any amount which may be awarded to
         the claimant by way of damages in a civil suit.‖

 court used the multiplier method for computation of adequate
compensation. It was observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_258">         "8. Incidentally, this Court in <a href="/doc/470583/" id="a_1110">C.K. Subramania
         Iyer v. T. Kunhikuttan Nair</a> [(1969) 3 SCC 64] while
         dealing with the matter of fatal accidents laid down
         certain relevant guidelines for the purpose of assessment
         of compensation. Para 13 of the Report would be
         relevant on this score and the same is set out
         hereinbelow: (SCC p. 70, para 13)
                  ―13. The law on the point arising for decision may
                  be summed up thus: Compulsory damages under
                  <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1111">Section 1-A</a> of the Act for wrongful death must be
                  limited strictly to the pecuniary loss to the
                  beneficiaries and that under <a href="/doc/124983/" id="a_1112">Section 2</a>, the measure
                  of damages is the economic loss sustained by the
                  estate. There can be no exact uniform rule for
                  measuring the value of the human life and the
                  measure of damages cannot be arrived at by
                  precise mathematical calculations but the amount
                  recoverable depends on the particular facts and
                  circumstances of each case. The life expectancy
                  of the deceased or of the beneficiaries whichever is
                  shorter is an important factor. Since the elements
                  which go to make up the value of the life of the
                  deceased to the designated beneficiaries are
                  necessarily personal to each case, in the very
                  nature of things, there can be no exact or uniform
                  rule for measuring the value of human life. In
                  assessing damages, the Court must exclude all
                  considerations of matter which rest in speculation
                  or fancy though conjecture to some extent is
                  inevitable. As a general rule parents are entitled to
                  recover the present cash value of the prospective
                  service of the deceased minor child. In addition
                  they may receive compensation for loss of
                  pecuniary benefits reasonably to be expected after
                  the child attains majority. In the matter of

                 ascertainment of damages, the appellate court
                should be slow in disturbing the findings reached

         only dealt with the issue in a manner apposite to the
         social need of the country but the learned Judge with his
         usual felicity of expression firmly established the current
         trend of ―justice-oriented approach‖. Law courts will lose
         their efficacy if they cannot possibly respond to the need
         of the society -- technicalities there might be many but
         the justice-oriented approach ought not to be thwarted on
         the basis of such technicality since technicality cannot
         and ought not to outweigh the course of justice.‖

         It is noteworthy that even in the Uphaar Tragedy Victims
Association, the Supreme Court adopted the multiplier method for
computation of the compensation.

cleaning a sceptic tank, three labourers died on account of
inhalation of poisonous gasses. Constable Ranbir Singh, who went
into the tank to help them, also died due to the toxic gasses. The
award of Rs.5,00,000/- by the Trial Court as compensation was
challenged in appeal before the High Court. The court discussed
the liability under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1132">Fatal Accidents Act</a>, 1855 and by application of
multiplier method, the compensation was enhanced from
Rs.5,00,000/- to Rs.11,00,000/-.

compensation under <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1133">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. is concerned, it is
to be imposed against persons who have been held guilty in

be persons of substantial means. In other words they have the

 paying capacity to adequately compensate the victims/dependants
for the loss which has enured. Just as in Kunal Sah award of the
strict and conservative compensation which may result by
application of the multiplier method, may be inconsequential - it
would certainly not have any deterrent effect.

</p><p id="p_862">371.      We find that in India, certain non-pecuniary and non-
tangible concerns are also being taken into consideration while
determining compensation.                    This is best illustrated by cases
involving computation of compensation to family members of a
deceased housewife i.e. a person with no fixed income/salary. In

 the pecuniary loss should not be limited to the value of the money
lost or the money value of the things lost and why should the
monetary loss incurred by replacing services rendered gratuitously
by a relative be not considered, if there was a reasonable prospect
of their being rendered freely in the future but for the death.

         "The weekend care of the plaintiff and the boys remains a
         problem which has not been satisfactorily solved. The
         plaintiff's relatives help him to a certain extent, especially
         on Saturday afternoons. But I formed the clear
         impression that the plaintiff is often, at weekends, sorely
         tired in trying to be an effective substitute for the
         deceased. The problem could, to some extent, be cured
         by engaging another woman, possibly to do duty at the
         weekend, but finding such a person is no simple matter. I
         think the plaintiff has not made extensive enquiries in
         this regard. Possibly the expense involved in getting
         more help is a factor which has deterred him. Whatever
         be the reason, the plain fact is that the deceased's services
         at the weekend have not been replaced. They are lost to
         the plaintiff and to the boys.

         life of a woman beyond her so-called services, that is to

          say, to keep house, to cook the food, to buy the clothes,
         to wash them and so forth. In more than one case, an
         attempt has been made to calculate the actual number of
         hours it would take a woman to perform such services
         and to compensate dependants upon that basis at so much
         an hour and so relegate the wife or mother, so it seems to
         me, to the position of a housekeeper.

         the other judges to whom I have been referred, of the
         view that the word ‗services' has been too narrowly
         construed. It should, at least, include an acknowledgment
         that a wife and mother does not work to set hours and,
         still less, to rule. She is in constant attendance, save for
         those hours when she is, if that is the fact, at work.
         During some of those hours she may well give the
         children instruction on essential matters to do with their
         upbringing and, possibly, with such things as their
         homework. This sort of attention seems to be as much of
         a service, and probably more valuable to them, than the
         other kinds of service conventionally so regarded.‖

</p>

<p id="p_870">374. So far as the position in India is concerned, we may extract
the observations of the Supreme Court in paras 26 and 27 of Arun
Kumar Agrawal which read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_263">         "26. In India the courts have recognised that the
         contribution made by the wife to the house is invaluable
         and cannot be computed in terms of money. The
         gratuitous services rendered by the wife with true love
         and affection to the children and her husband and
         managing the household affairs cannot be equated with
         the services rendered by others. A wife/mother does not
         work by the clock. She is in the constant attendance of
         the family throughout the day and night unless she is
         employed and is required to attend the employer's work
         for particular hours. She takes care of all the
         requirements of the husband and children including
         cooking of food, washing of clothes, etc. She teaches
         small children and provides invaluable guidance to them
         for their future life. A housekeeper or maidservant can do
         the household work, such as cooking food, washing
         clothes and utensils, keeping the house clean, etc., but
         she can never be a substitute for a wife/mother who
         renders selfless service to her husband and children.</blockquote>

<p id="p_871">         27. It is not possible to quantify any amount in lieu of the
         services rendered by the wife/mother to the family i.e. the
         husband and children. However, for the purpose of award
         of compensation to the dependants, some pecuniary
         estimate has to be made of the services of the
         housewife/mother. In that context, the term ―services‖ is
         required to be given a broad meaning and must be
         construed by taking into account the loss of personal care



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          and attention given by the deceased to her children as a
         mother and to her husband as a wife. They are entitled to
         adequate compensation in lieu of the loss of gratuitous
         services rendered by the deceased. The amount payable
         to the dependants cannot be diminished on the ground
         that some close relation like a grandmother may
         volunteer to render some of the services to the family
         which the deceased was giving earlier."
</p>

<p id="p_872">375. In para 28, the court referred to the pronouncement of the
Supreme Court reported at (2001) 8 SCC 197, <a href="/doc/508534/" id="a_1137">Lata Wadhwa v.
State of Bihar</a> wherein attempt was made to determine the
compensation on the basis of the multifarious services rendered by
the deceased housewives to the house, in the absence of any data
and as the wives were not earning any income. The value of the
service and the multiplier were varied based on the age of the
deceased.
</p><p id="p_873">376. The judgment in Lata Wadhwa was referred to with
approval in (2001) 8 SCC 151, <a href="/doc/927219/" id="a_1138">M.S. Grewal v. Deep Chand Sood</a>.
</p><p id="p_874">377. In several judgments, courts have advocated giving a wider
meaning to the word "services" in cases relating to the award of
compensation to the dependants of the deceased wife/mother.
</p><p id="p_875">378. We may note that in para 35 of Arun Kumar Agrawal, the
court observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_264">         "35. xxx xxx xxx it is highly unfair, unjust and
         inappropriate to compute the compensation payable to
         the dependants of a deceased wife/mother, who does not
         have a regular income, by comparing her services with
         that of a housekeeper or a servant or an employee, who

          works for a fixed period. The gratuitous services
         rendered by the wife/mother to the husband and children
         cannot be equated with the services of an employee and
         no evidence or data can possibly be produced for
         estimating the value of such services. It is virtually
         impossible to measure in terms of money the loss of
         personal care and attention suffered by the husband and
         children on the demise of the housewife. In its wisdom,
         the legislature had, as early as in 1994, fixed the notional
         income of a non-earning person at Rs. 15,000 per annum
         and in case of a spouse, 1/3rd income of the
         earning/surviving spouse for the purpose of computing
         the compensation."

<p id="p_876">379. In Arun Kumar Agrawal, A.K. Ganguly, J. gave additional
reasons to the issue. Reference was made to the Division Bench
pronouncement of the Madras High Court reported at (2009) 6
MLJ 1005, <a href="/doc/931785/" id="a_1139">National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Minor Deepika</a> to the
following methodology for assessment of the work of a
homemaker:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_265">         "56. The Madras High Court in its very illuminating
         judgment in Deepika [(2009) 6 MLJ 1005] has further
         referred to various methods by which the assessment of
         work of a homemaker can be made and the relevant portion
         from para 10 of the said judgment is extracted below: (MLJ
         p. 1008)
                ―10. ... that there have been efforts to understand the
                value of a homemaker's unpaid labour by different
                methods. One is, the opportunity cost which evaluates
                her wages by assessing what she would have earned
                had she not remained at home viz. the opportunity
                lost. The second is, the partnership method which
                assumes that a marriage is an equal economic
                partnership and in this method, the homemaker's
                salary is valued at half her husband's salary. Yet

                 another method is to evaluate homemaking by
                determining how much it would cost to replace the
                homemaker with paid workers. This is called the
                Replacement Method.‖
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_266">         57. Various aspects of the nature of a homemaker's job have
         been described in para 11 which are very relevant and are
         extracted below: (Deepika case [(2009) 6 MLJ 1005] , MLJ
         p. 1008)
                ―11. The role of a housewife includes managing
                budgets, coordinating activities, balancing accounts,
                helping children with education, managing help at
                home, nursing care, etc. One formula that has been
                arrived at determines the value of the housewife as,
                value of housewife = husband's income − wife's
                income + value of husband's household services,
                which means the wife's value will increase inversely
                proportionate to the extent of participation by the
                husband in the household duties. The Australian
                Family Property Law provides that while distributing
                properties in matrimonial matters, for instance, one
                has to factor in ‗the contribution made by a party to
                the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted
                by the parties to the marriage and any children of the
                marriage, including any contribution made in the
                capacity of a homemaker or parent'.‖
         In para 13, the Division Bench of the High Court has
         observed and, in my view very rightly, that time has come to
         scientifically assess the value of the unpaid homemaker both
         in accident claims and in matters of division of matrimonial
         properties."

<p id="p_877">380. We now examine another aspect of non-tangible losses
which result upon a death of a family member. Compensation

 reported at (2013) 9 SCC 54, <a href="/doc/108651051/" id="a_1140">Rajesh &amp; Ors. v. Rajbir Singh &amp;
Ors</a>., the court was considering a claim for damages by a widow
and three minor children of a deceased victim of a fatal road
accident.        Referring to the concept of non-pecuniary damages
which results on account of a fatal accident including loss of
consortium to the spouse and loss of love, care and guidance to the
children, it was held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_267">         "17. xxx xxx xxx In legal parlance, ―consortium‖ is the
         right of the spouse to the company, care, help, comfort,
         guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations
         with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of
         damages has not been properly understood by our courts.
         The loss of companionship, love, care and protection,
         etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated
         appropriately. The concept of non-pecuniary damage for
         loss of consortium is one of the major heads of award of
         compensation in other parts of the world more
         particularly in the United States of America, Australia,
         etc. English courts have also recognised the right of a
         spouse to get compensation even during the period of
         temporary disablement. By loss of consortium, the courts
         have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's
         affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society,
         assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during
         the future years. Unlike the compensation awarded in
         other countries and other jurisdictions, since the legal
         heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the
         pecuniary loss, it would not be proper to award a major
         amount under this head. Hence, we are of the view that it
         would only be just and reasonable that the courts award
         at least rupees one lakh for loss of consortium."

         by such person in Civil Court. <a href="/doc/1275348/" id="a_1147">Section 357(1)(c)</a> Cr.P.C.
         empowers the Court to award compensation out of the
         fine in death cases where the persons are entitled to
         recover the same under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1148">Fatal Accidents Act</a>, 1855.
         <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1149">Section 357(3)</a> Cr.P.C. empowers the Court to award
         compensation to any person who has suffered loss or
         injury by reason of the act of the accused. <a href="/doc/1065315/" id="a_1150">Section 357(5)</a>
         Cr.P.C. provides that at the time of awarding
         compensation in any subsequent civil suit relating to the
         same matter, the Court shall take into account any sum
         paid or recovered as compensation under this section.
         The effect of these provisions is that the Court has to
         compute the compensation which the victims are entitled
         to claim against the accused under Civil Law. The
         victims of the road accidents are entitled to compensation
         under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1151">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1988 and therefore, the

         computation of compensation under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1152">Motor Vehicles

         caused to the dependants by the death of the victim of the
         road accident. The dependency of the dependants is
         determined by taking the annual earning of the deceased
         at the time of the accident. Thereafter, effect is given to
         the future prospects of the deceased. After the income of
         the deceased is established, the deduction is made
         towards the personal expenses of the deceased which he
         would have spent on himself. If the deceased was
         unmarried, normally 50% of the income is deducted
         towards his personal expenses. If the deceased was
         married and leaves behind two to three dependents, 1/3rd


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          deduction is made; if the deceased has left behind four to
         six family members, deduction of 1/4th of his income is
         made and where the number of dependent family
         members exceeds six, the deduction of 1/5th of the
         income is made. The remaining amount of income after
         deduction of personal expenses is taken to be the loss of
         dependency to the family members which is multiplied
         by 12 to determine the annual loss of dependency. The
         annual loss of dependency of the dependants of the
         deceased is multiplied by the multiplier according to the
         age of the deceased or victim(s) whichever is higher. A
         table of multipliers is given in Schedule-II of the Motor
         Vehicle Act, 1988 but there was some error in the said
         table which has been corrected by the Supreme Court in
         Sarla Verma v. DTC, 2009 ACJ 1298.
</p>
<p id="p_885">         29. Before awarding any compensation under <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1153">Section
         357(3)</a> Cr.P.C., the Court shall consider whether any
         compensation has been received by the victim or his
         family by an award of the Motor Accident Claims
         Tribunal. If the victim(s) / his family have not received
         any compensation by an award of the Motor Accident
         Claims Tribunal, the Court shall, in exercise of its
         jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1154">Section 357(3)</a> Cr.P.C., compute the
         compensation to which the victim(s) / his family by
         applying the well settled principles under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_1155">Motor
         Vehicles Act</a>, 1988. However, if the victim / his family
         have received adequate compensation by an award of the

         under <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1156">Section 357(3)</a> Cr.P.C. shall be restricted to a
         reasonable conventional compensation in the facts and
         circumstances of each case. For example, in a case where
         the deceased aged 36 years working as a telephone
         operator earning Rs.7,500/- per month dies in a road
         accident leaving behind his widow and two children; first
         step would be to add 50% of the income as future
         prospects and total income for computation of
         compensation would be taken as Rs.11,250/-. Next step
         is to deduct 1/3rd towards the personal expenses which


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 297
          the deceased would have spent on himself and the loss of
         dependency of his family would be Rs.7,500/- per month.
         The annual loss of dependency of Rs.90,000/- is
         multiplied by the multiplier of 15 to compute the total
         loss of dependency as Rs.13,50,000/-. Rs.50,000/- is
         added towards loss of love and affection, loss of
         consortium, loss of estate and funeral expenses. The total
         loss would be Rs.14,00,000/- (Rs.7,500/- plus 50% minus
         1/3rd X 12 X 15 + Rs.50,000/-)."
</p>

<p id="p_886">         It was further held therein that after computation of the
compensation, the court would be required to consider whether the
victim had received compensation from the Motor Accidents
Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_887">384. The development of the law in the context of compensation
based on the multiplier method in motor accident cases is a useful
guideline for computation and award of compensation and
damages.            Flexibility has been read into the prescribed
methodology to provide for imponderables and non-pecuniary
elements of compensation. The same has been effectively utilized
for award of compensation. Thus, the two components of
compensation, i.e., standard compensation and compensation for
pecuniary loss of dependancy would be ascertained based on
above.

of the Cr.P.C., whereby the courts are empowered to award
compensation to victims of the criminal offences in respect of the
loss or injury suffered or harm caused, is to do justice in a holistic
and real manner to the victims of crime. We are herein concerned

 with the award of compensation for loss resulting on account of
criminal acts committed by defendants after premeditation and
planning. This fact would necessarily have to be factored into the
compensation awarded so far as quantification of compensation.

<p id="p_889">XI.      State liability to pay compensation

         The discussion on this subject is being considered under the

<p id="p_894">386. In a case where the offender stands identified and has the
capacity to pay compensation, there is no difficulty for the court to
make orders. However, what is to happen if the offender was not
identified or could not be traced? Or if identified and traced, does
not have the paying capacity? There may be a case, where the
police decides not to prosecute. Or the case, for some reason, ends
in an acquittal. Where would the victim or his dependants stand,
so far as compensation is concerned?

provides that the court which sentences an offender, shall be
competent to direct that in default of payment of fine, the offender
shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, in which the
imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to
which he may have been sentenced or to which he may be liable
under a commutation of a sentence. So far as the description of
such imprisonment for the non-payment of fine is concerned,
discretion is given to the court under <a href="/doc/1779880/" id="a_1169">Section 66</a> of the IPC which
permits the court to impose imprisonment in default of payment of
fine to be of any description to which the offender might have been
sentenced for the offence. So far as the limits to imprisonment for
non-payment of fine are concerned, when imprisonment and fine
are awardable, the same are provided in <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1170">Section 65</a> and when the

the judgment reported at (2010) 6 SCC 230, <a href="/doc/1845799/" id="a_1209">K.A Abbas H.S.A. v.
Sabu Joseph</a>, on the question of permissibility of awarding a
sentence        of     imprisonment            upon    default   of   payment   of
compensation observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_284">         ―26. From the above line of cases, it becomes very clear,
         that, a sentence of imprisonment can be granted for
         default in payment of compensation awarded under
         <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1210">Section 357(3)</a> CrPC. The whole purpose of the
         provision is to accommodate the interests of the victims
         in the criminal justice system. Sometimes the situation
         becomes such that there is no purpose served by keeping
         a person behind bars. Instead directing the accused to
         pay an amount of compensation to the victim or


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          affected party can ensure delivery of total justice.
         Therefore, this grant of compensation is sometimes in
         lieu of sending a person behind bars or in addition to a
         very light sentence of imprisonment. Hence on default of
         payment of this compensation, there must be a just
         recourse. Not imposing a sentence of imprisonment
         would mean allowing the accused to get away without
         paying the compensation and imposing another fine
         would be impractical as it would mean imposing a fine
         upon another fine and therefore would not ensure proper
         enforcement of the order of compensation. While passing
         an order under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1211">Section 357(3)</a>, it is imperative for the
         courts to look at the ability and the capacity of the
         accused to pay the same amount as has been laid down
         by the cases above, otherwise the very purpose of
         granting an order of compensation would stand defeated.

         reliance     on     the    decision    of  this    Court
         in Ahammedkutty v. Abdullakoya [(2009) 6 SCC 660 :

         on default of paying compensation awarded under
         <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1213">Section 357(3)</a>. But in light of several decisions
         reiterating the opposite stand, this case needs to be

          immediate relief so as to alleviate his grievance. In terms
         of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1215">Section 357(3)</a> compensation is awarded for the loss or
         injury suffered by the person due to the act of the accused
         for which he is sentenced. If merely an order directing
         compensation is passed, it would be totally ineffective. It
         could be an order without any deterrence or apprehension
         of immediate adverse consequences in case of its non-
         observance. The whole purpose of giving relief to the
         complainant under <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1216">Section 357(3)</a> of the Code would be
         frustrated if he is driven to take recourse to <a href="/doc/89440/" id="a_1217">Section 421</a>
         of the Code. Order under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1218">Section 357(3)</a> must have
         potentiality to secure its observance. Deterrence can only
         be infused into the order by providing for a default
         sentence. If <a href="/doc/89440/" id="a_1219">Section 421</a> of the Code puts compensation
         ordered to be paid by the court on a par with fine so far
         as mode of recovery is concerned, then there is no reason
         why the court cannot impose a sentence in default of
         payment of compensation as it can be done in case of
         default in payment of fine under <a href="/doc/1314176/" id="a_1220">Section 64</a> IPC. It is
         obvious that in view of this, in Vijayan [(2009) 6 SCC
         652 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 296] , this Court stated that the
         abovementioned provisions enabled the court to impose a
         sentence in default of payment of compensation and
         rejected the submission that the recourse can only be had
         to <a href="/doc/89440/" id="a_1221">Section 421</a> of the Code for enforcing the order of
         compensation. Pertinently, it was made clear that
         observations made by this Court in Hari Singh [(1988) 4
         SCC 551 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 984] are as important today as
         they were when they were made. The conclusion,
         therefore, is that the order to pay compensation may be
         enforced by awarding sentence in default."

<a href="/doc/82476980/" id="a_1222">Subrata Roy Sahara v. Union of India</a>, the Supreme Court

 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1223">Cr.P.C</a>., there is an elaborate procedure prescribed whereunder a
person can be subjected to arrest and detention for the
satisfaction of a fine or compensation (i.e. for the recovery of a
financial liability)‖.
</p><p id="p_925">406. It is, therefore, well settled that courts are amply empowered
to direct imprisonment for default of payment of fine or
compensation. Upon a conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_1224">Sections 357(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/713219/" id="a_1225">431</a>
of the Cr.P.C. as well as <a href="/doc/1314176/" id="a_1226">Section 64</a> of the Indian Penal Code, it is
trite that the court making an order under <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1227">Section 357</a> of the
Cr.P.C. can direct that in default of payment of the compensation,
the offender shall suffer imprisonment, for a term and manner for
which imprisonment would be imposed for default of payment of a
fine.
</p><p id="p_926">407. It is important to note that the sentence of imprisonment for
default in payment of compensation is different from the regular
sentence of imprisonment imposed as a punishment.               The
description of the imprisonment would be in consonance with
<a href="/doc/1779880/" id="a_1228">Section 66</a> of the IPC.
</p><p id="p_927">408. For the purposes of determining apt imprisonment for
default of payment of fine/compensation, while keeping within the
limits prescribed in <a href="/doc/26136/" id="a_1229">Sections 65</a> and <a href="/doc/1500319/" id="a_1230">67</a> of the IPC, it is therefore,
the duty of the court to keep in view relevant consideration which
would again inter alia include the nature of the offence, the

</p><p id="p_929"> (ii)     Impact of undergoing default sentence on liability for
         payment of fine/compensation

</p><p id="p_930">409. Having held that under <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1231">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. the court
can     impose a default                 imprisonment for failure to     pay
compensation, brings us to the next question. What is the impact
of undergoing the default sentence on the compensation liability?
</p><p id="p_931">410. In the context of execution of an order for payment of
maintenance under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_1232">Section 125</a> of the Cr.P.C. as well, the Supreme
Court in its judgment reported at (1989) 1 SCC 405, <a href="/doc/41316995/" id="a_1233">Kuldeep v.
Surender Singh</a> has observed that sentencing a person to jail is a
"mode of enforcement" and not a "mode of satisfaction". It was
held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_287">         ―6. A distinction has to be drawn between a mode of
         enforcing recovery on the one hand and effecting actual
         recovery of the amount of monthly allowance which has
         fallen in arrears on the other. Sentencing a person to jail
         is a ―mode of enforcement‖. It is not a ―mode of
         satisfaction‖ of the liability. The liability can be satisfied
         only by making actual payment of the arrears. The
         whole purpose of sending to jail is to oblige a person
         liable to pay the monthly allowance who refuses to
         comply with the order without sufficient cause, to obey
         the order and to make the payment. The purpose of
         sending him to jail is not to wipe out the liability which
         he has refused to discharge. xxx Sentencing to jail is
         the means for achieving the end of enforcing the order
         by recovering the amount of arrears. It is not a mode of
         discharging liability. The section does not say so.</blockquote>
<p id="p_932">         Parliament in its wisdom has not said so. Commonsense
         does not support such a construction. From where does
         the court draw inspiration for persuading itself that the
         liability arising under the order for maintenance would

          stand discharged upon an effort being made to recover it?
         The order for monthly allowance can be discharged only
         upon the monthly allowance being recovered. The
         liability cannot be taken to have been discharged by
         sending the person liable to pay the monthly allowance,
         to jail. At the cost of repetition it may be stated that it is
         only a mode or method of recovery and not a substitute
         for recovery. No other view is possible. xxx xxx xxx‖

</p><p id="p_933">411. So far as the working and recovery of compensation is
concerned, in (1998) 7 SCC 392 <a href="/doc/1899469/" id="a_1234">State of Gujarat v. Hon</a>'ble High
Court of Gujarat on the experience of a default sentence, it was
noted as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_288">         "48. <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1235">Section 357</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973
         provides some reliefs to the victims as the court is
         empowered to direct payment of compensation to any
         person for any loss or injury caused by the offence. But
         in practice, the said provision has not proved to be of
         much effectiveness. Many persons who are sentenced to
         long-term imprisonment do not pay the compensation
         and instead they choose to continue in jail in default
         thereof. It is only when fine alone is the sentence that the
         convicts invariably choose to remit the fine. But those
         are cases in which the harm inflicted on the victims
         would have been far less serious. Thus the restorative and
         reparative theories are not translated into real benefits to
         the victims."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_289">                             (Emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_290">412. It is evident, therefore, that too heavy a compensation
amount and too trivial the default imprisonment would negate the
efficacy of not only the compensation, but also of the length of
default imprisonment.
</blockquote>



<p id="p_934">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                      pg. 314
</p><p id="p_935"> 413. So what are the factors which must weigh with the court
while undertaking such assessment.                     This is best stated by the
Supreme Court in its pronouncement reported at (2007) 11 SCC
243, <a href="/doc/35282/" id="a_1236">Shantilal v. State of M.P</a>. wherein the court delved into the
factors which must weigh with the court before ordering a default
sentence for non-compliance of an order of payment of
compensation in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_291">         ―31. ... The term of imprisonment in default of payment
         of fine is not a sentence. It is a penalty which a person
         incurs on account of non-payment of fine. The sentence
         is something which an offender must undergo unless it is
         set aside or remitted in part or in whole either in appeal
         or in revision or in other appropriate judicial proceedings
         or ―otherwise‖. A term of imprisonment ordered in
         default of payment of fine stands on a different footing. A
         person is required to undergo imprisonment either
         because he is unable to pay the amount of fine or
         refuses to pay such amount. He, therefore, can always
         avoid to undergo imprisonment in default of payment of
         fine by paying such amount. It is, therefore, not only
         the power, but the duty of the court to keep in view the
         nature of offence, circumstances under which it was
         committed, the position of the offender and other relevant
         considerations before ordering the offender to suffer
         imprisonment in default of payment of fine.‖
                               (Emphasis by us)

</blockquote><p id="p_936">414. The default sentence is a method of procuring enforcement
of the order and not a method for discharge of liability.
</p><p id="p_937">415. Undergoing the default sentence would not discharge the
liability to pay the compensation ordered by the court.

</p><p id="p_939"> (iii)    Whether award of interim compensation is permissible?
</p>
<p id="p_940">416. The jurisprudence on the subject of compensation brings out
the aspect of grant of interim compensation as well. We find that
in para 18 of (1996) 1 SCC 490, <a href="/doc/642436/" id="a_1237">Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra
Chakraborty (Ms</a>.), the court referred to the prior decision in
(1995) 1 SCC 14, Delhi Domestic Working Women's <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_1238">Forum v.
Union of India</a> wherein the court had laid down the principles for
trying cases of sexual assault and made directions with regard to
payment of compensation to victims. In para 18, the Supreme
Court observed that "if the court trying an offence of rape has
jurisdiction to award the compensation at the final stage, there is
no reason to deny to the court the right to award interim
compensation which should also be provided in the scheme. On the
basis of principles set out in the aforesaid decision, the jurisdiction
to pay interim compensation shall be treated to be part of the
overall jurisdiction of the courts trying the offences of rape which,
as pointed out above is an offence against basic human rights as
also the Fundamental Right of Personal Liberty and Life".
</p><p id="p_941">417. In para 19, the court additionally observed that it had "the
inherent jurisdiction to pass any order it considers fit and proper
in the interest of justice or to do complete justice between the
parties". The jurisdiction to pass such interim order would be
inherent in the High Courts as well if the facts of the case so
warrant.
</p><p id="p_942">418. We see no reason as to why the above principles on award of
interim compensation ought not to apply to the every criminal case,


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                   pg. 316
 including the present case.                  The High Court in appellate and
revisional jurisdiction, has the substantive power to award
compensation under <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1239">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. It would therefore,
have the power to grant interim compensation in exercise of its
inherent power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1240">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_943">419. This issue in the context of a case involving the offences of
criminal conspiracy, kidnapping for ransom and murder was
considered by the Supreme Court in the judgment reported at
(2014) SCC Online SC 952, <a href="/doc/42131728/" id="a_1241">Suresh &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana</a>.
The court considered the pronouncement in (1985) 4 SCC 337,
<a href="/doc/1194071/" id="a_1242">Savitri v. Govind Singh Rawat</a> wherein the court held that it was a
duty of the court to interpret the provisions of Chapter IX of the
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1243">Cr.P.C</a>. (in the context of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1244">Section 125</a>) in such a way that the
construction placed on them would not defeat the very object of the
legislation.        It was held that in the absence of any express
prohibition, it was appropriate to construe the provisions as
conferring an implied power on the Magistrates to direct the person
against whom the application under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1245">Section 125</a> is made, to pay
some reasonable sum by way of interim maintenance to the
applicant.        This view was reiterated by the Supreme Court in
(2008) 9 SCC 632, <a href="/doc/1952766/" id="a_1246">Shail Kumari Devi v. Krishan Bhagwan
Pathak</a>.
</p><p id="p_944">420. So far as the issue of interim compensation to victims of
crime was concerned, in <a href="/doc/42131728/" id="a_1247">Suresh v. State of Haryana</a>, the Supreme
Court held as follows:
</p>



<p id="p_945">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                         pg. 317
          "We are of the view that above observations support the
         submission that interim compensation ought to be paid at
         the earliest so that immediate need of victim can be met.
         For determining the amount of interim compensation, the
         Court may have regard to the facts and circumstances of
         individual cases including the nature of offence, loss
         suffered and the requirement of the victim. On an interim
         order being passed by the Court, the funds available with
         the District/State Legal Services Authorities may be
         disbursed to the victims in the manner directed by the
         Court, to be adjusted later in appropriate proceedings. If
         the funds already allotted get exhausted, the State may
         place further funds at the disposal of the Legal Services
         Authorities.‖

</p><p id="p_946">421. It is therefore, well settled that the courts are adequately
empowered to consider award of interim compensation to a victim
of a criminal offence upon the court concluding in favour of the
entitlement of a person. A direction to make the payment of the
interim maintenance can be made against the Legal Services
Authority             subject           to         appropriate   orders      for
adjustment/reimbursement, if deemed appropriate upon final
adjudication.

         between multiple defendants, power to grant time and permit
         instalments for payment.

<p id="p_948">422. It is essential to refer to a statutory provision which confers
the power of suspension of execution of the sentence of
imprisonment in default of payment of the fine, either

 unconditionally or on conditions. In this regard, we set down
hereunder <a href="/doc/1700047/" id="a_1248">Section 424</a> of the Cr.P.C. which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_292">         ―424. Suspension of execution of sentence of

         sentenced to fine only and to imprisonment in default of

<blockquote id="blockquote_293">         (a) Order that the fine shall be payable either in fully on
         or before a date not more than thirty days from the date
         of the order, or in two or three instalments, of which the
         first shall be payable on or before a date not more than
         thirty days from the date of the order and the other or
         others at an interval or at intervals, as the case may be, of
         not more than thirty days;

<blockquote id="blockquote_294">         (b) Suspend the execution of the sentence of

         by the offender of a bond, with or without sureties, as the
         court thinks fit, on conditioned for his appearance before
         the court on the date or dates on or before which payment
         of the fine or the instalment thereof, as the case may be,
         is to be made; and if the amount of the fine or of any
         instalment, as the case may be, is not realised on or
         before the latest date on which it is payable under the
         order, the court may direct the sentence of imprisonment
         to be carried into execution at once.

<blockquote id="blockquote_295">         (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall be applicable
         also in any case in which an order for the payment of
         money has been made on non-recovery of which
         imprisonment may be awarded and the money is not paid
         forthwith; and, if the person against whom the order has
         been made, on being required to enter into a bond such as
         is referred to in that sub-section, fails to do so, the court
         may at once pass sentence of imprisonment."

          Therefore, even while passing an order suspending the
sentence of imprisonment for default of payment, it is open to the
court to grant time to the defendant to pay the amount or do so in
instalments.         The legislative intent is clearly to persuade the
defendant to comply with the direction to pay.
</p><p id="p_950">423. The issues regarding apportionment between multiple
convicts, permissibility of payment of differential compensation
amongst multiple convicts as well as grant of reasonable time to
the convict and mode for payment stand considered in (1988) 4
SCC 551 <a href="/doc/212245/" id="a_1249">Hari Singh v. Sukhbir Singh</a>, when the Court stated
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_296">         ―11. xxx The quantum of compensation may be
         determined by taking into account the nature of crime,
         the justness of claim by the victim and the ability of
         accused to pay. If there are more than one accused they
         may be asked to pay in equal terms unless their capacity
         to pay varies considerably. The payment may also vary
         depending upon the acts of each accused. Reasonable
         period for payment of compensation, if necessary by
         instalments, may also be given. The court may enforce
         the order by imposing sentence in default.‖
                            (Emphasis by us)

         Orders in respect of apportionment between defendants thus
are permissible and could be considered by the court when passing
the order of compensation. This would rest on factors as the acts
of each of the accused, capacity to pay and such like relevant
factors. So far as grant of a period or instalments for payment are
concerned, the convict would be required to place material in
support of such request. Even while suspending a sentence of

 imprisonment for default of payment, the court is empowered to
impose conditions in terms of <a href="/doc/1700047/" id="a_1250">Section 424</a> of the Cr.P.C., giving
opportunity to the defendant to pay the amount.

procedure to be followed:
</p><p id="p_952">(i)    Once a judgment of conviction is returned, or upheld, it is
the mandatory duty of every court to consider whether the case is a
fit case for award of compensation.

of compensation to which the victims or the dependants would be
entitled in law and then ascertain the paying capacity of the
defendants.

<p id="p_954">(iii) The court is required to conduct an inquiry even a summary
one with into all relevant factors including the paying capacity of
the accused. However, such inquiry may not be necessary, if the
facts emerging during the trial or otherwise are clear rendering the
inquiry unnecessary.
</p>
<p id="p_955">(iv) In fixing the fine and/or compensation, it is the duty of the
court to take into consideration all relevant factors inter alia
including the nature of the crime, the injury suffered, the persons
entitled to be compensated, the justness of the claim for
compensation, the capacity of the accused to pay.
</p>
<p id="p_956">(v) The enquiry ought to examine the details of the
victims/dependants, impact of the crime on them as well as their
circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_957">(vi) The judge awarding the compensation must exercise the
power reasonably. He cannot exercise the power to do so
arbitrarily. It is necessary to assign some reasons for the award of
fine and compensation by the court.

either irrational or exorbitant.

required to be rationally distributed between them. It is also
permissible to grant time or to direct payment of the compensation
in instalments keeping in view the paying capacity of the
defendant.

<p id="p_961">(ix) If recovery of the compensation or any part thereof is not
possible from the offender, the court shall proceed to cause the
same to be paid in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1252">Section 357A</a>

 XII. Fine and compensation - constituents, reasonability and
     adequacy

</p><p id="p_997">425. <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1255">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. confers the power on the courts to
impose fine and compensation. The legislation does not enumerate
the factors which ought to weigh with the court while assessing
appropriate reasonable compensation. There is also very scanty
jurisprudence on this aspect. It encompasses expenses properly
incurred in prosecution [clause (a)] as well as such payment to any
person so as to compensate for any loss or injury caused, when
compensation is in the opinion of the court recoverable by such
person in a civil court (clause b).
</p><p id="p_998">426. Fine is a part of sentence imposed, an award of
compensation is in addition thereto. We have noted above the
power of the High Court, either on appeal or in revision or also to
suo motu enhance the sentence if convinced that the same is not
adequate in the facts and circumstances of the case.
</p><p id="p_999">427. In the present case, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1256">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/695990/" id="a_1257">364</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1258">201</a> of the IPC do
not limit the quantum of fine which the sentencing court may
impose.
</p><p id="p_1000">428. In Chapter XXVII captioned "The Judgment" of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1259">CrPC</a>,
the legislature has provided <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1260">Section 357</a> which empowers the court
to make orders of compensation. Some indication as to what must
be considered by the court while imposing a fine is to be found in
sub-section (1) <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1261">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. which enables the court
to pass orders for the purposes of which fine (as part of the
sentence) may be applied.

</p><p id="p_1002"> 429. Clause (a) sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1262">Section 357</a> permits the courts
to direct the fine, or part thereof to be applied for ―defraying the
expenses properly incurred in prosecution‖.
</p><p id="p_1003">430. Clause (b) enables the court to apply the fine for payment to
"any person" within courts of "compensation" for "any loss or
injury caused by the offence" when compensation is in the opinion
of the court, recoverable by such person in a civil court.
</p><p id="p_1004">431. We find that so far as civil proceedings are concerned, the
legislature and judicial precedents have provided for recovery of
costs of proceedings. The CPC confers discretion on the court to
determine by whom, out of which property and to what extent costs
are to be paid as well as to give all necessary directions for the
purposes. Under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1263">Section 35A</a>, the court is enabled to make an order
for payment of costs by way of compensation in respect of false or
vexatious claims or defences. The courts are empowered to direct
that the costs shall form part of the decree.
</p><p id="p_1005">432. So far as Code of Criminal Procedure is concerned, it makes
reference to costs in <a href="/doc/1656746/" id="a_1264">Section 359</a> Cr.P.C. which enables the
convicting court to order accused to pay to complainant ―in whole
or in part, the cost incurred by him in the prosecution‖. It also
states that ―such costs may include any expenses incurred in
respect of process-fees, witnesses and pleader‟s fees which the
Court may consider reasonable‖.
</p><p id="p_1006">433. Some guidance in this regard is discernible from the
statutory provisions in other countries and jurisprudence therefrom.
We find legislation in this regard in the United Kingdom as well as


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 New Zealand. The Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985 of the
United Kingdom includes in Part II, "Costs in Criminal Cases".
The legislation grades costs as per the hierarchy of courts starting
from the Magistrates' Court, the Crown Court and the higher
courts. Apart from costs which may be awarded in favour of the
accused (referred to as the 'defendant'), in <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1265">Section 17</a>, prosecution
costs, with regard to proceedings in respect of indictable as well as
proceedings before the Divisional Court of the Queens Bench
Division or the Supreme Court. Under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1266">Section 18</a>, the award of
costs against the accused to be paid to the prosecutor as are
considered "just and reasonable".                      If in the particular
circumstances of the case, the court considers it right to do so,
certain statutory restrictions on the quantum, person to whom, and
manner of award are also statutorily prescribed. Under sub-section
4 of Section 18, a Magistrate's court shall not order the accused to
pay any cost "unless in the particular circumstances of the case it
considers it right to do so". There is also a limitation on costs
which a person under the age of 18 years can be ordered to pay.
</p><p id="p_1007">434. Sub-section 3 of Section 19 enables the Lord Chancellor to
make regulations to inter alia (a) compensate any witness and any
other person who necessarily attends for the purposes of the
proceedings otherwise and (b) to give evidence for the "expense,
trouble or loss of time" properly incurred in or incidental to his
attendance.
</p><p id="p_1008">         Additionally, the regulations would cover the proper
expenses for an interpreter who may be required; compensate a

 duly qualified practitioner, who makes a report with regard to a
medical examination, for the expenses properly incurred in or
incidental to his reporting to the court. The legislation is farsighted
in and even provides the cost for the defence; against legal
representatives; against third parties amongst other matters.
</p><p id="p_1009">435. Pursuant to the statutory requirement, the Criminal Cases
(General) Regulations, 1986 made as a result of the above
statutory power, came into operation on the 1st of October, 1986.
Regulation 3 enables the court to order that all or part of the costs
incurred in respect of proceedings by one of the parties as a result
of an "unnecessary or improper omission by or on behalf of
another party to the proceedings" be paid to him by the other
party.
</p><p id="p_1010">436. The regulations provide for the method of determination of
costs as well as its payment.                          The regulations provide a
requirement of an application for a cost order.
</p><p id="p_1011">437. The Costs in Criminal Cases Act (Northern Ireland), 1968
is restricted to the recovery of "expenses of prosecution" in
<a href="/doc/810783/" id="a_1267">Section 1</a>.
</p><p id="p_1012">438. Reference may usefully be made to the Costs in Criminal
Cases Act, 1967 in force in New Zealand. The enactment defines
the 'defendant' as "any person charged with an offence". Under
<a href="/doc/386422/" id="a_1268">Section 4</a>, where the defendant stands convicted by any court of
any offence, the court is empowered to order him to pay such sum
as it thinks "just and reasonable towards the cost of the
prosecution".          The costs which are allowed are required to be

 specified in the conviction and may be "recovered in the same
manner as a fine". Where the prosecution involved a difficult or
important point of law, this legislation also provides for payment of
defendant's costs, even if convicted, Under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1269">Section 10</a>, an order to
pay costs on appeal is enforceable as if were a fine by the District
Court.
</p><p id="p_1013">439. Section 12 of the New Zealand law makes it mandatory for
the court, before deciding whether to award costs under the Act, to
allow any party, who wishes to make submissions or call evidence
on the question of costs, reasonable opportunity to do so. So far as
the heads of costs that may be ordered to be paid under the
enactment; prescription of maximum scale of costs that may be
ordered, etc. under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1270">Section 13</a> of the statute, the same are to be
prescribed by regulations. Under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1271">Section 13</a>,
even if a maximum scale of costs stands prescribed by regulation,
the court is empowered to make an order for payment of costs in
excess thereof, if it is satisfied that having regard to the "special
difficulty, complexity, or importance of the case, the payment of
greater costs is desirable".
</p><p id="p_1014">440. The experience in the United Kingdom has shown that it is
impractical to maintain detailed time and costs records and that in
any event, the defendant is generally only asked to make a
contribution to costs. The tables which have been provided are for
the purposes of rendering assistance in calculating the staff costs
incurred at different levels of proceedings, called "Scales of Costs"
and the advocacy costs at different levels of proceedings.

the judgment in (2012) EWCA Crim 2029, R v Kesteven that the
purpose of the costs ordered is to compensate the prosecutor, and
not to punish the defendant.                   The costs should not be grossly
disproportionate to the fine. Though the judgment of the court
does not make a reference to costs, but the purpose of the order
appears to have been compensation for the system for delayed
compounding.
</p><p id="p_1017">442. Have costs been contemplated under the criminal justice

966/2010 [arising out of SLP(Crl.)Nos.6370-6372/2007], observed
that the law permitted compounding of an offence. However,
parties were choosing compounding as a matter of last resort
instead of opting for it as soon as Magistrates take cognizance of
complaints. Often parties wait till the matter reaches the Supreme
Court in appeal before the defendants accept liability and settles
the matter with the complainant. Given this reality of defendants
avoiding their liability to pay, the Supreme Court inter alia
proposed the following Guidelines for dealing with such cases:

         compounding of offences at any stage, however belated,
         gives an incentive to the drawer of the cheque to delay
         settling the cases for years. An application for
         compounding made after several years not only results in

         Therefore, even so far as the criminal proceedings are
concerned, imposition of costs either for wasting judicial time
wasting or compensating the other side is unique neither nor
restricted to civil proceedings. It is certainly not a new concept.
</p><p id="p_1021">445. Though the present case is not concerned with dishonouring
of the cheque, or an economic offence, however, the object of
imposition and method of computation of costs in criminal
proceedings or "expenses incurred in prosecution" even in exercise
of power under <a href="/doc/598565/" id="a_1277">Section 357(1)(a)</a> of the Cr.P.C. cannot differ.
</p><p id="p_1022">446. Let us first and foremost examine clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1644380/" id="a_1278">Section
357(1)</a> of the Cr.P.C. Other than mentioning the expression ―in
defraying the expenses properly incurred in the prosecution‖, the
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1279">Cr.P.C</a>. is silent on its composition.
</p><p id="p_1023">447. The           expressions          "defraying",   "expenses",   "properly
incurred", "prosecution" in clause (a) or "any person" in clause
"(b)" have not been defined by the legislature.
</p><p id="p_1024">448. So far as the expression 'defray' is concerned, no statutory
definition is available. Other than its use in <a href="/doc/598565/" id="a_1280">Section 357(1)(a)</a> of
the Criminal Procedure Code, it has also been used in Rule 2(1) of
Order XVI of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 in the context of
expenses of witnesses to be paid into court or applying for
summons. This expression is also used in <a href="/doc/1232361/" id="a_1281">Section 2(22)(e)</a> of the
Employees State Insurance Act. In<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1282"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure,



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                          pg. 334
 this statutory provision refers to an amount 'as appear to the court
to be sufficient to defray the travelling and other expenses............'.
The Legal Glossary, 1988 of the Government of India describes the
expression "defray" as "to meet the expenses to pay out the
expenses". The Oxford English Dictionary Vol. III has also defines
'defray' as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_311">         "1. To pay out, expend, spend, disburse (money).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_312">         2.    To discharge (the expense or cost of anything) by
         paying; to pay, meet, settle.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_313">         3.    To meet the expense of; to bear the charge of; pay for.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_314">         4.    To pay the charges or expenses of (a person); to
         reimburse."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_1025">449. It is therefore obvious that 'defray' as appears in <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1283">Section 357</a>
has to relate to discharge of all expenses in the prosecution and is
intended to be an amount equivalent to meeting the expenses
incurred in the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_1026">450. It is important to note another important facet of the drafting
of the statutory provision in India. Unlike the legislations noted by
us above as well as the orders of the Supreme Court, we find that
clause(a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1284">Section 357</a> has utilized the
expression "expenses" instead of only costs. Expenses relate to
value of all things utilised in doing particular thing which would be
beyond simply the actual monetary expenditure. For instance, as
per the Oxford English Dictionary, it would include the money
paid for meals, fares, etc. by an employee in the course of their
work, which they can claim back from the employer. The Black's




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 335
 Law Dictionary defines the word "expense" as "an expenditure of
money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a result; esp.,
business expenditure chargeable against revenue for a specific
period" whereas the word "cost" as per Black's Law Dictionary is
restricted to "the amount paid or charged for something; process or
expenditure". For this reason, the expression "expenses" appearing
in <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1285">Section 357(1)(a)</a> would take into its ambit not only the costs of
the court proceedings during the criminal trial or in hearing the
appeal but also all expenses incurred after the crime till final
adjudication including the expenses incurred on investigation, steps
taken by the complainant as well as litigation generated.
</p><p id="p_1027">451. The expression "properly incurred" needs no elaboration as
it clearly ousts all wasteful and unnecessary expenditure incurred
in the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_1028">452. The expression "in prosecution" is also not determinate. We
had the occasion to examine the meaning of the expression
"prosecuted", in the decision dated 21st December, 2012 in
W.P.(C)No.7325/<a href="/doc/147477530/" id="a_1286">2010, Bheem Singh Meena v. Govt. of NCT of
Delhi &amp; Ors</a>., in the context of service jurisprudence and the
failure of a new appointee to disclose on his attestation form that
an FIR was registered against him and that a chargesheet was filed
in the court of CJM in which he had been acquitted. We have
referred to the following meanings of the expression "prosecute"
and the "prosecution" in the Black's Law Dictionary and the
Oxford Dictionary :
</p><p id="p_1029">"Black's Law Dictionary


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                pg. 336
 "Prosecute - 1. To commence and carry out a legal action. 2. To
institute and pursue a criminal action against (a person)."
Oxford Dictionary

"Prosecute - To follow up, pursue; to persevere or persist in,
follow out, go on with (some action, undertaking, or purpose) with
a view to completing or attaining it. To institute legal proceedings
against (a person) for some offence; to arraign before a court of
justice for some crime or wrong."
</p><p id="p_1030">         We have noted therefore, that the meaning of expression
"prosecution" wide enough to include "anything from registration
of a case to conviction and punishment". It was also noted that
"challenges/defences to actions for malicious prosecution are
premised on the pleading that the plaintiff was never prosecuted as
he was not convicted", underscoring the restricted interpretations of
the expression that are pressed by the legally trained minds in
courts that "prosecuted" means "convicted".
</p><p id="p_1031">453. The Oxford Dictionary refers to following up, pursuing,
persevering or persisting with some action.            The Black's Law
Dictionary refers to instituting and pursuing criminal action. Both
the dictionaries refer separately to legal proceedings.
</p><p id="p_1032">454. We have examined the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985 of
the United Kingdom, the Costs in Criminal Cases Act (Northern
Ireland) 1968, Criminal Law, England and Wales as well as the
Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 of New Zealand.                These
enactments clearly refer to costs of prosecution.          In U.K., the




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                    pg. 337
 regulations indicate the Crown Prosecution Service. <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1287">Section
357(1)(a)</a> also uses the preposition "in" and not "of" thereby
suggesting that the legislative intent and object is not to restrict
clause (a) either to court proceedings or the prosecution but would
include all expenses "reasonably incurred in prosecution" that is
from the stage when a crime occurs till final adjudication.
</p><p id="p_1033">455. The question which remains to be answered is as to whose
expenses are to be defrayed under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1288">Section 357(1)(a)</a> out of the fine
which is imposed?
</p><p id="p_1034">456. It needs to be borne in mind that the Indian criminal justice
system recognizes an important role as well as the rights of the
complainant, rights from informing the police to lodging of a
complaint at the police station, as well as filing a complaint
directly in court (<a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_1289">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C.) instituting an appeal against
an acquittal in the case or seeking enhancement of sentence. These
are all steps in prosecution of a criminal case, though by a private
complainant.            For this reason as well the expression "in
prosecution" as used in <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1290">Section 357(1)(a)</a> cannot be restricted to
the prosecution agency. It would include costs incurred by the
complainant.
</p><p id="p_1035">457. Unlike other legislations, while drafting <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1291">Section 357(1)(a)</a>,
instead of "by" or "of", the legislature has carefully used the
preposition "in". It would thus necessarily encompass all such
expenses which have been necessitated for pursuing the matter.
The 'expenses' envisaged in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1292">Section
357</a> are also therefore, not restricted merely to the expenses which


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                 pg. 338
 have been incurred by the prosecution branch of the State but also
the essential expenses incurred by the complainant or the victim for
effecting the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_1036">458. Such expenses would also necessarily be part of the financial
injury and loss which a person (‗victim' or someone entitled to
compensation under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1293">Section 357</a>) has been compelled to incur by
reason of the crime.
</p><p id="p_1037">459. There is one other instrumentality which contributes to
prosecution, which is the investigating agency. As noted above,
the use of the expression 'expenses' in the legislation instead of
reference to mere 'costs', would suggest that the legislature has
intended to apply the fine in defraying expenses properly incurred
of the investigating agency as well.
</p><p id="p_1038">460. In view of the above discussion, the expression 'prosecution'
cannot be confined to legal proceedings in court or to the expenses
incurred by the prosecution agency alone. The expression 'expenses
properly incurred in prosecution' has to encompass the expenses
incurred by the complainant, investigating agency as well as the
prosecution branch of the state. This view is supported by <a href="/doc/1656746/" id="a_1294">Section
359</a> of the CrPC. Thus in the present case, an order under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1295">Section
357(1)(a)</a> for defraying expenses properly incurred in prosecution
would cover expenses on all actions which were necessitated by
the complainant, police and the State from the time the offences
were committed till final adjudication.
</p><p id="p_1039">461. Given the statutory scheme and the mandate on the courts,
while performing their duty, it is therefore, essential for the court to

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                    pg. 339
 examine the matter and make an appropriate order in respect of
clause(a) of Section(1) of <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_1296">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. at the time of
passing the judgment. By virtue of sub-<a href="/doc/386422/" id="a_1297">section 4</a>, the appellate
court i.e. the high court or the court of session exercising revisional
powers is also empowered to make the same order.
</p><p id="p_1040">462. It is necessary to consider as to what would be the position if
a court imposes a sentence of which fine does not form a part.
Sub-section 3 of Section 357 enables the court to order the accused
person to pay by way of compensation such amount as may be
specified in the order to the person who has suffered any loss or
injury by reason of the act by which the accused person so
sentenced.         If the person who has suffered loss or injury is
compelled to incur expenses in the prosecution, the same would
necessarily form part of the financial loss which enures to such
person because of the act for which the accused person has been
convicted and sentenced. These are the principles on which the
present case has to be examined.

 loss of dear one in a family who was not only very well educated
but also gainfully employed has many facets. The loss to the family
manifests not only into tangible losses such as loss of wages etc.

<p id="p_1117">Conclusion -       Under this head the broad expenses are to be
calculated both for District Courts and the High Court during the
course of hearing of appeal. The methodology adopted under this
head is to ascertain the entire functional cost of the District
Courts/High Court for a particular year followed by dividing the
same with the number of Judges functioning in the courts. This
method was adopted as it had more merits and accuracy as
compared to calculated costs of individual Courts only on the basis
of number of officials/staff functioning there. other than the Court
staff ancillary support wings like Copying Agency, Facilitation,
Record Room and Infrastructure are also necessary for running of
each Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_1118">      There is an urgent need to ascertain the monthly, daily and
even hourly cost of running of each individual court so as to have
an empirical data to study the costing patterns.
</p>
<p id="p_1119">       General public as well as functionaries of judiciary are
supposed to know the each day's cost every court costs on the
exchequer. This would go a long way to send a message across the
Bar, Bench and the Public that unwarranted adjournments deserve
to be curtailed and contained at any cost. There is also urgent need
to have a system whereby time spent by each court on a particular
case in hour/minute format shall be recorded. This practice would
also go a long way to access the costing of each trial individually.

       In the absence of such detailed inputs, in this inquiry a rough
estimation of expenditure incurred by judiciary in this case is
sought to be ascertained. The estimation would only be an
indicative figure under the principle of approximation."
</p>
<p id="p_1121">465. The learned OSD has noted that detailed inputs were not
available and therefore provided a very rough estimation
expenditure under this heading. We have noted above the practical
difficulties in keeping the above records. In our country, several
cases are listed before the trial court as well as the High Court and
it is almost impossible to ignore the other work on assigned rosters
to give single minded attention to a single case. The report notes
that the two trials were listed on 276 and 101 dates while the three
appeals were listed on 107 days.
</p>
<p id="p_1122">         The estimation of the expenditure under this heading is
admittedly a rough estimation, which in the noted circumstances,
recovery of full estimated amount cannot be based thereon or
ordered to be recovered from the defendants. Till details of actual
court time spent on the cases is provided, it would be unfair to
compute the cost thereof.

murder, executed with premeditation, planning and full knowledge

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                             pg. 355
 of the impact of their acts. The defendants removed all signs of
identification, including the clothes of the deceased, jewellery,
watch and mobile phone and burnt his body beyond identification.
One of the defendants was at that time, facing trial for an offence
in another murder case. After a proper enquiry into the means of
the defendants, the above circumstances of the crime as well as the
non-pecuniary factors noted by us have to be factored into
consideration of the compensation by the multiplier method. This
is essential so as to ensure a ‗just' and ‗adequate compensation' to
the victim/family/dependants.
</p><p id="p_1134">468. We may note that a categorical submission was made by Mr.
Sumeet Verma and Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsels for Vikas
Yadav and Vishal Yadav that they have no objection to
computation and payment of compensation on the multiplier basis.
</p><p id="p_1135">         We may also note the endorsement of the multiplier method
for computation of compensation by Mr. Sumeet Verma who in his
written submissions has stated that the quantum of compensation
has been endorsed.

<p id="p_1141">XIV. Expenses incurred in prosecution of FIR No.192/2002

</p><p id="p_1142">471. We may note that the report submitted by Mr. S.S. Rathi,
OSD, DLSA does not take into consideration the several cases
which have been filed by the defendants at different stages in the
trial in trial courts at Dabra, Ghaziabad, Delhi; the High Courts of
Allahabad and Delhi as well as the Supreme Court of India which
had to be defended by the State as well as the complainant to
ensure the prosecution. It also does not take into consideration the
cases which were necessitated and filed by the state or the
complainant to ensure due process in the trial and for prosecution
of her complaint. We propose to examine the material available in
this regard.
</p><p id="p_1143">472. In our judgment dated 2nd April, 2014, we have adverted to
the litigation generated at the instance of the defendants as well as
legal actions which were necessary to ensure the effective
prosecution of the defendants.
</p><p id="p_1144">473. In the present consideration, we called upon all parties to
disclose litigation in regard to the FIR No.192/2002. The
complainant Nilam Katara and the State have filed the list of some
cases which we propose to discuss hereafter.           None of the
defendants have placed any such information before us. In fact, the

their status sheds valuable light on the issue under consideration.
Smt. Nilam Katara has filed a list of some cases as well.
</p><p id="p_1145">474. Despite our directions, the defence have failed to submit the
list of cases before us. On scrutiny of the record of the case, we
find that in Crl.A.No.910/2008, Smt. Nilam Katara filed
Crl.M.A.No.6376/2010, an application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1302">Section 482</a> of the
Cr.P.C. for permission to assist the court in the criminal appeal.
This application was staunchly opposed on behalf of the defendant
Vikas Yadav. In support of her application, Mrs. Nilam Katara
inter alia urged that she had filed or contested a number of petitions
in connection with FIR No.192/2002 from which the cases arose.
In this regard, the details of several cases mentioned by Mrs. Nilam
Katara have been recorded in the order dated 4th August, 2010
passed by the Division Bench allowing the application. We set
down hereunder a compilation revealed from the status report by
the State; tabulation submitted by Smt. Nilam Katara; cases noted
in the order dated 4th August, 2010 and; those which may have
been noted from the available record as well as their status

Court, though details thereof are not available.
</p><p id="p_1206">476. In a case like the present one, this litigation was essential to
ensure the effective proceedings in the trial against the convicts i.e.
prosecution.         We have noted certain legal steps taken by the
Ghaziabad police at High Court of Allahabad, Dabra, M.P.;
Ghaziabad, U.P.
</p><p id="p_1207">477. At the same time, the defendants filed several cases which
had to be defended by the State as well as the complainant in order
to prevent orders which may have interdicted effective proceedings
against these persons. To the extent that against their convictions
and sentencing by the trial court at Delhi, appeals were first filed
by the defendants in the High Court of Allahabad! These were
dismissed by the High Court of Allahabad, which dismissals were
assailed by the defendants in the Supreme Court of India.
</p><p id="p_1208">478. The expenditure which had to be incurred by the
complainant as well as the State in pursuing/defending these cases
has to form part of the "expenses properly incurred in prosecution"
as referred to in <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1345">Section 357(1)(a)</a>.                   We are of the view that
consciously of this, the three defendants have deliberately withheld
all details thereof.

incurred expenditure of over Rs.70,00,000/- in the cases.                  The

pursue the cases at every stage after the lodging of the FIR.

in every inquiry or trial, the court is required to give an opportunity
to the accused to personally explain any circumstances appearing

the right of silence to the accused when it mandates that the

effect that he shall not be called as a witness except on his own

made the subject of any comment by any of the parties or the court
or give rise to any presumption against him or any person charged

</p><p id="p_1218">486. Unfortunately, experience has shown that the unduly
exaggerated concerns with the rights of the defendants as well as
aggressive posturing by or on their behalf have discouraged courts
from proactively engaging with the acts and omissions by or on
behalf of the defendant which are way beyond the constitutional
and statutory protections. As a result of these, defendants in
criminal trials get away with misleading investigation, threatening
prosecutors, witnesses, the police and misbehaviour in courts.

 Trials are protracted because witnesses are pressurised, if not

</p><p id="p_1220">487. Our judgment dated 2nd of April, 2014 upholding the
convictions of these defendants has noted in detail several such
actions by Vikas and Vishal Yadav two of the defendants before
us. The right to silence only enables the accused person to remain
silent - it does permit the accused to, for instance, lead the police
on a wild goose chase, to say Alwar, Rajasthan as in the present
case to recover a vehicle which they know is not there but located
at another location in another State wherefrom it was actually
recovered.
</p><p id="p_1221">488. In this regard, para 2000 of our judgment dated 2nd of April,
2014 is pertinent and we extract it hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_325">         "2000.        One aspect of this conduct of accused
         persons seldom talked about is the huge demand it makes
         on the investigation agency and the criminal justice
         system both in terms of manpower but also from the
         point of view of public funds which are compelled to be
         expended. Just to visualize the expenditure incurred on
         the 28th February, 10th/11th March is mind boggling.
         The public exchequer has had to provide for the
         Ghaziabad police personnel required to escort two
         accused persons - first to go to Dabra to secure custody;
         proceed with them to Alwar and then again to Panipat -</blockquote>

         then to Karnal. Not to say the incidental costs of
         transportation boarding, etc. The already stretched police
         force can ill afford such fruit less exercises. No provision
         of our Constitution of India or the law entitles accused
         persons to abuse the protections afforded to them in this

          manner and to deliberately misguide investigations and
         the courts."
</p>

<p id="p_1223">489. The third defendant Sukhdev Yadav compelled a second trial
by absconding from justice for a period of over three years-
obviously intending to exhaust the witnesses, prosecutors and the
complainant. The rights available to the accused do not extend to
abscondance.           On the contrary, law postulates such persons to
make themselves available to the police which is searching for
them.
</p><p id="p_1224">490. In para 1603 of our judgment dated 2nd of April, 2014, we
have noted the impact of such abscondance in the following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_326">         "1603.         We also find that this abscondance is part of
         a design. Having compelled the court to proceed with the
         trial of Vikas and Vishal Yadav in the absence of their
         accomplice, by the 23rd of February 2005 when Sukhdev
         Yadav was arrested, evidence of thirty seven prosecution
         witnesses (out of a total of forty three) stood completed
         in that trial. Many of the witnesses who had been already
         examined, had to be recalled in Sukhdev‗s trial. It
         appears that the calculated attempt was to pressurise and
         exhaust witnesses; take advantage of memory fading by
         passage of time and resultant omissions and
         contradictions; orchestrated deviations; loss of evidence
         by non-availability of witnesses at the second trial. By
         his conduct, the appellant has not only violated statutory
         provisions but has obstructed the due course of justice
         and expedition in the trial."

<p id="p_1225">491. One glaring instance of the manner in which both
investigation and trials were delayed is the manner in which Bharti


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                    pg. 371
 Yadav was first shifted from one State to another i.e.                        from
Ghaziabad (U.P.) to Faridabad (Haryana) immediately after the
crime on 16/17.2.2002 to prevent access to her of the U.P. Police.
As a result, her statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_1357">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. could be
recorded only on 2nd March, 2002 by the investigating officer.
During the trial, Bharti Yadav was removed from the boundaries of
India and sent to U.K. as noted in the judgment dated 2 nd April,
2014.        Even her address was not furnished to enable the
prosecution to summon her.                    In court, she was represented by
father and an uncle of Vikas Yadav (who were also uncles of
Vishal Yadav). Bharti Yadav played hide and seek with the court
for over three years holding up the trial. This was obviously at the
instance of these defendants.
</p><p id="p_1226">492. What makes a really pathetic story is the manner in which
the inability of the prosecution to examine this witness was utilised
by the defendant Vikas Yadav in making multiple applications for
bail on the ground that in view of the delay in the trial, his
incarceration was unwarranted. The complainant had to move
heaven and earth to ensure that Bharti Yadav was examined as a
witness, in as much as the prosecutor at the trial court frustrated by
the efforts to secure her appearance and the extreme pressure put
by the defendants on the ground of the resultant delay in trial, gave
her up as a prosecution witness.                       All this generated extensive
litigation including several petitions and applications as noted
above.

          The defendants have to compensate the complainant and the
State for the expenses incurred on all this litigation by their act of
keeping Bharti Yadav out of court in as much as her examination
was an essential part in their prosecution for the crime.
</p><p id="p_1228">493. There is yet another distressing facet of the proceedings in
the present case, right from the trial to the appellate court. On the
remote chance that the other sides would either not point out or it
would escape notice, protracted arguments on principles which
have been settled by judicial pronouncements are made,
compelling wastage of judicial time.
</p><p id="p_1229">494. We also find that advantage is taken of the fact that
prosecutors are either changed or compelled to be changed.
Certainly, there is no continuity of prosecutors from the trial court
to the appellate court. As a result, important proceedings in the
higher courts are not placed before the trial courts.

challenges.          In fact, the three status reports manifest that
investigations in the present case stood really monitored by the
court in W.P.(Crl.)No.247/2002 and several of the objections
pressed before the trial court as well as us were completely
unwarranted, given the conduct of the defendants in not
challenging the status reports filed by the police.
</p><p id="p_1238">498. The constitutional or statutory protections do not permit any
defendant to mislead or misdirect the police or the courts. The
protections also do not extend to such conduct of the defendants.
They also do not tolerate the deliberate actions in misdirecting the
police and investigators. For this reason as well, costs incurred by
the prosecution in the litigation so generated have to be defrayed
out of fine which may be imposed upon them.
</p><p id="p_1239">499. It can very well be argued that law provides for penal actions
for misleading the police, it provides for action under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_1360">Contempt
of Courts Act</a> if any action impedes course of proceedings in the
court.      However, these statutory provisions do not take into
consideration the financial burden which results to the public
exchequer or the complainant as a result. We have no manner of
doubt that the defendants in the present case have to defray the
expenditure incurred by the State as well as the complainant for the
expenses incurred in the investigation, trials and all the litigation
generated because of the deliberate acts and omissions of the
defendants for their effective prosecution in FIR no.192/2002.

<p id="p_1243">XV. Sentencing Principles
</p><p id="p_1244">502. We have so far considered the several aspects relating to
procedure to be followed and the orders which a sentencing court
may pass as well as the considerations for the same.          Before
proceeding to the examination of the sentence which befits the
crimes and the defendants in the present case, we need to advert to
the jurisprudence on the principles on which sentencing must be
effected.
</p><p id="p_1245">503. Light on the question as to how a sentence is to be imposed
has to be gathered from the pronouncements of the Supreme Court
inasmuch as the legislation gives no indication. In the judgment
reported at (1974) 3 SCC 85, B.G. Goswami v. Delhi Admn., the
Supreme Court observed that the "question of sentence is always a
difficult question, requiring as it does, proper adjustment and
balancing of various considerations appropriate quantum in a
given case". It was further observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_328">         "10. ... The main purpose of the sentence broadly stated
         is that the accused must realise that he has committed
         an act which is not only harmful to the society of which
         he forms an integral part but is also harmful to his own


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                 pg. 378
          future, both as an individual and as a member of the
         society. Punishment is designed to protect society by
         deterring potential offenders as also by preventing the
         guilty party from repeating the offence; it is also
         designed to reform the offender and reclaim him as a
         law abiding citizen for the good of the society as a
         whole. Reformatory, deterrent and punitive aspects of
         punishment thus play their due part in judicial thinking
         while determining this question. In modern civilized
         societies, however, reformatory aspect is being given
         somewhat greater importance. Too lenient as well as too
         harsh sentence both lose their efficaciousness. One does
         not deter and the other may frustrate, thereby making the
         offender a hardened criminal. ...‖

</blockquote><p id="p_1246">504. We may usefully refer to the pronouncement of the Punjab
High Court reported at AIR 1960 Pun 482, <a href="/doc/1287627/" id="a_1363">Lekhraj v. State</a>. This
judgment authored by Justice Dua (as his Lordship then was), sets
out the relevance of the offender's circumstances and social milieu,
apart from the daring and reprehensible nature of the offence for
sentencing puposes.
</p><p id="p_1247">505. In its 47th Report dated 28th February, 1972, the Law
Commission of India stated that guidelines cannot direct
sentencing with mathematical precision, that sentencing discretion
to the judge must be maintained; and had summed up the
components of the proper sentence. We set down hereunder the
relevant recommendations in the 47th Report in paras 7.44, 7.45
and 7.47:
</p>
<p id="p_1248">         ―7.44 A proper sentence is a composite of many factors,

         criminal record, if any, of the offender, the age of the
         offender, the professional and social record of the
         offender, the background of the offender with reference
         to education, home life, sobriety and social adjustment,
         the emotional and mental condition of the offender, the
         prospect for the rehabilitation of the offender, the
         possibility of a return of the offender to normal life in the
         community, the possibility of treatment or of training of
         the offender, the possibility that the sentence may serve
         as a deterrent to crime by this offender, or by others, and
         the present community need, if any, for such a deterrent
         in respect to the particular type of offence involved.
</p>
<p id="p_1250">         7.45. The variables in each case, including the accused's
         prior criminal record, his background and the condition
         of his health, the prospect of rehabilitation and many
         other factors are unpredictable, and it is for this reason
         that a discretion should preferably vest with the judicial
         officer.

         7.47. For these reasons, we do not think that the
         discretion of the court to award a sentence below the
         minimum should be totally abolished. In fact, even some
         of the officers concerned with enforcement of the Acts
         agreed that it was impossible to conceive of every
         possible situation which might operate in mitigation."

         viz. imprisonment, simple or rigorous, fine and, of

         choice and flexible treatment which must be available

SCC 537, <a href="/doc/116419938/" id="a_1366">State of U.P. v. Sanjay Kumar</a>, the Supreme Court has
reiterated the need for discretion in sentencing, stating thus:

          ―21. xxx Sentencing policies are needed to address
         concerns in relation to unfettered judicial discretion and
         lack of uniform and equal treatment of similarly
         situated convicts. The principle of proportionality, as
         followed in various judgments of this Court, prescribes
         that, the punishments should reflect the gravity of the
         offence and also the criminal background of the convict.
         Thus, the graver the offence and the longer the criminal
         record, the more severe is the punishment to be
         awarded. By laying emphasis on individualised justice,
         and shaping the result of the crime to the circumstances
         of the offender and the needs of the victim and
         community, restorative justice eschews uniformity of
         sentencing. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate
         sentence would do more harm to the public system to
         undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law
         and society could not long endure under serious threats.

         befitting the crime so that the courts are able to
         accurately reflect public abhorrence of the crime. It is
         the nature and gravity of the crime, and not the criminal,
         which are germane for consideration of appropriate

         seriousness of an offence depends, apart from other
         things, also upon its harmfulness. The question is
         whether the consequences of the offence can be taken

<blockquote id="blockquote_356">         The notion of 'Just deserts' or a sentence proportionate to
         the offender's culpability was the principle which, by
         passage of time, became applicable to criminal
         jurisprudence. It is not out of place to mention that in all

          crime and punishment have not been the subject of
         debate and difference of opinion. There are no statutory
         guidelines to regulate punishment. Therefore, in practice,
         there is much variance in the matter of sentencing. In
         many countries, there are laws prescribing sentencing
         guidelines, but there is no statutory sentencing policy in
         India. The <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1382">IPC</a>, prescribes only the maximum
         punishments for offences and in some cases minimum
         punishment is also prescribed. The Judges exercise wide
         discretion within the statutory limits and the scope for
         deciding the amount of punishment is left to the judiciary
         to reach decision after hearing the parties. However,

<p id="p_1265">517. In Bachan Singh, the Constitution Bench noted that over
standardization of the sentencing policy tends to defeat its very
purpose and may actually produce opposite results and that it was
neither practicable nor desirable to imprison the sentencing
discretion of a judge in the strait-jacket of exhaustive and rigid
standards. Nevertheless, the precedents on the issue show that it
was not impossible to lay down broad guide-lines as distinguished
from iron cased standards, which will minimise the risk of arbitrary
imposition of death penalty for murder and some other offences
under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1383"> the Penal Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_1266">518.      The sentence is an amalgam of several factors including
those relating to the crime as well as the criminal, circumstances
mitigating aggravating or extenuating the offence. Deep concerns
have been expressed on the lack of uniformity and equality in
sentencing with regard to equally placed convicts because of there

 being no sentencing guidelines in place.                    The above narration
would show that considerations of proportionality of punishment
relating the sentence to the gravity of the crime, circumstances of
the criminal, needs of the victim and the community emphasise the
imperative requirement of individualized justice and sentencing
discretion for the courts. That while broad guidelines could be laid
down, it would not be proper (even if possible) to lay down rigid
standards. Therefore, the aptness of a sentence must necessarily
rest on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances of
the individual cases.

In this application, it was pointed out that post conviction, Vikas

Dayal Upadhyay Hospital ('DDU Hospital' for brevity) and was
diagnosed to be suffering from Tuberculosis.                On the

order dated 11th November, 2008 permitting Vikas Yadav only to
visit Tibia College and Hospital and the Maulana Azad Medical
College. Despite this order, the jail authorities were taking Vikas
Yadav to AIIMS on their own accord. It was also submitted that
there was no material that Vikas Yadav was suffering from any

was not available in the jail hospital, the DDU Hospital or other
government hospitals. There was no material that it was only
available in AIIMS.

regard to collusion between jail authorities, authorities at the Batra
Hospital and Vishal Yadav to keep him out of Tihar jail in the
luxurious rooms of the special/private wards of the Batra Hospital.
The applicant pointed out that while admitted in Batra Hospital, by
way of Crl.M.(Bail)No.157/2009 dated 15th December, 2009
Vishal Yadav applied for interim bail from 14 th January, 2010 to

An officer from the jail conversant with the facts of the case was
also required to appear before this court. The jail superintendent
was also called upon to submit a list of other accused persons who

noted that after 3rd June, 2008, Vikas Yadav visited AIIMS 83
times as per record which included visits for confirmation of
tuberculosis. Notice was also taken of the expenses involved in
taking the convicts to the hospitals. By the order of 2 nd February,
2012 the jail authorities as well as AIIMS were directed to produce
details of the expenditure incurred on their security, stay, treatment

prior to the visits.

the treatment, hospital visits and admissions. Accordingly, by our
order dated 16th March, 2012, we had directed the State as well as
the defendants to place on record the following:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_357">         ―(i) The rules/guidelines/policy(ies) which were in

11th March, 2013 in Crl.M.A.No.1313/2012 were filed by
defendant Vishal Yadav.
</p><p id="p_1295">527. The brief submissions dated 11th March, 2013 in
Crl.M.A.No.1168/2012 has been filed on behalf of Vikas Yadav
wherein, while relying on the report of Army Hospital, it has been
submitted by Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav
with regard to the admission in AIIMS in October, 2011 that the
admission was justified and that Vikas Yadav had been diagnosed
with Scheurman's disease D11-D12 Vertebrae with Minimal
Anterior Wedging. He has further relied on the report of AIIMS
dated 20th February, 2012 of AIIMS contending that it did not rule
out the requirement of hospitalization in October, 2011.              As
regards 80 visits outside hospitals including AIIMS, he has
submitted that the convict was in the custody of the State and was
treated at par with other convicts. As regards stay in the private

 ward, it has been submitted that the convict was in the custody of
the State and he had no choice but to go wherever he was sent for
treatment and that he was shifted to the bigger room due to the
security personnel.
</p><p id="p_1296">528. Thus full opportunity was given to the respondents/convicts
to place documents/material as well as their explanation with
regard to the medical treatment undertaken in outside hospitals and
justification for these visits. The convicts were given opportunity
also to disclose their medical condition and treatment prior to their
arrests. A direction was also issued to AIIMS to explain the
circumstances in which the ward of the convict - Vikas Yadav was
shifted from ‗B' Class private room to ‗A' Class private room.
</p><p id="p_1297">529. On the 23rd March 2012, we were informed by the State that
prior to 10th February, 2011, no guidelines had been formulated by
the authorities with regard to referrals of Tihar jail inmates to
outside hospitals. Learned counsel for the parties were also heard
on the issue of costs involved during such visits. The importance
of the issue was noted by us in paras 4 and 5 of the order which
reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_359">         ―4. The instant matter raises serious controversies
         with regard to the outside hospital visits of the
         respondent nos.2 &amp; 3. The very need for the
         referrals; the visits; their periodicity; and their
         duration has been strongly disputed before us.</blockquote>
<p id="p_1298">         5.     We are aware that medical science is not a
         definite science but it would be a travesty of justice if
         outside referrals of prisoners are made
         unwarrantedly and such visits facilitated at public
         expense. It is also grossly unfair if such outside


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                       pg. 396
          referrals are sought/obtained utilizing the shield of
         non-existent medical condition(s). It also requires
         examination as to whether valuable medical facilities
         which are deficient have been misused and that too at
         public expense. Indulgence granted by the court or
         facilities provided by the jail authorities are not to be
         abused. Whenever jail and medical facilities have
         been misused by prisoners, be it as undertrials or as
         convicts, the matter is of serious concern. It is,
         therefore, necessary also to ascertain the culpability
         in this matter and fix the responsibility and initiate
         appropriate action against all including those remiss
         in the discharge of their duties.‖

</p><p id="p_1299">530. We had also noted in the order dated 23rd March, 2012 that
the court may not be competent to make an assessment of the
gravity of the medical condition of any person or to assess the
records received from the Batra Hospital and AIIMS.             It was
consequently deemed appropriate to appoint a committee of
medical experts to facilitate the consideration and adjudication by
us. Consequently, we had caused an independent assessment and
evaluation of the medical condition of the two convicts based on
the records produced by the hospitals, the material produced by
the convicts and their examination, if deemed necessary, to be
conducted by a Committee of relevant experts constituted by the
Medical Superintendent, Army Research and Referral Hospital,
Delhi Cantt. (‗Army Hospital' hereafter) certified copies of the
record was sent to the Army Hospital. The Committee was given
opportunity to examine the records filed by the two hospitals in the
court; and to seek production of the original record from this court.

 The Committee was empowered to call any other records, seek
appearance and make enquiries of the doctors or any of the
personnel from AIIMS, Batra Hospital, DDU Hospital and Tihar
jail for the purposes of making an objective evaluation.           The
committee of the Army Hospital was given liberty to permit the
parties and/or counsels to assist in the scrutiny of the record and to
assist it in the evaluation thereof. By our order dated 23rd March,
2012, the committee was required to submit a report within six
weeks on the following aspects :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_360">         ―(a) the medical condition of Vikas Yadav and
         Vishal Yadav for the period prior to January, 2012;

         hospital visit/admission which was not spent in the

</blockquote><p id="p_1301">531. In order to enable this court to issue directions so that no
under trial or convict is able to exercise undue influence or to
persuade the jail authorities to take them on unnecessary outside
hospital visits, by the order dated 17th August, 2012, the Medical
Superintendent, DDU Hospital and Director General, Tihar Jail
was required to examine the availability of facilities at the jail
hospitals and to submit a report to us.

hospital visits and admissions of the two convicts separately.

<p id="p_1304">(i)      Hospital visits and admissions of Vikas Yadav
</p><p id="p_1305">534. So far as Vikas Yadav is concerned, we are informed that he
was brought to Tihar Jail on 9th July, 1999 and remained there till
27th September, 1999 as an under trial in FIR No.287/1999 (known
as the Jessica Lal murder case). He was thereafter brought on 16th
September, 2002 to the Central Jail, Tihar as an under trial in the
case arising out of FIR No.192/2002, P.S. Kavi Nagar, Ghaziabad
(present case) and has remained in jail ever since.                  He was
convicted and sentenced on 30th May, 2008.
</p><p id="p_1306">535. The Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar has filed a
status report dated 2nd February, 2012 stating that Vikas Yadav's
reference to AIIMS started in the year 2008 on account of an
opinion dated 3rd June, 2008 given by Medical Superintendent,
DDU Hospital requiring him to be sent to AIIMS for further
treatment of tuberculosis. Thereafter, the convict was being sent to

 AIIMS on the advice of the "treating doctor". Further treatment in
respect of an orthopaedic problem is also stated to have been
suggested by the treating doctor at AIIMS. As per this status report
dated 2nd February, 2012, Vikas Yadav has visited AIIMS 83
times.

information received by her in response to her query under Right to
<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1385">Information Act</a> that no supporting documentation is available of
hospital visits of the convict Vikas Yadav. Ninety eight hospital
visits between January, 2008 and 14th December, 2011 have been
tabulated therein which include visits to the DDU Hospital; AIIMS
and the LNJP Hospital. In order to get a full picture, it is essential
to set out the details thereof which read as follows :

January, 2008; 8th November, 2008. Then in the month of March,
2009, he paid visits to this department on 3rd; 12th, 13th, 16th and
25th March, 2009! It is inexplicable as to how so many visits to the
Department of Microbiology at such short periods were necessary.
He has visited the Medicine OPD at AIIMS at intervals of two
weeks/for ‗fever' and ‗cough'. Vikas Yadav visited the Medicine
OPD/DDU Hospital on 31st May, 2008 then on 10th June, 2008 and
then the Chest Clinic/AIIMS on 22nd August, 2008. Thirty two

 Tibya College and Hospital; MAIDS for ‗needful'. Similarly for
the purposes of ‗for review', Vikas Yadav has gone 31 times to
AIIMS. After visiting the Medicine OPD at AIIMS on 5th August,
2008, he visits the same department on 8th, 13th, and 20th August,
2008. In between, on the 7th August, 2008, he visited Radiology
OPD at AIIMS.               Similarly Vikas Yadav has visited the Chest
Clinic at AIIMS on 12th September, 2008.               In October and
November, 2008, he visited the Chest Clinic at AIIMS on 10th, 17th,
31st October, 2008 as well as 7th and 14th November, 2008. In
January, 2009, he visited Chest Clinic on 9th and 16th January,
2009. Again in February, 2009, he visited the Chest Clinic on 6th,
11th, 13th, 14th and 20th February, 2009.
</p><p id="p_1316">538. If an ultrasound of the appellant had been done on 4th June,
2008, why was it repeated on 2nd July, 2008? Three visits to the
Orthopaedics OPD to AIIMS in less than a month from between
11th July, 2008 to 1st August, 2008. In August, 2008, Vikas Yadav
has visited one or the other department of AIIMS on the 1st, 5th, 7th,
8th, 13, 20th, 22nd, 25th and 27th August, 2008.
</p><p id="p_1317">539. In almost every month, the convict has had repeated outings
out of jail. If the convict was being treated in the medicine, chest
and orthopaedics of AIIMS, where was the need for him to go to
Tibitia hospital as well. For dental treatment, the convict was
visiting MAIDS as well as AIIMS. He visited the orthopaedic
department of AIIMS three times within 10 days (3 rd, 4th and 13th
May, 2009). He goes for physiotherapy to AIIMS on 16th May,
2009. He has got MRI of the left knee and X-rays done in the

 radiology department of LNJP Department on 20th, 25th and 26th
August, 2011. He is taken to the LNJP Hospital for collection of
the MRI report on 29th August, 2011. Is it possible to have three
MRIs of the left knee undertaken in six days? And even if he had
to visit AIIMS, could not the visits to the various departments be
combined in a single visit to AIIMS?
</p><p id="p_1318">540. No details of the treatment in these OPD visits of Vikas
Yadav have been provided either by Vikas Yadav, the jail
authorities or hospital authorities including AIIMS.
</p><p id="p_1319">541. The above tabulation would amply establish the fact that he
was being taken outside the Tihar jail for minor complaints -
‗fever, cough' at short intervals without any justification. There is
not an iota of supporting material to suggest that Vikas Yadav was
suffering from such sickness or at least a major illness which could
not be treated at the jail hospital or DDU, LNJP. There would
certainly be no occasion for visiting a super speciality referral
hospital as AIIMS at such short intervals. The information shows
that he has been taken out of jail for the ―needful‖. What was the
needful and what was done? Where was the need for the convict to
visit the hospital to get a date for CECT or to collect a MRI report
or any other report?
</p><p id="p_1320">542. A discharge summary dated 4th November, 2011 recorded by
AIIMS for Vikas Yadav's admission from 10th October, 2011 to 4th
November, 2011 also discloses another interesting fact.        Vikas
Yadav was diagnosed with Pulmonary TB in 2008 for which "he
took ATT for 4.5 months (stopped by self with symptomatic


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 improvement)". The above noting in the discharge summary
manifests that either Vikas Yadav did not contract tuberculosis at
all (there being no record of medication) or that he was "cured‖
within 4½ months of the commencement of anti T.B. treatment, if
at all he took any!
         The discharge summary also establishes that between 2008
till middle of 2011, Vikas Yadav was a healthy person without
tuberculosis and there was no real need for the hospital visits to
AIIMS of Vikas Yadav pursuant to the recommendation dated 3rd
June, 2008 of Medical Superintendent, DDU Hospital for this
disease.
</p><p id="p_1321">         We may also note that there is no record at all with regard to
the infection and treatment for tuberculosis, if Vikas Yadav
actually had the disease or underwent treatment for it or was it
really an enabling excuse used as a shield to get out of the prison?
</p><p id="p_1322">543. In the communication dated 15th February, 2012, of the

details of medication which was advised to Vikas Yadav during his

</p><p id="p_1324">         The above medication also does not point towards any
disease requiring visits to a super speciality referral hospital as
AIIMS.
</p><p id="p_1325">544. Pursuant to our order dated 2nd February, 2012, Vikas Yadav
and Vishal Yadav were medically examined by a Board of the
following five specialists and super specialists of AIIMS in the
relevant medical disciplines:
</p><p id="p_1326">(i)      Dr. S. Wadhwa, Professor, Deptt. of P.M.R.
</p><p id="p_1327">(ii)     Dr. A. Jayaswal, Professor, Deptt. of Orthopaedics.
</p><p id="p_1328">(iii)    Dr. S. Chumber, Professor, Deptt. of Surgery.

</p><p id="p_1330">(v)      Dr. I.B. Singh, Addl. Professor, Hosp. Admn.
</p>
<p id="p_1331">545. The Board examined Vikas Yadav on 9th 10th and 13th
February, 2012; scrutinized the entire medical record relating to
Vikas Yadav; took a detailed clinical history as well as physical
examination of Vikas Yadav and opined as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_368">         ―Final conclusion and Recommendations of the
         Medical Board:</blockquote>

<p id="p_1332">         Based on the information obtained by review of medical
         reports shown by the jail authorities, detailed history
         and findings of the clinical examination plus relevant
         investigations, it is reported that Sh. Vikas Yadav is able
         to perform all the activities of daily living without
         assistance and is currently not suffering from any acute
         or severe medical condition which requires


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          hospitalization or active intervention - medical surgical
         or investigational.     His current condition can be
         managed by taking appropriate care and medications.‖
                            (Emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_1333">546. The Board of experts at AIIMS has reported that Vikas
Yadav was not suffering from any acute medical condition. Vikas
Yadav was procuring his own medication and would be possessed
of the records in this regard. Nothing has been produced to support
that he actually took any medication. The medication prescribed
would also establish that Vikas Yadav was not suffering from any
major sickness necessitating visits to a super speciality hospital.
For all these reasons, we have no hesitation in holding that the
hospital visits and admission were not necessary.
</p><p id="p_1334">547. As per the status report dated 2nd February, 2012 of the
Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar, between 5th July, 2010 to
2nd February, 2012, apart from hospital visits, Vikas Yadav had
additionally left the jail for court appearances on 15 occasions (5th
July, 2010, 1st September, 2010, 1st October, 2010, 9th November,
2010, 4th January, 2011, 7th February, 2011, 3rd March, 2011, 2nd
May, 2011, 13th May, 2011, 1st June, 2011, 14th June, 2011, 8th
July, 2011, 1st August, 2011, 12th August, 2011, 5th September,
2011). The report states that for this purpose, the convict was
handed over to the DAP authorities a day prior to the court date
and was admitted back after attending the date. The convict was
sent for custody parole on 14th April, 2011 and 29th/30th April,
2011.

</p><p id="p_1336"> 548. It is manifest from the above discussion that visits to the
hospital have been utilised by the prisoner to procure outings from
the jail. These visits were unnecessary and not for any medical
reason, in any case not for any serious ailment which could not be
treated at an ordinary facility.
</p>
<p id="p_1337">(a)      Admission in AIIMS of Vikas Yadav

</p><p id="p_1338">549. Amongst the several visits to AIIMS, on 1st October, 2011,
Vikas Yadav visited the Department of Radiology, AIIMS for a
CAT scan of the left thigh. On 3rd October, 2011, he visited the
Orthopaedic department of AIIMS for review and again visited
AIIMS on 7th October, 2011 when he was advised admission in
AIIMS (private ward) for evaluation of MRI of left thigh, bone
scan and possible PET-CT scan. We are appalled to note the advice
of admission for ―evaluation‖ of an MRI and a bone scan. Let us
examine the events which transpired as a result of this advice.
</p><p id="p_1339">550. On 10th October, 2011, Vikas Yadav was admitted to AIIMS
for undergoing a PET-CT scan. Initially he was placed in a 'B'
Class room in the private ward but immediately thereafter, was
shifted to an 'A' Class luxury room. He was discharged on the 4th
of November, 2011 without any PET Scan having been conducted
or any diagnosis being made. During this period, neither any test
was done nor any treatment was provided to him.
</p><p id="p_1340">551. The office of the Superintendent, Central Jail No.3 under
covering letter No.F.3/SCJ-3/ASW/2014/2473 dated 8th December,
2014 has placed the medical report submitted by the Medical


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                    pg. 409
 Officer Incharge, Central Jail No.3 Dispensary in respect of Vikas
Yadav before us. The photocopy of outdoor patient tickets of the
Central Jail Hospital which have been placed shows that Vikas
Yadav attended the Radiology Department of the LNJP Hospital on
26th August, 2011 when he had got an MRI as well as X-rays done
which was received by him on 30th August, 2011. The referral of
the orthopaedic department of AIIMS on 1st September, 2011 gives
no reason or aggravation in any medical condition. After the MRI
in LNJP, Vikas Yadav visited the AIIMS on 16th September, 2011
to get his MRI undertaken. Why was this necessary?
</p><p id="p_1341">552. Interestingly, the record of the Central Jail No.4 also shows
that Vikas Yadav was being taken to the Radiology Department of
the LNJP Hospital earlier. No reason as to why the SCAN could
not be performed in any other Governments Hospital which he was
visiting is forthcoming.               There is no recommendation, referral,
evaluation, approval or authorization by the jail medical experts or
the DDU Hospital for this reference or admission.
</p><p id="p_1342">553. The discharge summary dated 4th November, 2011 records
the diagnosis as "suspected Sheurman's disease". The medical
record shows that the treatment which was prescribed for Vikas
Yadav by AIIMS on 4th November, 2011 was as follows:
</p><pre id="pre_35">         ―(i)     Physiotherapy &amp; mobilization
         (ii)     T-Nervemax 75 mg BD
         (iii)    T-Utracet 1TDS x 5 days
         (iv)     T-Pan - 40 1BD
         (v)      Incentive spirometry 2 hrsly, steam inhalation 6
                  hrsly.‖




</pre><p id="p_1343">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          Vikas Yadav was thus prescribed a nerve vitamin (T-
Nervemax); a pain killer (Ultra-cet) and an anti-acid (TPan) during
and after his hospitalisation. It is evident from the above that there
was no such medical condition requiring treatment by a super-
speciality hospital as AIIMS, let alone admission for twenty six
days.
</p><p id="p_1344">554. In its report of proceedings dated 14th June, 2012, on this
admission to AIIMS from 10th October to 4th November, 2011, the
Army Hospital Committee has noted the following:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_369">         ―3. The Board, having perused all the medical
         records produced before it has come to the following
         conclusions:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_370">         (a) Mr. Vikas Yadav was diagnosed to have
         Pulmonary Tuberculosis in 2008. He received anti-
         Tubercular treatment for a period of 04 to 05 months
         and stopped it on his own. Details of the basis of
         diagnosis and drugs administered are not available in
         the documents provided.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_371">         (b) He was admitted at AIIMS with effect from 10
         Oct 2011 to 04 Nov 2011 for low backache and pain
         left knee joint. His final diagnosis and detailed
         observations of the Board are recorded as per
         Appendix ‗A' to this report.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_372">         (c) The PET-CT Scan of the spine was carried out at
         a later date i.e. FDG/18725/11 dated 07/12/11, and this
         did not reveal any abnormality.

dated 14th June, 2012) which gave details of hospitalization of

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 411
 Vikas Yadav at AIIMS from 10th October, 2011 (for 26 days), his
discharge diagnosis was Scheurman's disease D11-D12 Vertebrae
with Minimal Anterior Wedging. The Board additionally made the
following remarks:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_374">         ―(a) Admitted for complaints of Low Backache and
         pain (Lt) Knee joint. MRI done. Revealed only
         degenerative changes in dorsal vertebrae.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_375">         (b) Made good clinical recovery on conservative
         treatment and physiotherapy. Admission was justified
         for evaluation, observation and treatment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_376">         (c) A PET-CT Scan was advised and jail authorities
         were asked to provide money for the same. Inordinate
         delay was experienced in obtaining the money. Hence,
         hospital stay got prolonged. Ultimately, patient was
         discharged without carrying out the scan. The scan
         was done on 07 Dec 2011 on outpatient basis, and
         reported normal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_377">         (d) As per hospital records, Mr. Vikas Yadav was
         reported to be absent from his hospital bed on two
         separate occasions on the night of 26/27 Oct 2011. The
         first absence was from 08.30 PM to 12.00 AM and the
         second from 00.45 AM to 06.00 AM. The matter was
         reported by the ward sister to the resident doctor on
         duty, who further informed the Ward in-charge of Ortho
         ward and the Nursing supervisor, and endorsed the same
         in the case notes maintained in the ward.‖
                             (Emphasis by us)


</blockquote><p id="p_1346">556. We are pained to note that the Army Hospital (R&amp;R)
Committee has merely extracted the expressions ("justified",
"advised") used in the other hospital from the records placed
before it without recording its independent opinion. ―Degenerative
changes‖ would be a result of passage of time and aging which



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                               pg. 412
 every person undergoes. No hospitalisation was recommended for
this condition. It is left to this court to draw its conclusions from
the noted facts and circumstances.
</p><p id="p_1347">557. From the above disclosures, it also appears that Vikas Yadav
was either not afflicted with tuberculosis or the infection was so
minimal that it could be cured without the standard medication
regime for the disease.
</p><p id="p_1348">558. As per the department of Orthopaedics of AIIMS, Vikas
Yadav was "complaining of pain in the left upper thigh and had
acute back pain which had worsened over the last few weeks". The
discharge summary issued by the AIIMS to Vikas Yadav on the 4 th
of November, 2011 records that the patient was complaining of low
backache and pain in left thigh for four months! It would appear
that this back pain got cured without any medical intervention. The
record of AIIMS thus establishes that there was no emergency and
no acute condition critically requiring the PET scan or requiring his
hospitalization for the purposes of taking the SCAN.
</p><p id="p_1349">559. After our order dated 4th February, 2012, a communication
No.SMO/CJ-4/2012/2350 dated 15th February, 2012 has been sent
by the Medical Officer Incharge, Central Jail No.4, Tihar to the
Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar which has been placed on
record to explain this admission. So far as the reference of Vikas
Yadav to the AIIMS is concerned, the manner and reasons therefor,
stated in this communication dated 15th February, 2012 read thus:
</p><p id="p_1350">         ―As per medical record the patient was referred to DDU
         hospital in Aug-2011 for evaluation and Management of



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          pain in Lt. Knee. The Doctors of DDU hospital referred
         the patient to AIIMS Deptt. of Orthopedics on
         30.08.2011 for opinion regarding his knee pain/need for
         arthroscopy (Annexure 1). There after the inmate was
         referred to AIIMS Deptt. of orthopaedics for further
         evaluation/Management/follow up as per the advice of
         treating Doctor. The inmate refused to take any
         medicines from CJ-4 Dispensary as he is taking the
         medicines on his own as stated by the inmate. The
         details of visits to outside hospitals as per medical
         record is enclosed (page No. 1 to 6). As per Medical
         Record he was treated for tubercular Lymphadenopathy
         in 2008 (ATT started on 06.06.2008 and stopped in
         November/December, 2008).
</p><p id="p_1351">         His PET - CT Scan conducted at AIIMS on dated
         07.12.2011 reveals - No definite evidence of any active
         disease.‖
                             (Emphasis by us)

</p><p id="p_1352">560. As per an affidavit dated 22nd February, 2012 filed by
Medical Superintendent, AIIMS, "the issue of non-receipt of
payment of charges of PET-CT from the jail authorities became the
reason of continuing his admission in AIIMS".          What was the
emergency for admission (if required) without even receipt of
charges for the scan, if it was not a mere shield for facilitating him
in staying outside prison. And if funds were the sole reason for
keeping Vikas Yadav in hospital, we fail to understand as to why
he was discharged at all without undertaking such PET?
</p>
<p id="p_1353">(b)      Change of room category

</p><p id="p_1354">561. The payment record submitted by AIIMS shows that Vikas
Yadav was put in a ‗B' Class private room on 10th October, 2011.
</p>


<p id="p_1355">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 He was shifted to ‗A' Class (Deluxe) room on 11 th October, 2011.
What is the difference between 'A' Class deluxe room and the ‗B'
Class private rooms? This is disclosed in para 4 of the affidavit of
the Medical Superintendent, AIIMS dated 21st March, 2012 which
reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_378">         ―4. That the difference between A type &amp; B type
         rooms is primarily of the size since both type of rooms
         are single seater rooms with attached toilet. The size
         of B class room in old private ward is approx. 26 sq.
         mtr. and size of A class room in new pvt. ward is
         approx. 32 sq. mtr. Therefore there is only marginal
         difference of size in these two types of rooms.‖


         Thus the ‗B' class rooms are the ‗old', while ‗A' class rooms

are in the ‗new' private ward of AIIMS. The difference between

the two is in the size and charges for the room.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1356">562. The affidavit makes a further very interesting disclosure. In
para 5 of this affidavit, the Medical Superintendent has disclosed
the following information as the reason for keeping a patient in the
‗A' Type or ‗B' type private room:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_379">         ―5. That since the old private ward is located within
         the main hospital building, and as a matter of precaution
         from the patient care point of view relatively serious
         patients (who are more sick) are preferably kept/
         admitted in the old pvt. ward, since it is easier for the
         doctor to reach on being called as &amp; when required and
         likelihood of doctor being called SOS is more in case(s)
         of relatively seriously ill patients than stable patients.</blockquote>
<p id="p_1357">         The ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) &amp; HDU's (High
         Dependency Units) and other centralized facilities like


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

          radio-diagnosis &amp; operation threatres are also located in
         the Main Hospital Building, which is attached with the
         Old Pvt. Ward. The relatively sick patient as and when
         required can be very easily shifted to the ICU/HDU/OT
         if required, whereas it is not only time taking but at time
         difficult as well for the relatively sick patient to be
         shifted to ICU/HDU/OT, without loss of time, as it take
         some time for the shifting of the patient from the New
         Pvt. Ward. The relatively less serious or stable patients
         are preferably kept admitted in new private ward since
         likelihood of urgently calling doctor on duty are less in
         such patients.‖
                            (Underlining by us)

</p><p id="p_1358">563. In para 5, the Medical Superintendent has admitted that
Vikas Yadav was shifted to the ‗A' Class room for the reason that
he was a stable patient whose possibility of urgently requiring a
doctor on duty was much less. It is also stated that the
transfer/shifting of Vikas Yadav was done in ―routine manner‖ as
per above practice without any consideration of his being a
prisoner and without reference to the jail authorities. It clearly
establishes that Vikas Yadav was a stable patient for whom the
likelihood of requiring urgent medical care was less, so he could be
kept away from the centralized facilities at AIIMS. The Medical
Superintendent, AIIMS has also explained that ‗B' Type rooms are
more in demand. Judicial notice requires to be taken of the long
line of critically ill patients waiting to be admitted to the AIIMS for
treatment in any ward.                 And yet a healthy prisoner has been
permitted to occupy and room for twenty six days thereby enabling
him to avoid the prison.

</p><p id="p_1360"> 564. This court had directed information with regard to private
ward hospitalization of other prisoners in AIIMS. In this regard, in
para 8 of the affidavit dated 21st March, 2012 of the Medical
Superintendent, it is disclosed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_380">         ―8. As regards pvt. ward hospitalization of other
         prisoner patients, it is informed that several jail patients
         have been given the facility of private ward
         hospitalization on the advice of the treating/consulting
         doctors only in the past as well including Sh. Pappu
         Yadav, Dr. Ketan Desai and Sh. Amar Singh.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_381">         9.      The jail inmate patient Sh. Amar singh was
         initially admitted in new private ward in Room
         No.2018, A type room on 12.9.2011 and was later
         shifted to Old Private Ward 14.09.2011 in Room
         No.301 A type room on account of need of regular
         monitoring required in view of his illness.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_1361">565. Since a question has been raised as to the authority with
which the hospital shifted the convict to ‗A' class room, in para 10
of the affidavit, AIIMS has sought to take the shield that the
admission was effected only after the payment was received from
the jail and because the jail made such payment, it was with their
approval. Given this statement that room change was effected only
after receipt of payment from the jail, AIIMS explanation that
Vikas Yadav was kept admitted as payment for the PET was
awaited is unbelievable, to say the least. This conduct on the part
of the jail authorities (if they paid for the ‗A' class deluxe room
and not for the SCAN) and AIIMS reeks of the collusion with the
prisoner to enable his stay in comfort outside of jail.

</p><p id="p_1363"> 566. PET-CT scans ordinarily do not require admission into
hospital, unless there is a medical condition of the patent requiring
his admission. The most telling circumstance which establishes
beyond doubt that the hospitalization from 10th October, 2011 to 4th
November, 2011 for undergoing the PET scan was completely
unwarranted is the fact that the PET-CT scan of Vikas Yadav was
not done even in his AIIMS visit on 28th November, 2011 for the
same purpose. It was done only on 7th December, 2011 as an out
patient i.e. almost two months after his admission on 10 th October,
2011 which did not reveal any abnormality.             This establishes
beyond doubt the fact that there was no urgency in getting the scan
and certainly no requirement Vikas Yadav's for hospital admission,
let alone for a hospital stay of twenty six days.

Diwali.
</p><p id="p_1370">570. Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for Vikas Yadav has
orally submitted that Vikas Yadav had gone to visit some doctor
friend in the AIIMS hostel. No details of such friend are disclosed.
No information was given to the doctor or nurse on duty. The
information given is to the contrary.

walk as part of Vikas Yadav's physiotherapy regime. We find this
explanation completely unacceptable. It is not supported by any
hospital record. Furthermore, no person would undertake a walk as
part of physiotherapy in the middle of the night. Also why was
such walk taken on the night of Diwali alone and on no other
night? Again no intimation thereof was given to any authority.
</p><p id="p_1372">572. It cannot be disputed that if the hospital stay was warranted,
the convict was required to restrict his movement to the hospital
room. Instead, he has been found missing on the several occasions

 as noted in the original record of case sheets by the medical
authorities on duty.
</p><p id="p_1373">573. It would appear that after the hospital visits were
highlighted, the Delhi Police has taken the matter seriously. Head
Constable Ishwar Singh and Constable Ramesh Kumar had been
detailed to ensure the proper care and custody of the convict in the
AIIMS on the dates in question. In view of these absences of the
convict from the hospital room, the police treated the same as
misconduct on the part of these two police officials who were
placed under suspension vide an office order dated 27th March,
2012 and subjected to a disciplinary inquiry. The inquiry officer,
Inspector Rajeshwar Aggarwal conducted the inquiry in which six
witnesses which included the doctors and nursing sisters at the
AIIMS were examined. Based on the evidence recorded during the
inquiry, the inquiry officer recorded his findings that the charges
against the Head Constable Ishwar Singh and Constable Ramesh
Kumar were fully substantiated beyond any shadow or doubt. The
disciplinary authority caused a copy of the report of the inquiry
officer to be served upon the police officials on 24 th July, 2012.
After considering their joint reply and hearing the defaulters on 3 rd
August, 2012, the disciplinary authority inter alia held as follows :

         the PWs as well as relied upon documentary evidence.
         The pleas taken by the defaulters are devoid of
         substance. The contentions raised by the defaulters in
         their defense statement have been discussed by the
         Enquiry Officer at length in his finding.

         from 12.45 AM to 6.00 AM of the intervening night of

</p><p id="p_1379">574. Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel has submitted that as per the
call details of the two aforesaid police officials, they were in the
area of Vasant Kunj during the relevant time. Mr. De, learned
counsel would suggest that the father of Vikas Yadav has a
farmhouse in this area and from these call details, the location of
the defendant on the night of the Diwali festival is established. In
support       of     this     submission,          reliance   is   placed   on      the
pronouncement of Supreme Court reported at 1992 4 SCC 172

even temporary escape is an offence and punishable under <a href="/doc/1522870/" id="a_1387">Section
224</a> of the IPC. The further submission is that life imprisonment
means rigorous imprisonment and even if a convict was sentenced
to simple imprisonment, such absence tantamounts to escape from
custody.

<p id="p_1413">         Therefore, for the hospital admission in AIIMS in respect of
Vikas Yadav from 10th October, 2011 to 4th November, 2011, the
State has spent Rs.50750/- on room rent and diet.
</p><p id="p_1414">581. As per the hospital record placed before us shows that Vikas
Yadav was also enjoying ―own diet‖ during his AIIMS admission.
The Tihar jail would not have permitted him the luxury of enjoying
home cooking or "outings" from the prison on festivals or other
occasions while undergoing rigorous imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_1415">582. It is clearly stated in the affidavit from the jail that there are
no policy guidelines by the jail authorities regarding private ward
room to be allotted to a jail inmate patient or its class. Such being
the position, it was incumbent upon the authorities of the AIIMS to
have informed the jail authorities about the substantial difference
of about Rs.600/- per day in the cost of the rooms and obtaining
specific approval from the competent jail authority, before
changing the room.
</p><p id="p_1416">583. So far as the excuse for admission to a larger room that such
patients have larger security personnel or secretarial staff



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                          pg. 427
 accompanying is concerned, we find that it is no ground at all for
admitting jail inmates in ‗A' type room. A prisoner can have no
access at all to any ―secretarial staff‖. If the reason that security
personnel accompany jail inmates was a reason for allotting ‗A'
Type private rooms, then the hundreds of jail inmates who require
visits to hospitals or admissions therein would all be entitled to
identical facilities.          It is obvious that completely specious and
untenable grounds have been set out in the affidavit in order to
create the semblance of an explanation for the completely
unwarranted hospitalization of Vikas Yadav in the private ward, be
it Type ‗B' or Type ‗A' rooms of the private ward in AIIMS.
</p><p id="p_1417">584. The Medical Superintendent cites instances of only three
prisoners as having been kept in Type ‗A' private rooms in the
affidavit which shows that such facilities are not available to all jail
inmates but a chosen few. Is it possible that no other prisoner has
ever been admitted in AIIMS for treatment? If yes, then they have
obviously been kept in the general wards - with their security.
</p><p id="p_1418">585. It is common sense that private hospitalization is for
treatment of a serious sickness or if quarantization is required.
Whether the patient was kept in the general ward or a private ward,
makes no difference at all to the treatment of a disease. The
difference only is of the facilities enjoyed by the prisoner in the
private ward. And, of course, to the expenses incurred by the
public exchequer which would grossly increase if the prisoner was
kept in a private ward.
</p>



<p id="p_1419">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 428
</p><p id="p_1420"> 586. It needs no special information regarding the practice in
private hospitals that the cost of investigations, treatment and case
fees for doctor visits etc. increases in direct proportion to the class
of room/facility to which the person is admitted.                  Therefore,
treatment in an ‗A' class facility/ward in a private hospital may
cost two or three times than that for same investigation/treatment
etc. in a ‗B' class facility/ward, and up to six times what it would
cost in the general ward.                  The difference of Rs.600/- per day
maintained in the room charges in AIIMS between 'A' and 'B' type
room manifests this position in AIIMS as well. We ask a question,
why should this be permitted at the cost of the public exchequer?
Especially, if treatment or medicare of the person does not require
so? And if the same is warranted, why should not such facility be
made available to every prisoner, irrespective of his/her
economic/social/political standing or position as the right to life
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1388">Article 21</a> of our Constitution guarantees equal
protection of our right to life without any such distinction and it is
the State's responsibility to protect the same, especially of
prisoners?
</p><p id="p_1421">587. Despite our specific order dated 16th March, 2012, the jail
authorities offer no explanation as to why one prisoner will go to
the private ward of AIIMS while another goes to general ward.
Neither AIIMS nor the jail authorities disclose why and on what
basis such privileges are extended. Certainly it is not the stand of
these authorities that there is necessarily a correlation between the
seriousness of the medical condition of the prisoner and the


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                          pg. 429
 room/bed to which he is admitted in AIIMS. Or that only certain
class of prisoners suffer ailments requiring admissions in exclusive
hospital wards which the jail authorities (i.e. the public exchequer)
must fund.
</p><p id="p_1422">588. Hospitals need to take special care in this regard where
treatment of prisoners is concerned inasmuch as the expenses are
borne by the public exchequer. Furthermore unless, the concerned
and competent security agency or the prison authority has verified
and recommended special facilities because of the nature of disease
or some special security concerns of a prisoner, all prisoners would
be entitled to the same treatment.

<p id="p_1423">(ii)     Hospital visits and admissions of Vishal Yadav

</p><p id="p_1424">589. Nilam Katara also filed Crl.M.A.No.1313/2012 dated 2nd
January, 2012 complaining that misusing financial and political
position with impunity, Vishal Yadav, also a life convict is also
being unnecessarily and repeatedly taken to visit the Batra Hospital
and Medical Research Centre for treatment of tuberculosis. The
applicant pointed out that Vishal Yadav was initially taken to the
DDU Hospital which referred him to AIIMS where he was
diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis. Pursuant to an order
dated 24th March, 2004, he was permitted to visit Batra Hospital
when he was an under trial person. Without any court orders or
any reference by the DDU Hospital, after the conviction, Vishal
Yadav has been taken to Batra Hospital almost 70 times for minor




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                 pg. 430
 complaints. As per the complainant, out of 70 visits, 40 were for
mere review, two were mysteriously recorded as ―the needful‖.
</p><p id="p_1425">590. As per the status report dated 2nd February, 2012, Vishal
Yadav was admitted on 16th September, 2002 in the Central Jail,
Tihar and remained in custody till 10th October, 2005 as an under
trial.    He was re-admitted to jail on 28th May, 2008 upon his
conviction and sentenced to life imprisonment on 30 th May, 2008.
Since 28th January, 2009, Vishal Yadav was lodged in Central Jail
No.4, Tihar.

of the following hospital visits by Vishal Yadav:

December, 2003 to 14th January, 2012. That most of them were
unnecessary is writ large even on the scanty information placed
before us. This defendant made six hospital visits in 40 days
between 6th December, 2003 to 12th January, 2004 (on 6th, 12th, 18th

 December, 2003; 1st, 8th and 12th January, 2004) for gastro review
in the G.B. Pant Hospital (GBPH).                      He again goes for a gastro
review and follow-up on 10th February, 2004; 10th and 25th April,
2004. He goes to the medicine OPD in the Deen Dayal Upadhyay
Hospital (DDU Hospital) on 3rd and 4th June, 2004 consecutively.
Thereafter on short intervals (31st August; 3rd, 22nd and 30th
September, 2004), he visits the medicine OPD in the Batra
Hospital for medicine reviews. For the same purpose, he visits the
medicine OPD of Batra Hospital five times (6th, 20th and 27th
December, 2004; 5th, 17th January, 2005). He thereafter undertakes
three medicine reviews within 21 days (6th, 11th and 25th April,
2005); three orthopaedic reviews in six days (24th, 27th and 30th
July, 2010); 15 medicine visits in 87 days to the Batra Hospital.
Vishal Yadav then made 14 visits to the medicine Department,
Batra Hospital (23rd, 30th March, 2011, 20th, 27th April, 2011, 4th,
11th, 18th, 26th May, 2011, 8th, 22, 27th June, 2011, 13th, 27th July,
2011 and 10th August, 2011).
</p><p id="p_1444">593. From 27th December, 2004, Dr. Manohar Lal Sindhwani
from the Department of Internal Medicine was the doctor who was
attending to Vishal Yadav's every complaint.
</p><p id="p_1445">594. A question arose in our mind as to how did this cycle of
visits and admissions of Vishal Yadav to the Batra Hospital
commence? In this regard, the Jail Superintendent has also placed
before us the following order dated 23rd August, 2004 passed by
the learned Single Judge in Bail App.No.1215/2004, which was
filed by Vishal Yadav:
</p>

<p id="p_1446">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                             pg. 437
          ―The petitioner seeks interim bail being diagnosed as
         suffering from disseminated tuberculosis with
         pleuropericardial effusion with pulmonary and
         mediastinal lymphoadenopathy. He has been
         undergoing treatment for the said ailments as advised
         by AIIMS. Lastly, his case was reviewed at AIIMS on
         6th August, 2004 and he was advised to continue anti-
         tubercular treatment besides review in cardiology
         department. Plea for release on interim bail is being
         opposed on behalf of the respondent State on the ground
         that one of the material witnesses Ms. Bharti Yadav
         remains yet to be examined. He refers to an order dated
         14th October, 2003 of this Court whereby request for
         release on interim bail was declined earlier and the
         petitioner could renew the plea in that regard only after
         the statement of Ms. Bharti Yadav is recorded by the
         Trial Court. Confronted with the aforesaid order, the
         petitioner seeks a direction to Jail Superintendent
         concerned to take him to Batra Hospital instead of
         AIIMS for further investigation and treatment of the
         ailments he is suffering from. Learned counsel for the
         State of U.P. has no objection to such a request being
         granted. Accordingly while declining the release of the
         petitioner on interim bail on medical ground a direction
         is issued to the Jail Superintendent concerned to
         arrange for or taking the petitioner in custody to Batra
         Hospital as and when so required for his further
         treatment at his own cost of the ailment he is suffering
         from. In case of any difficulty being experienced, the
         petitioner would be at liberty to approach this Court
         from time to time. Petition is disposed of.

                             (Emphasis by us)

         This order was passed when Vishal Yadav was an under
trial.

</p><p id="p_1449"> 595. Our attention is drawn to a communication dated 12 th
December, 2011 from the office of the Director General (Prisons)
addressed to the Registrar General of this court mentioning that
"under the shield of this order, the prisoner had visited the Batra
Hospital" for more than 80 occasions during the past years after the
order and "he is not regular in taking the prescribed medicines as
per the observations of the treating doctor". A clarification was
sought based on the change of the status of the prisoner from under
trial to convict as well as the policy formulated by the prison
department.
</p><p id="p_1450">596. The Registrar General placed this communication before the
learned Single Judge on 18th January, 2012, when it was clarified
that the relief granted in the order dated 23rd August, 2004 could
not be extended to Vishal Yadav after his conviction and that in
case Vishal Yadav would require any medical treatment, he would
be at liberty "to make such request before the concerned court".
</p><p id="p_1451">597. It is important to note that the order dated 23rd August, 2008
refers to Vishal Yadav suffering from disseminated tuberculosis
with pleuropericardial effusion with pulmonary and mediastinal
lymphoadenopathy. It was clearly directed that as and when he
was required to be taken to Batra Hospital for "further treatment",
it was to be "at his own cost of the ailment he is suffering from".
The directions of the court were explicit that he could be taken for
treatment of this disease alone and none other. The cost, which
was required to be paid by the prisoner, would be all costs involved
for taking treatment from Batra Hospital.

<p id="p_1452">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

</p><p id="p_1453"> 598. As per the record, interestingly, in his visits and admissions
to the Batra Hospital, Vishal Yadav was under the treatment of
one, Dr. Manohar Lal Sindhwani. This doctor had recorded that so
far as the Tuberculosis was concerned, ―Tuberculosis was
completed/cured‖.              On the 15th of September, 2009, the jail
authorities had requested the Batra Hospital to ―kindly advice is it
necessary to send the patient to very hospital for review, as we are
having medicine and chest specialist in jail hospital‖.               Dr.
Sindhwani gave no response to this query and continued to call
Vishal Yadav to Batra Hospital for review on flimsy and non-
specific grounds, which cannot be verified.
</p><p id="p_1454">599. It is well nigh impossible to deal with each every hospital
visit of the convict or his hospital admission in this judgment. The
tabulation of the hospital visits of Vishal Yadav would show that
visits to the same departments of the hospital were separated by
gaps of were 2, 3, 4 days. All visits, be it for an Orthopaedic,
neurology, neurosurgery, radiology or any other problem, have
been advised by Dr. Manohar Lal Sindhwani.                 Interestingly,
almost on every visit to Batra Hospital, Dr. Sindhwani has planned
("advised") the next visit, on most occasions after a gap of barely
one week only!
</p><p id="p_1455">600. In four visits to the Neurology Department of the Batra
Hospital between 17th August, 2011 and 14th September, 2011,
Vishal Yadav is seen by Dr. M.L. Sindhwani as ―one Dr. Dua was
busy in the O.T.‖. Vishal Yadav appears to have complaining
about a lower backache, which ought to have been seen by an

 orthopaedician or neurologist whereas Dr. Sindhwani, a specialist
of internal medicine, examined the convict.
</p><p id="p_1456">601. We also questioned as to how, after his conviction, Vishal
Yadav came to be repeatedly referred and sent by the jail
authorities to the Batra Hospital and required the State to disclose
the same. The State has placed a copy of the memorandum dated
18th February, 2012 addressed by the Medical Officer Incharge of
the Central Jail No.4 to Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar
Jail, New Delhi informing that Vishal Yadav ―was initially
referred to Batra Hospital as per the court order. Subsequently he
was referred as per the advice of treating doctors of Batra
Hospital‖. Therefore, without any intervention or recommendation
of the concerned medical experts in the jail or at the jail referral
hospitals i.e. DDU Hospital and LNJP Hospital, Vishal Yadav was
permitted to be taken out of the jail repeatedly to visit Batra
Hospital merely on the 'advice' of Dr. M.L. Sindhwani. No effort
was made by the jail authorities even to ascertain whether such
visit was warranted or not.
</p><p id="p_1457">602. In his reply dated 22nd March, 2012 filed before us, Vishal
Yadav admits that he was required to be produced for the purpose
of treatment ―whenever necessary as per the opinion of the jail
doctor‖. There is no such record of opinion of the relevant medical
experts of the jail. It is evident that Vishal Yadav has taken such a
plea to disown the responsibility for his actions.
</p><p id="p_1458">603. Let us also examine some more information which points
towards the health of the convict.                     Vide his letter dated 15 th

as reference to his investigations are concerned, the Medical
Officer Incharge, has informed thus:

any hospital or the prisoner himself.                  No investigation reports
which would support the diagnosis exist. It is unbelievable that
such an educated person would not preserve his own medical
record, if it actually existed.
</p><p id="p_1463">606. Shri Vijender Singh, Superintendent (Jails), Tihar Jail has
sworn and filed an affidavit on the 4th of October, 2012 before us
stating that amongst the facilities available at the 150 bedded
Central Jail Hospital, there is a tuberculosis ward. The affidavit
discloses that ―patients who do not get cured on O.P.D. basis are
referred by the doctors of the respective jails to Central Jail
Hospital for investigations and treatment Central Jail Hospital
provides round the clock emergency services and in patient
treatment facilities. Junior residents, Senior Residents, Medical
Officer and Consultants are working under Senior Medical Officer
Hospital along with other medical and Paramedical staff‖.
</p><p id="p_1464">         It is further stated that in the Central Jail Hospital, specialists
in medicine ophthalmology, orthopaedics, chest and tuberculosis,
skin, psychiatry, pathology are available.
</p><p id="p_1465">607. The Central Jail hospital thus has consultants who are
specialists in medicine ophthalmology, orthopaedics, chest and
tuberculosis, skin, psychiatry and pathology. The hospital has an
entire ward for patients of tuberculosis. Apart from the facilities
available within the jail itself, the referral DDU Hospital located

 close by is also able to provide treatment for tuberculosis. This
apart, in Delhi there are specialised departments, clinics as well as
hospitals devoted to the treatment of tuberculosis and chest disease,
including the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory
Diseases, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Near Qutab Minar, New Delhi-
110030; Babu Jagjiwan Ram Chest Clinic, Jehangir Puri, Delhi-
110033; Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and T.B. Chest Clinic,

</p><p id="p_1466">608. For radiological investigations as well as orthopaedic
complaints, Vikas Yadav was visiting the DDU Hospital as well as
LNJP Hospital. The Safdarjung Hospital has an elaborate and
renowned orthopaedic department. In the jail itself as well as, in
close proximity, all facilities are available. There would be no
question of referring any person to a tertiary care referral hospital,
especially for primary investigations or treatment of routine
ailments as abdomen pain, backache, nasal blockage, etc. which are
required to be addressed by primary facilities. It is only after a
detailed clinical examination by a medical expert, investigations, if
any, that a reference could be made to a tertiary care referral
hospital of the nature of AIIMS or the Batra Hospital. This has
been avoided in the present case.

</p><p id="p_1468"> 609. The aforesaid status report also informs that between 5th
July, 2010 till 2nd February, 2012, Vishal Yadav had 15 court
appearances outside jail. On each occasion, he was handed over to
DAP escort a day prior to the court date and was admitted back
after attending the date.
</p><p id="p_1469">610. Our observations on the frequent hospital visits of Vikas
Yadav squarely apply to these visits of Vishal Yadav as well, only
difference being of the dates and hospital. There is no material at
all to justify these visits of the convict to the outside hospitals.
</p>
<p id="p_1470">(a)      Admissions of Vishal Yadav in Batra Hospital

</p><p id="p_1471">611. The details of hospital/admissions of Vishal Yadav from 3rd
June, 2004 (Annexure ‗B') have also been placed by the State
before us. While the first admission was to the DDU Hospital on
3rd June, 2004 for 2 days 6 hours 50 minutes; the second admission
of Vishal Yadav was to the AIIMS hospital on the 28th June, 2004
to 7th July, 2004 (8 days). He was thereafter admitted in the Batra
Hospital from 3rd September, 2004 to 15th September, 2004(12
days).
</p><p id="p_1472">612. So far as admissions of Vishal Yadav in the Batra Hospital
are concerned, till his conviction on 28th May, 2008, Vishal Yadav
was admitted in the Batra Hospital only once from 31st August,
2004 to 15th September, 2004 (15 days, 13 hours and 30 minutes).
</p><p id="p_1473">613. Apart from the OPD visits to Batra Hospital regarding the
admissions of Vishal Yadav, some shocking facts are revealed.
We propose to briefly advert to these admissions to illustrate the


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 446
 conduct of the prisoner despite conviction for such major offences.
After his conviction, Vishal Yadav was inter alia admitted in the
Batra Hospital on the following occasions as well :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_421">      S.No. Duration

</blockquote><p id="p_1474">614. The close proximity of the above Batra Hospital admissions
(separated by few weeks to a couple of months only) and the life of
a person in luxurious private ward facilities in the Batra Hospital
points to the design of the prisoner to keep himself out of jail.
</p><p id="p_1475">         Vishal Yadav was admitted thrice - from 7th July, 2008 to 7th
August, 2008 (for 32 days); from 14th August, 2008 to 6th
September, 2008 (for 24 days) and 24th October, 2008 to 15th
December, 2008 (for 53 days) as a case of the old tuberculosis.
The re-admission on 14th August, 2008 was within seven days of
discharge from the Batra Hospital on 7th August, 2008, after a stay
of 32 days.
</p><p id="p_1476">615. During his admission of about 3½ months from 25 th
February, 2009 to 4th June, 2009, as per the discharge summary
produced by the Batra Hospital, Vishal Yadav was administered
innocuous medications of the nature of Metrogyl, Spasmindon,



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                      pg. 447
 Aristogyme for infections, cramps (spasms), enzyme respectively,
which are given for minor ailments. All these medicines clearly
suggest that the convict was not suffering from any major ailment.
</p><p id="p_1477">616. In the prolonged admission from 7th December, 2009 to 16th
December, 2009 (of 2 months and 10 days), the said Dr. Manohar
Lal Sindhwani, Consultant in Internal Medicine Department had
advised admission for surgery. After Vishal Yadav's prolonged
stay of 2 months and 10 days, the convict was discharged without
any surgery. Dr. Sindhwani certainly was not competent to either
make a surgical diagnosis nor had the expertise to treat a patient
who needed surgery. A shocking state of affairs is revealed from
the above details of Vishal Yadav's hospital visits to the Batra
Hospital that a specialist in internal medicine was providing
orthopaedic, neurology, cardiology as well as surgical opinions.
</p><p id="p_1478">617. So far as the last admission is concerned, Vishal Yadav had
been referred to Batra Hospital for a review only. Where was the
occasion for his admission?
</p><p id="p_1479">618. So far as the medical opinion on the records of the treatment
and hospitalization of Vishal Yadav is concerned, the medical
board of officers at the Army Hospital (R&amp;R), Delhi Cantt. has
submitted a report under the cover of the letter dated 19th June,
2012 giving the following conclusions :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_429">         ―3. The Board, having perused all the medical

<p id="p_1498">622. In the reply dated 22nd March, 2012 filed on behalf of Vishal
Yadav supported by an affidavit of his brother, Shri Vivek Yadav,
it is submitted on behalf of Vishal Yadav that his Tuberculosis
appears to be a direct result of the ills affecting the prison system.
It has been orally suggested that tuberculosis is widely rampant in
the jail. If the treatment given to Vishal Yadav was the correct
treatment, then the several prisoners suffering from tuberculosis
should all have been visiting or admitted in private rooms Batra
Hospital to ensure parity of treatment to prisoners.
</p><p id="p_1499">623. We have noted the negative medical opinion with regard to
requirement of hospitalisation for Kochs disease (tuberculosis)
while considering the case of Vikas Yadav above. The medical
record of Vishal Yadav also does not support any need for hospital
admission on these occasions. There is neither clinical evidence
nor investigation results which support any requirement for
hospitalisations. On the contrary, despite being advised discharge,
Vishal Yadav continued his hospital stay for weeks at an end
without any reason.
</p><p id="p_1500">624. We are of the view that Vishal Yadav has also acted in
violation of the order dated 23rd August, 2004 which did not permit




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                          pg. 455
 any visits to the Batra Hospital for the minor ailments as nausea,
vomiting, stomach disorder, nasal blockage and the like. Vishal
Yadav was not only taken to the Batra Hospital as an outpatient for
trivial complaints but was also repeatedly hospitalized for the
same.
</p><p id="p_1501">625. Pursuant to our order dated 2nd February, 2012, Vishal
Yadav was also medically examined by the aforesaid Board at
AIIMS in February, 2012 when the following report was given :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_433">         ―Final conclusion and Recommendations of the
         Medical Board:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_434">         Based on the information obtained by review of medical
         reports shown by the jail authorities, detailed history
         and findings of the clinical examination plus relevant
         investigations, it is reported that Sh. Vishal Yadav is
         able to perform all the activities of daily living without
         assistance and is currently not suffering from any
         acute or severe medical condition which requires
         hospitalization or active intervention - medical
         surgical or investigational. He is stable and actively
         mobile. The complaints mentioned by him are mild
         and of chronic nature and can be managed by taking
         appropriate care and medications.‖
                              (Emphasis by us)

</blockquote><p id="p_1502">626. It is further pointed out that Vishal Yadav was admitted in
the Batra Hospital w.e.f. 7th October, 2009 to 15th December, 2009
i.e. for a period of 70 days and wanted out of prison for which one
excuse after another was being created. Vishal Yadav had got filed
Crl.M.(Bail)No.157/2009 dated 15th December, 2009 seeking
interim bail on the ground of his sister's marriage from 14th




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                   pg. 456
 January, 2010 to 31st January, 2010. He deliberately concealed the
fact that he was not in jail when he filed this application.
</p><p id="p_1503">627. We find that the hospital visits and admissions of Vishal
Yadav post conviction were also without permission from the
concerned court or from any authority. No referral from any jail
doctor for the visits or admissions is also forthcoming. Specialists
to look after the complaints of the prisoner were available in the
jail hospital. There is therefore, substance in the submission that
Vishal Yadav has actively manipulated authority, connived with
jail authorities and the doctors at the Batra Hospital to keep himself
out of jail and away from undergoing the sentence of life
imprisonment imposed on him on false pretexts of medical
treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_1504">(iii)    Analysis of hospital visit/admission discussion

</p><p id="p_1505">628. It is noteworthy that we had given opportunity to the
convicts to place all records of their medical condition and
treatment before the Board of Officers constituted by the Army
Hospital (R&amp;R), Delhi Cantt. as well as before us.
</p><p id="p_1506">         No record at all has been produced of prescriptions, medical
investigation, treatment, bills, payment records, etc. by either of the
defendants with regard to the visits to any hospital as an out or as
in patient, before or after their convictions.
</p><p id="p_1507">629. Vikas Yadav has also not required any outside hospital visits
after 23rd January, 2012 when Crl.M.A.No.1168/2012 was filed.
There is no averment or evidence of any sickness before his arrest.
</p>

<p id="p_1508">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                   pg. 457
 No record of treatment in any hospital is forthcoming. On the
contrary, as per available record, Vikas Yadav stopped T.B.
treatment without any medical advice. The jail has no record of his
having taken ever taken medication for the same. After the initial
mention that Vikas Yadav suffering from T.B., there is no mention
of any such disease.
</p><p id="p_1509">630. If Vishal Yadav was so sick that he required such extensive
hospitalization after his conviction, it can be reasonably expected
that there would have been some kind of sickness in the prior
period of 2½ years when he was on bail during trial. There is no
assertion even of illness, let alone any evidence to support the
same. Vishal Yadav has also not made any outside hospital visits
after 27th January, 2012 when Crl.M.A.No.1313/2012 was filed.
</p><p id="p_1510">631. The above factors also lend support to the objection that the
complaints of sickness, visits to and hospitalizations were
contrived, manipulated and were not for any genuine medical
problem.
</p><p id="p_1511">632. We have set out above the extensive number of visits of the
two convicts in the present case to the hospitals as well as the
details of their hospitalization.                  We have noted that from the
record, the convicts have been enjoying their own diet.
</p><p id="p_1512">633. It is complained by Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the
complainant that while the convict Vishal Yadav was luxuriating in
the Batra Hospital, he also ran up a total bill of Rs.55,000/- for
making telephonic calls alone. Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned counsel for
Vishal Yadav has submitted that these calls were not only by


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                           pg. 458
 Vishal Yadav but by his wife and mother as well who were with
Vishal Yadav as his attendants during his admission in the Batra
Hospital.
</p><p id="p_1513">634. We may point out that neither Vishal Yadav nor Vikas
Yadav, was so ill as to need an attendant with them during his
hospital stay.            There is no record of any treatment being
administered which had to be monitored at these times. Clearly,
the admissions were to keep the convicts out of jail in the company
of wife/relatives, with access to visitors, telephone facilities, home
cooking with facilities as in the nature of private room, private
bathroom, air conditioning, etc. similar to those they would have
enjoyed at home. It was certainly not the regimented lifestyle
which the jail stay entails.
</p><p id="p_1514">635. In a reply which is dated 1st October, 2012, it has been stated
by Vishal Yadav that ―each and every expense of the treatment and
the calls has been borne by the answering respondent and the
answering respondent has in fact spent about Rs.25 lakhs apart
from certain medicines in the treatment, which in fact lessen the
cost on the government exchequer‖. The defendant is unable to
support these submissions with any record of treatment for a
serious      disease        which       required       his   hospitalizations.       In
Crl.M.A.No.4073/2012, Vishal Yadav claims to                             have spent
Rs.23,60,000/- on treatment. This figure, coupled with the amount
of Rs.55,000/- spent on phones reeks of the luxury which the
defendant enjoyed. That he could procure it while undergoing a life




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                                   pg. 459
 sentence indubitably points to an inability to conform to legal
systems.
</p><p id="p_1515">636.      It needs no elaboration that merely because you can afford
it, would justify hospital admission, especially when as a life
convict, prisoners are required to undergo the sentence of rigorous
imprisonment for life.
</p><p id="p_1516">637. The facilities enjoyed in the private rooms in AIIMS or in
Batra Hospital have not the remotest of the semblance or
comparison to the discipline during jail incarceration.              The
facilities enjoyed in private rooms are certainly way beyond those
available even in the general wards of the Batra Hospital or
AIIMS. The facilities which were made available to these two
defendants in these hospitals can bear no comparison to those
which are provided in the general ward in government hospitals
which other prisoners would have got.
</p><p id="p_1517">638. In the jail, the prisoners do not have access to telephone
facilities or the benefit of air conditioning or personalized
bathroom and private toilet facilities. Both these convicts have had
prolonged stays outside the regimentation and discipline of the jail.
Such stays were as per their whim and desire.
</p><p id="p_1518">639. The defendants need to be reminded that while it is the duty
and responsibility of the State to ensure the health and well being
of the convicts but it is no part of State's responsibility to facilitate
or incur expenditure of even a single paisa for enabling prisoners to
make unwarranted visits outside the jail or to facilitate a convict's
unwarranted visits to or stays in hospital.
</p>

<p id="p_1519">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 460
</p><p id="p_1520"> 640. It is therefore, obvious that Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav
have utilized the shield of the hospital visits and stays in
connivance with jail authorities as well as doctors at the hospital
which they visited or were admitted to. They manipulated the
systems deliberately and knowingly with impunity without any
respect for law or authority, sure and confident that their unholy
and illegal acts would go undetected and they could avoid
undergoing the imprisonment awarded to them, in any sense.
</p><p id="p_1521">641. For the period between 30th of May, 2008 till 17th October,
2011 of 36 months and 140 days, Vishal Yadav has spent 32 days
(from 7th July, 2008 to 7th August, 2008); 24 days (from 14th
August, 2008 to 6th September, 2008), 53 days (24th October, 2008
to 15th December, 2008); 100 days (from 25th February, 2009 to 6th
June, 2009); 71 days (from 7th October, 2009 to 16th December,
2009); 36 days (from 29th September, 2010 to 3rd November,
2010); 4 days (from 14th October, 2011 to 17th October, 2011)
(totalling 320 days, equivalent to over 10 months) in private rooms
in the Batra Hospital in the company of his family with wife and/or
mother staying with him without any medical justification for the
same. The defendant has also partaken home or outside cooking
during this period. With such relatives, friends and acquaintances
who were not in hospital, he has freely engaged on the telephone
access.
</p><p id="p_1522">         This period certainly cannot be treated as part of
imprisonment already undergone by the defendant.
</p>



<p id="p_1523">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                               pg. 461
</p><p id="p_1524"> 642. Similarly, the comfortable stay of Vikas Yadav from the 10 th
of October, 2011 to 4th November, 2011 (23 days) in the private
ward ['B' category room (for one day) and then the ‗A' category
room] in AIIMS in the company of "attendants" (noted in his case
sheets) with full freedom in terms of diet, access to friends and
family; freedom to take outings, cannot be treated as period during
which the convict was undergoing even simple imprisonment.
</p>
<p id="p_1525">(iv)     Cost of hospital visit/admission

</p><p id="p_1526">643. We now come to a critical question which arises in the
present case. Given the above discussion, is it fair to burden the
public exchequer with the costs of such 'outings' for prisoners?
Before we answer, let us examine the stand of the two convicts.
</p><p id="p_1527">644. So far as Vikas Yadav is concerned, despite opportunity, no
medical record produced. Only a brief synopsis dated 11th March,
2013 has been filed. Mr. Verma has vehemently contended that
T.B. is widely rampant in the jail and the convict contracted the
infection from jail. It is also submitted that he has been rightly
taken to the hospitals for the several visits. Learned counsel would
justify Vikas Yadav's admission in AIIMS and his absences from
the hospital room as well.                    It is submitted that the medical
treatment of Vikas Yadav while in custody was the absolute
responsibility of the State and he cannot be called upon to bear
costs thereof. Mr. Verma would deny liability for the cost thereof
contending that the practice of taking prisoners on outside hospital




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                           pg. 462
 visits is common and that there is nothing unique about either the
defendant's visits or his client's hospital admission.
</p><p id="p_1528">645. Vishal Yadav has opposed the consideration of the aspect of
liability for the costs on the hospital visits and admissions from the
perspective that it is the bounden duty of the State/its agencies to
bear the costs for the security of the convicts and that Vishal Yadav
was never a free man; as his visits were controlled by the prison
authorities. It is submitted that in the order dated 23 rd August,
2004, Vishal Yadav had undertaken to bear only the cost of
treatment which would be incurred at the Batra Hospital and not
the cost incurred on the security arrangements to take him to and
fro from the jail premises.
</p><p id="p_1529">646. The order dated 23rd August, 2004 nowhere restricts 'cost' to
only treatment cost. The use of the expression ‗cost' would show
that the court intended Vishal Yadav to bear all costs which would
be incurred on his visits to Batra Hospital for undergoing treatment
for tuberculosis. Vishal Yadav, a literate and well placed
individual, was fully conscious that he was in custody and the
‗costs' entailed in being treated in the Batra Hospital would include
not only the cost of treatment but also expenditure transportation as
well as providing the security and other ancillary costs. In fact
expenditure on all counts for the purpose of taking him to Batra
Hospital was inherent in the direction that the prisoner would bear
the costs of the treatment at Batra Hospital.
</p><p id="p_1530">647. It is also pertinent that the order nowhere directed the State
to incur costs for visits to the hospital which were not warranted,


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 463
 especially costs of prolonged hospital stays for months together
without any reason or justification.
</p><p id="p_1531">(a)      Cost incurred on escort/security deployment during outside
         hospital visits

</p><p id="p_1532">648. Every expense incurred on a prisoner, whether under trial or
a convict is additional burden on the public exchequer. Examining
the hospital visits of the convict from the perspective of the
unwarranted expense and drain of public resources, we had called
upon the State to inform us as to the costs which were entailed in
providing escort and guard duties to the two prisoners as well as
other expenses incurred thereon.                       The State has been able to
provide some details of expenses incurred on providing escorts to
the prisoners and taxi fare on some occasions. We consider the
few details provided hereafter.
</p><p id="p_1533">649. The State has filed an affidavit of Shri Shamsher Singh
posted as Superintendent, Central Jail No.4, Tihar with regard to
the costs incurred for provision of security arrangements in respect
of Vikas Yadav for his referral visits to AIIMS and the DDU
Hospital and the costs incurred by the 3rd Battalion for making
security arrangements when he was admitted to the hospital.
</p><p id="p_1534">650. As per the memo dated 22nd February, 2012 from the office
of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, 3rd Battalion, DAP, Delhi,
no money is charged from prisoners for escort and guard duties of
under trial prisoners. In custody parole cases, payment is charged
when specific orders are given by the court and guard charges are

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                              pg. 464
 calculated on the basis of the Government of Delhi notifications
dated 5th August, 1999 and 16th July, 2007.
</p><p id="p_1535">651. Implicit in the above directions is the fact that security/escort
has to be deployed only for such hospital visits as have been
authorised in accordance with law. Certainly for such authorised
hospital visits, it would be the duty of the State to ensure escort and
guard duties. Can the same be said of such visits and admissions
as are not required for medical reasons?
</p><p id="p_1536">652. The office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, 3 rd
Battalion DAP, Delhi has placed a copy of Standing Order
No.52/2008 in this regard. It is been pointed out that as per this
Standing Order, it was the duty of the 3rd Battalion DAP to escort
under trial witnesses during their court production as well as to
hospitals for treatment and to guard them during such visits.
</p><p id="p_1537">653. Additionally, a copy of the Notification No.6/71/98/HP-Estt.
dated July, 2007 issued in exercise of powers conferred under
<a href="/doc/408820/" id="a_1389">Section 40(2)</a> of the Delhi Police Act, 1978 by the Lieutenant

systems, law, human resources and scarce medical facilities
displayed by these two defendants despite their conviction, that

passed an order dated 2nd February, 2012 calling upon the State to
furnish the following details:

</p><p id="p_1542">(v)       authorization for all of the above.
</p><p id="p_1543">655. It is unfortunate that the State has been able to provide only
scanty information limited to expenditure incurred on providing
escort during some hospital visits and taxi fare, again not for all
visits.

</p><p id="p_1545"> 656. The State has also placed some calculation of costs based on
these notifications including the number of guards deployed and
the time for which the convicts were admitted in the hospital. The
first hospital visit of Vikas Yadav in the year 2008 was on 31st
May, 2008 for which the police has notified expenses incurred as

Yadav in his hospital admissions post conviction is concerned, as

period 1st January, 2009 to 7th February, 2012 as per the available
record of their outside visits, OPDs and hospitalization in various
hospitals comes approximately to Rs.20,77,721/-, a burden borne
by the tax payer.
</p><p id="p_1561">661. These monetary figures are no measure of the colossal waste
of valuable manpower and scarce human resources as the police
personnel are constantly required for discharging critical policing
duties. That the defendants could manipulate and influence
authority to permit this kind of wastage of services of police
personnel to guard these two defendants for unwarranted hospital
visits and admissions is completely impermissible and cannot be
countenanced under any circumstance.

the LNJP hospital, the State has paid taxi fare to the tune of

         escort in the outside visits

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                           pg. 471
</p><p id="p_1568"> 665. The State has informed us that so far as convicts are
concerned, diet for them is supplied on OPD/outside hospital visits
by the jail administration through the Central Jail No.6 in packets
at the time of boarding the ambulance/taxi from the DAP
Command Room located at Central Jail No.2, Tihar, New Delhi. It
is further informed that in case any inmate/convict is admitted in
outside hospital, the jail administration does not provide any diet to
the inmate/convict and the diet is provided by the concerned
hospital as per the norms of the hospital.
</p><p id="p_1569">666. As per the affidavit, no diet or payment at all is provided to
the security personnel on escort duty by the jail authorities to the
guards and the security personnel providing security to the jail
inmate during such visits or admissions.
</p><p id="p_1570">667. It is important to note that there is no reference to any
statutory provisions, rule, regulation or guideline to which the
above practice is relatable. There cannot be an instance of bigger
subversion and compromise of discipline which personnel in the
uniformed services must maintain.                       The commitment       of the
assigned police personnel to their duty would have been
compromised given their exposure to the luxury of being in the
private wards, even though in hospitals. The non provision of diet
or payment in lieu thereof to security personnel for the duties with
prisoners during their outside visits would have rendered the
security       personnel         dependant             on   the   convict   and      his
family/attendants for provision of their dietary needs as well. The

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                                    pg. 472
 bonding which would have been created thereby between the
prisoner and his guards has to have resulted in a consequential
relaxation of the control which is required to be maintained over
prisoners. This is amply illustrated in the present case. The guard's
presence, thus reduced to mere token, is certainly of no
significance and would not have interdicted the freedoms enjoyed
by the defendants in any manner during the visits or the
admission(s).
</p><p id="p_1571">668. We do not know, but the bonhomie generated by the liberties
shared with the guards during the protracted hospital admission
may have led to them permitting the aforenoted freedom to Vikas
Yadav during his AIIMS admission between 10th October, 2011
and 4th November, 2011. Even the guards on escort duties have a
duty to inform the jail authorities about the unnecessary visits or
stays in the hospitals.
</p>
<p id="p_1572">(f)      Impact of such unwarranted hospital visits and admissions

</p><p id="p_1573">669. Mr. Sumeet Verma submits that there was nothing unusual
in the hospital visits of the two convicts inasmuch as thousands of
outside hospital visits are undertaken by jail inmates. Even if this
figure were correct, it can have no impact at all so far as
consideration of the justification for the visits by the prisoners in
hand is concerned. It is well settled that a plea based on equality of
treatment rests only in legality, it cannot rest on or be claimed qua
acts which are contrary to law or steeped in violations of rules. We
are of the firm view that even if such practice is being universally


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 473
 adopted in the jails as claimed, it is completely illegal and
impermissible.
</p><p id="p_1574">670. We are greatly saddened by the situation manifested from
the fact that persons convicted for heinous offences, undergoing
life imprisonments are able to manipulate not only jail authorities
but medical professionals in the most premier institutions enabling
utilisation of a shield of non-existent medical ailments for
―outings‖ out of jail.               Thereby convicts in a heinous murder
offence have been permitted creation of a facade of sickness to
enjoy the luxury of visiting and staying in private wards in private
hospitals in the company of relative and friends ('attendants'). That
jail authorities could permit these visits and stays without once
bringing it to knowledge of the concerned medical experts in the
jail hospital or the jail referral hospitals and taking their opinion on
the justification for the hospital visit or the hospitalisation lends
support to the complainant's suggestion of involvement. We do
not know whether these acts and omissions had any element of any
quid pro quo, but they are completely impermissible even if
emanating out of a misplaced sense of sympathy towards life
convicts or out of regard for the status or position of the convict or
his family.         Those placed in positions of authority, be it jail
administration or be it medical experts, must realise that no one is
above the law, that each person must be treated equally. That
imprisonment, especially after conviction, brooks no such liberties.
</p><p id="p_1575">671. Be it by actually making or facilitating referrals, or
permitting visits and admissions, authorising and making payments


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                      pg. 474
 for such visits admissions; or lending tacit support to the same by
not pointing out/objecting or standing by the same, the liability for
involvement in misuse of the process of law remains the same.
</p><p id="p_1576">672. Merely because other prisoners have indulged in similar
practices and that the official machinery in jails and hospitals is
susceptible to such manipulation/influence, with or without quid
pro quos, would not in any manner mitigate the culpability of the
prisoner. We may point out that such practice is prevalent because
prisoners who entertain such intents and expectations exist, who
actively engage and utilise influence of every kind, (be it position/
political/monetary/association/relationship) so that official jail
machinery is subverted/lured/intimidated/persuaded into bending
rules and regulations, in facilitating unwarranted benefits to
prisoners. If Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav had not aspired to
avoid prison stay while undergoing their life sentence, no official
or doctor in the jail or hospitals would have facilitated their outside
visits and stays. Why would any jail official or doctors in the
hospital be interested in keeping the convicts out of jail? They
obviously reacted to such request by the prisoners and succumbed
to some kind of influence.
</p><p id="p_1577">673. The above is illustrated by the fact that there is no allegation
or material with regard to outside visits of the third defendant
Sukhdev Yadav who is not financially or politically as empowered
as Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav.
</p><p id="p_1578">674. So far as Vishal Yadav is concerned, the order of the learned
Single Judge dated 23rd August, 2004 specifically directed that the


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                   pg. 475
 visit to the Batra Hospital for treatment was to be at the cost of the
prisoner. The fact that the Tihar jail has not claimed the cost of
transport and security arrangements for the hospital visits and
during the hospital admissions from the prisoner, which they were
bound to do so in terms of order by itself speaks volumes about the
connivance of prison authorities with the convict.
</p><p id="p_1579">675. We therefore, have no hesitation in holding that Vikas
Yadav and Vishal Yadav are liable to bear the costs incurred on
any count in every unnecessary visit outside and hospital
admission(s).          Inasmuch as incomplete information is available
with regard to the OPD hospital visits of Vikas Yadav and Vishal
Yadav, we therefore, propose to pass directions for notional
payments for these visits.

XVII. Power of this court to pass orders with regard to
      unwarranted hospital visits

</p><p id="p_1592">679.      Having concluded that hospital visits and admissions were
unwarranted; that such outings cannot be treated as sentence
undergone and that public money has knowingly been caused to be
squandered by these two convicts, what can this court do? Is there
any way of ensuring that the order of life imprisonment imposed by
the court is complied with in its real spirit? Or will the court
helplessly watch the brazen manoeuvrings of these two convicts?
Can these convicts be permitted to claim the period(s) that they
spent outside the jail as period of sentence undergone while
computing the period of imprisonment undergone?
</p><p id="p_1593">680. The complainant has prayed for drastic orders based on inter
alia such conduct of the defendants. Before proceeding to pass any
orders, it is essential to consider the competence of the court to
proceed in the matter.
</p><p id="p_1594">681. By the order dated 30th of May, 2002, Vikas Yadav and
Vishal Yadav were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment upon
conviction for the offence of murder which necessarily means
rigorous imprisonment. The sentence was passed in exercise of the
powers of the trial court under Code of Criminal Procedure. The



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 manipulations and the conniving by the convicts have enabled
them to avoid the rigours of the imprisonment in the circumstances
detailed above. Certainly, this conduct of the prisoners tantamounts
to violation of the orders of life imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_1595">682. <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1392">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. recognises the inherent
jurisdiction of the High Court for the following purposes:
</p><p id="p_1596">(i)      to give effect to an order under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1393">Cr.P.C</a>.;
</p><p id="p_1597">(ii)     to prevent an abuse of the process of court; and
</p><p id="p_1598">(iii)    to otherwise secure the ends of justice.
[Ref.: (2011 8 <a href="/doc/157309435/" id="a_1394">S.C.R., Sushil Suri v. C.B.I. &amp; Anr</a>.]

</p><p id="p_1599">683. It is trite that although the power possessed by the High
Court under the said provision is very wide but it is not unbridled.
It has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and cautiously, ex debito
justitiae to do real and substantial justice for which alone the court
exists. Nevertheless, it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down
any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of inherent
jurisdiction of the court.

          "53. <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1398">Section 482</a> of the Code, as its very language
         suggests, saves the inherent power of the High Court
         which it has by virtue of it being a superior court to
         prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to
         secure the ends of justice. It begins with the words,
         ―nothing in this Code‖ which means that the provision is
         an overriding provision. These words leave no manner
         of doubt that none of the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1399"> of the Code</a> limits
         or restricts the inherent power. The guideline for
         exercise of such power is provided in <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1400">Section 482</a> itself
         i.e. to prevent abuse of the process of any court or
         otherwise to secure the ends of justice. As has been
         repeatedly stated that <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1401">Section 482</a> confers no new
         powers on the High Court; it merely safeguards existing
         inherent powers possessed by the High Court necessary
         to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to
         secure the ends of justice. It is equally well settled that
         the power is not to be resorted to if there is specific
         provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1402"> the Code</a> for the redress of the grievance of
         an aggrieved party. It should be exercised very
         sparingly and it should not be exercised as against the
         express bar of law engrafted in any other provision<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1403"> of
         the Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_1603">         54. In different situations, the inherent power may be
         exercised in different ways to achieve its ultimate
         objective. Formation of opinion by the High Court
         before it exercises inherent power under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1404">Section 482</a> on
         either of the twin objectives, (i) to prevent abuse of the
         process of any court, or (ii) to secure the ends of
         justice, is a sine qua non.
</p><p id="p_1604">         55. In the very nature of its constitution, it is the judicial
         obligation of the High Court to undo a wrong in
         course of administration of justice or to prevent
         continuation of unnecessary judicial process. This is
         founded on the legal maximquando lex aliquid alicui
         concedit, conceditur et id sine qua res ipsa esse non
         potest. The full import of which is whenever anything is
         authorised, and especially if, as a matter of duty,

          required to be done by law, it is found impossible to do
         that thing unless something else not authorised in
         express terms be also done, may also be done, then that
         something else will be supplied by necessary
         intendment. Ex debito justitiae is inbuilt in such
         exercise; the whole idea is to do real, complete and
         substantial justice for which it exists. The power
         possessed by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1405">Section 482</a> of the
         Code is of wide amplitude but requires exercise with
         great caution and circumspection.
</p><p id="p_1605">         56. It needs no emphasis that exercise of inherent
         power by the High Court would entirely depend on the
         facts and circumstances of each case. It is neither
         permissible nor proper for the court to provide a
         straitjacket formula regulating the exercise of inherent
         powers under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1406">Section 482</a>. No precise and inflexible

observed that public confidence in the judiciary is said to be the

and to secure the ends of justice, it is therefore the judicial
obligation of this court to pass appropriate orders with regard to the
unwarranted outside visits and hospitalization of the two
defendants as well as the expenditure incurred thereon. So far as
the unwarranted hospitalizations i.e. hospital admission(s) are
concerned, information on the hospital costs, guards and taxi fare
for the purposes have been provided and there is no difficulty in
passing orders. Inasmuch as we have not been provided complete
documentation with regard to the numerous OPD hospital visits
and as such, it may not be appropriate to rule on the propriety of
such visits, and so we are refraining from burdening the prisoners
with regard to the full costs with regard thereto. We however,
propose to direct the convicts to make a token payment towards the
cost of security on which expense has been entailed to the State for
the security provided during such hospital visits. Other details
have been noted above.

 XVIII.            Jurisdiction of the appellate court while considering
                  a prayer for enhancement of the sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_1612">689. An objection is pressed before us that while considering an
appeal against conviction or acquittal, the High Court has vide
powers but it does not have any such power while considering an
appeal for enhancement of sentence. It has been contended by Mr.
Sumeet Verma before us that so far as interference with the order
of sentence of the trial court is concerned, the same can be
enhanced only if in case it is held that the order is perverse. In this
regard, reliance is placed on the pronouncements of the Supreme
Court reported at (1994) 4 SCC 353, <a href="/doc/860395/" id="a_1413">Jashubha Bharatsingh Gohil
v. State of Gujarat</a>. In this case, 12 persons were found by the
sessions court to be the members of an unlawful assembly.
Different members were guilty for murder of 10 people. The trial
court imposed a sentenced of life imprisonment for the offence
under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1414">Sections 302</a> and <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1415">302</a>/<a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1416">149</a>.                        No separate sentence was
imposed under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_1417">Section 120B</a> of the IPC. Some of the accused
were also sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years and
fine for commission of the offence under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1418">Section 25A</a> of the Indian
Arms Act. The defendants filed an appeal in the High Court while
the State filed an appeal seeking enhancement of the sentence of
life imprisonment to death sentence.                     The High Court partly
accepted the State appeal and awarded the sentence of death only
to Jashubha Bharatsingh Gohil, the appellant before the Supreme
Court. Aggrieved thereby, the appeal was filed before the Supreme
Court. The observations of the Supreme Court in para 12 on the

 legislative intent and principles which must weigh with court while
sentencing deserve to be considered in extenso and read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_446">         ―12. It is needless for us to go into the principles laid
         down by this Court regarding the enhancement of
         sentence as also about the award of sentence of death, as
         the law on both these subjects is now well settled. There
         is undoubtedly power of enhancement available with the
         High Court which, however, has to be sparingly
         exercised. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to
         in which case the High Court may enhance the
         sentence from life imprisonment to death. xxx xxx xxx
         xxx Protection of society and deterring the criminal is
         the avowed object of law and that is required to be
         achieved by imposing appropriate sentence. The change
         in the legislative intendment relating to award of capital
         punishment notwithstanding, the opposition by the
         protagonist of abolition of capital sentence, shows that it
         is expected of the courts to so operate the sentencing
         system as to impose such sentence which reflects the
         social conscience of the society. The sentencing process
         has to be stern where it should be.‖

<a href="/doc/324405/" id="a_1419">Section 354(3)</a> of the Cr.P.C. into the statute which makes it
obligatory in cases of conviction for offences punishable with
death or with imprisonment for life to assign reasons in support of
the sentence awarded and, in case death penalty is awarded,
"special reasons" for such sentence. The Supreme Court in para 14
noted that the judge was under a legal obligation to explain his
choice of sentence and that the sentencing court was therefore,
required to approach the question seriously and to make an

 endeavour to see that all the relevant facts and circumstances
bearing on the question of sentence are brought on record. It is
only after giving due weight to the mitigating as well as
aggravating circumstances that it must proceed to impose an
appropriate sentence.

         merely, by a cursory order, impose the sentence of life
         imprisonment and used its discretion not to award the
         capital sentence of death for detailed reasons recorded
         by it. The reasons given by the trial court cannot be said
         to be wholly unsatisfactory or irrelevant much less
         perverse. The High Court differed with the reasoning of
         the trial court and almost 5 years after the judgment had
         been pronounced by the trial court proceeded to enhance
         the sentence of A-11 from life imprisonment to that of
         death sentence. The High Court also gave its own
         reasons in support of its view on the question of
         sentence. The High Court, however, did not opine that
         the reasons given by the Sessions Judge were perverse
         or so unreasonable as no court could have advanced
         the same. It took a different view of the legislative
         policy as also of the law laid down by this Court and
         referred to some other judgments of this Court also in
         support of its ―reasons‖ to impose the sentence of death.
         The view taken by the High Court, it can legitimately be
         said is also a possible view."

<blockquote id="blockquote_451">         AIR 1953 SC 364 : 1953 Cri LJ 1465] , this Court dealt
         with the subject, thus: (AIR pp. 367-68, para 39)
                  ―On the question of sentence, it would have been
                  necessary for us to interfere in any event because
                  a question of principle is involved. In a case of
                  murder the death sentence should ordinarily be
                  imposed unless the trying judge for reasons which
                  should normally be recorded considers it proper
                  to award the lesser penalty. But the discretion is
                  his and if he gives reasons on which a judicial
                  mind could properly found an appellate court
                  should not interfere. The power to enhance a
                  sentence from transportation to death should very
                  rarely be exercised and only for the strongest
                  possible reasons. It is not enough for an appellate
                  court to say, or think, that if left to itself it would
                  have awarded the greater penalty because the
                  discretion does not belong to the appellate court
                  but to the trial Judge and the only ground on
                  which an appellate court can interfere is that the
                  discretion has been improperly exercised, as for
                  example where no reasons are given and none
                  can be inferred from the circumstances of the
                  case, or where the facts are so gross that no
                  normal judicial mind would have awarded the
                  lesser penalty.‖

                  could advance. Only because the High Court
                  looked at those reasons differently, in our

sentence merely on another possible view.              The jurisdiction to

</p><p id="p_1629"> 695. Before embarking on an inquiry into the facts in the present
case, it is necessary to notice a recent judgment reported at 2014
SCC OnLine SC 844, <a href="/doc/301266/" id="a_1423">Mofil Khan &amp; Anr. v. State of Jharkhand</a>,
wherein the Supreme Court has elaborately detailed the manner in
which the courts will consider the relevant circumstances. In this
case, the appellants had some property disputes with their own
brother, murdered eight persons including their brother, his wife,
four minor children one of whom was a physically disabled child.
Their mother was the sole eye-witness who supported the
prosecution case and testified against them. The court summed up
the principles laid down by successive judgments of the Supreme
Court which we propose to reproduce, highlighting those which
apply to the factual matrix of the present case:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_455">         "18. This Court in the aforesaid decisions has evolved
         the doctrine of ―rarest of the rare‖ case and put it to test
         via the medium of charting out the aggravating and
         mitigating circumstances in a case and then balancing the
         two in the facts and circumstances of the case. As a
         norm, the most significant aspect of sentencing policy is
         independent consideration of each case by the Court
         and extricating a sentence which is the most
         appropriate and proportional to the culpability of the
         accused. It may not be apposite for the Court to decide
         the quantum of sentence with reference to one of the
         classes under any one of the head while completely
         ignoring classes under other head. That is to say, what
         is required is not just the balancing of these
         circumstances by placing them in separate
         compartments, but their cumulative effect which the
         Court is required to keep in its mind so as to better
         administer the criminal justice system and provide an
         effective and meaningful reasoning by the Court as

brutality of crime, etc., cannot be construed individually in water

accordingly.

factors from precedents which have been treated as aggravating or
mitigating circumstances. In para 18, it was further stated thus:

         not in the identity of the principles, but lies in the realm

         Sentences of severity are imposed to reflect the
         seriousness of the crime, to promote respect for the law,
         to provide just punishment for the offence, to afford
         adequate deterrent to criminal conduct and to protect the

</p><p id="p_1647">         45. The crime test, criminal test and the ―rarest of the
         rare‖ test are certain tests evolved by this Court. The tests
         basically examine whether the society abhors such
         crimes and whether such crimes shock the conscience
         of the society and attract intense and extreme
         indignation of the community. The cases exhibiting pre-
         meditation and meticulous execution of the plan to
         murder by leveling a calculated attack on the victim to
         annihilate him, have been held to be fit cases for
         imposing death penalty. Where innocent minor children,
         unarmed persons, helpless women and old and infirm
         persons have been killed in a brutal manner by persons in
         dominating position, and where after ghastly murder
         displaying depraved mentality, the accused have shown
         no remorse, death penalty has been imposed. Where it is
         established that the accused is a hardened criminal and
         has committed murder in a diabolic manner and where it
         is felt that reformation and rehabilitation of such a person
         is impossible and if let free, he would be a menace to the
         society, this Court has not hesitated to confirm death
         sentence. Many a time, in cases of brutal murder,



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 495
          exhibiting depravity and callousness, this Court has
         acknowledged the need to send a deterrent message to
         those who may embark on such crimes in future. In some
         cases involving brutal murders, society's cry for justice
         has been taken note of by this Court, amongst other
         relevant factors. While deciding whether death penalty
         should be awarded or not, this Court has in each case
         realizing the irreversible nature of the sentence,
         pondered over the issue many times over. This Court has
         always kept in mind the caution sounded by the
         Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh case (supra) that
         judges should never be blood thirsty but wherever
         necessary in the interest of society identify the rarest of
         rare case and exercise the tougher option of death
         penalty."

</p><p id="p_1649">698. The question which this court has to consider is whether the
trial court orders dated 30th May, 2008 against Vikas Yadav and
Vishal Yadav and 12th July, 2011 against Sukhdev Yadav on the
sentences are premised on a consideration of the relevant
circumstances as per law, are well reasoned and therefore, cannot
be interfered with? We shall examine this question on these well
settled principles.
</p><p id="p_1650">699. The learned trial judge in the order dated 30th May, 2008
has held that the present case did not fall within the ambit of any of
the principles laid down in Machhi Singh to award the extreme
penalty of death to the convicts.
</p><p id="p_1651">700.      Mr. P.K. Dey points out that the learned trial judge has
erred in holding that the case was not covered by Machhi Singh
inasmuch as the case is covered under categories I, II and III.
</p>

<p id="p_1652">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

</p><p id="p_1653"> 701. The above conclusion was based on the finding that as per
the post mortem report there was only a single injury on the skull
of the deceased caused by a hammer which, the learned trial judge
has held that could not be termed as "murder in a brutal or
diabolical manner". In so concluding, the learned trial judge has
held that there were three accused but only one injury was found
which, is a great mitigating circumstance in favour of the convicts.
After so holding, the learned trial judge has further held that the
destruction of evidence was a separate offence under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1426">Section 201</a>
which did not invite the extreme penalty of death. Lastly, the
learned trial judge has held that it is not the death penalty which is
deterrent in which a person is hanged to death in a few seconds;
that to the contrary, it is life imprisonment which is deterrent
wherein a convict dies every moment in the jail.         These three
reasons have persuaded the learned trial judge to impose the
sentences which we have set out above.
</p><p id="p_1654">702. So far as the order of sentence dated 12th July, 2011, on the
third defendant Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan is concerned, the
learned trial judge has held that the murder in the instant case could
not be described as an "honour killing"; that the offence could not
be described as extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical or revolting.
The submissions of the defendant that a single blow by a hard
object given at the vital body part resulted in the death of the
victim and that putting the body on the fire was for the intention of
abolishing incriminating evidence for which act the accused were
convicted under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1427">Section 201</a> of the IPC. The learned trial judge


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 497
 held that the case could not be taken as falling in the category
where murder was committed with the motive which evinced total
depravity and meanness and that this defendant was merely in the
employment of the liquor shop business of the family of the other
two defendants. It was therefore, held that the case did not fall in
the category of rarest of rare cases.
</p><p id="p_1655">         Inasmuch as in both the orders dated 30th May, 2008 and
12th July, 2011, the learned trial judges have arrived at similar
conclusions persuaded by the same factors, we propose to discuss
the findings arrived at by them together.
</p>
<p id="p_1656">(i)      Single blow by hammer

</p><p id="p_1657">703. It has been extensively argued by Mr. Sumeet Verma,
learned counsel supported by the submissions of Mr. Sanjay Jain,
learned counsel and Mr. Chaman Sharma, learned counsel that it
was a case of a single blow by a mere hammer which is not a
dangerous weapon and that this factor by itself leads to the
conclusion that there was no brutality in the commission of the
offence. It is submitted that this must be treated as a mitigating
circumstance.
</p><p id="p_1658">704. The learned trial judges have been persuaded to hold that the
death resulting by the single injury had to be treated as a mitigating
circumstance. The learned trial judges have also observed that the
case rested on the circumstantial evidence alone.
</p><p id="p_1659">705. We find that the learned trial judges have considered each of
the circumstances pointed out by the defence singularly and not


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 498
 examined these circumstances cumulatively to impose an
appropriate sentence. This is contrary to law. As discussed in
some detail above, each of these factors by itself is also certainly
not determinative of whether the death penalty ought to be imposed
or not.
</p><p id="p_1660">706. A hammer is not a tool that is usually found in a tool box in
a car. There is little possibility of finding a hammer in car. The
defendants therefore, consciously chose to use the hammer as a
weapon of offence and carried it with them. In our view, it is not
the instrument used but the use to which the article is put, which
would render it dangerous or not so. A hammer used for murder is
certainly a dangerous article in the hands of the murderers. The
use of this instrument, in fact, points towards the meticulous
planning of the defendants.
</p><p id="p_1661">707. Let us also examine the victim profile. Nitish Katara was
born on 20th April, 1978 and was a young well educated man of 23
years (para 1836 of our judgment) who had just embarked on his
professional career on the fateful night.
</p><p id="p_1662">708. It has been urged by Mr. Dey, learned counsel for the
complainant that as per the post-mortem report, Nitish Katara was
a healthy able-bodied young person who would not have easily
permitted infliction of the blow and that it would have required
force to control him even to inflict the single assault. For this
reason, three persons were involved. It is urged that two of the
defendants would have been actively involved in immobilizing him
so as to inflict the hammer injury. There is certainly strength in


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                pg. 499
 this submission. It is contended that the post-mortem finding that
his tongue was out of his mouth would show that the deceased was
throttled as well.
</p><p id="p_1663">709. There were no clothes on the body which would suggest that
the deceased had obviously been overpowered, throttled and a
blow of such force inflicted with a hammer, brought for this
purpose, on his skull, a vital part of the body.
</p><p id="p_1664">710. The force of the single blow is apparent from the fact that it
resulted in a fracture of the frontal bone, lacerations and congestion
of the brain which lacerations corresponded with the fracture of the
skull bone and resulted in haemotoma of half litre in the left skull
cavity. As per the post mortem report, there was only one litre
blood out of the total blood in the body.
</p><p id="p_1665">711. The consideration by the Supreme Court of Appeal of South
Africa in S Nyathi and The State, (2005) ZASCA 134 (23 May
2005) of the argument of "inadvertence", a "conscious decision",
"degree of culpability", "blameworthiness" though in the context of
a road accident resulting in death, sheds valuable light on the issue
and reads as follows:

         (A) (at 557D-E) where the court held that although no
         greater moral blameworthiness arises from the fact that a
         negligent act caused death, the punishment should
         acknowledge the sanctity of human life. It affirmed the
         dicta of Miller J who twenty years earlier in S v.

                  culpability or blameworthiness exhibited by the
                  accused in committing the negligent act. Relevant
                  to such culpability or blameworthiness would be the
                  extent of the accused's deviation from the norm of
                  reasonable conduct in the circumstances and the
                  foreseeability of the consequences of the accused's
                  negligence. At the same time the actual
                  consequences of the accused's negligence cannot
                  be disregarded. If they have been serious and
                  particularly if the accused's negligence has
                  resulted in serious injury to others or loss of life,
                  such consequences will almost inevitably constitute
                  an aggravating factor, warranting a more severe

</p><p id="p_1676">717. Mr. Mahajan would rely on the pronouncement of the
Supreme Court reported at (1970) 2 SCC 113, <a href="/doc/756608/" id="a_1431">Tapinder Singh v.
State of Punjab</a> wherein the brutal manner in which the offence
was committed reflected deliberation and pre-planning and had led
to the confirmation of the capital punishment imposed on the
appellant by the trial court.
</p><p id="p_1677">718. We have noted the several precedents where betrayal, when
in a position of trust, has been held to be an aggravating
circumstance (Ref. : Ramnaresh)
</p><p id="p_1678">719. Therefore, the submission on behalf of the appellants that the
medical evidence disclosed that only a single injury resulted in the
death and that this fact has to be taken as a mitigating circumstance
by the learned trial judges is, in the facts and circumstances of the
present case, completely unacceptable. The fact that the three
defendants were able to achieve what they wanted with the single
injury cannot be considered a mitigating circumstance by any
measure but must count as an aggravating circumstance.             The
learned trial judges have completely ignored the relevant and
material fact that the blow was deliberate and premeditated and
carefully inflicted on the vital part of the body. The surrounding
facts and circumstances of this case have also not been considered.

 The single blow has been dealt with in isolation and treated as a
mitigating circumstance which is contrary to law and erroneous in
the facts and circumstances of this case. The finding to this effect
is unsustainable even on the principles laid down in (1994) 4 SCC

<p id="p_1680">(ii)     Crime a result of emotional disturbance

</p><p id="p_1681">720. The submission that the crime resulted on account of an
emotional disturbance is also not supported by the evidence on the
record of the case.
</p><p id="p_1682">721. The plan which was executed by the defendants was well
thought out and meticulously executed. The date (night of 17th
February, 2002 - Shivani Gaur's wedding) and time was carefully
chosen. The precision of its execution establishes the clarity of the
three defendants.
</p><p id="p_1683">722. The manner in which the defendants came to Shivani Gaur's
wedding clearly shows that they were under no kind of emotional
disturbance. We have discussed in the judgment dated 2nd of
April 2014 that as per the evidence, Vishal Yadav and Sukhdev
Yadav were not invited to the wedding of Shivani Gaur (a friend of
Bharti Yadav only). Vikas Yadav was invited to this wedding. Yet
Vishal Yadav had the arrogance and confidence to not only go with
Vikas Yadav to the wedding venue, but to accompany him to the
stage and get himself photographed with the bridal couple! We
have noted the casual attire of these defendants in our judgment
which also points to the real purpose of their going to the wedding.

</p><p id="p_1685"> 723. The evidence on record establishes that they had deliberated
on their actions to conclude that the only way of ending the
alliance between the deceased Nitish Katara and sister of Vikas
Yadav was by eliminating Nitish Katara. The deceased was eating
his dinner in the company of old friends when accosted at the party
and had accompanied the defendants trustingly from the wedding
of Shivani Gaur, completely unaware of the fate which was going
to befall him. Nitish Katara was alone, unarmed, innocent and
completely defenceless when he was brutally murdered.            The
destruction of the body of the deceased, concealment of all sources
of identification and abscondance establish the fact that there was
no emotional disturbance, that the defendants went about their
criminal acts with complete clarity.
</p><p id="p_1686">724. The murder was not an ordinary murder. It was an honour
killing which was executed with extreme vengeance. The crime
was certainly not a result of emotional disturbance. The learned
trial judge in fact, has gravely erred in holding that the defendants
were emotionally disturbed also for the reason as it was a defence
of the defendants that they had no knowledge of the relationship
between the deceased and Bharti Yadav.
</p><p id="p_1687">725. Again the learned trial judges have arrived at such
conclusion because they failed to consider all the material
circumstances noted above but only examined the motive for the
offence as a stand alone circumstance in so concluding.

</p><p id="p_1689"> (iii)    Impact of post offence events

</p><p id="p_1690">726. Let us also examine the post offence events and impact of
the offence on the family of the deceased. On the 17th February,
2002, a dead body was found in a badly burnt position on
Shikarpur Road (P.S. Kotwali) by one Shri Virender Singh (PW-
</p><p id="p_1691">23). On his information, Inspector K.P. Singh reached the spot;
took photographs; prepared a panchnama and; a site plan. Only the
left hand fingers and palm were not burnt. Post-mortem was done
on the 18th of February 2002 on this dead body of an unknown
person by Dr. Anil Singhal at the District Hospital, Bulandshehar,
U.P. whereafter the body was kept in the mortuary.        On 19th
February, 2002, S.I. Anil Somania from P.S. Kavi Nagar reached
Bulandshehar.
</p><p id="p_1692">727. On receipt of information from the P.S. Kavi Nagar about
the recovery of the dead body, on 21st February 2002 the
complainant Nilam Katara and her son Nitin Katara and other
family members reached the mortuary. The deceased was burnt to
such a point, that his own mother could only suggest the
identification from the small size of one unburnt palm with fingers
of the hand that the body appeared to be that of Nitish Katara. The
identification had to be confirmed by DNA testing.        For this
purpose, on 21st February, 2002, S.I. Anil Somania made an
application before the CJM, Bulandshehar seeking possession of
the body and its transfer to the All India Institute of Medical




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 Sciences (AIIMS) for DNA and finger print examination. This
application was allowed and the body was removed to AIIMS.
</p><p id="p_1693">728. The finger print samples were taken on 22nd February, 2002.
On the same day, blood samples of the mother Nilam Katara and
father Nishit M. Katara were taken for the DNA test as well as
from dead body which were sent to the Central Forensic
Laboratory at Kolkata. The finger print expert gave his report on
25th February, 2002 to the effect that the finger prints of the dead
body matched the finger prints of Nitish Katara which had been
obtained from the Regional Transport Office, Sarai Kale Khan,
New Delhi. This report stands rejected by the trial court.
</p><p id="p_1694">729. The DNA report however, was received only on the 6th of
March, 2002 which established the body as belonging to a
biological son of Nilam Katara and Shri Nishit M. Katara. It was
only thereafter that the body was handed over to the family of
Nitish Katara so that they could proceed for the cremation which
took place on the 12th of March, 2002.
</p><p id="p_1695">730. We have noted the above dates just to bring to the fore the
magnitude of the vengeance of the defendants and the extent to
which they went to destroy the body of Nitish Katara after his
murder so much so that a confirmed identification even by his
mother and immediate relatives was also not possible. The family
of the deceased must have died a million deaths as they would have
nursed such hopes of his being alive from the night of 16th/17th
February, 2002 till his death was confirmed by the report of the
DNA matching on 6th March, 2002. How his family would have

 agonised about his safety and well being during this period. And
all this merely because Nitish befriended the sister of one of them!
</p><p id="p_1696">731. The hope of the family is manifested from the prayers in the
habeas corpus petition filed by them in W.P.(Crl.)No.247/2002
wherein directions were sought for his production by the present
defendants who were impleaded as respondent nos.7 and 8.
</p><p id="p_1697">732. We were informed by Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the
complainant that Mr. Nishit M. Katara was so traumatised by the
loss of his son that he also expired on 3rd August, 2003. It was
submitted that there is grave threat and danger to Nitish Katara's
mother and brother even on date. Mr. Dey points out that Nilam
Katara is under police protection even on date while his brother
lives in constant fear from the reach of the defendants in distant
places. Such has been the impact of the crime on the family of the
deceased.
</p><p id="p_1698">733. Before us, while arguing the appeal, Mr. Ravinder Kapoor,
learned counsel for Sukhdev Yadav had challenged identity of the
body.
</p>
<p id="p_1699">(iv)     Motive for crime and public abhorrence

</p><p id="p_1700">734. We have held that the offence was carefully planned and
premeditated and the murder was committed in cold blood without
any provocation. It was committed because the defendants did not
approve the romantic relationship between Nitish and Bharti Yadav
</p><p id="p_1701">- sister of Vikas Yadav, for the reason that the deceased did not
belong to their caste and because that he belonged to a family of


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                 pg. 508
 government servants, therefore, not as affluent as Vikas Yadav's
family. The unity of their thought, aim and purpose is apparent
from the fact that the three defendants are of the same caste, two
closely related, the third an employee at a family concern.
</p><p id="p_1702">735. Both Mr. P.K. Dey and Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned
Additional Standing Counsels for the State have vehemently urged
that the crime invited public abhorrence, shook the collective
conscience of the society to the core as well as the judicial
conscience.
</p><p id="p_1703">736. The motive which incited the despicable crime certainly
evidences exceptional depravity and meanness. Caste divisions are
a menace which the society is struggling to eradicate. The motive
evinces exceptional depravity, meanness; the crime was socially
abhorrent and certainly an aggravating circumstance.          [Ref. :
Machhi Singh (para 34)]

</p><p id="p_1704">(v)      Absence of eye-witness - case of circumstantial evidence

</p><p id="p_1705">737. We now turn to the finding that the case rested on
circumstantial evidence and there was no eye-witness, therefore, it
was not possible to say who inflicted the injury-therefore a
mitigating factor. The learned trial judge had concluded that the
defendants shared a common intention to commit the offences. We
have agreed with the findings of the learned trial judge. Therefore,
the absence of any eye-witness or evidence as to which accused in
particular caused the fatal injury is irrelevant for sentencing
purposes inasmuch as the three shared the common intention to


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 509
 commit the offence of murder and each would be liable for the
actions of the others.
</p><p id="p_1706">738. In this regard, we may refer to the following observations in
para 30 of (2009) 5 SCC 740, Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod
(1) v. State of Gujarat:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_480">         "30. The plea that in a case of circumstantial evidence
         death should not be awarded is without any logic. If the
         circumstantial evidence is found to be of
         unimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the
         accused, that forms the foundation for conviction. That
         has nothing to do with the question of sentence as has
         been observed by this Court in various cases while
         awarding death sentence. The mitigating circumstances
         and the aggravating circumstances have to be balanced.
         In the balance sheet of such circumstances, the fact that
         the case rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to
         play. In fact in most of the cases where death sentence is
         awarded for rape and murder and the like, there is
         practically no scope for having an eyewitness. They are
         not committed in the public view. By the very nature of
         things in such cases, the available evidence is
         circumstantial evidence. If the said evidence has been
         found to be credible, cogent and trustworthy for the
         purpose of recording conviction, to treat that evidence as
         a mitigating circumstance, would amount to
         consideration of an irrelevant aspect. The plea of learned
         counsel for the appellant that the conviction is based on
         circumstantial evidence and, therefore, the death sentence
         should not be awarded is clearly unsustainable."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_481">                              (Emphasis by us)


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_482">739. This was reiterated in (2008) 15 SCC 269, <a href="/doc/61901185/" id="a_1433">Shivaji v. State of
Maharashtra</a> wherein in para 27, it was held that in a case of



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 510
 circumstantial evidence, death should not be granted cannot be an
absolute rule. In the balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating
circumstances that the fact that the case rests on circumstantial
evidence has no rule to play. To hold the fact that the case rested
on circumstantial evidence as ipso facto a mitigating factor would
amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. It was so declared
in para 49 of Swamy Shraddananda (2). Merely because the
conviction rested on circumstantrial evidence is not sufficient
ground for not imposing the death sentence. The learned trial
Judges in the instant case have therefore misdirected themselves.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1707">(vi)     Life imprisonment harsher than death sentence

</p><p id="p_1708">740. In observing that life imprisonment is harsher than the death
penalty, the learned trial judge failed to consider power under
<a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_1434">Section 432</a> of the Cr.P.C. to apply for and secure remission of the
life sentence. The learned trial judges have also not considered the
aspect of remorse and repentance which was completely lacking on
the part of the defendants in the present case. Both the learned trial
judges have overlooked these well settled principles and erred in
law.
</p>
<p id="p_1709">(vii) Post murder conduct - burning of the body

</p><p id="p_1710">741. It is contended by learned counsel for the State as well as the
complainant that the actions of the defendants after the murder to
disfigure the dead body beyond recognition and to destroy the
evidence of the crime display the attitude of the defendants and


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 511
 points towards their being accustomed to criminal activity, a strong
aggravating factor.
</p><p id="p_1711">742. The post offence conduct of the accused specially in causing
mutilation or disappearance of the dead body is treated as an
aggravating factor. Expressing strong disapproval of such conduct,
in para 11 of (1996) 4 SCC 148, <a href="/doc/1822033/" id="a_1435">Ravindra Trimbak
Chouthmal v. State of Maharashtra</a>, the court observed thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_483">         "11. But then, it is a fit case, according to us, where, for
         the offence under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1436">Sections 201</a>/<a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1437">34</a>, the sentence
         awarded, which is RI for seven years being the
         maximum for a case of the present type, should be
         sustained, in view of what had been done to cause
         disappearance of the evidence relating to the
         commission of murder -- the atrocious way in which
         the head was severed and the body was cut in nine
         pieces. These cry for maximum sentence. Not only this,
         the sentence has to run consecutively, and not
         concurrently, to show our strong disapproval of the
         loathsome, revolting and dreaded device adopted to
         cause disappearance of the dead body. To these
         sentences, we do not, however, desire to add those
         awarded for offences under <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1438">Sections 316</a> and <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1439">498-A</a>/<a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1440">34</a>,
         as killing of the child in the womb was not separately
         intended, and <a href="/doc/594667/" id="a_1441">Section 498-A</a> offence ceases to be of
         significance and importance in view of the murder of
         Vijaya."</blockquote>
<p id="p_1712">         For this reason, it was ordered that the sentence of seven
years rigorous imprisonment for offence under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1442">Section 201</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1443">34</a> IPC
would start running after the life imprisonment had run its course.
</p><p id="p_1713">743. In (2012) 4 SCC 37, Rajendra Prahladrao Wasnik v. State
of Maharashtra, the accused left the deceased in a badly injured



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 512
 condition in the open fields without even clothes. The court noted
that ―this reflects the most unfortunate and abusing facet of human
conduct, for which the accused has to blame no one else than his
own self". The death sentence was upheld in this case. In (1999) 9
SCC 581, <a href="/doc/702364/" id="a_1444">Molai &amp; Anr. v. State of M.P</a>., similar conduct was held
to be displaying no respect for the human body.
</p><p id="p_1714">744. Therefore, the finding of the learned trial judge that the act
of burning the dead body was a separate offence and could not be
treated as an aggravating circumstance to invite extreme penalty of
death is erroneous and contrary to the well settled principles which
would guide consideration of the facts and circumstances on
record. In fact, in so concluding, the learned trial judge has gravely
erred in ignoring the fact that the removal of all sources of
identification and burning of the body beyond identification was
part of single premeditated plan executed by the defendants.
</p><p id="p_1715">745. The actions of the defendants manifest disrespect of human
body, brutalization and its burning display depraved state of mind
and lack of remorse, all of which are aggravating factors. Just as in
Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal, for commission of the offence
under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1445">Section 201</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1446">34</a> IPC, the defendants are liable for a sentence
of imprisonment which must necessarily run consecutively to the
imprisonment imposed for the other offences.           Therefore, the
imprisonment to be undergone for this offence would commence
after completion of the imprisonment for the other offences.

       the offence is per se material for sentencing purposes
</p><p id="p_1718">746. As at present it is argued by the defence that much time has
passed since the offence was committed and that this factor must
be treated as a mitigating factor for sentencing. This submission
completely fails to note an important aspect in many trials. More
often than not, as in the present case the accused persons protracted
trials. We have dealt at length on this aspect in paras 1918 to 1924
of our judgment dated 2nd April, 2014.
</p><p id="p_1719">747. It has been held in several judgments that delay per se would
not impact sentencing. In (2013) 9 SCC 516, <a href="/doc/33045506/" id="a_1447">Hazara Singh v. Raj
Kumar &amp; Ors</a>., it was held as under:

         appreciate that the reduction of sentence merely on the

         (1985) 3 SCC 225 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 359] , a three-Judge

         reduction of substantive sentence by the High Court, held
         as under: (SCC p. 228, paras 5-6)
                ―5. ... We must confess that what ought to be the

                discretion of the trial court, which discretion has to
                be exercised on sound judicial principles. Various
                relevant circumstances which have a bearing on
                the question of sentence have to be kept in view.
                Before deciding the quantum of sentence the
                learned Sessions Judge has to hear both the sides
                as required by the relevant provision<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1449"> of the Code</a>

<p id="p_1720">                6. In an appeal against the conviction, it is open to

         case [<a href="/doc/108345/" id="a_1450">Sadha Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (1985) 3 SCC 225 :
         1985 SCC (Cri) 359] , SCC pp. 228-29, paras 7-8)
               ―7. ... The learned Judge then took notice of the
               fact that three co-accused of the appellants were
               given benefit of doubt by the trial court and
               acquitted them although they were also attributed
               causing of some injuries. If acquittal of some co-
               accused casts a cloud of doubt over the entire
               prosecution case, the whole case may be rejected.
               But we fail to understand how acquittal of some of
               the accused can have any relevance to the question
               of sentence awarded to those who are convicted.

 sentence on 19th February, 2007.                       The appeal had remained
pending in the Supreme Court for six years. In this background, it
was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there had been a long
lapse of time since imposition of a capital sentence and its
consideration by the court which provided a valid ground for
commuting death sentence to life imprisonment. The court noted
in para 72 the submission of counsel for the appellant as well as
various judicial pronouncements which were relied upon in support
of this submission. The submission was countered by the State
inter alia on the following submission:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_485">         "76. On the aspect of delay, relying on the judgment of
         this       Court        in Triveniben v.      State      of
         Gujarat [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat, (1989) 1 SCC
         678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248] , the counsel submitted that in
         this case the Constitution Bench has held that while
         considering whether the death sentence should be
         awarded or not, the time utilised in judicial proceedings
         up to final verdict cannot be taken into account. This is
         not a case of delay in disposing of mercy petition. The
         counsel submitted that while awarding death sentence,
         perception of the society is one of the considerations. The
         counsel submitted that this case is one of the most widely
         published and infamous murder case. It is a case where
         this Court must, by confirming the death sentence, send a
         strong signal to the society which will operate as an
         effective deterrent in future."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_1724">749. After examining the several judicial pronouncements on
award of death sentence, so far as time taken in judicial
proceedings is concerned, the court pointed out as follows:
</p><p id="p_1725">         "104. We must also bear in mind that though, the judicial
         proceedings do take a long time in attaining finality, that

          would not be a ground for commuting the death sentence
         to life imprisonment. Law in this behalf has been well
         settled in <a href="/doc/751831/" id="a_1453">Triveniben [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat</a>,
         (1989) 1 SCC 678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248] . The time
         taken by the courts till the final verdict is pronounced
         cannot come to the aid of the accused in canvassing
         commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment.
         <a href="/doc/751831/" id="a_1454">InTriveniben [Triveniben v. State of Gujarat</a>, (1989) 1
         SCC 678 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 248] , the Constitution Bench
         made it clear that though ordinarily, it is expected that
         even in this Court, the matters where the capital
         punishment is involved, will be given top priority and
         shall be heard and disposed of as expeditiously as
         possible but it could not be doubted that so long as the
         matter is pending in any court, before final adjudication,
         even the person who has been condemned or who has
         been sentenced to death has a ray of hope. It, therefore,
         could not be contended that he suffers that mental torture
         which a person suffers when he knows that he is to be
         hanged but waits for the doomsday. Therefore, the
         appellant cannot draw any support from the fact that from
         the day of the crime till the final verdict, a long time has
         elapsed. It must be remembered that fair trial is the right
         of an accused. Fair trial involves following the correct
         procedure and giving opportunity to the accused to
         probabilise his defence. In a matter such as this, hurried
         decision may not be in the interest of the appellant."

reported at (1989) 1 SCC 678, <a href="/doc/751831/" id="a_1457">Triveniben v. State of Gujarat</a> that
the time taken in court proceedings cannot be taken into account to
say that if there is a delay, the death sentence should be converted
into a life sentence.
</p><p id="p_1729">752. On this issue, the Constitution Bench in Triveniben stated
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_487">         "71. xxx xxx xxx The time taken in the judicial
         proceedings by way of trial and appeal was for the
         benefit of the accused. It was intended to ensure a fair
         trial to the accused and to avoid hurry-up justice. The
         time is spent in the public interest for proper
         administration of justice. If there is inordinate delay in
         disposal of the case, the trial court while sentencing or
         the appellate court while disposing of the appeal may
         consider the delay and the cause thereof along with other
         circumstances. The court before sentencing is bound to
         hear the parties and take into account every circumstance
         for and against the accused. If the court awards death
         sentence, notwithstanding the delay in disposal of the
         case, there cannot be a second look at the sentence save
         by way of review. There cannot be a second trial on the
         validity of sentence based on <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1458">Article 21.</a> The execution
         which is impugned is execution of a judgment and not
         apart from judgment. If the judgment with the sentence
         awarded is valid and binding, it falls to be executed in
         accordance with law since it is a part of the procedure
         established by law. Therefore, if the delay in disposal of
         case is not a mitigating circumstance for lesser sentence,
         it would be, in my opinion, wholly inappropriate to fall
         back upon the same delay to impeach the execution."

<p id="p_1731">(ix)     Possibility of reform and rehabilitation

</p><p id="p_1732">753. It is urged by Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Standing
Counsel for the State that material for this court to conclude as to
whether the defendants would not commit criminal act or acts of
violence in the future and whether there was any possibility of their
reform and rehabilitation is amply available from the record of the
trial court in respect of investigation and trial in the present case.
</p><p id="p_1733">754. So far as the post crime, pre-trial conduct of the defendants
is concerned, our attention is drawn to the material available on
record and our observations thereon in our judgment dated 2nd
April, 2014. After burning the body more than 50 kms from the
wedding, the three defendants set about creating false alibis and
absconded from justice. Two of the defendants Vikas Yadav and
Vishal Yadav stage managed their arrest at Dabra in the State of
M.P. and despite every effort by the Ghaziabad police which was
investigating the crime, they could not be traced out. The efforts to
track them included visits to home and the other places which they
visited. Close relatives of the defendants would not disclose their
whereabouts. Searches had to be effected in different States as
well. So far as the third defendant Sukhdev Yadav is concerned,
he could be arrested only on 23rd February, 2005 whence also he
opened fire on the police party.

</p><p id="p_1735"> 755. Ample material regarding the conduct of the defendants
during the trial is available on the trial court records.
</p><p id="p_1736">756. So far as the post conviction conduct i.e. conduct in jail is
concerned, the nominal rolls have been placed on record as also the
material which has been produced before this court pursuant to the
orders passed by us.                 It is therefore, submitted that there is
adequate material relating to both, offence as well as the offenders
on record, which is relevant for arriving at a conclusion on this
aspect of the matter and that in view thereof, there is no further
necessity of inducing further evidence or placing more material on
record.
</p><p id="p_1737">757. Let us examine the post crime conduct which can be divided
into three parts: (i) conduct during investigation; (ii) conduct
during trial and; (iii) conduct in jail. These three aspects have
been dealt with elaborately in the judgment dated 2nd April, 2014.
Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Standing Counsel for the State has
tabulated these circumstances as considered in depth in the
judgment which for convenience, we extract hereunder:
"CONDUCT POST CRIME DURING INVESTIGATION
</p><p id="p_1738">a)    In Para 72 of the judgment of conviction dated 2.4.2014,
discussed the arrest of two of the accused being stage managed
with definite purpose followed by dramatic entry of third accused
who was arrested after firing at a police patrol party.
</p>
<p id="p_1739">b)     In Para 782 of the judgment, this Court has observed as to
how the appellants delayed and hampered investigation by
misleading the police tream at the time of the recovery of the Tata
Safari vehicle.
</p>



<p id="p_1740">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                         pg. 520
</p><p id="p_1741"> c)    In Para 792 and 793 of the judgment, this Court has laid
down the manner in which the accused Vikas and Vishal
obstructed the police team in obtaining their custody and remand
from PS Dabra by first raising objections to the order allowing the
police remand and then delaying the handing over by stating that a
writ petition has been filed in the High Court of Allahabad which
eventually delayed the remand till the next day.
</p>
<p id="p_1742">d)    In para 801, how the accused misled the police to an inter-
state trip to Alwar, Rajasthan for recovery of Tata Safari.
Thereafter they disclosed that vehicle could be in UP or Punjab.
On 9.3.02, they led police team to Panipat, from where the vehicle
was finally recovered from burnt factory premises of Vikas
Yadav's father in Karnal.
</p>
<p id="p_1743">e) In Para 1421 and 1422 of the judgment, this Court has observed
the manner in which, after their arrest, the accused persons avoided
their custody being handed over to the Ghaziabad police by filing
frivolous applications and objections before the court.
</p>
<p id="p_1744">f) In para 1581, finding has been returned that accused persons
were absconding. Further, they stage managed their arrest from
outside maalgodown at Dabra as they wielded influence in Dabra.
Consequently, they delayed their custody being handed over to
Ghaziabad Police. This is followed by discussion on absondance
of Sukhdev Yadav.
</p>
<p id="p_1745">g) In Para 1603 of the judgment, this Court has stated as to how the
accused persons have violated statutory provisions and obstructed
justice with respect to the abscondance of Sukhdev Yadav which is
stated to be a part of a design in order to pressurize and exhaust the
witnesses and take advantage of fading memories of the witnesses
due to passage of time and thus resulting in contradictions and
omissions.
</p>
<p id="p_1746">h) In para 1611, the conduct of the accused in making no voluntary
efforts to join investigation is discussed.
</p>



<p id="p_1747">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 521
       In para 1612, Sukhdev Yadav opening fire at police party
when he was challenged and recovery of arms and ammunition
from him and his arrest on 23rd February, 2005 are discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_1748">i) In Para 1870 to 1880 of the judgment, this Court records the
influence of the defendants resulting in deliberate lapses, gaps and
defects left in the investigation. These included avoidance of
taking on record by the investigating officer of best evidence of
motive in the form of cards, albums etc., as the IO was under the
influence of the family of the accused persons; IO not visiting the
spot till February 28, 2002 leading to loss of crucial evidence; IO
not obtaining report with regard to presence of any inflammable
circumstance on the body of the deceased, nor lifting of soil, burnt
ash for chemical examination; IO not recording certain facts in
statement of Nilam Katara u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1459">Cr.P.C</a>.; lapse on the part of the
IO in not seeking opinion of doctor with regard to recovered
hammer and not making sketch of hammer; mistake by prosecution
in dropping Bharti Yadav as witness on March 30, 2005; mistake
in exhibiting statement of Kamal Kishore u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1460">Cr.P.C</a>.; failure
on the part of IO to analyse the call records and documents,
verification of emails; non conduct of TIP.
</p>
<p id="p_1749">j) In Para 1881, this court lamented the shocking state of affairs
wherein Bharti Yadav, an educated 23 year old young lady, was
terrorized and physically confined by her immediate family and
brow-beaten into submission.
</p>
<p id="p_1750">k) In para 1966, the aspects of Vikas and Vishal misleading the
investigations with regard to recovery of Tata Safari are discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_1751">CONDUCT DURING TRIAL:
</p>
<p id="p_1752">a) In Para 71, it is pointed out how in the first trial, out of 43
witnesses, all except one, including police officials, had to be
declared hostile or were won over and influenced.
</p><p id="p_1753">b) In Para 73 and Para 446 of the judgment, this Court has stated as
to how the well-placed accused persons had put pressure on the
public witnesses as well as the public prosecutor in the case.

</p><p id="p_1755"> c) In Para 76, obstruction of trial, subverting due process,
suborning witnesses and leading false evidence on the part of
accused is discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_1756">d) Para 78, intimidation of witnesses, suggestion of answers to not
only defence but also prosecution witnesses, to compel
contradictions and omissions on record, setting up false pleas in
applications and leading false evidence are discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_1757">e) In para 81 control over appearance of witnesses in court and
successful avoidance from testifying of Bharti Yadav for over three
and a half years is discussed.
</p>
<p id="p_1758">f) In Para 160, Para 163, Para 189-191, Para 996 and Para 2024 of
the judgment, this Court has illustrated the pressure which had
been put on PW Bharti Singh Yadav, both prior to the incident and
subsequent to the incident wherein she was spirited away from her
house to Faridabad and out of India subsequently, in order to save
her brothers at all costs. This court observed that such facts have
been denied by her which stand established by documentary
evidence and any testimony to the contrary cannot be relied on.
</p>
<p id="p_1759">g) In Para 392 and Para 393, this Court has stated as to how the
testimony of PW42, Bhawna Yadav, was tutored to favour the
accused persons as she initially denied all questions put to her and
on a later date changed her stand to depose that she does not
remember the number of times she had spoken on the phone to
Nilam Katara, Nitish Katara, Bharat Diwakar and Gaurav Gupta.
</p><p id="p_1760">h) In Para 602, 603 and Para 1999 of the judgment, this Court has
deprecated the arrogance with which the appellants conducted
themselves during trial and the impunity with which they had set
up a false defence which reeks of the sense that they deem
themselves to be above the law.
</p>
<p id="p_1761">i) In Para 719 of the judgment, this Court has stated as to how PW
23 who is stated to be a witness to the recovery of the body is
influenced by the accused persons in so far as in his testimony in



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                pg. 523
 court he could not give the time and date when he saw the police at
the spot where the body was found.
</p><p id="p_1762">(j)   In para 827, a finding was returned with regard to Vikas and
Vishal Yadav setting up a false plea that they had gone to wedding
of Shivani Gaur on February 16, 2002 not in a Tata Safari but in a
Mercedes Car.
</p><p id="p_1763">(k) In para 837 to 839 the aspect of doctored photograph Ex PW
6/D3 showing deceased wearing a round watch with metallic chain
is discussed. This is followed by discussion on PW-6 Archana
Sharma acting at the instance of accused persons and production of
photographs by her which were not genuine.
</p><p id="p_1764">(l)   In Para 841 of the judgment, this Court while dealing with
the deposition of PW-15, Vijay Kumar, has stated the manner in
which the accused persons had influenced the said witness in
supporting their defence plea by producing morphed photographs.
</p><p id="p_1765">(m) In Para 1063 of the judgment, this Court while considering
the testimony of PW 32, Ct. Satender Pal Singh, has noted the
pressure which was upon him as regards his testimony which was
evident from the sense of hopelessness expressed by him and that
despite best assurances from the trial court, the same failed to instil
confidence and as sense of security in him.
</p><p id="p_1766">(n) In Para 1069 and Para 1930 of the judgment, this Court has
expressed its view upon the testimony of PW 32 and PW 28 stating
that they reflect the manner in which the police constables had
either been won over or sufficiently intimidated to resile from the
statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_1461">Section 161</a> CrPC.
</p><p id="p_1767">(o) In Para 1431 of the judgment, it has been held that to negate
the prosecution allegation of abscondance all accused led defence
evidence of plea of alibi, which ultimately was found to be false.
</p><p id="p_1768">(p) In Para 1613, the conclusion with regard to the plea of alibi
being proved to be false is discussed.
</p><p id="p_1769">(q) In Para 1695, Para 1698, Para 1699 and Para 1940 of the
judgment, this Court has reflected upon how Bharat Diwakar (PW

Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                   pg. 524
</p><p id="p_1770"> 25) and Gaurav Gupta (PW 26) were won over and influenced by
the accused persons as during their examination in court they
resiled from the statements made to the police in order to dilute the
prosecution story.
</p><p id="p_1771">(r)    In Para 1840, Para 1842, Para 1926 and Para 1995 of the
judgment, this Court has observed the duress faced by PW 33, Ajay
Kumar, who expressed that he had received threats to his and his
family's life and to be roped in false cases at the instance of the
accused persons in order to make him change his statement and
give a favourable statement in favour of the accused persons. He
further stated that threats were also received from police officials
and that he had apprehension to his life and security.
</p><p id="p_1772">(s)   In Para 1917, this court under eight different heads has
elaborately discussed the conduct of the accused persons.
</p><p id="p_1773">(t)    In Para 1918, the setting up of false pleas that Vikas Yadav
and Vishal Yadav were at the house of DW-1 at the time when they
were spotted by Ajay Katara and subsequently their alibi from
February 17 to 23, 2002 and alibi of Sukhdev Yadav that he was in
his native village; this is followed by leading false evidence about
going to marriage of Shivani Gaur in a Mercedes and not a Tata
Safari.
</p><p id="p_1774">(u) In sub paras (c) to Para 1918 and subsequent paras upto Para
1923 of the judgment, this Court had made categorical observation
as regards the delay caused to the trial by the accused persons by
deliberately avoiding the appearance of PW 38, Bharti Singh
Yadav, before the trial court on one pretext or the other. The court
observed that how her movements after the incident were
orchestrated by her family members as she was shifted out of
Ghaziabad and eventually sent to the UK. The statement under
<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_1462">Section 161</a> CrPC was also recorded in the presence of her father.
This Court had also observed that the address provided of the said
witness was also incorrect as a Nottingham address was given
while she was staying in London. The witness finally appeared
only when steps were taken to revoke her passport. The court
made strong observations with regard to influence, reach and sheer
arrogance of the accused and the impunity with which the court

 orders were flouted and undertakings to produce the witness were
repeatedly violated, reflecting the mindset of the accused persons
in para 1923.
</p><p id="p_1775">(v) In Paras 1925-1926 intimidation                    of   witness   Ajay
Kumar/Katara is discussed in detail.
</p><p id="p_1776">(w) In Para 1927, it is observed that the record reflects that the
accused in the present case wielded political influence as well as
economic and physical power. As a result thereof various
witnesses deposed either out of fear, pressure, threat or because of
the influence of their relationship with accused persons. The
variations in the evidence of the witnesses between the statements
u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1463">CrPC</a> and court testimonies establish the pressure borne by
the witnesses. The witnesses included Shivani Arora nee Gaur,
BhawnaYadav, Ct. Inderjeet Singh, Ct. Satender Pal Singh, Rohit
Gaur, Bharat Diwakar, Gaurav Gupta and Virender Singh.
</p><p id="p_1777">(x) In Para 1929 and Para 1959 of the judgment, it has been
observed as to how the defence has worked as a part of a design in
defeating the prosecution case by manufacturing a false defence so
much as the witnesses resile in their testimonies given in the court
on the same aspects. This Court had infact considered criminal
action against the witnesses deposing falsely bt took a lenient view
taking into consideration the lapse of time.
(y) In Paras 1935-1943 of the judgment, it is stated as to how
PW 8, Rohit Gaur (in Sukhdev Yadav trial) too had turned hostile
to the extent of not remembering who accompanied Vikas Yadav
to the wedding and further denying making any statement to the
police.
</p><p id="p_1778">(z) In Para 1942-1943 of the judgment, this Court observed that,
during the trial there were instances of shouting in court and blatant
tutoring of witnesses inside the court and preventing the
testimonies from being recorded, and thereby displaying no respect
for process of law are discussed.
</p><p id="p_1779">aa) In para 1944, the defence counsels tutoring and suggesting
answers to the witnesses is discussed. Bharat Diwakar being under
the influence of accused persons is discussed in para 1945; defence

 counsel suggesting answers to DW-3 Rajender Chaudhary finds
mention in para 1946; interference by defence counsel during
examination of DW-1 finds mention in para 1948; Vikas Yadav
whispering in the ear of PW-15 Vikram Garg and observations
with regard to obstruction of trial are discussed in para 1949; the
design in improvements, contradictions and facts resiled from by
the witnesses finds mention in para 1958.
</p><p id="p_1780">bb) In Para 71, Para 1953, Para 1955, Para 1957, Para 1994 as
well as in Para 2004 of the judgment, this Court has stated as to
how police witnesses and other crucial witnesses such as Bharti
Yadav, Bhawna Yadav, Shivani Gaur etc. had been either won over
or influenced by or on behalf of the accused persons.
cc) In Paras 79, 1972 and 1973 of the judgment, this Court has
observed as to how the accused person tried their best to brow-beat
and intimidate the prosecutors who were conducting the
prosecution of the case, by sending legal notice, filing complaints
and civil suits against the prosecutors.
</p><p id="p_1781">dd) In Paras 1987 and 1988 of the judgment, this Court has
noted as to how the accused persons had manipulated the court
records to include papers which were seemingly introduced after
the passing of the judgment."
</p><p id="p_1782">758. In para 2004 of our judgment dated 2nd April, 2014, we have
been compelled to make the following observations:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_488">         ―Inference needs to be drawn against the accused
         persons who deliberately misled investigators; suborn
         witnesses; destroy evidence; win over crucial witnesses;</blockquote>
<p id="p_1783">         protract trial so that crucial evidence is lost or forgotten
         by witnesses... The education, economic status, position
         occupied by the witnesses is immaterial when accused
         persons go about exercising influence - it is only the
         nature of influence which may vary - so as to succeed in
         their dishonest designs... This case has distressed
         judicial conscience not only because of manner of
         commission of crime, but also because of the staunch

</p><p id="p_1784">759. Our attention is drawn to the pronouncement of the Supreme
Court reported at (2003) 12 SCC 199, <a href="/doc/17393829/" id="a_1464">Praveen Kumar v. State of
Karnataka</a> wherein it was held that abscondance for four years
indicated that possibility of rehabilitation was nil.
</p><p id="p_1785">760. The above narration would show that at the same time, every
effort was made to weaken the prosecution case.
</p><p id="p_1786">761. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned additional Standing Counsel
for the State has pointed out that in the judgment reported at (2013)
13 SCC 1, <a href="/doc/160740668/" id="a_1465">Yakub Abdul Razak Memon v. State of Maharashtra</a>,
cooperation with the investigating team has been taken as a
mitigating         circumstance           while        non-cooperation,   including
misleading investigators, would be treated as an aggravating
circumstance. The post crime conduct of the defendants noted
above must be taken as an aggravating circumstance.                         In the
present cases as well, therefore, the abscondance, failure to co-
operate with the investigators, the pressure put on the witnesses
and prosecutors and obstructions to fair trials have to be treated as
aggravating circumstances. These important circumstances do not
find even a mention in the orders of the learned trial judges.

married on 1st November, 2009 which ceremony was proceeded by
family functions to be held on 20th October, 2009; 24th October,

referring to his sicknesss as well as the marriage of his grandson
Kunal and expressing desire to spent time with Vikas Yadav and
also for him to make arrangements for the marriage functions and

was committed in the instant case on a misconceived belief that the
defendant was upholding the honour of the family, caste and the
community.

concerted effort was made by the defendants, as well as the father
and uncle of the defendant for a period of 3½ years. When Bharti
Yadav gave her deposition, Vikas Yadav sought exemption from
remaining present in court. During the course of submissions, it
has been pointed out that the sister of the defendant has been
married in the same community. It certainly cannot be expected
that in these circumstances, the family would take a stand against
the defendants. The filing of the affidavits by the family members
or family support for the defendants is therefore, of no
consequence so far as sentencing is concerned.

the other hand urged at length that Vikas Yadav has a criminal
state of mind and that his criminal activity started in the year 1991.
In his written submissions, Mr. Dey, learned counsel has pointed
out the following:
</p><p id="p_1803">"Vikas Yadav - (1) He was prosecuted for the murder of Devendra
P. Singh. The prosecution was withdrawn when his father D.P.
Yadav was a Minister in U.P. government (2) He was also detained
under the <a href="/doc/190229/" id="a_1468">National Security Act</a> though it was subsequently
quashed. (3) He was prosecuted in Jessica Lal murder case and
convicted under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1469">Section 201</a> of IPC. While on bail in the Jessica
case, he committed the murder of Nitish. The Supreme Court in
(2010) 6 SCC 1, <a href="/doc/1515299/" id="a_1470">Manu Sharma v. State</a> (paras 117, 125 and 126)

trial and during custody including tampering with court records,
threatening prosecutors and prosecution witnesses.                    They have
misused their qualifications to subvert the process of law. Mr. P.K.
Dey has vehemently urged that the antecedents of the third
defendant would also reflect his propensity towards crime.
</p><p id="p_1806">769. Let us firstly examine the profile of the defendants and the
circumstances brought out on record in respect of the offence. It is
contended by learned counsels for all the defendants that they were
of young ages, a mitigating factor.                    On the night of 16 th/17th
February, 2002 when the offence was committed, Vikas Yadav was
aged 26 years. We have been informed that Vikas Yadav is a
qualified engineer who had also obtained a degree in Masters in
Business Administration.
</p><p id="p_1807">770. Vishal Yadav was aged 24 years at the time of the offence.
Vishal Yadav had done his schooling from the Delhi Public
School, Ghaziabad followed by the graduation from the Delhi
University.
</p><p id="p_1808">771. Sukhdev Yadav was aged 27 years at the time of the offence
and was working in the liquor shop at Buland Shahr, U.P. which
belonged to the father of Vikas Yadav.
</p><p id="p_1809">772. Vikas Yadav has also contended that he was standing for
assembly elections which were to be scheduled shortly after the
incident.       Both Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav are managing
several properties and as emerges in the inquiry are extremely well
placed in life.

</p><p id="p_1811"> 773. Vishal Yadav was even in February, 2002 a well educated
married man with a child as well.
</p><p id="p_1812">774. Sukhdev Yadav, a matured man, was an employee of the
father of Vikas Yadav and a father of four children at that time. He
was also not of such vulnerable age that he did not understand the
import of his actions.               The three defendants were certainly so
stationed that they fully understood the nature and impact of their
actions.
</p><p id="p_1813">775. The age of the defendants has been pressed as a mitigating
factor. The defendants at the time of commission of the crime
were not so young for their age to come within the ambit of
consideration as a mitigating factor. They were not of an age
bordering juvenility but were of an age when they possessed the
maturity to understand completely the nature of their actions.
</p><p id="p_1814">776. It is trite that the age of the accused by itself is not a
determinative factor against award of the death sentence (Ref. :
Dhananjoy, Jai Kumar, Shivu, Ramdeo Chauhan, Atbir and
Vikram Singh).
</p><p id="p_1815">777. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, leanred Additional Standing Counsel
for State has drawn our attention to para 12 of the pronouncement
reported at (1991) 3 SCC 471, Sevaka Perumal, etc. v. State of
Tamil Nadu wherein a similar submission was repelled by the
Supreme Court observing as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_489">         "12. Undoubtedly under <a href="/doc/729076/" id="a_1477">Section 235(2)</a> of Code of
         Criminal Procedure, the accused is entitled to an
         opportunity to adduce evidence and if need be the case

          is to be adjourned to another date. There is illegality to
         convict and to impose sentence on the same day. It is
         true as contended for the State that under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1478">Section 309(2)</a>
         third proviso brought by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_1479">Amendment Act</a>, 1978 no
         adjournment should be granted for the purpose only of
         enabling the accused person to show cause against
         sentence to be imposed upon him. Under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1480">Section 235(2)</a>
         when the accused has been given right to be heard on
         the question of sentence it is a valuable right. To make
         that right meaningful the procedure adopted should be
         suitably moulded and (sic) the accused given an
         opportunity to adduce evidence on the nature of the
         sentence. The hearing may be on the same day if the
         parties are ready or be adjourned to a next date but once
         the court after giving opportunity proposes to impose
         appropriate sentence there is no need to adjourn the case
         any further thereon. No doubt the Sessions Judge
         needed to adjourn the case under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1481">Section 235(2)</a> to next
         date but in the High Court the counsel was directed to
         show any additional grounds on the question of
         sentence. The High Court observed that the counsel was
         unable to give any additional ground. It is further
         contended that the appellants are young men. They are
         the breadwinners of their family each consisting of a
         young wife, minor child and aged parents and that,
         therefore, the death sentence may be converted into
         life. We find no force. These compassionate grounds
         would always be present in most cases and are not
         relevant for interference. Thus we find no infirmity in
         the sentence awarded by the Sessions Court and
         confirmed by the High Court warranting interference.
         The appeals are accordingly dismissed."
</blockquote><p id="p_1816">778. It is not an inflexible rule that in every case where the
accused is a young person, death sentence cannot be granted. The
final adjudication rests on a consideration of all relevant facts and
circumstances.

</p><p id="p_1818"> 779. The discussion by us would show that the defendants in the
instant case have no respect at all for the law and the judicial
system.       While on bail in the Jessica Lal murder case, Vikas
Yadav has committed the offence in the present case. It has been
urged by Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel that Vikas Yadav
was found guilty only for commission of offence under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1482">Section
201</a> of the IPC in the Jessica Lal murder case and not for any
serious offence.           Learned counsel would urge that this conviction
is irrelevant for consideration of a sentence for commission of the
offence of murder.
</p><p id="p_1819">780. Let us examine the allegations for which Vikas Yadav was
tried and found guilty in the Jessica Lal murder case.                The
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case is reported at (2010) 6
SCC 1, <a href="/doc/1515299/" id="a_1483">Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of
Delhi</a>):        We may briefly notice the essential facts and the
allegations against Vikas Yadav in this case as they point to the
mindset of the defendant. On the 29th of April, 1999, Vikas Yadav
had accompanied Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma, Amandeep
Singh Gill and Alok Khanna to the Tamarind Cafe in a black Tata
Safari bearing no.CH-01-W-6535 where a Thursday night party
was going on. At about 2:00 am, Manu Sharma asked for some
drinks of liquor, however, the waiter did not serve the same as the
party was already over. On this, Manu Sharma took out a .22"
calibre pistol and fired one shot at the roof while another shot was
fired at Jessica Lal (working as a waitress) which hit her near the
left eye as a result of which she was declared dead in the early

 hours of 30th April, 1999 at the Apollo Hospital. Manu Sharma
and his associates abandoned the vehicle while making good their
hasty escape after the shooting.
</p><p id="p_1820">781. On receipt of an information about the incident, the police
reached the Tamarind Cafe at about 2:30/2:45 am on 30th April,
1999 and directed PW-30 (Shrawan Kumar), a home guard
constable to keep a vigil at the parking lot so that nobody is
allowed to take the cars parked there. While on duty, this guard
saw a while Tata Sierra vehicle, occupied by two persons on the
front seats, bringing in their vehicle slowly and stopping the same
near the Tata Safari. Vikas Yadav got out and opened the Tata
Safari with a key. Despite being told by the guard not to do so, he
forcibly entered the Tata Safari, started the vehicle and drove away
with it. The guard gave a lathi blow on the last window pane on
the driver's side on the Tata Safari, as a result of which, the
window pane broke. The witness identified Amardeep Singh Gill
who had driven the Tata Sierra and Vikas Yadav who accompanied
him and as the person who forcibly took away the Tata Safari. The
Tata Safari was subsequently recovered from Noida on the 2nd of
May 1999 when a live cartridge of a .22" weapon bearing a Mark
'C' was recovered from the vehicle. Two empty cartridge cases of
the .22" with 'C' Mark were recovered from the spot of the murder
and the mutilated lead recovered from the skull of the deceased
was of .22" which could have been fired from the standard .22"
calibre fire arm. Manu Sharma admitted that he possessed a fire

 arm licence and that he also owned a .22" bore Beretta pistol made
in Italy. The weapon of offence was not recovered.
</p><p id="p_1821">782. On these facts, while Manu Sharma was charged for
commission of an offence under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1484">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1485">201</a> read with 120B

read with 120B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1489">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_1822">783. The judgment of acquittal by the trial judge dated 21st
February, 2006 was reversed on the State appeal by the Division
Bench of this court inter alia holding that Vikas Yadav with the
other co-accused had come to the Cafe in the said Tata Safari and
was present at the time of the incident.               The Tata Safari was
abandoned by Manu Sharma at the time of his escape which was
subsequently removed from outside the Cafe pursuant to a
conspiracy between Vikas Yadav, Amardeep Singh Gill and Manu
Sharma.         It was consequently held that they were guilty for
commission of the offences under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1490">Section 201</a> read with 120B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1491">IPC</a>
by a separate judgment dated 20th December, 2006. This court had
handed sentences of two to four years of rigorous imprisonment
each and a fine of Rs.2,000/- each and in default three months of
imprisonment under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1492">Section 201</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_1493">120B</a> of the IPC.
</p><p id="p_1823">784. It appears that Vikas Yadav was on bail in this case when he
committed the offence in the present case on the night intervening
16th/17th February, 2002. The judgments in Jessica Lal were not
placed before us during arguments in the appeals against
conviction and examination thereof would show a striking parallels


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                       pg. 539
 between the present case and what transpired in Jessica Lal's
murder trial.          The large number of witnesses turning hostile;
challenge to identification on identical grounds as in the present
case; objection to the make of the vehicle; the dispute with regard
to identification; the grounds on which recoveries were assailed
and; the nature of the expert witness evidence (ballistic expert in
Jessica Lal's case and the medical expert in the present case), are to
name a few parities.
</p><p id="p_1824">785. We find that, just as in the present case, in Jessica Lal's case
as well [para 47 at pages 176-177 of] (2007) 93 DRJ 145, <a href="/doc/1238469/" id="a_1494">State v.
Sidharth Vashisht &amp; Ors., the Division Bench</a> has noted that an
application dated 16th August, 1999 was "clearly a plant in
judicial record". It was noted that there was no reference to any
such application in any proceedings of Magistrate and that "even if
it was filed, it was only an eye-wash, not to be pursued and, in fact,
it was not pursued at all". In our judgment dated 2nd April, 2014,
we have also held so with regard to an application which was
sought to be relied upon by Vikas Yadav before us. It is perhaps a
sheer coincidence that in both cases, a black Tata Safari was
involved and that the city of Karnal has prominently figured.
</p><p id="p_1825">786. Though Vikas Yadav was not found guilty for commission
of the offence under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1495">Section 302</a>, but his conduct amply illustrate
the mindset and the arrogance of the defendant that he could
actually take away the vehicle which was under police guard. It
reflects complete lack of respect for authority and the law and

 manifests a confidence that he is above law, that even the long
arms of law cannot touch him.
</p><p id="p_1826">787. While on bail in this case, Nitish Katara was murdered on
the night of 16th/17th February, 2002.
</p><p id="p_1827">788. The circumstances in Jessica Lal murder, the manner of
commission of murder committed in the presence of Vikas Yadav
and the manner in which he committed the offence of <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_1496">Section 201</a>
of the IPC in that case are certainly relevant for assessment for his
propensity to commit offences in the future.
</p><p id="p_1828">789. We also note that the conduct of Vikas Yadav clearly
displays criminality in attitude as, from being a by-stander in the
commission of the offence of murder in Jessica Lal's murder, he
has been actually involved in the murder in the present case, even
while standing trial in the previous case.             This is certainly an
important circumstance which points towards the propensity
towards crime.
</p><p id="p_1829">790. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan, learned Additional Standing Counsel
for the State has pointed out the practical reality that education and
social eminence is unfortunately inversely proportionate to severity
of the sentencing. He has drawn our attention to the following
observations in the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported
at (2010) 14 SCC 641 (para 169), Mohd. Farooq Abdul Gafur &amp;
Anr. v. State of Maharashtra:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_490">         ―Swinging fortunes‖

          for us when we speak of fair trial. The situation is
         accentuated due to the inherent imperfections of the
         system in terms of delays, mounting cost of litigation in
         High Courts and Apex Court, legal aid and access to
         courts and inarticulate information on socio-economic
         and criminological context of crimes. In such a context,
         some of the leading commentators on death penalty
         hold the view that it is invariably the marginalised and
         the destitute who suffer the extreme penalty ultimately.‖

observed as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_492">         ―73. Despite the investigation being conducted under
         judicial scrutiny of not only the Chief Judicial
         Magistrate, Ghaziabad but also this court in Crl.Writ

         to protracted objections. The trials bring to fore the
         manner in which well-placed accused persons are able
         to put pressure on the public witnesses and public
         prosecutors in the very capital of India, in a trial court

         barely a kilometer from the Supreme Court, as the

         faculties were ripe enough to comprehend the

         warrant pardon of this Court. Secondly, the circumstance
         that the appellants have a family and old aged parents
         etc. does not convinces us, especially in light of the fact
         that the parents themselves have testified against the
         appellant's act of uprooting their brother's family and
         their utter disregard for blood relations. Thirdly, the mere
         fact that some of the accused persons of young age have
         been awarded a lesser sentence than death sentence can
         not be made a ground for commuting the sentence of
         death to imprisonment for life. The manner in which the
         crime was committed on the helpless members of a
         family including children of tender age and child with
         locomotive disability and design of the accused-
         appellants to eliminate the whole family justifies the
         grant of death sentence. Lastly, the manner of the

         and innocent children of deceased-Haneef Khan for
         property and choice of the day of commission of crime

         be the most appropriate punishment. We are mindful that

</p><p id="p_1833">793. It cannot be disputed that the murder in the present case was
committed with utmost brutality and shook the collective
conscience of the society to the hilt. The conduct of two of the
defendants Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav after conviction
suggests that their education in good institutions and their
placement in society, instead of inculcating discipline, has led to
creation of an arrogance that their position in society places them
above the law and they continue to exhibit lack of respect for the
discipline of law. Instead of motivating them to abide by the law,
even after commission of the crime, they have acted in the worst
possible manner during investigation; before the learned trial court
as well as in the jail.               In the given circumstances, their age,
qualifications and social status certainly do not mitigate their
culpability. Despite convictions they show no concern for society
and persist in aggressively manipulating the systems.
</p><p id="p_1834">794. In the present case, it would certainly be a travesty of justice
if the age, education and economic status of the defendants was
accepted as a mitigating factor so far as sentencing is concerned.

</p><p id="p_1836"> (xii) Finding that death penalty is not deterrent

</p><p id="p_1837">795. The learned trial judge in the order dated 30th May, 2008 was
further of the view that it is not the death penalty which was the
deterrent inasmuch as the person is hung to death in a few seconds
and that it is the life imprisonment which is a deterrent wherein a
convict dies every moment in jail. These observations may be
correct if life imprisonment meant the remainder of the convict's
life. However, in so stating, the learned trial judge has based her
conclusions on a personal opinion in ignorance of provisions of
<a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_1498">Sections 432</a> and <a href="/doc/1275473/" id="a_1499">433</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a view
which has to be treated as unreasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_1838">(xiii) Murder - not an honour killing

</p><p id="p_1839">796. So far as the order on sentence dated 12th July, 2011 with
regard to Sukhdev Yadav @ Pehalwan is concerned, the learned
trial judge has recorded that such a situation may not describe the
case as a murder committed as ―honour killing‖. This finding is
contrary to the record as well as our judgment dated 2nd April,
2014.       The circumstances of the criminal have also not been
considered by the learned trial judge.

<p id="p_1840">(xiv) Possibility of reform and rehabilitation and its impact on
      imposition of death penalty

</p><p id="p_1841">797. The consideration of the entirety of the circumstances
established by the prosecution which have been detailed in our
judgment dated 2nd April, 2014 especially with regard to the


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                               pg. 545
 meticulous planning and execution of the crimes; the brutality with
which they were executed and our above discussion on the various
other factors and circumstances pressed before us certainly brings
the present case in the category of 'rarest of rare' cases. However,
so far as imposition of the death sentence is concerned, it is well
settled that a case falling in the rarest of rare category would per se
not invite imposition of the death penalty but the important factor
with regard to the possibility of reform and rehabilitation of the
offender has to be examined.
</p><p id="p_1842">798. It is contended on behalf of the defendants that the State has
not led evidence in accordance with Bachan Singh to show that
the accused persons are beyond possibility of reformation and
rehabilitation and therefore, death sentence cannot be imposed
against the defendants.               The Supreme Court has repeatedly held
that it is open to the court to examine the material in this regard on
the available record.
</p><p id="p_1843">799. We have discussed heretofore the nature of hearing and the
factors which are required to be considered by the court in deciding
upon the appropriate sentence (Santa Singh). Both the prosecution
and the defendant are required to be given an opportunity to bring
relevant material on record. We have noted the principle that in
case the State fails to produce any material on record, the court
could ascertain from the available material on record, if there are
any mitigating factors favouring the accused. In case a proper pre-
sentence hearing has not been afforded, it is open to the appellate
court to do so.

</p><p id="p_1845"> 800. It is thus, well settled that material with regard to sentencing
can be gathered from the earlier stage of the proceedings. In the
present case, we have extensively noted the post-crime conduct of
the defendants. The State and the complainant have urged that
given the nature of the crimes as well as the conduct of the
defendants, they ought not to go unpunished and that enhanced
punishment is necessary to ensure the adequacy of the sentence.

or interference in the administration of justice and strike a blow to
the rule of law. Learned counsel would contend that these acts
prove beyond doubt that the defendants have no remorse and are
beyond reformation.
</p><p id="p_1849">803. It is contended by Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned cousnel that
the appellant Vikas Yadav has undergone lengthy incarceration of
more than 12 years.
</p><p id="p_1850">804. As per the nominal roll placed before us, Vikas Yadav has
been in custody in the present case since 25 th February, 2002. He
has gone on custody parole by the order dated 23rd October, 2009
on 1st November, 2009 to attend the marriage ceremony of his
sister from three hours before the 'barat' and till the 'doli' in the
morning. Thereafter by the order dated 7th April, 2011, he was
permitted to go in custody firstly on 14 th April, 2011 to attend the
ring ceremony of brother Kunal at Hyatt Regency Hotel for two
hours and secondly on 29th April, 2011 to attend his marriage at
Umrao Hotel and Resort, NH-8 from 6:00 pm to early hours of 30 th
April, 2011. These were two occasions when he was permitted by
the court.
</p><p id="p_1851">805. However, we have discussed hereinabove that Vikas Yadav
has repeatedly gone out of jail post conviction on the pretext of
hospital visits. In addition, he has had an unwarranted hospital stay
w.e.f. 10th October, 2011 to 4th November, 2011 which period we


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                  pg. 548
 have held cannot be treated as a period during which he underwent
imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_1852">806. Vishal Yadav was arrested in the present case on 25th
February, 2002 and admitted to bail on 11 th October, 2005 as an
undertrial. He came to be lodged in the prison upon his conviction
of 28th May, 2002. It is submitted by Mr. Sanjay Jain that both
while on bail or when he was granted suspension of sentence, there
has been no complaint against the conduct of Vishal Yadav. It is
submitted that he does not belong to the family of Vikas Yadav.
He is a married man with a daughter aged 12 years and deserves
leniency.
</p><p id="p_1853">807. With regard to Vishal Yadav's argument with regard to
marriage of his sister in a different caste, Mr. P.K. Dey submits
that this marriage took place more than 12 years after the murder of
Nitish Katara.           He further submits that so far as his brother's
marriage is concerned, the same did not survive for reasons best
known to Vishal Yadav's family.
</p><p id="p_1854">808. The closeness of Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav and their
complicity in the crime and the course of events thereafter is
evident from the fact that in the record of Batra Hospital, in 2004
Vishal Yadav has given his address as that of Mr. D.P. Yadav
(father of Vikas Yadav) at 15, Balwant Rai Mehta's Lane, New
Delhi. After the crime, they also absconded and were arrested
together.
</p><p id="p_1855">809.      So far as Sukhdev Yadav is concerned, he got together with
the other two defendants who are from the same caste and


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                    pg. 549
 committed the heinous crimes. He remained absconding for over
three years after crime till he was arrested on 23rd February, 2005.
All efforts to arrest him including issuance of proclamation and
attachment of property were of no avail. Even when the police
party went to arrest him, he opened fire pursuant to which a case
under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_1517">Section 307</a> IPC bearing FIR No.56/05 was registered
against him by Police Station Dewaria in District Kushi Nagar.
Another FIR No.57/05 was also registered against him under the
<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1518">Arms Act</a>. Sukhdev Yadav's abscondance for over three years
appears to be a part of the clear design to pressurize and exhaust
witnesses. His culpability for the offence is no less than that of the
other two defendants though his incarceration appears to have
chastened him over the last two years.
</p><p id="p_1856">810. So far as Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav are concerned,
despite their conviction for such heinous offences, we have
discussed and concluded above that while in jail, they have
ruthlessly misused the process of law and have manipulated
hospital visits and admissions. This conduct of Vikas Yadav and
Vishal Yadav manifests that there is no remorse or regret. The jail
stay has also had no impact so far as reformation and rehabilitation
of these two defendants is concerned.
</p><p id="p_1857">811. We may note that, before us, it has not been argued on
behalf of any of the defendants that they have no responsibility for
the manipulations which have resulted in the hospital visits or the
unwarranted admissions. This is rightly so. The defendants are the
ones who have directly benefitted as a result and have been able to


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 stay out of the Tihar jail for different periods which we have noted
above. Why would the jail or medical authorities permit such visits
and admissions unless it was persuaded by them, to assist their
stays out of the jail?
</p><p id="p_1858">812. It is necessary to point out an important factor that there is
no such allegation of feigning sickness and unnecessary hospital
visits and admission against Sukhdev Yadav, a reflection of the
reality that he, not as well placed as the other two, does not have
the influence, to manipulate authority and systems.
</p><p id="p_1859">813. So far as the post conviction conduct i.e. the conduct of the
defendants in jail is concerned, the following jail punishments are
revealed in the nominal rolls:
</p><p id="p_1860">CONDUCT IN JAIL:
</p><p id="p_1861">a)     As per the nominal roll of Vikas Yadav, he was awarded
punishment dated 28.05.2012 when 10 cigarettes were recovered
from him. Another punishment dated 10.07.2013 was awarded to
him for assaulting a ward sahayak. His jail conduct for the last one
year is stated to be satisfactory.
</p>
<p id="p_1862">b)     As per the nominal roll of Vishal Yadav, he was awarded
punishment dated 28.05.2012 when tobacco was recovered from
him. Another punishment dated 08.07.2013 was awarded to him

year is stated to be satisfactory.

</p><p id="p_1865"> 814. Vikas Yadav has filed W.P.(Crl.)No.1644/2014 impugning
the order of the Lt. Governor rejecting his application for parole.
In this case, a report by Mr. Yogesh Chandra Mishra, Probationary
Officer, Department of Social Welfare Government of NCT of
Delhi dated 26th August, 2014 has been filed by the jail authorities.
Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel for the defendant has
extensively relied on this report contending that the report
establishes that the possibility of the defendant's reform and
rehabilitation cannot be ruled out.                    Reliance is placed on the
judgment in Birju by Mr. Verma in this regard.
</p><p id="p_1866">815. This report is staunchly challenged by the State as well as
the complainant. It is pointed out by the complainant that Mr.
Sunil Babu, an officer, Ward no.5 of the jail recorded her statement
on the 2nd October, 2014.                     Mr. Mahajan, learned Additional
Standing Counsel has also submitted that no such report had been
requisitioned by him and that the probationary officer has not
undertaken relevant issues into consideration nor the behaviour
pattern of the defendant over the entire period since the crime
before returning a finding on the possibility of his reformation. It
is submitted that no sociological or psychiatric appraisal by any
expert or specialised body was undertaken and that the report is
premised completely on the conduct of the defendant for the period
immediately preceding the report.
</p><p id="p_1867">816. The report of the probationary officer encloses statements of
what has been termed as "three neighbours". It is pointed out by
Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel for the complainant (and not

 disputed by Vikas Yadav) that out of these three persons, Suraj
Singh (shown resident of 4/32, Raj Nagar) is a servant of Mr. D.P.
Yadav (father of the defendant) who stays in the same residence
while Satendra (residing at 4/17, Raj Nagar) is a son of Shri D.P.
Yadav's elder brother Shyam Singh.                     The third person whose
statement was recorded is also a neighbour, obviously under the
influence of the family of Vikas Yadav.
</p><p id="p_1868">817. It is complained by the Mr. P.K. Dey that the last two lines
of the probationary officer's report indicate his malafides. The
report does not even advert to the pre-conviction and post
conviction conduct of the defendant including the manipulated
hospital visits and admissions. The report also does not refer to the
fact that the c'omplainant as well as a witness in the case are even
on date granted police protection. The report makes no reference
to the circumstances in which the parole was rejected.
</p><p id="p_1869">818. It needs no elaboration that it is not the conduct of the
defendant when consideration of his appeal is underway which
alone is to be considered but his conduct over his entire stay in jail
has to be considered.
</p><p id="p_1870">         We have already noted above the report from the
Superintendant, Jail about the defendants' conduct since 2013.
</p><p id="p_1871">819. Something needs to be stated about this report which has
been filed directly by the jail authorities without being routed
through even learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State
who represents the authorities before us. There is certainly weight
in the submission of Mr. Dey that this defendant continues to wield

 a deep influence.            We are refraining from commenting further on
this report which we will consider in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_1872">(xvi) Conduct since July, 2013

</p><p id="p_1873">820. Mr. Sumeet Verma, learned counsel appearing for Vikas
Yadav has submitted that Vikas Yadav has undergone several
Vipasana sessions in the jail. In support of his submission with
regard to jail conduct of Vikas Yadav is concerned, Mr. Verma has
pointed out that Vikas Yadav's conduct in jail for the last one year
has been exemplary. Placing reliance on certificates and rewards
by jail authorities including a certificate of recognition dated 16th
April, 2014; for good conduct; 31st May, 2014 issued by the
Gandhi Smriti Darshan Samiti for participating in the competition
and his poetry published in by-monthly jail magazine "Asha Ki
Kiran".
</p><p id="p_1874">821. The above activities and courses have been undergone by
him after the consideration of the appeal against conviction had
commenced. Reform, remorse and repentance for the offence as
well as respect for systems has to be manifested from every action
of the defendant. Only then will the court conclude that reform and
rehabilitation is possible. Lip service to the rehabilitation
programmes being conducted in the jail with the object of earning
sympathy of the court cannot impact the present consideration. It
is while in custody, the defendant has manipulated many outside
jail visits.
</p>



<p id="p_1875">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                     pg. 554
</p><p id="p_1876"> 822. However, the nominal rolls also do not disclose any jail
offences by any of the three defendants over the last year. The
nominal rolls state that the conduct of the defendants in jail is now
satisfactory.         There is also no material that after 2012, the
defendants are still manipulating the systems to secure 'outings'
from the jail.
</p><p id="p_1877">823. Let us also examine the material available in the present case
on the aspect of possibility of reform and rehabilitation of these
defendants. The nominal rolls discussed above would show that
for the last one year only, the conduct of these defendants has been
satisfactory. No offence is reported from the jail after July, 2013.
This fact would suggest that the possibility of reformation and
rehabilitation of the defendants is not "unforseeably foreclosed"
and therefore, the present case may not invite the imposition of
death penalty on the defendants.
</p>

<p id="p_1878">(xvii) Variations in judicial response to similar fact situations

</p><p id="p_1879">824. So far as imposition of a death sentence is concerned, it is
argued before us that one guard who rapes and murders a young
girl residing in the building over which he stands as a guard got a
death sentence (Dhananjoy Chatterjee) whereas a similarly aged
guard who commits a similar, if not identical crime, gets life
imprisonment            (Rameshbhai             Chandubhai   Rathod).     The
submission is that use of a particular weapon for commission of the
crime of murder makes it more heinous in one case while the same




Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                          pg. 555
 may be treated as less heinous in another. It leads to variation in
the sentence imposed from the capital punishment in one case to
the life imprisonment in another. Learned counsels submit that the
education or the economic status of one defendant has been
considered a mitigating circumstance while considering imposition
of a punishment.              It is urged that on the other hand, higher
education, better economic status should in fact be an aggravating
circumstance as such persons would be expected to know both the
correct conduct as well as the consequences of their actions; why
should the act of cutting up a dead body after murdering a in one
case lead to imposition of a death sentence whereas for a similar
offence, in another case, it may not be deemed relevant. It is
submitted that this dichotomy ought to weigh in favour of the
defendants.
</p><p id="p_1880">825. We           may       usefully        refer      to   Sangeet,   Rameshbhai
Chandubhai Rathod (2), Swamy Shraddananda (2) and Ashok
Debbarma @ Achak Debbarma wherein the court has expressed
distress and discomfort with imposition of death sentences for
other reasons.
</p><p id="p_1881">826. In Swamy Shraddananda (2), the court reviewed the
application of the sentencing court relating to the death sentence
through aggravating and mitigating circumstances and concluded
that there was lack of evenness in the sentencing process. In para
48 of the judgment, the court held thus:
</p>
<p id="p_1882">         "48. That is not the end of the matter. Coupled with the
         deficiency of the criminal justice system is the lack of

          consistency in the sentencing process even by this
         Court. It is noted above that Bachan Singh [(1980) 2
         SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580 : AIR 1980 SC 898] laid
         down the principle of the rarest of rare cases. Machhi
         Singh [(1983) 3 SCC 470 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 681] , for
         practical application crystallised the principle into five
         definite categories of cases of murder and in doing so
         also considerably enlarged the scope for imposing death
         penalty. But the unfortunate reality is that in later
         decisions neither the rarest of rare cases principle nor
         the Machhi Singh [(1983) 3 SCC 470 : 1983 SCC (Cri)
         681] categories were followed uniformly and
         consistently."

</p><p id="p_1884">827. The Supreme Court's discomfort that the working of the
balance sheet approach had not worked sufficiently well was
reiterated in (2009) 6 SCC 498, <a href="/doc/1312651/" id="a_1519">Santosh Kumar Satish Bhushan

                   which on similar facts this Court took contrary
                  views on giving death penalty to the convict (see
                  SCC pp. 279-87, paras 151-78: Scale pp. 504-10,
                  paras 154-82). He finally observed (SCC para 158)
                  that ‗courts in the matter of sentencing act
                  differently although the fact situation may appear
                  to be somewhat similar' and further ‗it is evident
                  that different Benches had taken different view in
                  the matter' (SCC para 168). Katju, J. in his order
                  passed in this appeal said that he did not agree with
                  the decision in Aloke Nath Dutta [(2007) 12 SCC

                  467] in that it held that death sentence was not to
                  be awarded in a case of circumstantial evidence.
                  Katju, J. may be right that there cannot be an
                  absolute rule excluding death sentence in all cases
                  of circumstantial evidence (though inAloke Nath

                  not as an absolute rule). But there is no denying
                  the illustrations cited by Sinha, J. which are a
                  matter of fact.

<blockquote id="blockquote_498">                  50. The same point is made in far greater detail in
                  a report called, ‗Lethal Lottery, The Death Penalty
                  in India' compiled jointly by Amnesty
                  International India and People's Union for Civil

                  based on the study of the Supreme Court
                  judgments in death penalty cases from 1950 to
                  2006. One of the main points made in the report
                  (see Chapters 2 to 4) is about the Court's lack of
                  uniformity and consistency in awarding death
                  sentence.</blockquote>

<p id="p_1885">                  51. The truth of the matter is that the question of
                  death penalty is not free from the subjective
                  element and the confirmation of death sentence or
                  its commutation by this Court depends a good deal

<p id="p_1886">                  52. The inability of the criminal justice system to
                  deal with all major crimes equally effectively and
                  the want of uniformity in the sentencing process by
                  the Court lead to a marked imbalance in the end
                  results. On the one hand there appears a small
                  band of cases in which the murder convict is sent
                  to the gallows on confirmation of his death penalty
                  by this Court and on the other hand there is a
                  much wider area of cases in which the offender
                  committing murder of a similar or a far more
                  revolting kind is spared his life due to lack of
                  consistency by the Court in giving punishments
                  or worse the offender is allowed to slip away
                  unpunished on account of the deficiencies in the
                  criminal justice system. Thus the overall larger
                  picture gets asymmetric and lopsided and presents
                  a poor reflection of the system of criminal
                  administration of justice. This situation is a matter
                  of concern for this Court and needs to be remedied.

         applies to the judicial process at the sentencing stage. We
         share the Court's unease and sense of disquiet
         in Swamy Shraddananda (2) case [(2008) 13 SCC 767 :
         (2008) 10 Scale 669] and agree that a capital
         sentencing system which results in differential
         treatment of similarly situated capital convicts
         effectively classifies similar convicts differently with
         respect to their right to life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1522">Article 21.</a> Therefore,
         an equal protection analysis of this problem is
         appropriate. In the ultimate analysis, it serves as an alarm
         bell because if capital sentences cannot be rationally

          distinguished from a significant number of cases where
         the result was a life sentence, it is more than an
         acknowledgement of an imperfect sentencing system. In
         a capital sentencing system if this happens with some
         frequency there is a lurking conclusion as regards the
         capital sentencing system becoming constitutionally
         arbitrary. We have to be, thus, mindful that the true

         extraordinary and exceptional case."

 "beyond reasonable doubt".                     In para 29, the court discussed
'residual doubt' as a mitigating circumstance which was sometimes
used and urged in the United States of America dealing with the
death sentence.           Refering to the fact situation of the case, the
observations of the court in para 31 deserve to be extracted in
extenso and read as thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_506">         "31. In Commonwealth v. Webster [(1850) 5 Cush 295 :
         52 Am Dec 711 (Mass Sup Ct)] at p. 320, Massachusetts
         Court, as early as in 1850, has explained the expression
         ―reasonable doubt‖ as follows:
</blockquote>
                  ―Reasonable doubt ... is not a mere possible doubt;
<blockquote id="blockquote_507">                  because everything relating to human affairs, and
                  depending on moral evidence, is open to some
                  possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the
                  case which, after the entire comparison and
                  consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds
                  of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say
                  they feel an abiding conviction.‖

         In our criminal justice system, for recording guilt of the
         accused, it is not necessary that the prosecution should
         prove the case with absolute or mathematical certainty,
         but only beyond reasonable doubt. Criminal courts, while
         examining whether any doubt is beyond reasonable
         doubt, may carry in their mind, some ―residual doubt‖,
         even though the courts are convinced of the accused
         persons' guilt beyond reasonable doubt. For instance, in
         the instant case, it was pointed out that, according to the
         prosecution, 30-35 persons armed with weapons such as
         firearms, dao, lathi, etc., set fire to the houses of the
         villagers and opened fire which resulted in the death of
         15 persons, but only eleven persons were charge-sheeted
         and, out of which, charges were framed only against five
         accused persons. Even out of those five persons, three
         were acquitted, leaving the appellant and another, who is

          absconding. The court, in such circumstances, could have
         entertained a ―residual doubt‖ as to whether the appellant
         alone had committed the entire crime, which is a
         mitigating circumstance to be taken note of by the court,
         at least when the court is considering the question
         whether the case falls under the rarest of the rare
         category."

<p id="p_1895">833. The court also considered the counsel's ineffectiveness
which may have prejudiced the defence as a mitigating factor in
para 36 of the judgment which reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_508">         "36. Right to get proper and competent assistance is the

         engage a counsel, owing to poverty or similar
         circumstances, trial would be vitiated unless the State
         offers free legal aid for his defence to engage a counsel,
         to whose engagement, the accused does not object. It is a

</blockquote><p id="p_1896">834. In para 37, the court noted a submission on behalf of the
appellant that ineffective legal assistance caused prejudiced to him
and hence the same be treated as a mitigating circumstance while
awarding sentence. The Supreme Court noted in para 38 that the
"right to get proper legal assistance plays a crucial role in
adversarial system, since excess to counsel's skill and knowledge is
necessary to accord the accused an ample opportunity to meet the
case of the prosecution".
</p><p id="p_1897">835. So far as to whether such ineffectiveness of counsel has to be
treated as a mitigating circumstance, in para 39, the court held as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_509">         "39. The court, in determining whether prejudice
         resulted from a criminal defence counsel's
         ineffectiveness, must consider the totality of the
         evidence. When an accused challenges a death sentence
         on the ground of prejudicially ineffective representation
         of the counsel, the question is whether there is a
         reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the court
         independently reweighing the evidence, would have
         concluded that the balance of aggravating and
         mitigating circumstances did not warrant the death
         sentence.</blockquote>
<p id="p_1898">                          (Emphasis supplied)


         Thus the Supreme Court has considered residual doubt
nurtured by the court and counsel's ineffectiveness as relevant
circumstances for not awarding the death sentence.

</p><p id="p_1900"> 836. Yet another factor which is unique to the imposition of the
death penalty is that, once executed, a death sentence is irreversible
in nature. Once the life of the convict is extinguished, he cannot be
brought back. The discussion in the preceding paras of this
judgment would show that even judicially trained minds can apply
the same circumstance as aggravating or mitigating differently to
conclude that the circumstances do not warrant a death penalty
whereas another may feel it to be a fit case justifying the death
penalty.
</p><p id="p_1901">837. The Supreme Court was called upon to consider the question
as to whether the hearing of review petitions by the Supreme Court
in death sentence cases should not be by circulation but should be
in open court only. The anxiety of the Constitution Bench of the
Supreme Court to ensure that no injustice results, was emphasised
in      the       judgment           dated        2nd   September,   2014        in

that the circumstances do not warrant a death penalty, whereas
another may feel it to be a fit case fully justifying the death penalty,
we feel that when a convict who has suffered the sentence of death

impact the fundamental right to life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1534">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India of a person, it has been held in Mohd. Arif

under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1535">Article 21;</a> irreversibility of the death sentence and the
possibility of any Judge on the Bench taking a different view,

</p><p id="p_1903">839. An intercaste marriage of a person of general caste perceived
to be belonging to a scheduled caste as a husband resulted in the
murder of five members of the bride by the appellants who
belonged to his caste in the judgment reported at (1987) 3 SCC 80,
<a href="/doc/4526047/" id="a_1536">Mahesh v. State of M.P. The High</a> Court confirmed the sentence
of death imposed on the two appellants observing that the act of the
appellant ―was extremely brutal, revolting and gruesome which
shocks the judicial conscience‖. It was further observed that ―in
such shocking nature of crime as the one before us which is so
cruel, barbaric and revolting, it is necessary to impose such
maximum punishment under the law as a measure of social
necessity which work as a deterrent to other potential offenders‖.
</p><p id="p_1904">         The Supreme Court shared the concern of the High Court
and observed that it would be a mockery of justice to permit the

 such offence and such cruel acts.                      The death sentence was
accordingly confirmed.
</p><p id="p_1905">840. Another precedent in which the motive of murder was the
intercaste marriage of the sister of one of the appellant despite
resentment and disapproval by the girl's family, has been brought
to our notice. The judgment of the Supreme Court is reported at
(2010) 1 SCC 775, <a href="/doc/1100478/" id="a_1537">Dilip Premnarayan Tiwari v. State of

murder and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_1906">841. This very factor that on the same, that on very similar facts,
variable sentences are possible also dissuades us from invoking our
jurisdiction in imposing the death sentence in the present case.

<p id="p_1907">XX. If not death penalty, what would be an adequate sentence
    in the present case?
</p>
<p id="p_1908">842. In the present case, the manner in which the offence was
committed; the impunity with which effort was made to remove
traces of the offence by removing clothes, jewellery, phone, etc.
and burning the body; the abscondance after the commission of the
offence and the stage managing of the arrest; the conduct of the
defendants during investigation and after conviction, especially,
misuse and abuse of the facility of outside hospital visits and
hospitalisation despite the passage of a decade after the offence,
establishes the fact the that the long incarceration has had little
impact on the defendants who have neither remorse nor repentance
for their actions. With impunity, Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav

two defendants have displayed that they have no respect for the
criminal dispensation system nor any fear of the law.
</p><p id="p_1909">843. So far as the present order is concerned, it is not disputed
before us that substance has been found in the apprehensions
expressed by Nilam Katara (mother of the deceased) and Ajay
Katara and they have been afforded police protection which
continued even on date, more than twelve years after the crime.
Would this not be a material fact while evaluating a just and
appropriate sentence to the convict? It is certainly material as well
as relevant fact. [Ref. : 2009 VIII AD (Delhi) 262, <a href="/doc/57721179/" id="a_1538">State v. Shree
Gopal @ Mani Gopal</a> (para 35)]
</p><p id="p_1910">844. From paras 1925 to 1927 in the judgment dated 2nd April,
2014, we have noted the traumatisation and the pressure put on
Ajay Katara to prevent him from deposing in the present case.
Prior to the case in hand, Ajay Katara seems to have been living an
ordinary existence. The only litigation he seemed to be embroiled
in was with his wife with regard to their matrimonial ties. Post the
murder of Nitish Katara and his deposition as a witness in the case,
he is facing multiple cases at the instance of relatives of the
defendant, Ajay Katara. It would seem as if deposition in a case
has suddenly transformed a person from somebody of ordinary
sensibilities and temperament into a habitual criminal.

emphasising individual circumstance and as held thereon by the

 a reading of the principles culled out in Mofil Khan above. Each
circumstance cannot be treated as by itself enabling the court to
arrive at a conclusion as to what would be a punishment adequate
for and befitting the crime. The reference to the balance sheet by
the Supreme Court was never of the nature of 'one plus one would
necessarily make two' but required a consideration of the varied
facts and circumstances which lead to and go into a crime
cumulatively, especially heinous crimes.
</p><p id="p_1912">846. In this background, the consideration by the learned trial
judges of each of the established circumstances individually
without examining the same cumulatively or in totality is clearly
contrary to the well settled principles of law on which sentencing is
to be effected. The learned trial judges have completely failed to
consider material circumstances including the pre-meditation
which went into the offence as well as manner of its execution;
antecedents of the defendants; the impact of the crime on society;
the conduct of the defendants; amongst others, which have been
held by the Supreme Court to be an aggravating circumstance and
an essential consideration for imposing an appropriate sentence.
The assessment of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances by
the trial courts was therefore, incomplete and cannot be the basis
for evaluation of an adequate sentence on the defendants.
</p><p id="p_1913">847. Mr. Rajesh Mahajan has pressed that there are several
precedents wherein, on a consideration of the relevant factors, the
court held that the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation is
not ruled out and therefore, death penalty was not imposed.

 However, instead of awarding life sentences simplicitor, term
sentences or consecutive running sentences were imposed upon the
convicts. In this regard, reference is made to the pronouncements

impose the death penalty, certainly life sentence simplicitor is not
an adequate sentence and the court must consider this other option.
We shall examine this submission hereafter.

</pre><p id="p_1918">         The three sentences have been directed to run concurrently.
</p><p id="p_1919">850. A most distressing aspect of the murder of Nitish Katara is
the fact that the convicts made a conscious choice to opt as to
which one, out of the two partners in the objected relationship, they



Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                                    pg. 572
 would eliminate.             They consciously decided to sacrifice Nitish
Katara while sparing the life of Bharti Yadav perceived as their
own.
</p><p id="p_1920">851. The crimes were perpetrated in an organized and systematic
manner. The amplitude of the gravity of the offence, its nature and
its deleterious effect, not only upon the victim or his family but
upon the entire civilized society at large, cries for the need that the
defendants be adequately punished.                     It is sentence of life
imprisonment simplicitor were to be remitted or commuted on
expiry of 14 years in terms of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1551">CrPC</a> provisions, the sentence
would really be inconsequential and completely inadequate so far
as the crimes in the instant case is concerned.
</p><p id="p_1921">852. The abduction of the deceased was integral to the offence of
murder. The detailed discussion in our judgment dated 2 nd April,
2014 would show that the abduction was really an aggravating
feature of the murder, firstly because of the level of planning which
has gone into it and secondly, its meticulous execution. Thirdly,
the degree of arrogance displayed by the defendants who took
away the victim from amidst hundreds of guests.                  As we have
considered abduction as integral, to the offence of murder, we are
of the view that the sentences of imprisonment on these two
offences can run concurrently.
</p><p id="p_1922">853. The offence involving burning of the body in order to cover
the acts of the defendants was also brutal, cruel and heartless. It
left an indelible negative impact on the family and horrified the
society. This act of burning was committed as part of the same


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                          pg. 573
 premeditation but it was committed after the commission of the
offence of murder. This therefore, justifies a consecutive sentence.
</p><p id="p_1923">854. After the brutal crime was committed, the clarity of the
defendants is evident in the care that they took in removing all
articles of identification from his body; concealing his clothes,
mobile, gold chain as well as the hammer which was the weapon of
the offence.            The defendants thereafter with utmost clarity
proceeded to the next stage when they absconded from the scene of
the crime and could not be traced by the police. The brutal murder
of young Nitish Katara had no impact on the emotions of the three
defendants who executed the crimes with precision and clarity.
The depravity in the mindset and planning of the crimes, brutality
in its execution, post crime conduct during investigation and trial
detailed above point to one essential fact that a life sentence which
means only 14 years of imprisonment is grossly inadequate in the
present cases and that these defendants do not deserve to remission
of the life sentence imposed on them by application of <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_1552">Section
433A</a> of the CrPC.
</p><p id="p_1924">855. Even the conviction for such heinous offences and their
incarceration had no impact on two of the defendants. We have
also noted the conduct of the two defendants Vikas Yadav and
Vishal Yadav in jail in their unwarranted hospital visits and
admissions clearly manifesting their basic temperament and the
sense that they are above the law and all institutions which points
at difficulty in their reformation or rehabilitation, pointing also to
the imperative need for a longer stay in jail.
</p>

<p id="p_1925">Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

</p><p id="p_1926"> 856. The nominal rolls from the jail have shown that only since
2013, all the defendants have been careful and their conduct in jail
has been satisfactory. This only suggests that the possibility of
their reformation and rehabilitation cannot be ruled out. In fact,
this factor has weighed with us while rejecting the prayer for
enhancement of the sentence to imposition of the death penalty
upon the defendants. There is nothing to show that the defendants
stand reformed. This conduct supports the view that these
defendants do not deserve to be set at liberty on completion of the
14 years of imprisonment mandated under <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_1553">Section 433A</a> of the
Cr.P.C. and that remission of the sentence at that stage would be
complete travesty of justice.
</p><p id="p_1927">857. There is another very important aspect of the present case. It
has been urged by Mr. P.K. Dey that there is grave and imminent
threat to the life of the complainant Nilam Katara and also Ajay
Katara, the witness on behalf of the prosecution at the hands of the
defendants who are powerful and wielded influence.                  For this
reason, they have been granted police protection even on date. It is
submitted that if not awarded death sentence, the defendants were
likely to eliminate the remaining family members of the deceased
Nilam Katara as is evident from their conduct and behaviour. As
noted in our judgment of 2nd April, 2014, these apprehensions are
not without substance.
</p><p id="p_1928">858. A similar contention was argued on behalf of the prosecution
witness in the judgment reported at (2001) 4 SCC 458, <a href="/doc/1139087/" id="a_1554">Subhash
Chandra v. Krishan Lal</a>.                    The court had taken on record the


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,
Crl.A.Nos.1322/2011 &amp; 145/2012                                         pg. 575
 statement made by one of the convicts to the effect that
imprisonment for life shall be the imprisonment in prison for the
rest of life.         Keeping in view the circumstances of the case
specially the apprehension of the imminent danger expressed by
the witness, the court ordered that for this appellant, imprisonment
for life shall be the imprisonment in prison for the rest of his life,
that he shall not be entitled to any commutation or premature
release under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1555">Cr.P.C</a>., <a href="/doc/52066971/" id="a_1556">Prisoners Act</a>, Jail Manual or any other
statute and rules made for the purposes of grant of commutation
and remissions.
</p><p id="p_1929">859. It is therefore, manifest that the concerns, safety and security
of witnesses remain an abiding concern for imposing a sentence as
well as at the stage of consideration of a prayer for remission of the
sentence under <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_1557">Section 432</a> of the Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_1930">860. These aggravating aspects become relevant when setting the
period of imprisonment should be required to serve before
remission should be considered. It would also be permissible and
fair to impose a consecutive sentence whereupon a sentence for
commission of one offence would commence on completion of the
sentence of imprisonment for another offence or upon remission of
the sentence to these persons was being examined and granted.
</p><p id="p_1931">         Therefore, looked at from any angle, certainly a prolonged
stay in a controlled environment as the prison with its discipline
and community activities, especially those relating to the mind, is
essential to ensure the reformation of the two defendants, namely,
Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav.
</p>

</p><p id="p_1933"> 861. After his arrest, Sukhdev Yadav appears to have been
chastened. We may note that there is a jail offence attributed to
him on 10th of July, 2013 with regard to assaulting to a ward
sahayak for which he was awarded punishment. Interstingly, an
identical offence dated 10th July, 2013 is attributed to Vikas Yadav
for which he has also been awarded punishment. We do not know
whether the two were implicated in the same offence. If the two
were implicated for the same crime, it has to be borne in mind that
Sukhdev Yadav was an employee of the father of Vikas Yadav
which may have been the influence for his involvement in this jail
offence. However, there is no allegation with regard to violating
any other jail regulation against Sukhdev Yadav.           Another
important circumstance is the fact that only the State has sought
enhancement of the sentence imposed on Sukhdev Yadav whereas
the complainant Nilam Katara in Crl.Rev.No.369/2008, has not
prayed for enhancement of the sentence against him. In the oral
submissions, it has been pleaded on behalf of Sukhdev Yadav that
on account of his incarceration, his family is in dire straits.
Sukhdev Yadav is a married man with five children. Our inquiry
has also established that he is not a person of substantial means.
Keeping only these circumstances in mind, so far as Sukhdev
Yadav is concerned, we are drawing a distinction between the
punishments being imposed on Vikas and Vishal Yadav on the one
hand and Sukhdev Yadav on the other.
</p><p id="p_1934">862. We also find that given his lesser paying capacity, the
default imprisonment which the learned trial judge has ordered for


Crl.A.Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl.Rev.P.No.369/2008,

 non-payment of fines against Sukhdev Yadav in the judgment
dated 12th July, 2011 as unduly harsh. By the present order, we
propose to modify and reduce the default imprisonments which
have been imposed on Sukhdev Yadav.

     the Cr.P.C. in the present case

</p><p id="p_1936">863. The instant case arose out of an offence committed in the
State of U.P. on a complaint which was lodged with the police
station Kavi Nagar and was registered as FIR No.192/02. The
chargesheet was originally filed in the district courts at Ghaziabad
in the State of U.P. A transfer petition being Transfer Petition
No.449/2002 was filed by Smt. Nilam Katara praying for transfer
of the case to Delhi. By virtue of orders dated 22nd May, 2002 and
22nd August, 2002 passed by the Supreme Court of India, the trial
was transferred to the district courts in Delhi and culminated in the
judgment on conviction dated 28th May, 2008 so far as Vikas
Yadav and Vishal Yadav are concerned and against Sukhdev
Yadav on 6th July, 2011. They were respectively sentenced by the
judgment dated 30th May, 2008 and 12th July, 2011 by the Sessions

government" as the government of the State within which the

</p><p id="p_1938">865. The Code of Criminal Procedure has conferred the power
upon the executive to remit the sentence of the defendants in
Chapter XXXVII of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1560">CrPC</a>. The present case has thrown up a
unique situation where an offence committed in District Ghaziabad
in the State of Uttar Pradesh has been tried by the trial court at

authority for considering a prayer for remittance of sentence if
made by the defendants?
</p><p id="p_1939">866. In the present case, after their conviction and sentence, it
appears that Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav filed an appeal
assailing the same in the High Court of Allahabad which was
rejected for want of jurisdiction. Though the orders of the
Allahabad High Court have not been placed before us, but during
the course of arguments, it was submitted that they assailed the
order of the Allahabad High Court before the Supreme Court of
India which rejected the challenge.

 High Court and the sentences are being considered as well by the
same court.           Therefore, so far as the present defendants are
concerned, if at any point of time, they were to seek remission of
the sentence, the only government which is competent to consider
an application by these defendants under Chapter XXXII (E) of the

<p id="p_1942">XXII. What ought to be the fines in the present case

</p><p id="p_1943">868. Apart from imprisonment, we note that <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1562">Section 302</a> of the
IPC directs that whoever commits murder shall be punished with
death or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable for fine.
Under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1563">Section 364</a>, punishment of imprisonment for life or
rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine is prescribed. Under
<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1564">Section 201</a>, imprisonment for seven years and fine is prescribed.
</p><p id="p_1944">         Therefore, while considering an appropriate sentence, apart
from imprisonment, we also have to consider and direct payment of
adequate fines.
</p><p id="p_1945">869. What would be an appropriate sentence so far as imposition
of the fine is concerned? Valuable light is thrown on the
importance of an appropriate sentence befitting the crime in the
pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2012) 8 SCC
450, <a href="/doc/190237958/" id="a_1565">State v. Sanjeev Nanda</a>. The respondent was involved in a
motor accident on the night intervening 9th/10th January, 1999

was charged under Sections 201, 304 Part I, 308 read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1566">Section

him jail sentence of five years while he was acquitted of the other

          punishment awarded by the High Court is commensurate
         with the gravity of the offence.
</p><p id="p_1949">         116. The mitigating circumstances suggested by the
         defence counsel are as follows:
</p><p id="p_1950">         (i) The accused was only 21 years on the date of the
         accident, later married and has a daughter;
</p><p id="p_1951">         (ii) Prolonged trial and judicial unfairness caused
         prejudice;
</p><p id="p_1952">         (iii) The accused has undergone sentence of two years
         awarded by the High Court and, during that period, his
         conduct and behaviour in the jail was appreciated;
</p><p id="p_1953">         (iv) Accident occurred on a foggy day in the early hours
         of morning with poor visibility;
</p><p id="p_1954">         (v) The accused had no previous criminal record nor has
         he been involved in any criminal case subsequently;
</p><p id="p_1955">         (vi) The accused and the family members contributed and
         paid a compensation of Rs 65 lakhs, in total, in the year
         1999 to the families of the victims;
</p><p id="p_1956">         (vii) The accused had neither the intention nor
         knowledge of the ultimate consequences of his action
         and that he was holding a driving licence from the United
         States.
</p><p id="p_1957">         117. Following are, in our view, the aggravating
         circumstances unfolded in this case:
</p><p id="p_1958">         (i) Six persons died due to the rash and negligent driving
         of the accused and the car was driven with the knowledge
         that drunken driving without licence is likely to cause
         death.
</p><p id="p_1959">         (ii) Much of the delay in completing the trial could have
         been avoided if wisdom had dawned on the accused
         earlier. Only at the appellate stage the accused had
         admitted that it was he who was driving the vehicle on
         the fateful day which resulted in the death of six
         persons and delay in completion of the trial cannot be
         attributed to the prosecution as the prosecution was
         burdened with the task of establishing the offence
         beyond reasonable doubt by examining sixty-one

          witnesses and producing several documents including
         expert evidence.
</p><p id="p_1960">         (iii) The accused did not stop the vehicle in spite of the
         fact that the vehicle had hit six persons and one got
         injured and escaped from the spot without giving any
         helping hand to the victims who were dying and crying
         for help. Human lives could have been saved, if the
         accused had shown some mercy.
</p><p id="p_1961">         (iv) The accused had the knowledge that the car driven
         by him had hit the human beings and human bodies were
         scattered around and they might die, but he thought of
         only his safety and left the place, leaving their fate to
         destiny which, in our view, is not a normal human
         psychology and no court can give a stamp of approval to
         that conduct.
</p><p id="p_1962">         (v) Non-reporting the crime to the police even after
         reaching home and failure to take any steps to provide
         medical help even after escaping from the site.
</p><p id="p_1963">         118. Payment of compensation to the victims or their
         relatives is not a mitigating circumstance, on the other
         hand, it is a statutory obligation. Age of 21, as such is
         also not a mitigating factor, in the facts of this case,
         since the accused is not an illiterate, poor, rustic
         villager but an educated urban elite, undergoing studies
         abroad. We have to weigh all these mitigating and
         aggravating circumstances while awarding the sentence.‖

</p><p id="p_1964">871. So far as considerations which must weigh with the court
while passing a sentencing order is concerned, the observations in
paras 119 to 122 and the directions in para 123 deserve to be
considered in extenso and read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_510">         ―Sentencing
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_511">         119. We have to decide, after having found on facts, that
         this case would fall under Section 304 Part II, what will
         be the appropriate sentence. Generally, the policy which

          the court adopts while awarding sentence is that the
         punishment must be appropriate and proportional to the
         gravity of the offence committed. Law demands that the
         offender should be adequately punished for the crime, so
         that it can deter the offender and other persons from
         committing similar offences. Nature and circumstances
         of the offence; the need for the sentence imposed to
         reflect the seriousness of the offence; to afford adequate
         deterrence to the conduct and to protect the public from
         such crimes are certain factors to be considered while
         imposing the sentence.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_512">         120. The imposition of sentence without considering its
         effect on the social order in many cases is in reality a
         futile exercise. In our view, had the accused extended a
         helping hand to the victims of the accident, caused by
         him by making arrangements to give immediate medical
         attention, perhaps lives of some of the victims could have
         been saved. Even after committing the accident, he only
         thought of his safety, did not care for the victims and
         escaped from the site showing least concern to the human
         beings lying on the road with serious injuries. Conduct of
         the accused is highly reprehensible and cannot be
         countenanced by any court of law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_513">         121. The High Court, in our view, has committed an error
         in converting the conviction to <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_1571">Section 304-A</a> IPC from
         that of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_1572">Section 304</a> Part II IPC and the conviction
         awarded calls for a relook on the basis of the facts
         already discussed, otherwise this Court will be setting a
         bad precedent and sending a wrong message to the
         public. After having found that the offence would fall
         under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_1573">Section 304</a> Part II IPC, not under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_1574">Section 304-A</a>,

         come forward to serve the community, especially in
         crimes relating to motor vehicles. Graver the crime,

          greater the sentence. But, serving the society actually is
         not a punishment in the real sense where the convicts pay
         back to the community what they owe. Conduct of the
         convicts will not only be appreciated by the community,
         it will also give a lot of solace to them, especially in a
         case where because of one's action and inaction, human
         lives have been lost.
</p><p id="p_1967">         123. In the facts and circumstances of the case, where six
         human lives were lost, we feel, to adopt this method
         would be good for the society rather than incarcerating
         the convict further in jail. Further sentence of fine also
         would compensate at least some of the victims of such
         road accidents who have died, especially in hit-and-run
         cases where the owner or driver cannot be traced. We,
         therefore, order as follows:

         (Rupees fifty lakhs) to the Union of India within six

         compensation to the victims of motor accidents, where
         the vehicle owner, driver, etc. could not be traced, like
         victims of hit-and-run cases. On default, he will have to
         undergo simple imprisonment for one year. This amount
         be kept under a different head to be used for the aforesaid
         purpose only.

         years which will be arranged by the Ministry of Social
         Justice and Empowerment within two months. On
         default, he will have to undergo simple imprisonment for

          "127. In addition, the accused is put to the following

<p id="p_1974">873. In Sanjeev Nanda, the Supreme Court ordered the driver to
do community service and imposed the sentence of fine payable to
the Union of India to be utilised for providing compensation to
victims of motor accidents where vehicle owners, drivers, etc.
could not be traced, as for instance in hit and run cases in order to
do complete justice in the case. The High Courts may be able to
source the power to pass similar order to the inherent powers under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1577">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. We are not undertaking an examination
of the issue as to whether the trial courts have the jurisdiction to so
mould sentencing orders.
</p><p id="p_1975">874. It is well settled that a fine should not be excessive. This
could obviously relate to the ability to pay the fine by the
defendant.         A fine which cannot be realised would be unduly

 excessive. The quantification has to be effected having regard to
all the circumstances of the case which include the means of the
offender [Ref. : AIR 1977 SC 1323, <a href="/doc/662559/" id="a_1578">Paliappa Gounder v. State of
Tamil Nadu</a> (paras 11 and 12)]
</p><p id="p_1976">875. So far as the paying capacity of the defendants is concerned,
the inquiry has concluded the paying capacity of the defendant
Vikas Yadav as between Rs.5.50 crores to Rs.5.75 crores and the
paying capacity of Vishal Yadav at Rs.9.19 crores. So far as
Sukhdev Yadav is concerned, the inquiry conducted under orders
of this court has concluded that he does not have financial means to
pay any substantial compensation to the family of the deceased.
</p><p id="p_1977">876. It appears that Vishal Yadav filed an affidavit dated 26th
May, 2014 before the enquiry officer Shri S.S. Rathi, OSD, Delhi
Legal Services Authority wherein, so far as immovable properties
were concerned, Vishal Yadav has stated that he has shares in
ancestral undivided properties and as per oral understanding, his
share is 1/3rd of the total value. Based thereon, the learned enquiry
officer has given the finding with regard to Vishal Yadav's paying
capacity. However, in the written submissions dated 17th July,
2014 filed before us, it is stated on behalf of Vishal Yadav that
there is a mistake in mentioning the share and that Vishal Yadav
has 1/4th share because his sister also has a share. Be that as it
may, even if this statement was accepted, Vishal Yadav's paying
capacity would still be over Rs.5 crores.

the fact that they are being sentenced for conscious acts in

concerned, the same has been dealt with separately and not as part
of the compensation discussion in the present discussion. Based on
the discussion and findings reached, we have opted to separately
issue directions against the defendants for the same. The directions
to the defendants to make payments with regard to the hospital
visits and admissions are not in the nature of an order to pay a fine.
