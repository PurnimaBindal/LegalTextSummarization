4             In so far as the application filed by the Appellant under Section 

</pre><p id="p_8">33C(2) is concerned, it is required to be noted that it was founded on the fact 

that payment has been made under the aforesaid heads to 35 other employees 

who were similarly situated as the Appellant and the other Appellants.  Hence 

the main thrust of the application in the matter of making the said claim under 

<a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_6">Section 33C(2)</a> was on the basis that A similar claim was accepted by the then 

Mahavir Co-operative Bank Ltd. (MCBL) in respect of 35 other employees who 

were similarly situated as the Appellant.   The application filed under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_7">Section 

33C(2)</a> was pending on the date when the amalgamation took place.  The said 

application was opposed to on behalf of the MCBL prior to its amalgamation 

with   the   Respondent   Bank   by   filing   its   Written   Statement.     After   the 

amalgamation, the Respondent Bank opposed the said application inter-alia on 

the grounds mentioned in its Written Statement.         



5             The   learned   Judge   of   the   Labour   Court   on   the   basis   of   the 

pleadings of the parties framed issues revolving around the aspect of whether 

the   application   filed   by   the   Applicant/Appellant   was   maintainable,   and 

whether the  Applicant/Appellant was entitled to claim the amounts as per the 

Schedule-with-interest.

who   could   be   said   to   be   a   workman,   the   Appellant   can   be   said   to   be   a 

workman as defined under <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_8">Section 2(s)</a> of the I.D. Act.  



</p><p id="p_11">               In so far as the entitlement of the Appellant to the amount claimed 

as per the Schedule-with-interest is concerned, the learned Judge answered the 

said issue in the negative.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

6              The   gist   of   the   reasoning   of   the   learned   Judge   was   that   the 

Appellant had failed to prove that he had a pre-existing right to claim the said 

amounts from the Respondent-Bank.  The learned Judge further held that since 

the dispute was as regards the entitlement of the Appellant to the amounts 

under various heads which were frozen in the year 1995 and having regard to 

the  intervening  facts  which  disclose   that   the   financial  condition  of   the  said 

Mahavir   Co-operative   Bank   Ltd.   Kolhapur   (MBCL)   was   not   good   and   it 

resultantly being amalgamated with the Respondent-Bank, the learned Judge 

held that the said issue as regards the entitlement of the Appellant could not be 

decided in a proceeding under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_9">Section 33C(2)</a> of the I.D. Act which proceeding 

is in the nature of execution proceeding based on a pre-existing right.   The 

learned Judge in the process of recording the said finding has held that the 

evidence adduced on behalf of the Appellant failed to show as to how and on 

what basis the Appellant has calculated the amount mentioned in the Schedule 


lgc                                                                                         16 of 54

to the said application.   The learned Judge observed that the said Court had 

limited jurisdiction to compute the amount due and not for adjudication of the 

claim, and therefore, the application was not maintainable.  The learned Judge 

further held that the Appellant could not rely upon the earlier judgment in 

I.D.A. Application Nos.34 to 63 and 75 to 79 of 1998 (case involving the 35 

employees).     The   learned   Judge   was   of   the   view   that   the   said   case   was 

between the employees who had opted for VRS and the Mahavir Co-operative 

Bank Ltd. (MCBL) and that the MCBL did not seriously dispute the claim of the 

Applicants   in   the   said   cases.     The   learned   Judge   on   the   aforesaid   basis 

accordingly   rejected   the   application   filed   by   the   Appellant   herein   by   the 

judgment and order dated 27/01/2012.

situated persons, who had also filed the applications under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_10">Section 33C(2)</a> of

 A]            That the learned Single Judge had erred in holding that the claim

 B]            That the learned Single Judge ought to have appreciated that the 

               Appellant was claiming a benefit in respect of which computation 

               was only required to be done.  Reliance is sought to be placed on

 C]           That the amount claimed by the Appellant is on the basis of the 

</pre><p id="p_16">              Award   dated   30/09/1985   passed   by   the   Industrial   Tribunal   in 

              Reference (IC) No.18/1983 between The Bank Employees' Union, 

              Kolhapur vs. Shri Mahavir Co-operative Bank Ltd. The said Award 

              contained the service conditions which the employees of the said 

              MCBL were entitled to and the Award inter-alia governs the Wage-

              scale,   Dearness   Allowance,   House   Rent   Allowance   and   Medical 

              Allowance   with effect from 01/07/1983.   Hence unless the said 

              Award is replaced by another Settlement or Award, the efficacy of 

              the Award continues and the employees are therefore entitled to 

              the   benefits  as per  the  said  Award.    Reliance  was sought  to  be 

              placed on the judgment of the Apex Court reported in 1980 LAB I.  

              C. 1218   in  the  matter of   The Life Insurance Corporation of  

              India v/s. D J Bahadur and others



 D]           That the right of the Appellant is also based on the revision of pay 

              scales carried out by the MCBL in September 1992 by passing a 

              Resolution.

              procedure required for the same in the matter of giving a notice of

              Allowance,   House   Rent   Allowance   and   Medical   Allowance,   the 

              service conditions of the employees of the said MCBL were sought 

              to   be   changed   to   their   detriment.   The   said   change   is   without 

              following the procedure for the same.

              claim as the Appellant and whose claim was allowed by the Labour 

              Court and thereafter confirmed right up to the Apex Court.



 H]           That the Labour Court as well as the learned Single Judge have 

              erred   in   holding   that   the   basis   of   the   claim   mentioned   in   the 

              Schedule has not been stated by the Appellant.

              only what was required to be done was the computation.

 K]           That the Respondent Bank being the "Successor Bank", it is bound 

              by the Award in terms of Section 94 of the Maharashtra Industrial 

              Relations Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">

 L]           That the MCBL did not follow the procedure contemplated under 

              the   Maharashtra   Industrial   Relations   Act   to   terminate   the 

              Settlement/Award by issuing notice in the Form-Q prescribed and 

              therefore the MCBL is bound by the Award dated 30/09/1985.



 M]           That the Labour Court as well as the learned Single Judge failed to 

              appreciate that the liability was accepted by the MCBL in so far as 

              the Appellant and the other persons similarly situated like him are 

              concerned as can be seen from the written statement filed by it.

              matter   of  M/s.   Advani   Oerlikon   Ltd.   v/s.   Machindra   Govind

II]           That the orders passed by the Labour Court and the learned Single 

              Judge   are   well   founded   on   the   aspect   of   there   being   no   pre-

              existing   right   in   the   Appellant   to   claim   the   amount   which   is 

              claimed under Section 33C(2) of the I. D. Act. Reliance is placed 

              on the judgment of the Apex Court reported in 1974 (4) SCC 696 

              in   the   matter   of  Central   Inland   Water   Transport   Corporation  

              Limited v/s. Workmen and reported in (1995) 1 SCC 235 in the 

              matter   of  Municipal   Corporation   of   Delhi   v/s.   Ganesh   Razak  

              and another



III]          That the Respondent Bank being the successor bank is not liable to 

              make   any   payment   to   the   Appellant   or   other   persons   similarly

              situated like him.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

IV]           That the right of the Appellant is not based on a pre-existing right 

              and the same can be seen from the fact that the representative 

              union i.e. Bank Employees Union, Kolhapur had filed Complaint 

              (ULP) No.85 of 1998 alleging unfair labour practice against the 

              MCBL,   the   subject   matter   of   which   complaint   was   also   the 

              amounts   frozen   by   the   MCBL,   which   Complaint   came   to   be 

              dismissed for default in the year 2008 i.e. after the merger of the 

              said MCBL with the Respondent Bank had taken place.



V]            That the said order dismissing the said Complaint for default was 

              confirmed by the learned Single Judge of this Court. Hence in so 

              far   as   the   said   claim   of   the   Appellant   which   was   sought   to   be 

              espoused by the then representative union is concerned, the same 

              came   to   be   rejected   and   therefore   the   Appellant   herein   is   not 

              entitled to file the instant application under Section 33C(2) of the 

              I. D. Act on the ground that he has a pre-existing right to claim the 

              amount claimed in the said application.

VI]           That the case based on the Award dated 30/09/1985 was never 

              urged before the Labour Court or even the learned Single Judge 


lgc                                                                                         23 of 54

               but is urged for the first time in the above Letters Patent Appeal in 

               support of his case that the claim is based on a pre-existing right.



VII]           That the issue as to whether the Appellant would be entitled to the 

               amount   claimed   cannot   be   adjudicated   in   a   proceeding   under 

               Section 33C(2) of the I. D. Act as the entitlement of the Appellant 

               was on the basis that the financial health of the MCBL improves 

               The facts disclose that on account of precarious financial position 

               of the  said MCBL,  an  order of  amalgamation  of the  said MCBL 

               with   the   Respondent   Bank   was   required   to   be   passed   by   the 

               Registrar of the Co-operative Societies under Section 110(A) of the 

               Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act.

<p id="p_29">

VIII]          That   there   is   enough   material   on   record   to   show   the   financial 

               position of the said MCBL as also the accumulated losses of the 

               said MCBL on the date of merger were to the tune of Rs.114 lakhs.



IX]            That it is pertinent to note that the employees of the MCBL were 

               represented   by   a   representative   union.     The   said   representative 

               union did not at any time give any notice of change for revision of 

               wages or did not raise any general demands at any time after the 

               Award   dated   30/09/1985   and   had   therefore   accepted   the

              amounts.

              directions of the Reserve Bank of India so as to lessen the financial 

              burden on account of salaries of the staff and thereby seeing to 

              make the MCBL financially viable.

               maintainable as the Writ Petition was filed under Articles 226 and 

               227 of the Constitution of India and as held in the judgment of the 

               Full   Bench   of   this   Court   in  M/s.   Advani   Oerlikon   Ltd.'s  case

               CONSIDERATION

11             The issue which is required to be addressed first is as regards the 

maintainability of the above Letters Patent Appeal.   As indicated above, the 

above  Letters Patent  Appeal  has been  filed against  the  judgment  and  order 

dated   25/07/2012   passed   by   a   learned   Single   Judge   of   this   Court.   In   the 

context of the issue of maintainability of the above Letters Patent Appeal, it is 

required to be noted that in paragraph 19 of the above Writ Petition it has been 

averred that the Petitioner i.e. the Appellant herein is approaching this Court 

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_14">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India on the grounds 

mentioned   in   the   said   Writ   Petition.       In   Ground   (ii)   the   challenge   to   the 

impugned order passed by the Labour Court is on the ground that the Labour 

Court   has   refused   to   exercise   the   jurisdiction   vested   in   it   on   perverse   and 

erroneous grounds.   Hence the averment in paragraph 19 makes it clear that 

the   jurisdiction   of   this   Court   under   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article   226</a>   and   <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_16">Article   227</a>   of   the 


lgc                                                                                          26 of 54

Constitution of India was invoked, and by Ground (ii) the judgment and order 

passed by the Labour Court is sought to be assailed on the ground that the 

Labour Court has refused to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it on perverse 

and   erroneous   grounds.     The   maintainability   of   the   above   Writ   Petition   is 

sought to be questioned on behalf of the Respondent-Bank on the ground that 

since the judgment and order passed by the Labour Court is under challenge, 

the Writ Petition is essentially one filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_17">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of 

India as no relief is claimed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. In 

the said context the principles laid down by the Full Bench of this Court in the 

judgment   of  M/s.   Advani   Oerlikon   Ltd.'s  case   (supra)   assume   importance. 

The   Full   Bench   in   the   said   case   was   concerned   with   the   issue   whether   an 

Appeal can lie under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent against a decision of a 

learned Single Judge in a Petition invoking <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_20">Article 227</a> of the 

Constitution   of   India.     The   Full   Bench   in   paragraph   20   has   answered   the 

reference by answering the questions which were in the order of reference.  In 

the context of the present case the answer to question No.7  in paragraph 20 of 

the order of  reference  is material  and the  said paragraph 20 is reproduced 

herein under :-

              would not dilute the character of an order as one with

              the true nature of the order passed by the Single Judge

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_48">Section 33C(2)</a> of the I.D. Act.   In  Central Inland Water

that   the   proceeding   under   <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_49">Section   33C(2)</a>   of   the   I.D.   Act   is   a   proceeding 

generally in the nature of an execution proceeding wherein  the Labour Court 

calculates the amount of money due to a workman from his employer, or if the 

workman   is   entitled   to   any   benefit   which   is   capable   of   being   computed   in 

terms of money, the Labour Court proceeds to compute the benefit in terms of 

money.  The Apex Court further held that the said  calculation or computation 

follows upon an  existing  right to the  money or benefit, in  view  of  it  being 

previously   adjudged,   or,   otherwise,   duly   provided   for.     The   Apex   Court

Apex Court held that in a suit, a claim for relief made by the plaintiff against 

the defendant involves an investigation as regards the plaintiff's right to the 

relief,   the   corresponding   liability   of   the   defendant,   including   whether   the 

defendant is, at all, liable or not; and the extent of the defendant's liability. 

The Apex Court observed that the working out of such liability with a view to 

give relief is generally regarded as the function or an execution proceeding vis-

a-vis   the   determination   of   the   plaintiff's   right   to   the   relief   and   the 

corresponding liability of the defendant.   The Apex Court held that the first 

two are the functions of a suit and not an execution proceeding. The Apex 

Court observed that since a proceeding under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_50">Section 33C(2)</a> is in the nature 

of an execution proceeding it should follow that an investigation of the nature 

of determination in respect of the first two questions normally is outside its 

scope.   The Apex Court held that when a claim is made before the Labour 

Court under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_51">Section 33C(2)</a> that court must clearly understand the limitations 

under which it is to function. It cannot arrogate to itself the functions say of an 

Industrial Tribunal which alone is entitled to make adjudications in the nature 

of determination in respect of the first two aspects.  The Apex Court held that a 

workman cannot put forward a claim in an application under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_52">Section 33C(2)</a> 

in respect of a matter which is not based on a pre-existing right and which can 

appropriately be the subject-matter of an industrial dispute which requires a

               which is capable of being computed in terms of money, 
               the   Labour   Court   proceeds   to   compute   the   benefit   in 
               terms of money. This calculation or computation follows 
               upon an existing right to the money or benefit, in view of 
               its   being   previously   adjudged,   or,   otherwise,   duly 
               provided for. In (Chief Mining Engineer, East India Coal

               section 33(C)(2) are analogous to execution proceedings 
               and the Labour Court called upon to compute in terms of 
               money the benefit claimed by workmen is in such cases 
               in   the   Position   of   an   executing   court.   It   was   also 
               reiterated that the right to the benefit which is sought to

               already adjudicated upon or provided for and must arise 
               in   the   course   of   and   in   relation   to   the   relationship

              Labour   Court   under  <a href="/doc/1774629/" id="a_56">section   33(C)(2)</a>  that   court   must

              dubbing the former as 'Incidental' to its main business of 
              computation.   In   such   cases   determinations  (i)  and   (ii) 
              are not 'Incidental' to the computation. The computation

Court's power under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_62">Section 33C(2)</a> like that of the Executing Court's power to 

interpret the decree for the purpose of its execution.  Paragraph 12 of the said 

judgment is material and is produced herein under for ready reference :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">               The High Court has referred to some of these decisions 
               but missed the true import thereof. The ratio of these

               the   claim   or   the   entitlement   of   the   workmen   to   a 
               certain   benefit   is   disputed,   there   being   no   earlier 
               adjudication or recognition thereof by the employer, the 
               dispute relating to entitlement is not incidental to the 
               benefit   claimed   and   is,   therefore,   clearly   outside   the 
               scope   of   the  proceeding under  Section  33C(2)  of  the 
               Act. The Labour Court has no jurisdiction to first decide 
               the   workman's   entitlement   and   then   proceed   to 
               compute   the   benefit   so   adjudicated   on   that   basis   in 
               exercise of its power under Section 33C(2) of the Act. It 
               is   only   when   the   entitlement   has   been   earlier 
               adjudicated   or   recognized   by   the   employer   and 
               thereafter   for   the   purpose   of   implementation   of

MCBL had illegally stopped the Annual Increments, Dearness  Allowance  and 

other benefits like House Rent Allowance  and Medical Allowance  from May 

1995 on account of the poor financial condition of the bank.   It was further 

averred that the employees were assured that dues would be paid when the

said   amounts   were   frozen   from   the   year   1995   till   the   retirement   of   the

the   MCBL   has   merged   with   the   Respondent   Bank   during   pendency   of   the 

application and therefore, the Respondent Bank is a legal entity which came 

into being on account of the said amalgamation.  It was further averred that in

contingent   liabilities   of   the   MCBL.   It   was   further   averred   that   all   pending

implementation   of   the   outcome   of   the   said   proceedings   would   be   the 

responsibility   of   the   Respondent   Bank.   It   was   further   averred   that   the 

Appellant had applied for the said outstanding amounts being paid to him as 

the Appellant had legal right to the said amounts. It was further averred that in

14             A reading of the application filed under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_64">Section 33C(2)</a> therefore 

discloses that in the application the thrust of the case of the Appellant is as 

regards the liability of the Respondent Bank to pay the outstanding amounts on 

account of freezing of the Annual Increments, Dearness  Allowance  etc. by the 

MCBL since 1995.  The case of the Appellant was also based on the fact that in  

respect of other employees the issue has been decided in favour of the said 

employees by the Apex Court.  Hence in so far as the application is concerned, 

the same is not founded on any pre-existing right based on the Award dated 

30/09/1985 or the Resolution passed by the MCBL in September 1992.   The 

application   filed   by   the   Appellant   under   Section   33C(2)   of   the   I.   D.   Act   is 

conspicuous of any such averment.

15             Against the judgment and order passed by the Labour Court dated

              given by the Mahavir Bank since 1992. The said benefit

              filed   aforementioned   Application   before   the   Labour

              Disputes Act, 1947.  The Applicant, in the annexure to 
              the   Application,   stated   that   he   is   a   retired   employee 
              and  that  he  is  entitled  to  the  release   of   benefits  like 
              dearness,   allowance,   annual   increments,   bonus, 
              medical aid etc. illegally withheld by the Bank."


In the grounds of challenge in the said Petition, Ground Nos.(iv) and (viii) are 

required to be noted and read thus :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">              "(iv) That   the   Ld.   Labour   Court   failed   to   appreciate

</p><p id="p_52">              (viii) That   the   Ld.   Labour   Court   failed   to   appreciate

              Industrial  Disputes  Act  were  not  confined to  benefits 
              arising out of any settlement, agreement or award. The 
              claim under the term "any money or benefit due" under 
              <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_67">section   33C(2)</a>   is   wider   than   the   claim   under   any 
              settlement, agreement or award under <a href="/doc/485232/" id="a_68">section 33C(1)</a> 
              of   the   Industrial   Disputes   Act.   The   Ld.   Labour   Court 
              failed   to   appreciate   that   such   a   claim   for   money   or 
              benefit can arise out of the decision or inaction of the 
              management.   The   Ld.   Labour   Court   ought   to   have 
              appreciated that the Petitioner was entitled to receive 
              annual increment every year as per the resolution and 
              hence it was pre-existing right for Petitioner. So also, in 
              case of the dearness allowance and other benefits, the 
              Petitioner   had   such   pre-existing   right   to   claim   the 
              arrears   thereof,   which   amount   was   withheld   by   the

<p id="p_53">
Hence a reading of the said Writ Petition filed by the Appellant discloses that 

the   case   based   on   the   Award   dated   30/09/1985   passed   in   Reference   (IC) 

No.18/1983 was not pleaded in the said Writ Petition and the pre-existing right 

was therefore claimed on the basis of the Resolution passed by the MCBL in 

September   1992.   Hence   it   is   for   the   first   time   in   the   above   Letters   Patent 

Appeal that the learned counsel for the Appellant has sought to base the pre-

existing rights by relying upon the Award dated 30/09/1985 passed in the said 

Reference (IC) No.18/1983.
</p>
<p id="p_54">

16             In so far as MCBL is concerned, it is required to be noted that the 

general demands raised on behalf of the employees by the representative union 

was a subject of adjudication before the Industrial Tribunal in Reference I.C. 

No.18 of 1983 (Bank Employees Union, Kolhapur vs. The Mahavir Co-operative 

Bank Ltd.).  The Industrial Tribunal has passed the Award in the said Reference 

covering   various   aspects   like   Wages,   Dearness   Allowance,   House   Rent 

Allowance, Medical Allowance   etc.   The said Award therefore governed the 

service   conditions   of   the   employees   in   the   MCBL.     As   indicated   above,   the 

Board of Directors of MCBL in September 1992 passed a Resolution revising 

the wage scale of the employees.  It is pertinent to note that though there was 

a representative   union  and  though  the  Award  was  passed  by  the   Industrial 

Tribunal in the year 1985 governing the service conditions of the employees, 

lgc                                                                                          39 of 54




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">        ::: Uploaded on - 20/09/2017                            ::: Downloaded on - 21/09/2017 01:42:03 :::</span>
                                                                                           lpa-285.13

the representative union had not raised any fresh general demands. As can be 

seen, the MCBL had revised the wages of the employees in September 1992 at 

the   request   of   the   employees.     It   is   further   required   to   be   noted   that   the 

financial  position  of  the   said MCBL  had taken  a  nosedive   and  accumulated 

losses in the year 1994 was to the tune of Rs.114 lakhs.   It resulted in the 

Reserve Bank of India which has got the regulatory powers under <a href="/doc/222598/" id="a_69">Section 35</a> of 

the   Banking   Regulation   Act   issuing   directions   to   MCBL   to   cut   down   its 

expenditure   on   account   of   staff.     This   has   ultimately   resulted   in   the   MCBL 

freezing the Annual Increments, Dearness Allowance, House Rent Allowance, 

Medical   Allowance     etc.   from   May   1995   and   it   was   represented   to   the 

employees that the employees could claim the said amounts after the financial 

condition of the MCBL improves.  It is required to be noted that the condition 

of   MCBL   did   not   improve   and   further   deteriorated   resulting   in   an 

Administrator   being   appointed   in   the   year   1996   by   the   Registrar   of   Co-

operative   Societies,   Maharashtra   State.     The   Administrator   with   a   view   to 

streamline the affairs of the said MCBL came out with VRS in the year 1997. 

One of the conditions of the VRS was that the employees would be entitled to 

frozen Annual Increments, Dearness   Allowance, House Rent Allowance and 

Medical   Allowance   on   improvement   of   the   financial   condition   of   the   said 

MCBL.    Hence   the   position   of   the   MCBL   in   so   far   as  financial   condition   is 

concerned was also reflected in the conditions in VRS which has been referred 

to earlier.

with   effect   from   01/03/1997   and   the   claim   of   arrears   of   the   Dearness 

Allowance, House Rent Allowance and the relief of Annual Increments.   The 

dismissal   of   the   said   Complaint   and   the   confirmation   of   the   same   by   the 

Industrial Tribunal by not allowing the application for restoration in our view 

impinges upon the  factum  of  maintainability of the  application  filed by the 

Appellant under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_70">Section 33C(2)</a> of the I.D. Act.

18             As indicated above, the Wage-scale, Dearness   Allowance, House 

Rent   Allowance,   and   the   Medical   Allowance   were   frozen   in   May   1995   on 

account of the precarious financial condition of the said MCBL.  Though there

the   arrears  under  the   said   heads.     The   representative   union   though  filed   a 

Complaint did not take the said Complaint to its logical conclusion resulting in 

the said Complaint being dismissed for non-prosecution. Implicit in the filing of 

the   Complaint   under   the   MRTU   and   PULP   Act   1971   by   the   representative 

union was the acceptance of the fact that there was a dispute as regards the 

entitlement  to the  said amounts. Hence  it  could not be  said that the  claim 

made  in the  application by the  Appellant was based on a pre-existing right 

which was steeped in the Award dated 30/09/1985 or the Resolution passed 

by the MCBL in September 1992.  It is required to be noted that the Appellant 

accepts the fact that the amounts towards the increase in Wage-scale, Dearness 

Allowance, House Rent Allowance and Medical Allowance were frozen in May 

1995 with an assurance or promise that the said amounts would be released 

when   the   financial   condition   of   the   MCBL   improves.     The   said   fact   is   also 

reflected in the VRS which was announced in the year 1997.  The question that 

would arise is therefore whether the Respondent Bank would be bound by the 

said   Award   dated   30/09/1985   or   the   Resolution   passed   by   the   MCBL   in 

September 1992.  The said question has to be considered in the context of the 

fact that before the Labour Court as well as before the learned Single Judge in 

this Court no case was advanced on the basis of the said Settlement/Award 

dated 30/09/1985 or the Resolution passed by the MCBL in September 1992. 

Hence whether the Respondent Bank which is a transferee bank is liable to 

comply with the Settlement/Award dated 30/09/1985 also impinges upon the 


lgc                                                                                         43 of 54

issue as to whether the claim of the Appellant is based on a pre-existing right. 

The question that also begs an answer is whether the Respondent Bank is liable 

to pay the amount towards difference in the Wage-Scale, Dearness Allowance, 

House Rent Allowance and Medical Allowance when the financial condition of 

the   said   MCBL   did   not   improve,   as   a   result  of   which   the   MCBL   had   to   be 

merged  with  the   Respondent  Bank.     The  said  issue   therefore   also  impinges 

upon whether the claim of the Appellant is based on any existing right.



19             Now coming to the judgments cited on behalf of the Appellant i.e. 

the judgment in The Central Bank of India Ltd's case (supra).  In the said case 

the Apex Court has held that the remedy by way of <a href="/doc/759209/" id="a_71">Section 33C</a> which was 

introduced   in   the   Act   1956   is   a   speedy   remedy   to   enforce   the   existing 

individual rights of the workmen.  The said provision i.e. Section 33C of the I. 

D. Act illustrates the cases in which individual wormen can enforce their rights 

without having to take recourse to <a href="/doc/760439/" id="a_72">Section 10(1)</a> of the Act, or without having 

to   depend   upon   their   Union   to   espouse   their   cause.     The   Apex   Court   has 

however  held  that construction  to be  put on  <a href="/doc/759209/" id="a_73">Section  33C</a> should not be so 

broad as to bring within the scope of <a href="/doc/759209/" id="a_74">Section 33C</a> cases which would fall under 

Section 10(1) of the I. D. Act. The Apex Court also sounded a note of caution 

by observing that though in determining the scope of <a href="/doc/759209/" id="a_75">Section 33C</a> we must 

take care not to exclude cases which legitimately fall within its purview, we 

must also bear in mind that cases which, fall under <a href="/doc/760439/" id="a_76">Section 10(1)</a> of the Act for

</p><p id="p_59">               The Apex Court in The Life Insurance Corporation of India's case 

(supra)    has held that after the expiry of the specific period contractually or 

statutorily  fixed  as  the   period  of  operation   of  the   award   or   settlement,   the 

same does not become nonest but continues to be binding. The Apex Court 

further held that until a new contract or award replaces the previous one, the 

former   settlement   or  award   will   regulate  the  relations  between  the  parties. 

The   relevant   paragraph   of   the   said   judgment   is   paragraph   33   which   is 

reproduced herein under :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">                "33 The core question that first falls for consideration 
                is   as   to   whether   the   Settlements   of   1974   are   still   in 
                force. There are three stages or phases with different 
                legal effects in the life of an award or settlement. There 
                is a specific period contractually or statutorily fixed as 
                the   period   of   operation.   Thereafter,   the   award   or 
                settlement does not become nonest but continues to be 
                binding. This is the second chapter of legal efficacy but 
                qualitatively different as we will presently show. Then 
                comes the last phase. If notice of intention to terminate 
                is given under  s. 19(2)  or 19(6) then the third stage 
                opens where the award or the settlement does survive 
                and is in force between the parties as a contract which 
                has superseded the earlier contract and subsists until a 
                new   award   or   negotiated   settlement   takes   its   place. </blockquote><p id="p_60">

                both   sides   to   raise   disputes   negotiate   settlements   or 
                seek a reference and award. Until such a new contract 
                or   award   replaces   the   previous   one,   the   former

                and of this court bear testimony. To hold to the contrary 
                is to invite industrial chaos by an interpretation of the 
                <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_79">ID   Act</a>  whose   primary   purpose   is   to   obviate   such   a

                opposite of the objective, intendment and effect of the

                ethos   and   purpose.   Industrial   law   frowns   upon   a

                service created by an award or settlement lives so long 
                as a new lawful contract is brought into being. To argue 
                otherwise   is   to   frustrate   the   rule   of   law.   If   law   is   a 
                means   to   an   end-order   in   society   can   it   commit 
                functional   harakiri   by   leaving   a   conflict   situation   to 
                lawless void ?"

In our view, the said judgments would not aid the Appellant in so far as the 

maintainability   of   the   application   under   Section   33C(2)   of   the   I.   D.   Act   is 

concerned as also to contend that the claim made by the Appellant is based on 

a   pre-existing   right.     In   instant   case   as   indicated   above   there   was   a 

representative union operating in the MCBL.  However, the said representative 

union   had   never   raised   fresh   demands   or   had   called   upon   the   MCBL   and 

thereafter the Respondent Bank to comply with the Award.  As indicated above, 

it   has   come   on   record   that   the   MCBL   in   September   1992   had   passed   a 

resolution  granting increase in  wages to the  employees.   Thereafter in May 

1995   the   amounts   under   the   said   heads   were   frozen   with   a   representation 

made   that   the   employees   would   be   entitled   to   the   said   amounts   after   the 

financial position of the MCBL improves.   Thereafter the MCBL had paid the 

wages after deducting 40% from the amounts payable.  This had prompted the

No.85 of 1998 which was filed under the provisions of the MRTU and PULP 

Act, 1971 and which was ultimately dismissed for default in the year 2008.



20             The aforesaid facts therefore indicate that the representative union 

or the employees can be said to have acquiesced in the factum of freezing of 

the amounts under the said 4 heads and had also thereafter accepted the fact 

that   the   said   amounts   would   be   payable   only   in   the   event   of   the   financial 

condition of the MCBL improving.  In our view, therefore, in the facts as afore-

stated, the judgments (supra) cited on behalf of the Appellant would be of no 

avail to the Appellant.

<p id="p_63">

21             The   financial   condition   of   the   MCBL   at   the   relevant   time   is 

required to be noted.  The   Reserved Bank of India in the Inspection Report of 

the year 2005 had recorded the gross NPA of the MCBL at Rs.345.28 and that 

the   bank   had   suffered   an   operating   loss   of   Rs.83.65   lakhs   during   the   said 

financial year and accumulated losses were increased from 1061.73 lakhs for 

the year 2003-04 to Rs.1154.34 lakhs for the year 2004-05.   During the said 

period i.e. 2004-05 the percentage of staff costs to total income had increased 

from 15.6% to 21.3%.   It has also come in the evidence that the bank was 

virtually in a precarious condition on 31/03/2005 when the viability of the 

bank was -0.8% and there was no surplus income to pay anything for operating

expenses including salaries.  Hence the financial position of the MCBL can be 

said to be bad since 1994 till it was merged with the Respondent Bank.



22            The Appellant has laid much store on the adjudication in respect 

of the 35 employees of the erstwhile MCBL which adjudication had also taken 

place under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_80">Section 33C(2)</a> of the I.D. Act.  In so far as the said 35 employees 

are concerned, they had opted for the VRS which was announced in the year 

1997 by the said MCBL. As indicated in the earlier part of this Judgment, one 

of the clauses in the said VRS was that the employee who opts for the said 

scheme   would   be   entitled   to   the   Wage-Scale,   Annual   Increments,   Dearness 

Allowance, House  Rent  Allowance,  Medical   Allowance, in  case   the  financial 

condition of the MCBL improves.   The Applications under Section 33C(2) of 

the I. D. Act filed by the said 35 employees were therefore filed relying upon 

the said VRS and the condition mentioned therein.  The said proceedings were 

I.D.A. Application Nos. 34 to 63 and 75 to 79 of 1998 filed by the said 35 

employees in their individual capacity.   It seems that in the said proceedings 

the MCBL had accepted its liability to pay the amounts which were frozen and 

it is on the said basis that the said I.D.A. Applications came to be allowed by 

the learned Judge, Labour Court, Kolhapur by the judgment and order dated 

17/11/2000.   Hence the defining aspect in so far as the cases of the said 35 

employees was the acceptance of the case of the said Applicants by the MCBL. 

Against   the   judgment   and   order   dated   17/11/2000   the   MCBL   filed   a   Writ

Petition   in   this   Court   being   Writ   Petition   No.7216   of   2000.     The   said   Writ 

Petition came to be dismissed by a learned Single Judge of this Court by order 

dated 22/02/2001.  The MCBL thereafter filed Letters Patent Appeal No.160 of 

2001  before  a  Division  Bench  of  this  Court.  The  said  Letters  Patent Appeal 

came to be dismissed by the Division Bench by order dated 22/10/2001 on the 

ground that the same was not maintainable.  Against the said order, the MCBL 

filed  SLP   in  the  Apex  Court which  latter  on  came   to be  numbered  as Civil 

Appeal (S) No.6577 of 2002.     As by that time merger had taken place, the 

Respondent herein i.e.  Shamrao Vithal Co-operative Bank Ltd. filed an I A for 

being permitted to intervene in the said Civil Appeal.   The said Civil Appeal 

came to be dismissed by the Apex Court by order dated 01/05/2008, however, 

liberty was granted to the Respondent Bank to challenge the original order, if 

not already challenged.  The Respondent Bank thereafter filed Review Petition 

in this Court seeking review of the order passed by a learned Single Judge 

dated 22/02/2001.  Since the said Review Petition was suffering from delay, a 

Civil   Application   was   filed   for   condonation   of   delay   being   Civil   Application 

No.2558   of   2008.     The   learned   Single   Judge   did   not   find   the   reasons 

mentioned in the said Civil Application for seeking condonation of delay of 7 

years and 110 days as setting out sufficient cause for condonation of delay and 

accordingly dismissed the said Civil Application. Hence as a result the order 

passed by a learned Single Judge confirming the order dated 17/11/2000 by 

the Labour Court in the said  I.D.A. Application Nos. 34 to 63 and 75 to 79 of

1998 filed by the said 35 employees came to be final and binding.   Hence in 

the case of the 35 employees the MCBL had accepted its liability to pay the 

amounts which were frozen.  The Respondent Bank i.e. the Shamrao Vithal Co-

operative Bank was not party to the proceedings till it filed an application for 

intervention in the Apex Court after the amalgamation of the MCBL with it. 

Hence   the   Respondent   Bank   had   no   opportunity   to   defend   the   applications 

which were filed by the 35 employees.  In so far as the present Appellant and 

the other persons similarly situated as him are concerned, it is required to be 

noted that the Respondent Bank had filed its written statement and opposed 

the applications filed by the Appellant and other persons similarly situated as 

him under Section 33C(2) of the I. D. Act.   As indicated above, the Labour 

Court has recorded a finding that the  cases of  the  said 35 employees were 

decided on  the facts as prevailing in  the  said cases wherein  the  MCBL  had 

accepted its liability, whereas in the instant case the Respondent Bank after 

merger has opposed the claims made by the Appellant and the other persons 

similarly situated as him.  The Labour Court has also observed that each case 

has to be decided on its facts.   In our view, therefore, the Appellant herein 

cannot draw support from the adjudication which has taken place in respect of 

the 35 employees, as the fact whether the Appellant can claim parity with the 

35 employees would also impact the case of the Appellant that the claim in the 

said application filed by him under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_81">Section 33C(2)</a> is based on a pre-existing 

right.

23             At   the   cost   of   repetition,   the   findings   recorded   by   the   learned 

</pre><p id="p_65">Judge of the Labour Court would have to be revisited.  The learned Judge has 

recorded finding to the effect that the amount claimed by the Appellant is not 

based   on   any   pre-existing   right.     The   Learned   Judge   has   further   held   that 

reliance  could not  be  placed  on  the   cases of  the  said  35  employees by the 

Appellants as the Respondent Bank had raised several objections regarding the 

entitlement   of   the   Appellants   to   the   said   amount.     The   Learned   Judge   has 

further held that the Appellants claim based on a pre-existing right is denied 

and seriously disputed by the Respondent Bank and on account of the same 

serious issue of law and facts which requires adjudication by an appropriate 

forum.  The learned Judge has also held that the evidence adduced on behalf 

of the Appellant failed to show as to how and on what basis the Appellant has 

calculated   the   amount   mentioned   in   the   Scheme.   The   Learned   Judge   has 

further   referred   to   the   precarious   financial   condition   of   the   MCBL.     The 

Learned Judge has concluded by observing that the Appellants having accepted 

the payment at the time of retirement without any protest, it is not open for 

the Appellant to claim the amounts which has been claimed in the Application 

filed under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_82">Section 33C(2)</a>.

24             Now coming to  the  Judgment and  Order   of   the  Learned  Single 

Judge of this Court, the Learned Single Judge as indicated above has recorded 


lgc                                                                                         51 of 54

                                                                                       lpa-285.13

a finding that the amount as claimed was never determined or crystallized. 

The Learned Single Judge of this Court has further observed that the financial 

conditions of the MCBL (Mahavir Bank) never improved.   The MCBL though 

agreed had contested the matters and therefore at no time the amount claimed 

by   the   Applicants   was   accepted   by   the   Banks.     The   Learned   Single   Judge 

further   observed   that  the   complex  and   disputed   facts  cannot   be   decided   in 

proceedings under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_83">Section 33C(2)</a>.   The Learned Single Judge has concluded 

that the amount claimed was never determined and finalized and therefore 

such a claim cannot be adjudicated in the summary proceedings under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_84">Section 

33C(2)</a> of the ID Act.

<p id="p_67">

25             This judgment would not be complete without dealing with the 

observations   made   by   the   Learned   Single   Judge   in   paragraph   18   of   the 

impugned judgment.  The said paragraph 18 reads thus :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                  18.   Admittedly,   all   the   liabilities,   duties   and 
                  obligations of the transferor Bank (The Mahavit 
                  Bank) has been taken by the transferee Bank i.e. 
                  the Respondent Bank.</blockquote><p id="p_68">


</p><p id="p_69">               In so far as the said aforesaid observations of the Learned Single 

Judge are concerned, it is required to be noted that the Labour Court did not 

answer the issue of the liability of the Respondent Bank on the ground that the 

said issue did not survive for consideration as it had come to the conclusion 

that the claim of the Appellants was not based on any pre-existing right and 


lgc                                                                                       52 of 54

                                                                                    lpa-285.13

therefore the Application under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_85">Section 33C(2)</a> was not maintainable.   It is 

also   required   to   be   noted   that   the   Respondent   Bank   had   opposed   the 

application filed by the Appellants inter alia on the grounds mentioned in its 

Written Statement which included the denial of its liability to pay the amount 

claimed by the Appellants.  In the Writ Petition also no such issue was raised 

and contentions advanced as regards the existence or non existence of the pre-

existing right in the Appellants.   Hence there could not be any admission on 

the part of  the Respondent Bank as observed by the  Learned Single  Judge. 

Hence   the   observations   made   in   paragraph   18   can   be   said   to   be   stray 

observations made by the Learned Single Judge.  The said issue according to us 

would also be an issue involving facts and law which cannot be decided in a 

proceeding under <a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_86">Section 33C(2)</a> and can be a issue which can be at large in 

appropriate proceedings.

26            Having heard the Learned Counsel for the parties at length and 

having perused the Judgments and Orders passed by the Labour Court as well 

as the  Learned Single Judge  of  this Court, we  do not find any infirmity or  

illegality in the order passed by the Learned Single Judge for us to exercise the 

Letters Patent Jurisdiction. The above Letters Patent Appeal No.285 of 2013 is 

accordingly dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_14">
