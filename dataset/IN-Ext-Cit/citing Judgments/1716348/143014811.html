</p>

<p id="p_3">             Ashim Kumar Roy, J.:
</p>

<p id="p_4">                                  Invoking <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code the petitioner,
             who happens to be the husband of the opposite party no. 2/wife has approached
             this court for quashing of the charge sheet relating to the offences punishable
             under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_2">sections 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_3">494</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p><p id="p_5">                                  The grounds on which the quashing has been sought for are as follows :
</p><p id="p_6">                                  (i)        Earlier the petitioner was tried on a charge under <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_5">section 494</a>
                                             of the Indian Penal Code and acquitted. The said order of
                                             acquittal was never challenged in any higher forum and has
                                             reached its finality. Therefore, his prosecution once again for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                          2</span>


                        the self-same offence is not legally permissible both under
                        <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">CrPC</a> and Constitution.
</p><p id="p_7">              (ii)      Out of sheer mala fide suppressing the petitioner's previous trial for the self-same offence
                        under <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_7">section 494</a> of the Indian Penal Code and his acquittal, an FIR has been lodged and the
                        impugned charge sheet is an outcome thereof. Thus the very initiation of the case is bad in
                        law.
</p><p id="p_8">              (iii)     In the previous trial, the court, on scrutinizing the evidence, came to a definite finding that
                        the opposite party wife left her matrimonial home in June, 1983, which she admitted in her
                        cross-examination and it was never claimed that thereafter she ever returned to her
                        matrimonial home. Therefore, the torture, if any, perpetrated upon her must be before she
                        left her matrimonial home and the F. I. R. which was lodged on 19th April, 2005 nearly after
                        about 23 years for an offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_8">section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code and the
                        impugned charge sheet is hit by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_9">section 468</a> CrPC.
</p><p id="p_9">              (iv)      In connection with a maintenance proceeding under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_10">section 125</a> of the Code of Criminal
                        Procedure, similar was the evidence of the opposite party wife that she left her matrimonial
                        home in February, 1983 and there was no claim that she again returned. Therefore, if she
                        was at all subjected to any torture that must be before February, 1983.

                        494</a> IPC, is absolutely without jurisdiction, on the face of the specific statutory bar contained

<p id="p_12">              On the other hand the learned counsel for the State produced the
case diary and submitted that so far as the materials collected during
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         3</span>


investigation, there is no clear evidence as to when she left her matrimonial home
allegedly being driven out by her in-laws except the allegation that she was
driven out long back. He further submitted that the order passed in connection
with a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_17">section 125</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is also
with the case diary. According to the evidence recorded therein, she was driven
out from her matrimonial home in February, 1983. He further submitted that she
was also examined under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_18">section 161</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure but
there also she never disclosed when she was actually driven out, except,
disclosing for the first time, the name of the lady Mita Mukherjee, whom, her
husband, married for the second time. He then added that in the first trial the
lady whom the petitioner married was described as Bula Mukherjee @ Roy. It is
further pointed out that in connection with the present case the alleged second
wife applied for anticipatory bail where she described herself as Mita Mukherjee
alias Bula Roy and both of them are the same persons. Lastly he submitted only
materials as regards to her being driven out from her matrimonial home was in
February 1983.
</p><p id="p_13">            On the other hand the learned advocate for the wife/opposite party
submitted that there is no legal impediment in police investigation, where the FIR
discloses both the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_19">section 498A</a> and <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_20">494</a> of the Indian
Penal Code inasmuch as one of the offences is cognizable. He then added that
there is also no bar to take cognizance of an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_21">section
494</a> of the Indian Penal Code on a police report by the court.
</p><p id="p_14">            In support of his submissions reliance has been placed by the
learned counsel for the wife in the case of Usha Ben vs. Kishor Bhai Chunilal
Talapada &amp; Others reported in 2012 Criminal Law Journal 2234.
</p><p id="p_15">            Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary
containing the charge sheeted materials.
</p><p id="p_16">            In the case of <a href="/doc/10089/" id="a_22">G. Narashimham vs. T. V. Chokkappa (Supra</a>) and
<a href="/doc/571081/" id="a_23">Ashwin Nanubhai Vyas vs. State of Maharashtra and Another</a> (supra) two
different three Judges Bench of the Apex Court, uniformly held that the
provisions of <a href="/doc/854390/" id="a_24">section 198</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is mandatory and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          4</span>


prohibition contained therein completely restricts the power of the court in taking
cognizance of any such offence referred in <a href="/doc/854390/" id="a_25">section 198</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Therefore, although it may be permissible for the police to undertake
investigation where the FIR relates to both the offences one punishable under
<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_26">section 498A</a> IPC, the other under <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_27">Section 494</a> IPC, while one is cognizable and
the other is non-cognizable. However the court is not legally empowered to take
cognizance of an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_28">section 494</a> of the Indian Penal Code
on a police report on the face of the mandate of <a href="/doc/854390/" id="a_29">section 198</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Furthermore, there is no disclosure that previously the
petitioner was tried for an offence under <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_30">section 494</a> of the Indian Penal Code
and was acquitted. There is also neither any disclosure as to the identity of the
alleged second wife in the FIR nor in the 161 statement of the de facto
complainant wife. There is also no claim that both the women were different.
However, it is pointed out to this court from the side of the State that while in the
previous trial the second wife was described as Bula Mukherjee alias Bula Roy
but in the instant case she has been described as Mita Mukherjee. According to
the learned counsel for the State both of them are same person. From the
evidentiary material collected during investigation there is no clear picture who
was the lady, whom the present petitioner married for the second time. It is also
not the allegation in the present complaint that he married for the second time
another lady who was not referred in the first trial. The acquittal of the petitioner
for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_31">Section 494</a> IPC has also not been disputed from
the side of the defacto complainant.
</p><p id="p_17">            Now, coming to the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_32">section 498A</a> of the
Indian Penal Code, I find so far as the charge sheeted materials are concerned, it
is an admitted position that she was driven out from her matrimonial home
about 23 years back and there is no material forthcoming that thereafter she
again returned there. Therefore, the case made out from the side of the petitioner
and endorsed by the learned counsel for the State that if at all she was subjected
to torture, that was before she left her matrimonial home in the year 1983, in
absence of anything more, is quite justified. Accordingly, the impugned charge
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                           5</span>


sheet for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_33">section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code on
the basis of an FIR lodged in the year 2005 is clearly hit by the prohibition
contained in <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_34">section 468</a> CrPC.
</p><p id="p_18">                 For the reasons stated above, in my opinion, a case for quashing has
certainly been made out and accordingly the impugned proceeding stands
quashed.
</p><p id="p_19">                 Urgent photostat certified copy of the order, if applied for, be supplied to the learned advocates for
both the sides within a week from the date of making such application.
