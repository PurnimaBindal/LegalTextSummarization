aggrieved by the dismissal of its application for an ad interim injunction
restraining the respondent/defendant Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (hereafter
"Glenmark") from using its patented product Sitagliptin (Indian Patent No.
209816, hereafter "the patent" or "the suit patent"). MSD, in its suit,




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                    Page 1
 claimed permanent injunction restraining infringement of the patent,
damages, rendition of accounts and delivery up. The suit patent concerns a
drug which lowers blood sugar levels in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
("T2DM") patients. Glenmark was on caveat: the learned Single Judge
heard the parties at the first hearing. Glenmark opposed the application for
ad interim injunction and relied on documents produced during the hearing.
The learned Single Judge rejected the injunction application.
MSD‟s Contentions - Pleadings and Submissions

</p><p id="p_6">2.      MSD, a New Jersey incorporated company, imports and sells the
drugs in question, after local packaging, under the trademarks "Januvia" and
"Janumet", in India. In addition, MSD also works its invention through Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the second plaintiff, its marketing and
distributing licensee for the drugs in question in this suit, which are sold
under the trademarks "Istavel" and "Istamet". MSD claims that it holds the
patent - IN 209816 (hereafter referred to as "the suit patent") - which covers
the said drugs. Glenmark is another multinational pharmaceutical company.
It launched its products under the trademarks "Zita" and "Zitamet". Both
Glenmark‟s and MSD‟s products seek to treat T2DM.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.      MSD alleges that Glenmark‟s products infringe its patent. MSD also
claims that it has been granted patents in 102 countries for the suit patent
formulation i.e. the Sitagliptin molecule. The Indian Patent application was
filed     on        06.01.2004;   the   international   application     being
PCT/US2002/021349 filed on 05.07.2002 with the priority date 06.07.2001.
The suit patent was finally granted on 06.09.2007, bearing the title "Beta-
Aminotetra Hydroimidazo - (1, 2-A) Pyrazines And Tetrahydrotrioazolo (4,




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                       Page 2
 3-A) Pyrazines As Dipeptidyl Peptidase Inhibitors For The Treatment Or
Prevention Of Diabetes". It is claimed that the application for the said patent
was not opposed either in pre-grant or post-grant proceedings by anyone,
including Glenmark, despite extensive publicity for the commercial product
sold in India under the brand names „Januvia‟ and „Janumet‟.                                  The
Sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate salt is sold under the trademarks
Januvia, by MSD and Istavel, by its licensee. Likewise, the combination of
Metformin and Sitagliptin (in its diphosphate monohydrate salt) is sold
under the trademark Janumet, by MSD and Instamet, by its licensee.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.      According to MSD, Sitagliptin is the active pharmaceutical ingredient
in the said drugs, which was approved for sale in the United States of
America in October 2006 and in the Indian market on 23.08.2008. The suit
patent has 20 claims of which Sitagliptin is covered in 13 claims. Sitagliptin
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are specifically claimed by Claim
No.19 of the suit patent. Claim No.1 embraces all forms of Sitagliptin, all
Stereoisomers1, including R Stereoisomers in the commercial product, all
salts and solvates of Sitagliptin and the Sitagliptin molecule (i.e. the free
amine). The plaintiff has outlined the technical details pertaining to
Sitagliptin and emphasized that the commercial product comprises the R-
stereoisomer2 of Sitagliptin, in the phosphate monohydrate salt form. The

 Two molecules are described as stereoisomers of each other if they are made of the same atoms,
connected in the same sequence, but the atoms are positioned differently in space. The difference
between two stereoisomers can only be seen when the three dimensional arrangement of the
molecules is considered. Stereoisomers are a type of isomer (i.e different substances that have the
same formula). Ref. http://www.chemicool.com/definition/stereoisomers.html.

 said patent claims R and S forms of Sitagliptin and its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts in genus claim 1 as well as the specific R-Sitagliptin
molecule in Claim 19. It is stated further that the MSD paid special regard to
public interest and launched „Januvia‟ at `43/- a pill in the Indian market in
April 2008 at roughly 1/5th of its price in the US. It is claimed that MSD
spoke to over 350 doctors before launching the product.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.      MSD alleges that it actively pursues the indigenization of its products,
and in 2012, bulk packs of its Sitagliptin products were imported from Italy
and sold by its local licensees. The plaintiff has also disclosed its sales
figures, claiming that from the initial sales of ₹17,76,65,940/- (for Januvia)
and ₹1,37,91,420/- (for Janumet) in 2008, the figures have increased to
₹96,24,48,996/- (for Januvia) and ₹95,64,87,772/- (for Janumet) in 2012.
MSD further claims to have launched a helpline, the first of its kind, to
facilitate optimal and comprehensive management of patients with T2DM
by enhancing their understanding, ensuring compliance with prescribed
therapy etc. It claims to have spent about ₹10 crores on such patient access
programs. The suit also outlines other measures and the expenditure
undertaken to educate patients and the general public about the suit patent
and the products derived from it.

</p><p id="p_14"> 6.       It is alleged that Glenmark was aware of the suit patent - specifically
Sitagliptin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts - especially since it
cited them in support of its patent claim in the United States, being US
Patent 8334385 dated 18.12.2012. The suit relies upon extracts of the said
patent claims which specifically refer to Januvia. It is argued that
Glenmark‟s patent in the US claims the crystalline3 R Sitagliptin free
amine4. It is urged that Glenmark does not have freedom to operate in the
US based on its patent because of MSD‟s US compound Patent No.
6699871. MSD argues that Glenmark infringes its suit patent as its product
Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate is covered by Claim 19 and well as the
other 13 claims made under it, and further that Glenmark infringes its suit
patent as its product Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate cannot be prepared
without manufacturing the active ingredient, the Sitagliptin molecule.
Therefore, it is urged that the use of Sitagliptin claimed by IN 209816 to
prepare Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate by Glenmark infringes MSD‟s
exclusive right.

<p id="p_15">  With few exceptions, the particles that compose a solid material, whether ionic, molecular,
covalent, or metallic, are held in place by strong attractive forces between them. When we discuss
solids, therefore, we consider the positions of the atoms, molecules, or ions, which are essentially
fixed in space, rather than their motions (which are more important in liquids and gases). The
constituents of a solid can be arranged in two general ways: they can form a regular repeating three-
dimensional structure called a crystal lattice, thus producing a crystalline solid, or they can aggregate with
no particular order, in which case they form an amorphous solid (from the Greek ámorphos, meaning
"shapeless"). Sourced from:http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/4309?e=averill_1.0-ch12_s01

 According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUAPC) nomenclature, functional
groups are normally designated in one of two ways. The presence of the function may be indicated by a
characteristic suffix and a location number. This is common for the carbon-carbon double and triple bonds
which have the respective suffixesene and yne. Halogens, on the other hand, do not have a suffix and are
named as substituents, for example: (CH 3)2C=CHCHClCH3 is 4-chloro-2-methyl-2-pentene. Amines are
derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the hydrogens has been replaced by an alkyl or aryl group.
The nomenclature of amines is complicated by the fact that several different nomenclature systems exist,
and      there      is    no      clear   preference     for    one      over    the    others.      (Ref.
https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/amine1.htm)




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                                                     Page 5
</p><p id="p_16"> 7.      The learned Senior Counsel, Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina for MSD argues,
that its drug Sitagliptin is the first in its class of compounds that inhibits the
enzyme Di Peptidyl Peptidase-IV ("DPP-IV"). Urging that the current
opinion about the origin of T2DM associates it with insulin resistance
resulting in high glucose levels, the learned counsel contends that most
common drugs enhance insulin production in the body thereby controlling
glucose level. For instance, Metformin is established in the market for
treatment of diabetes. Such products have unwarranted side effects of
dramatically        lowering        blood      glucose       levels      which       can      lead     to
hypoglycemia5. MSD claims that its new drugs function through a different
mechanism and inhibit DPP-IV which blocks the production of two peptides
called GIP and GLP-I that are released into the human body upon
consumption of food6. This prevents the possibility of hypoglycaemia, as the
new drugs control glucose produced only after meal intake. It is stated that
MSD took over 9 years of research and substantial amounts of monetary
investment to develop this drug.
</p>
<p id="p_17">8.      The learned counsel argued that the suit patent is infringed because
Sitagliptin and any of its acceptable salts are covered by its claims, thus
resulting in the making, using or offering for sale, importing into India etc.

  Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood glucose (blood sugar)
levels, usually less than 70 mg/dl - (Ref. http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-
and-care/blood-glucose-control/hypoglycemia-low-blood.html)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">6</span>
  DPP-4 inhibitors work by blocking the action of DPP-4, an enzyme which destroys the hormone incretins,
which help the body produce more insulin only when it is needed and reduce the amount of glucose being
produced by the liver when it is not needed. These hormones are released throughout the day and levels are
increased at meal times. (Ref. http://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/What-is-diabetes/Diabetes-</p>

 of Sitagliptin or any of its salts or any form amounting to infringement of
the suit patent. The learned counsel also explains that <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_1">Section 48</a> of the
Indian Patent Act, 1970 extends exclusive rights to exclude others from
making, using or offering for sale or importing into India products which fall
within the scope of a suit claim. It is argued that Glenmark, by
manufacturing, selling, offering for sale and advertising the pharmaceutical
combinations Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate under the brand Zita and
Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate and Metformin Hydrochloride under the
brand name Zitamet infringes the suit patent and all its claims. It was
underlined that Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate cannot be prepared
without manufacturing the active ingredient Sitagliptin molecule. Therefore,
the use of Sitagliptin claimed by IN 209816 to prepare Sitagliptin Phosphate
Monohydrate by Glenmark infringes the suit patent.
</p>
<p id="p_19">Impugned order

</p><p id="p_20">9.     The suit was filed before this Court on 01.04.2013. Glenmark was on
caveat and appeared before the learned Single Judge on the first date of
hearing. Its contentions were also heard. On that first date of hearing,
02.04.2013, the learned Single Judge heard the suit along with the
application IA 5167/2013, which sought ad interim injunction. In the
hearing, MSD‟s counsel relied upon the suit allegations set out in the
previous portions of this judgment and also relied upon certain judgments of
the Courts. Glenmark, on the other hand, contended that MSD was guilty of
suppression on account of non-disclosure of the abandonment of its patent
application for the Sitagliptin Phosphate. This submission was elaborated
stating that MSD‟s product comprises of three parts, „S‟, „PD‟, and „DC‟. It




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                       Page 7
 is argued on behalf of Glenmark that MSD had separate patents for these
parts in the US, and that in India, even though it holds the patent for S- i.e.
"Sitagliptin", it had applied for separate patents for the other two, which
were subsequently abandoned. In support, a compilation of documents was
handed over during the hearing. It is also submitted that Application No.
5948 was filed (by MSD) for the invention "PD", i.e. Phosphoric Acid Salt
of a DPP IV Inhibitor, in which the combination was described as a "novel
salt" and a new discovery over its patented „S‟; having itself claimed novelty
of the S and PD combination, MSD cannot now be heard to argue that
Glenmark‟s combination of S and PD is an infringement of MSD‟s patent in
S. Furthermore, it was argued that if Sitagliptin were not a distinct product
from Sitagliptin Phosphate, then MSD would never have sought to apply for
separate patent protection for the latter in the US, and in India (which effort
was concededly abandoned). It was further urged that nine other entities or
individuals were marketing Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate.
</p>
<p id="p_21">10.    By the order dated 02.04.2013/05.04.2013, learned Single Judge in
paragraph 22 was of the opinion that a minor variation in the combination
in Glenmark‟s product (phosphate with Sitagliptin) could not mean that
there was no infringement; trifling variations had to be ignored. However, he
went on to notice that MSD, as patentee of Sitagliptin was not marketing
Sitagliptin alone as a product and was marketing Sitagliptin in combination
with phosphate, just like Glenmark. Nevertheless, he noticed that interim
relief and the pleadings did not suggest that Sitagliptin Phosphate made by
Glenmark was with the same object as MSD‟s patent; equally he noted that
there was no pleading that the mere addition of phosphate to Sitagliptin did




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 8
 not embody an inventive advancement. The impugned judgment, therefore,
concluded that the plaintiff did not prove the case it ought to have i.e. how
Sitagliptin Phosphate is merely a new form of Sitagliptin that was medically
equivalent to Sitagliptin, thus rendering the interim injunction unwarranted.
The impugned order relied upon a Division Bench ruling in <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_2">Hoffman La
Roche Ltd. v. CIPLA</a> 2012 (52) PTC 1 (Del) to the effect that if a related
patent claim in India is rejected and that information is not forthcoming at
the time of the subject patent claim, no injunction can be granted.

the agreement on behalf of Glenmark that since the learned Single Judge had
proceeded to dismiss ad interim injunction application at the preliminary
hearing, it would be granted the liberty to file its substantive reply under
Order XXXIX Rule 1 CPC and also produce and place on record all the
necessary documents; MSD was also permitted the liberty to file its reply
and documents if they wished to place any on record. After this course was

</p><p id="p_25"> 12.    MSD argues that its non-disclosure of applications (which were not
pursued by it) was an inessential detail which should not have clouded the
debate on whether Glenmark infringed its suit patent. It was submitted that
the   subject       of   the   European   Patent,   and   the   application     No.

Salt of a DPP-IV inhibitor that claimed Dihydrogenphosphate salt of
Sitagliptin and was abandoned under <a href="/doc/13146/" id="a_3">Section 21(1)</a> on 23.08.2010) could not
have been the basis for refusing ad interim injunction. It was submitted in
this context that the obligation to disclose material and essential facts was a
subject of ongoing debate, as evidenced by the judgment in <a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_4">Novartis AG v.
Union of India</a>, 2013 (6) SCC 1. It was submitted that there can be cases
where the coverage of a patent claim can be more than its disclosure. It was
urged that moreover, Explanation to <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_5">Section 3</a> (d) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_6">Patents Act</a> was the
reason behind why MSD did not pursue its patent claim in Application No.
5948 in respect of Dihydrogenphosphate salt of Sitagliptin. Furthermore, the
learned counsel submitted that the latter claim in effect was an improvement
patent, the claim for which was not precluded. He relied on the judgment
reported as <a href="/doc/122154591/" id="a_7">CFMT Inc v. YieDup International Corporation</a> 349 F.3d 1333.
</p>
<p id="p_26">13.    Mr. Andhyarujina, the learned Senior Counsel for MSD next argued
that the basic question to be addressed was whether MSD‟s grievance that
Glenmark had infringed its suit patent was borne out prima facie from the
records. He contended that it was; to demonstrate that, he placed reliance on
Glenmark‟s US Process Patent No. US8334385 dated 18.12.2012. This
patent is for "Process for the preparation of R. Sitagliptin and its
pharmaceutical salts". This patent, argues counsel, clearly admits that




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                             Page 10
 Sitagliptin is developed for the treatment of T2DM and is the active free
base7. It also gives the full description of the process for preparing
Sitagliptin freebase in the patent specification which is Scheme „6‟ in
Merck‟s patent; reliance is placed on MSD‟s US patent for Sitagliptin in
support. The claim of Glenmark‟s patent is for a crystalline salt of
Sitagliptin. It is stated that suitable "pharmaceutically acceptable" acids
include phosphoric acid. Glenmark however, did not disclose this patent in
its reply. It totally disproves the allegation that Sitagliptin was not disclosed
in the suit patent and was not capable of industrial application.
Consequently, submitted MSD, on Glenmark‟s admission, Sitagliptin and its
pharmaceutically acceptable salt is incorporated within the MSD's patent,
and Glenmark cannot be heard to state to the contrary. Mr. Andhyarujina
relies on the World Health Organization (WHO) assigning Sitagliptin an
"INN" name. For this reason, Glenmark in their US patent refer to the
chemical compound as Sitagliptin and not by its chemical name. The
submission was that anyone using the INN Sitagliptin is unquestionably
referring to the same chemical name and structure as given in MSD‟s patent
specification and claims.
</p>
<p id="p_27">14.    MSD urges that the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical compound
is often administered in the form of a salt. The use of a salt increases the
water solubility and improves the stability of the drug compound - to say

 A substance or compound that is intended to be used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical
product as a therapeutically active compound.

 this, reliance is placed on Pharmaceutical Patent Law8 by John Thomas at p.
</p><p id="p_29">43. Therefore, a salt of a basic compound is prescribed for convenience in a
drug. Sitagliptin is a basic compound which, when taken with phosphoric
acid facilitates administration of the drug. Glenmark‟s allegation that the
only product which is "exemplified, disclosed and enabled" in the suit
patent is Sitagliptin HCL, referring to Example 7, and that Sitagliptin
Phosphate Monohydrate is not disclosed in the suit patent is seriously
contested. Counsel submitted that there is no one single disclosure in the
Suit Patent as alleged by Glenmark. Example 7 is not the entire scope of
MSD‟s patent but is one instance of pharmaceutical salt for Sitagliptin.
Every compound, under the patent, of Formula 1 is encompassed in the
patent, particularly those compounds, which are, enumerated in the specific
claims e.g. Claim No.19 which comprises Sitagliptin or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof. Stressing that it would be wrong to read Example 7
as the entire reach of MSD‟s specification, it is argued that the patent must
be read as covering all the compounds of Formula 1 and not one particular
compound stated in Example 7 which mentions a salt of Hydrochloride.
MSD relies on Pharmaceuticals: Biotechnology and the Law,9 especially the
chapter „Claims to New Chemical Entities‟ at p. 75 ¶5.15. It was contended
that the Supreme Court in Novartis AG stated the applicable law and
rejected Novartis‟ argument that Imatinib Mesylate, a salt, was not disclosed

 urges that Sitagliptin is disclosed and claimed by the claims and the patent
specification. The patent specification also gives minute details of
preparation of Sitagliptin free base in Scheme 6.
</p>
<p id="p_30">15.    The learned counsel relies upon the disclosures made to the suit patent
IN 209816 to say that the basic invention for which patent protection was
sought was Sitagliptin "with pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof". It is
submitted that this is clearly stated in claims 01, 15, 17 and 19. Citing
Edward H. Phillips v. AWH Corporations, 415F. 3d 1303 and <a href="/doc/865758/" id="a_8">F. H and B
Corporation v. Unichem Laboratories</a>, AIR 1969 Bom 255 it was argued
that in patent law, claims are the vital part of the patent and the words of the
claim define the scope of the invention. Counsel elaborated that there is no
merit in Glenmark‟s plea with respect to Sitagliptin Hydrochloride in
Example 07 being the only disclosure, on the ground that it is mentioned as
a preferred salt. It was contended that the examiner in the European Patent
Office during prosecution of the subsequent phosphate salt application,
clearly stated that phosphates are included in the range of compounds
disclosed in the basic salt application but if there was a selection, the
properties of the selected salt should be brought out. MSD responded to this
comment based upon two facts: one, that the phosphate salt was more
suitable than others because of its stability and solubility and therefore the
advantage of "ease of processing, handling and dosing" and two, that under
the European law, a distinction exists between coverage and disclosure, and
even if the phosphate salt were covered by the claims of the basic patent,
there may be not a specific disclosure through detailed example as opposed
to a generic disclosure. In India, on account of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_9">Section 3(d)</a> and the




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 13
 interpretation of the expression "efficacy" by courts, MSD abandoned the
phosphate salt application.
</p>
<p id="p_31">16.      It is stressed that Glenmark‟s ZITA (Sitagliptin Phosphate
Monohydrate) and ZITA-MET (Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate and
Metformin) infringe the suit patent because Sitagliptin is made and used by
Glenmark in ZITA and ZITA-MET when it makes salt Sitagliptin Phosphate
Monohydrate. It is underlined that the phosphoric acid salt of Sitagliptin was
disclosed in the suit patent itself as one of the pharmaceutically acceptable
salts.
</p>
<p id="p_32">17.      The learned counsel also submitted that the disclosure requirements
mandated by law were fulfilled by MSD in its patent claims as they were
comprehensible and could be worked by persons skilled in the art. It was
highlighted that Glenmark‟s own claims in the US patent claim are
testimony to the capability of Sitagliptin‟s patent application‟s ability to
teach one skilled in the art to produce the drug.

<p id="p_33">Glenmark‟s pleadings and arguments

</p><p id="p_34">18.      Glenmark urges that MSD‟s patent suit is liable to be dismissed. It
argues, in its counter claim that the suit patent is liable to be revoked. It was
first urged that MSD has not revealed its title to the suit patent. More
substantially, it is urged that MSD did not approach the Court with clean
hands and in this regard did not disclose that it filed several applications,
two of which were specifically abandoned, (i.e. International Application
nos. 5948/DELNP/2005 filed on 18.06.2004 - in respect of Phosphoric Acid
Salt of a DPP- IV inhibitor which claims Dihydrogenphosphate salt of




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                         Page 14

Application no. 1130/DELNP/2006, filed before the suit patent was granted,
which was abandoned on 31.03.2011). The latter described the claims as
"Novel Crystalline forms of a phosphoric acid salt of a Dipeptidyl Peptidase
IV    inhibitor"    and   specifically   relied   on   crystalline   form    of
Dihydrogenphosphate salt of Sitagliptin. Other Applications, Nos.
2710/CHENP/2008 (filed on 12.12.2006); 4922/DELNP/2010 filed on
15.01.2009 and No. 5603/DELNP/2010 filed on 23.02.2009 are awaiting
examination. These, it is highlighted, should have been disclosed.
</p>
<p id="p_35">19.    It was argued that MSD sought to mislead the Court, and made a false
claim in respect of Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate and combination of
Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate and Metformin Hydrochloride after
urging that they are the subject matter of and thus consequently subsumed in
the suit patent. Glenmark‟s Senior Counsel, Dr. A.M. Singhvi states that
ZITA has Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate as the active pharmaceutical
ingredient for which no patent protection exists because Application No.
5948/DELNP/2005 was specifically abandoned. It was also argued that
ZETAMET is a combination of Sitagliptin Phosphate and monohydrate and
Metformin Hydrochloride which is not subject matter of any patent and
application No. 2710/CHENP/2008 is awaiting examination before the
Patent office.
</p>
<p id="p_36">20.    Glenmark states that in Patent law whenever corresponding
applications are lodged in different countries or when a patent application is
filed claiming priority from a particular application - those have to be related
to the "same invention" as contained in the prior document or corresponding

those applications are to be treated as admissions while considering patent
claims and documents. Highlighting that MSD‟s common application failed
to make full disclosure about the filing or pendency of Application nos.
5948, 1130 and 2710 which was subsequently discovered - Glenmark urges
that the omission in the suit is fatal to MSD‟s claims. <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_11">Section 8</a> is relied on
to underline this argument; counsel also relies on the Division Bench ruling
in <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_12">F.Hoffman La Roche v. Cipla</a>, 2009 (40) PTC 12. It was submitted that
<a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_13">Section 8</a> of the Patents Act, 1970 requires Indian patent applicants to
disclose all details of corresponding foreign patent applications. Thus, patent
prosecution outcomes in foreign countries- such as the EPO, were material;
the suppression of these precluded the grant of the suit patent itself.
</p>
<p id="p_37"> 21.    Dr. Singhvi submits the MSD did not support its claims with any
technical analysis either in the form of Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC)10, Thermogravimetric Analysis11 (TGA) or X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
of Glenmark‟s products. This would have indicated that the active
pharmaceutical ingredient is Zeta and Zeta Sitagliptin Phosphate

<p id="p_40">22.    Glenmark describes itself a research-driven, global, integrated
pharmaceutical company and discoverer of new molecules - both New
Chemical Entities (NCEs) and New Biological Entities (NBEs) - with
significant presence in branded generics markets across the emerging
economies and global operations with more than 20 subsidiaries and over
9000 employees in 80 countries. It possesses 6 R&amp;D centres and has 13
manufacturing facilities. Glenmark urges that it is currently among the
world‟s top pharmaceutical companies. Glenmark urges that the suit patent
description claims includes compounds which hinder DPP IV inhibitors,
useful in treatment or prevention of disease where such enzyme is involved,
like diabetes, i.e T2DM. Sitagliptin is a compound claimed (or its
pharmaceutically acceptable salt). Glenmark argues that no details regarding
the process to isolate Sitagliptin base was provided in the suit patent; the
sole pharmaceutically acceptable salt for which there is an enabling
disclosure was in example 7, i.e Hydrochloride salt. No other salt was
exemplified in the patent specification. Glenmark relies on several decisions
(Teva Canada v Pfizer Canada 2012 SCC 60); Abraham Esau‟s &amp; C.
Lorenz Application 1932 (49) RPC 85; John Willliam Howlett - 1941 (9)

Application 1967 (6) RPC 170; Eastman Kodak‟s Application 1970 (87)

works leads one to conclude that the patent is invalid.

<p id="p_41">FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                      Page 17
</p><p id="p_42"> 23.    Glenmark avers, and Dr. Singhvi argues on its behalf, that the suit
patent by the plaintiff‟s own admission is different from its product. The
only exemplified salt being Sitagliptin Hydrochloride, no other salt can be
claimed or covered in the impugned salt patent and the plaintiff, by its own
admission equivocally, through several documents admitted that the suit
patent is distinct and different from the Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate
(SPM) as well as its combinations with Metformin Hydrochloride. Urging
that the latter two products are the subjects of separate patents, Glenmark
highlights that this is clear admission that they are not covered by the suit
patent. In this respect, the details of the plaintiff‟s application, i.e.
5148/DELNP/2005, especially, Claim no.1 and International Patent US
2004027983, again claim no.1 are relied upon. The said salt, i.e. SPM was
also claimed to possess tremendous advantages over free base and
previously disclosed hydrochloride salt. MSD‟s said patent application no.
5948/DELNP/2005 for SPM was specifically abandoned. In this context,
submits      Glenmark,    MSD‟s      admission      that   the     monobasic
dihydrogenphosphate salt was "newly discovered" was made for the first
time in 2003 in its patent application for SPM that was applied for and
registered in several jurisdictions other than India. This admission, i.e that
SPM was newly discovered in 2003 completely demolishes its current
attempt to suggest and claim that SPM is subsumed within the suit patent.
Thus, by the present appeal MSD attempts to mala fide enlarge its monopoly
by seeking to injunct Glenmark‟s products containing SPM. It is also
submitted that the claims sought to be pursued by MSD in effect is patent
monopoly that is overbroad and unworkable; it includes possibly 4.9 billion
compounds and such elastic claims cannot be sustained. Such claims are




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                       Page 18
 known as Markush claims (based on the US Patent ruling in Ex parte
Markush., 1925 Dec Comm‟r Pat, 126 (1924)).
</p>
<p id="p_43">24.    It is argued that MSD, in its application in respect of SPM, admits that
there was no specific disclosure of the newly discovered dihydrogen
phosphate salt of Sitagliptin in the suit patent. It is also claimed that the
dihydrogenphosphate salt of Sitagliptin has enhanced chemical and physical
stability which is a pre-condition for clinical development. Similarly, it was
only in this 2003 application that MSD for the first time disclosed the
process for isolation of Sitagliptin Free Base. This disclosure is completely
different from the disclosure made in the suit patent by MSD in Example 7
which discloses Sitagliptin HCl and not Sitagliptin Free base.
</p>
<p id="p_44">25.    Similarly, Indian Application No. 1130/DELNP/2006 and its claim
and the corresponding international claim PCT/US/2006/047380 are relied
on.    According to Glenmark, abandonment of these two applications
amounted to MSD‟s admission and they are not subsumed under the suit
patent. Glenmark highlights that the claim subject matter as disclosed in the
European Patent application no. 04755691.5 corresponds to application no.
5948/DELNP/2005 (which was abandoned) whereas the European claim
was that the subject matter is novel in nature in as much as claim 1 of the
said application is directed to a particular salt form. Emphasizing that list of
potentially suitable salts forming acids and bases being provided in WO
03/004498 includes phosphoric acid - it is emphasized that there is no actual
disclosure of Dihydrogenphosphate salt of Sitagliptin and that is not the only
possible outcome of treatment of Sitagliptin Phosphoric Acid since the
Phosphoric Acid is tri-basic in nature as it has three ionisable hydrogen, and




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 19
 therefore, capable of forming di- and tri-ammonium salts as well as the
mono-ammonium salts. Since Glenmark admits that the suit patent is the
closest prior art disclosed under Application No. 5948 which was
abandoned, it is urged that it is no longer open to it to state that Glenmark
has infringed the suit patent. It is further submitted that Dihydrogen
Phosphate has superior properties over Hydrochloride in respect of physical
and chemical properties and has superior properties over Sitagliptin free
base since free base of Sitagliptin undergoes deamination at elevated
temperatures and is therefore unstable for pharmaceutical development.
Claiming that crystalline Hydrochloride salt of Sitagliptin exists as
monohydrate and when analyzed through XRPD shows its tendency to
hydrate water from the room temperature which is disadvantageous for solid
formulation, Glenmark states that crystalline Hydrochloride was not chosen
for commercial development. Therefore, it is stated that MSD, through
European EP 1654263 states that Dihydrogen phosphate salt has a
remarkable advantage over the Hydrochloric salt. In view of this, it is argued
that MSD‟s case in various documents is that the product which contains
phosphate salt is different from products containing hydrochloride salt, and
therefore, Glenmark products are not covered by suit patent nor do they
infringe it.
</p>
<p id="p_45">26.    It is averred and argued next that the non-working of the patent is
equivalent to its incapability for industrial application. Glenmark states that
Sitagliptin per se as well as Sitagliptin Hydrochloride are unstable
compounds incapable of commercial production and industrial use. The
admissions of MSD, while prosecuting its subsequent application pertaining




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 20
 to Dihydrogen Phosphate salt of Sitagliptin with Sitagliptin base and
Sitagliptin Hydrochloride are chemically and physically unstable in nature is
heavily relied upon. It is also argued that the subject of the patent is obvious
in nature and does not involve any inventive step given what was publically
known or publically used in India. Likewise, the invention as claimed is not
useful. The other objections under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_14">Section 64</a>, i.e. non-disclosure of
complete specification of the patent being a patent under false suggestion,
and non-compliance of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_15">Section 8</a> are pleaded and argued as defences by
Glenmark. Glenmark also seeks to highlight the difference between Januvia,
Istavel and its Zita tablet and Janumet and Istamet.
</p>
<p id="p_46">27.    Dr. Singhvi submits that acceptance of MSD‟s contentions would
nullify <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_16">Section 3(d)</a> in as much as under the blanket of broad claims, it
would enjoy patent protection for a product which otherwise in terms of its
admissions was not patentable due to <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_17">Section 3(d)</a>. The rejection of a patent
for a product under <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_18">Section 3(d)</a> does not make it automatically covered
under the earlier patent. That would defeat the very purpose of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_19">section 3(d)</a>.
He submitted that MSD‟s stand throughout with regard to the patent
application for SPM was that it satisfied all three tests necessary for grant of
patent i.e. novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. In fact, MSD
enjoys patent protection in respect of SPM in various other jurisdictions
except India. Thus, if SPM is new and inventive then it is a logical
conclusion that the same cannot be said to be subsumed in the suit patent.
Dr. Singhvi argues that MSD in essence is seeking to enlarge its patent
protection to a large number of compounds including SPM due to broad
claiming despite the fact that corresponding details are not provided in the




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 21
 body of the complete specification thereby rendering the suit patent invalid
in nature on the ground of insufficiency.
</p>
<p id="p_47">28.    In support of the plea that the patent salt is liable to be revoked,
Glenmark argues that Sitagliptin Free Base is not disclosed either as a raw
material or as an intermediate product in the patent application and that
MSD‟s admission in the SPM patent application disclose its awareness of,
and unequivocal acceptance of Sitagliptin Free Base‟s unpatentability due to
lack of industrial application. Here, the statement that the "form of
sitagliptin is relatively unstable and not suitable for pharmaceutical
development" and further that "...the amorphous hydrochloride salt of
sitagliptin was tested but rejected for pharmaceutical development due to
inter alia its hygroscopic and morphological properties" by MSD in its
patent application is relied on. MSD‟s clear understanding that Sitagliptin is
unformed, not isolated, industrially unusable and therefore not patentable is
highlighted. It is urged that what was put to clinical trial was SPM, and not
Sitagliptin Free Base, or even Sitagliptin Hcl. All these, states Glenmark,
exemplify MSD‟s disregard and violation of the statutory mandate contained
in <a href="/doc/1217727/" id="a_20">Section 10</a> (4) with respect to complete disclosure of the specification. It
is further argued that textually <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_21">Section 48</a> presupposes rights in respect of
the patented article alone- an interpretation supported by the definition of
"invention"; reliance is placed on the judgments reported as <a href="/doc/1753677/" id="a_22">Bhor Industries
v. Collector Central Excise</a>, 1989 (1) SCC 602 and <a href="/doc/719134/" id="a_23">Delhi Cloth and General
Mills Co. Ltd v. R.R. Gupta</a>, 1976 (3) SCC 444. It is argued that the failure
to fulfil the disclosure mandate of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_24">Patent Act</a> renders the suit patents
liable to revocation. When the suit patent was examined, a claim for SPM




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                       Page 22
 was made and MSD knew that neither Sitagliptin Free Base nor Sitagliptin
Hydrochloride had any industrial application. Therefore, for it to now
contend that the suit patent subsumed those compounds or substances was
impermissible. It was lastly argued that the patent was liable to be revoked
as MSD‟s applications, as well as pleadings before the Court, when it
alleged infringement by Glenmark, were replete with half truths and
suppression of material facts.
</p>
<p id="p_48">Analysis &amp; Conclusions

</p><p id="p_49">29.    At the outset this Court notices that much of the controversies which
had to be grappled with at the appellate stage ought to ordinarily have been
considered during the proceedings in the court of First Instance, i.e the
learned Single Judge. Whilst one cannot doubt the learned Single Judge's
anxiety in the facts of this case, to do justice to all, with utmost dispatch, at
the same time, it cannot be overemphasized that in patent disputes, an ex-
parte or even an in limine decision (i.e at the threshold stage) of an
interlocutory application should be avoided. Patents are granted after
searching scrutiny by the statutory authorities. The court should (unless
there are overwhelming and compelling reasons, manifest from the
plaintiff's pleadings in the suit) not so reject an interlocutory application,
without the benefit of pleading - or the barest indication of the defence. A
safer approach - one dictated by caution and circumspection, would be to
deny relief in the first hearing if there is the slightest doubt, but set down the
application for hearing at the earliest opportunity even while requiring some
semblance of formal disclosure by the defendant. "Swift justice" remarked




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                          Page 23
 Justice Potter Stewart (of the US Supreme Court) "demands more than just
swiftness".
</p><p id="p_50">30.     MSD claims that Glenmark violated its product patent; Glenmark‟s
defence is that MSD‟s patent is liable to be revoked as it was wrongly
granted in the first place and in the alternative, that there is no infringement.
In such cases, while considering the grant of ad interim injunctions
generally, the Court must determine whether first, the claimant may, prima
facie, succeed in its claim, secondly, whether MSD will suffer irreparable
injury if the injunction is refused, and finally, determine the balance of
convenience between the parties.
</p><p id="p_51">31.     At issue in this case, in the first place, is the construction of Patent
No. 209816, the suit patent) which concerns the anti-diabetes drug
Sitagliptin. MSD alleged in its suit that it commercially markets Sitagliptin
as a phosphate monohydrate salt ("SPM"), under the commercial name
„Januvia‟, and as a di-phosphate monohydrate salt combined with another
drug - Metformin - under the commercial name „Janumet‟. On the other
hand, Glenmark markets a drug under the commercial name „Zita‟, which is
SPM. MSD claims in the suit that Sitagliptin inhibits the enzyme DPP-IV.
DPP-IV breaks down the incretins12 GLP-1 and GIP, which are
gastrointestinal hormones released after food intake. Incretins slow the rate
of absorption of nutrients into the blood stream by reducing gastric emptying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">12</span>
   Incretins are gut hormones that are secreted from enteroendocrine cells into the blood within
minutes after eating. One of their many physiological roles is to regulate the amount of insulin
that is secreted after eating. Their important function is to aid in disposal of the products of
digestion. There are two incretins, known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), that share many common actions in the pancreas but have
distinct actions outside of the pancreas. Both incretins are rapidly deactivated by an enzyme
called            dipeptidyl           peptidase            4           (DPP4).            (Ref.

 and may directly reduce food intake. By preventing GLP-1 and GIP
inactivation, they are able to increase the secretion of insulin and suppress
the release of glucagon by the alpha cells of the pancreas. This pushes blood
glucose towards normal levels. As blood glucose levels approach normalcy,
the amounts of insulin released and glucagon suppressed diminishes, thus
tending to prevent an "exceed" or overrun and subsequent low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia) which is seen with some other oral hypoglycemic agents. It
is stated that Sitagliptin lowers HbA1c level by about 0.7% points as
compared to placebos.

<p id="p_53">32.    The hearings on the interim injunction application were, ironically
and quite contrary to the description, prolonged, and the material placed for
consideration of the court, voluminous. Various claims, counter claims and
defences were urged by Glenmark, and resisted by MSD. Before entering
the details, recounting an outline of the grounds of Glenmark‟s opposition to
the suit claim would be essential. They can be divided into two parts.

</p><p id="p_58">       (d) the claim goes much beyond the limited disclosures in the
       specification, and thus the claim is overbroad or an impermissible

       Monaco and Eurasia was not provided.
</p>

<p id="p_61">34.    Glenmark‟s challenges, thus, can be grouped into five categories
which will be helpful for the purposes of this discussion. The first is that the
patent monopoly is too broad to be workable (the Markush plea); it includes
possibly 4.9 billion compounds and such elastic claims cannot be sustained;
the second is - on the basis of claim construction of the suit patent, and
subsequent patent application filed by MSD for SPM specifically - that the
claims in this patent do not disclose SPM or the Sitagliptin free base, but
only Sitagliptin Hcl; the third is that even if the Sitagliptin free base is
disclosed, it is unstable in itself and not industrially applicable. The fourth
challenge is that the patent is anticipated by prior art, specifically European
Patent 1406622 and WO/01/34594; and finally, that several facts crucial to
the decision of the Patent Office were suppressed by MSD, rendering the




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                          Page 26
 grant void, and at the very least, indicating an absence of good faith in
pursuing the present interim injunction application.
</p><p id="p_62">35.    If the patent is found to be valid and covering SPM, the matter ends
there; infringement is established. If, however, the suit patent is found to be
valid, but only disclosing Sitagliptin free base rather than SPM, the
alternative defence is that Glenmark‟s drug still does not infringe the MSD‟s
patent because it "neither uses Sitagliptin base or Sitagliptin Hydrochloride
salt as a raw material nor is it generated or formed as an intermediate in the
manufacturing process". Besides, Glenmark also argues that SPM is
qualitatively different from the Sitagliptin free base - it has enhanced
pharmaceutical qualities. This, according to Glenmark, means that the
manufacture of SPM does not violate a patent for the Sitagliptin free base
simpliciter.
</p><p id="p_63">36.    With this background in place, the Court will first consider the prima
facie validity of MSD‟s cause of action, and conversely, Glenmark‟s
counter-claim. At the outset, the Court notes that although the patent has
been granted in this case, its validity cannot be presumed. <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_32">The Act</a> envisages
revocation of patents based on subsequent opposition, and the patentee
cannot claim immunity from defending the validity of the patent. The
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1905157/" id="a_33">Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam v. Hindustan Metal
Industries</a>, (1979) 2 SCC 511, rejected any presumption of validity inhering
in granted patents:

        or the decision rendered by the Controller in the case of
        opposition, does not guarantee the validity of the patent, which
        can be challenged before the High Court on various grounds
        in revocation or infringement proceedings. It is pertinent to




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                          Page 27

<p id="p_64">37.    Though that case concerned a presumption at the stage of final

<p id="p_65">38.    Construction of the patent by this court, to verify its coverage is
fundamental. This coverage depends on the nature of the claims made (and
enabling disclosures specified) by MSD in its „Complete Specification‟
under Form 2 of the Act. The words used to describe the claims - as read by
a person of ordinary skill in the art -determine the breadth of the monopoly
granted by the patent, for which the substantive (and indeed, substantial)
rights under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_39">Section 48</a> of the Act are triggered. The „Field of the Invention‟
described by MSD in Form 2 states that the patent is "directed to
pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of
these compounds and compositions." The issue is how far these
compositions can be subsumed within the „core‟ of the patent, without




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 28
 precise enabling disclosures; in other words, how elastic can the Court read
the claims to be. The section „Detailed Description of the Invention‟, which
discloses Formula 1 (reproduced below), corresponds to claim 1 of the
patent specification, discloses the following compound structure:
</p>



<p id="p_66">39.      This is the Sitagliptin free base. Each element of this structure, and
selection of particular elements to reach this structure, is further detailed at
pages 5 and 6 of the specification. Page 10 further details the separation of
racemix mixtures of the compound to isolate individual enantiomers,
including the R form of the compound that is ultimately used in Januvia and
Janumet. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" - it is stated -
"refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases
or acids including" inter alia phosphoric acid, which is the second element
in SPM (i.e. the P in SPM). The M - or monohydrate - is indicated by
stating that "salts ... may also be in the form of hydrates." (page 10 of the
Form 2 filing) The compound indicated in Formula 1 - it is further stated
and reiterated - "are meant to also include pharmaceutically acceptable
salts" (page 11 of the Form 2 filing). Revealingly, the specification then
notes:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_67">40.    As was argued at great length by MSD's Senior Counsel, the invention
relates to the Sitagliptin free base, which is the active component with
therapeutic value, i.e. DPP inhibitor. The salt (phosphate, HCL, or any
other) is only the inert carrier that assists in the proper administration of the
drug in the body, but does not in itself have any therapeutic value. Rather,
the stability of the compound is ensured by the accompanying salt, though
the HCL salt (as the specification itself notes) is less stable and not fit for
manufacture, as compared to the stable and efficient phosphate salt (SPM).
</p><p id="p_68">41.    This Court notes that the Form 2 filing discloses the structure for the
Sitagliptin free base in Formula 1, at page 5. The invention in this case
discloses several compounds, and
        "[s]everal methods for preparing the compounds ... are
        illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                          Page 30
         materials are made according to procedures known in the art
        ..."
</p>
<p id="p_69">       In line with this, Scheme 6 - after demonstrating six rounds of
reactions combining known compounds and detailing reaction conditions -
again discloses the Sitagliptin free base. Starting from the general
knowledge of a person skilled in the art, the compounds created through
Schemes 1-5 are utilized in Scheme 6 to reach the Sitagliptin free base -
which is the essence of the invention in this case. Scheme 6 is reproduced
below, with the free base marked as „I‟.
</p>



<p id="p_70">42.    The Intermediate 13 is Sitagliptin with a protecting „BOC‟ group
(represented by P), which, on deprotection in the condition and manner




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                     Page 31
 described results in the Sitagliptin free base. The entire process is described,
and thus disclosed, in the accompanying paragraph as below:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "Intermediates II and III are coupled under standard peptide
        coupling conditions, for example, using Iethyl-3-(3
        dimethylaminopropyl)        carbodiimide     (EDC),      I   -
        hydroxybcnzotriazole (HOBT), arid a base, generally
        diisopropylethylamine, in a solvent such as N,N-
        dimethylformamide (DMF) or dicloromethane for 3 to 48
        hours at ambient temperature to provide intermediate 13 as
        shown in Scheme 6. The protecting group is then removed
        with, for example, trifluoroacetic acid or methanolic hydrogen
        chloride in the case of Boc to give the desired amine „I‟. The
        product is purified from unwanted side products, if necessary,
        by recrystallization, tritluration, preparative thin layer
        chromatography, flash chromatography on silica gel as
        described by ..." (emphasis supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_71">43.    The „desired amine‟ (amines being organic compounds and functional
groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair) referred is the
end product in Scheme 6, which is the Sitagliptin free base. This is also the
compound structure reflected in Claim 1, which is not protected by the BOC
group. Subsequently, examples "are provided so that the invention might be
more fully understood." Example 7 - on which both parties placed reliance -
discloses the HCL salt of Sitagliptin, which is arrived at by treating the BOC
protected Sitagliptin, so as to substitute the BOC group with the HCL salt.
This is represented below:

<p id="p_72">FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 32
        Therefore, page 48 of the Specification - on the basis of the various
examples provided - lists the reactions carried out and the possible variants
for each element in the Sitagliptin free base, without the salt element (HCL,
       phosphate                          or                          others).

</p><p id="p_74"> 44.    Thus, detailed lists of possible variants in the Sitagliptin free base for
each element involved - based on experiments conducted - are provided.
The emphasis, here, is on the free base itself (which is the active therapeutic
ingredient), and not the accompanying salt.
</p><p id="p_75">45.    Glenmark argued that the patent does not disclose the Sitagliptin free
base or SPM, but only the Sitagliptin HCL salt. This is because - it is argued
</p><p id="p_76">- that apart from a routine mention of treating Sitagliptin with phosphate, no
real disclosure concerning SPM was made. Further, whilst Claim 1 (of the
patent) does claim the Sitagliptin free base, it is argued that in Example 7,
the only disclosure is as regards the BOC protected Sitagliptin, and not the
free base itself. Since the claim is not matched by the disclosure, it is argued
it (the claim) cannot be the basis of the monopoly. Only those products that
are disclosed may be claimed, asserts Glenmark. Glenmark also argues that




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                         Page 34
 Sitagliptin, Sitalgiptin Hcl and SPM have different physical and chemical
properties, and a disclosure of one cannot cover the others.
</p><p id="p_77">46.    The Court notes that mere claims, without an enabling disclosure,
cannot be sustained. The patent must - as a quid pro quo for the grant of
monopoly - enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to work the invention
as claimed. This crucial principle was considered by the Supreme Court in
Novartis AG (supra):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "139. The dichotomy that is sought to be drawn between
        coverage or claim on the one hand and disclosure or
        enablement or teaching in a patent on the other hand, seems to
        strike at the very root of the rationale of the law of patent.
        Under the scheme of patent, a monopoly is granted to a
        private individual in exchange of the invention being made
        public so that, at the end of the patent term, the invention may
        belong to the people at large who may be benefited by it. To
        say that the coverage in a patent might go much beyond the
        disclosure thus seem to negate the fundamental rule
        underlying the grant of patents."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">47.    The court consequently, has to inquire into whether the Sitagliptin
free base and further SPM were disclosed sufficiently for a sustainable
patent claim. The Court first notes that Schemes 1-5 begin with compounds
known in the art, and through a series of reactions, results in Intermediate 13
in Scheme 6, which is the BOC protected Sitagliptin free base. This - on
deprotection13 in the second reaction in Scheme 6 - leads to the removal of
the BOC group and leaves only the Sitagliptin free base. Each of those

 reactions are accompanied with detailed notes on the manner and process in
which they are to be carried out, and at each instance, either use a compound
already known in the art (and stated to be so), or disclosed in the schemes
itself. The end product - the Sitagliptin free base - is precisely the claim
made in Claim 1. Claim 1 represents a general formula for the complex
chemical structure, which is further exemplified in the further claims (and
all of which can be reached through the table at page 48 of the specification
disclosed above). Specifically, and important for the present purpose, this
includes Claim 19, which is the specific Sitagliptin free base (within the
various possibilities under the general structure in Claim 1 that corresponds
to Formula 1). This is reproduced below:

<p id="p_80">48.    At this juncture, the Court notes that
        "the construction of claims is not something that can be
        considered in isolation from the rest of the specification,
        Claims are intended to be pithy delineations of the scope of
        monopoly, and they are drafted in light of the much more
        detailed text of the description. A specification must be read as
        a whole, just as any document is. It must moreover be read as
        having been addressed to a person acquainted with the
        technology in question. So it must take account of that
        person‟s state of knowledge at the time."

 (see, Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin, Intellectual Property, Seventh Ed, Sweet
and Maxwell, pages 182-3, "Cornish"). Those to whom the above claims,
examples and schemes are directed are not judges, ably assisted by lawyers;
they are "persons of ordinary skill in the art". This was stated long ago in
Hinks &amp; Son v Safety Lighting Co 1876 (4) Ch.D 607 when it was held that
patent claims are "addressed not to the public generally, but to persons
skilled in the particular art." Likewise, this was stated again in Tubes Ltd v.
Perfecta Seamless Steel, 1902 (20) RPC:

<p id="p_82">       While reading a patent claim, therefore, the Court must not reinvent
the wheel and mandate disclosures of techniques and product rehearsed in

</p><p id="p_85"> 50.    In this case, from known compounds, prima facie, the Sitagliptin free
base is disclosed. As it is a free base, a pure form of an amine, as opposed to
a salt form, this naturally does not include particular salts, whether
phosphates, hydrochlorides or any other. The elements of the free base -
since many alternatives exist - are then also detailed in the above table.
Conspicuously - and this is not denied by Glenmark- the free base must be
transformed into a salt form before it can be administrated to patients (with
the salt acting as the carrier). Unsurprisingly the free base requires a further
appropriate reaction to create that salt. The argument that at no point is the
free base disclosed (and only salt forms, though still not the phosphate salt
form, SPM) lacks prima facie substance. First, Scheme 6, read with the table
above, discloses the free base, which is claimed in Claim 1, and specifically,
Claim 19. In each of these specifications, Sitagliptin is found as a free base,
without any attached salt. Two, the Court has to look to the invention in this
case, and not read the claims literally. The invention in this case is a DPP
inhibitor which assists control and prevention of diabetes by regulating
insulin production, and specifically, inhibiting the DPP-IV enzyme activity.
The claims and disclosures made, should be seen in the light of the invention
underlying the patent and sought to be disclosed. In this case, the active
therapeutic component is the Sitagliptin free base (which is delivered into
the body with an attached salt that wears away once in the system), and not
the attaching phosphate, Hcl or other carriers. No doubt such carrier salts are
needed to deliver the drug into the body, and the salt must contain certain
crucial properties that allow for the drug to be administrated properly
(solubility, flow issues, propensity for adhesion, poor filtration, drying etc.)
This is recognized in the statement of the inventor, Mr. Robert M. Wenslow




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 38
 Jr, as well in determining the best method for administration (on which
Glenmark relies in its written submissions); but there too, the active
therapeutic ingredient remains the Sitagliptin free base, and that product is
sufficiently disclosed in Form 2 filed by MSD. It seems, that Sitagliptin free
base's activity, prima facie, on the DPP enzyme is not naturally affected by
the attached salt; those properties remain, though the efficacy of
administration is dependent in part upon the carrier. The Sitagliptin free
base, previously unknown as a compound that could affect the activity of the
DPP enzyme is a new and arguably, a novel addition. It is in that context -
and in the shoes of that notional addressee who is working in that field of
pharmaceuticals - that the technical contribution has to be seen.
</p>
<p id="p_86">51.    The Court here is aware of the fact that claims must not be imaginary,
and must not leave anything unarticulated that require further research by
those skilled in the art. Nor is there any principle that patent specifications
be interpreted in favour of validity where an ambiguity exists (see,
SmithKline Beecham‟s (Paroxetine Anhydrate) Patent, [2003] RPC (49) 855
(CA)). To constitute prior disclosure of an invention, the matter relied upon
as prior art must disclose subject matter which, if performed, would
necessarily result in infringement of the patent. This infringement test is

</blockquote><p id="p_88">52.    The next question that arises is whether SPM too is disclosed in the
suit patent. This is a vexed question on which learned counsel for both
parties have stressed. SPM is not found in any of the claims, nor is it




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                         Page 40
 specified in the schemes or examples. The only reference to it is generally at
page 9 of the Form 2 filing where a phosphate salt is mentioned as a possible
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt". MSD argues that since the active
ingredient is disclosed, it covers all acceptable salts and since the matter and
process of their production is known in the art, it need not be rehearsed for
every possible salt. Glenmark, on the other hand, claims that SPM is not
covered by the suit patent, and that SPM is qualitatively different from the
Sitagliptin free base. Moreover, considerable emphasis was placed on the
abandonment         of   a   subsequent     patent    application    in    India
(5948/DELNP/2005) where SPM was claimed as a novel addition to the suit
patent. That application was ultimately withdrawn by MSD on account of
failure to reply to the First Examination Report. MSD claims that it
withdrew its application on the basis of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_44">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act - which it
describes as a provision peculiar to Indian law - that would have been fatal
to that patent application. However MSD claims that SPM is adequately
disclosed as a possible pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Sitagliptin, the
active ingredient, amongst the various options.
</p><p id="p_89">53.    This Court notes that there is a serious technical dispute here that is to
be tried. Glenmark claims that SPM was not disclosed by a generic reference
to phosphate salts; MSD says that such a disclosure is sufficient for the
carrier salts. Glenmark claims that SPM is qualitatively (physically and
chemically) different from the Sitagliptin free base; MSD states otherwise.
Glenmark claims that the production of SPM from Sitagliptin was not an
obvious step to those skilled in the art (since treatment of Sitagliptin with
Phosphoric Acid can result in not one, but three, possible salts); MSD argues
that this would have been known in the industry. These are technical




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                         Page 41
 disputes that would quite possibly require a detailed examination of expert
evidence. It would be worthwhile noticing at this stage that phosphate salts
are also known as pharmaceutical elements.14 The Court does not (and
indeed, cannot) go into these questions, where guess work and speculation
would be the only guiding factors. Nor can the Court, at this stage, decide
the question of whether or not <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_45">Section 3(d)</a> of the Patent Act (which,
according to MSD, was the basis of its withdrawal) would have been
attracted.
</p><p id="p_90">54.     It is relevant at this stage to notice that <a href="/doc/1217727/" id="a_46">Section 10</a> of the Act stipulates
the manner in which a claim must be made. Under <a href="/doc/1169723/" id="a_47">Section 10(4)(b)</a>,
"[e]very complete specification shall - ... (b) disclose the best method of
performing the invention which is known to the applicant and for which he is
entitled to claim protection." It is clear that SPM was not specifically
disclosed in the suit patent, apart from a generic reference as a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The process of arriving at SPM from the
Sitagliptin free base and SPM‟s precise chemical structure were not
disclosed specifically in the suit patent. However, the Sitagliptin HCL salt
was disclosed specifically in Example 7. MSD admits however, as is also
confirmed by the statement of the inventor, that the "morphology [of
Sitagliptin HCL] is not desirable for solid dosage formulations due to flow
issues ..." It is admitted that this property of the HCL salt "is
disadvantageous for solid dosage formulations since the loss of water can
lead to a phase change." This is "undesirable in a drug product due to

  Phosphate salts refers to many different combinations of the chemical phosphate with salts and
minerals     and      are     used      for    pharmaceutical      products.               (Ref.
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/735.html)




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                                       Page 42
 possible chemical stability issues." Essentially, the HCL salt - which is
specifically disclosed in the Form 2 filing - has issues and cannot be used
for the commercial drug. SPM (the phosphate salt) however has no such
issues; it can be, and is, used in both parties‟ commercial drugs. The Court
notes that if SPM is a „better‟ formulation than the HCL salt, and it was
known at the time of the filing of the patent (as MSD claims), it must have
been disclosed under <a href="/doc/1169723/" id="a_48">Section 10(4)(b)</a>. It was not; whilst the precise
chemical structure and reaction for reaching the HCL salt was detailed, SPM
was not. The clear inference is thus that the phosphate salt was unknown to
the inventor at the time (or perhaps that it was known, but not disclosed -
which is a breach of the statutory good faith obligation in <a href="/doc/1217727/" id="a_49">Section 10</a>). In
such a case, the case could tilt against MSD as regards the coverage of SPM
in the patent. Indeed, at trial the serious factual disputes indicated above -
that are determinative of this claim - will be considered and evidence
produced. This Court cannot today answer whether a person skilled in the art
would have known the phosphate salt as an obvious alternative such that its
specific disclosure was not needed. [In the absence of evidence to that
effect, a prima facie view through the lens of the legal obligation under
<a href="/doc/1169723/" id="a_50">Section 10(4)(b)</a> cannot be taken. To put it the other way, it is not patent that
<a href="/doc/1217727/" id="a_51">Section 10</a> (4)(b) stood breached, disentitling MSD for interim relief.]
</p><p id="p_91">55.    Accordingly, questions of whether the abandonment of SPM in the
subsequent patent application (5948/DELNP/2005) affects the claim of SPM
in the suit patent assumes lesser importance. The Court at the same time,
notes that the claim construction to determine the coverage in the suit patent
is to be determined objectively on its own terms with regard to the words
used by the inventor and the context of the invention in terms of knowledge




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                         Page 43
 existing in the industry. The subsequent abandonment of a patent for SPM
cannot remove what is patented earlier (if an objective reading, as indicated
above, considers it to be included); nor can it include something that was
excluded earlier. The motives for abandonment - since MSD claims that it
abandoned the claim due to <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_52">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act - play no part in the
claim construction. Considerable argument was addressed to the Court on
this aspect; learned Senior Counsel for MSD argued that the subsequent
patent was abandoned because of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_53">Section 3(d)</a>, as SPM had not enhanced
therapeutic value and would not be granted an independent patent but be
included in the original patent as well (thus arguing the concept of „basic‟
and „improvement‟ patent); Glenmark urged that this would be contrary to
the purpose of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_54">Section 3(d)</a> - whilst improvements in patents not disclosed
in the patent application are hit by that section, this does not mean that they
are included in the original patent. These arguments make the construction
of the claim dependant on the scope of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_55">Section 3(d)</a> vis-à-vis improvements
to basic patents.
</p><p id="p_92">56.    <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_56">Section 3(d)</a> does not work backwards, such that two independent
patent claims are to be construed in reference to each other. Each claim is
regulated by its own terms, subject to the statutory prescriptions of inventive
step and industrial applicability. Moreover, such an argument also
introduces an undeserved subjectivity in the patent construction process. A
patent is construed by reference to the words used by the inventor, and not
her subjective intent as to what was meant to be covered (as was noted in
Kirin-Amgen Inc and Others v. Hoechst Marion Roussel Limited and
Others, [2004] UKHL 46, "[t]here is no window into the mind of the
patentee or the author of any other document. Construction is objective in




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 44
 the sense that it is concerned with what a reasonable person to whom the
utterance was addressed would have understood the author to be using the
words to mean."]. Merely because an inventor applies for a later patent -
that is already objectively included in a prior patent, but which the inventor
subjectively feels needs a separate patent application - does not mean that it
is taken to be at face value. The intent of the inventor, through the use of the
words that have been employed, must be judged, but the subjective intent
cannot replace a detailed analysis of the text of the patent. This Court has
already noted - on a different basis - that the coverage of SPM in the suit
patent is questionable on account of <a href="/doc/1169723/" id="a_57">Section 10(4)(b)</a>, although the issue is
ultimately tied to important factual disputes. The same decision significantly
provided the following rationale for patent construction in terms of the
words and expressions used:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "The courts of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and
        Germany certainly discourage, if they do not actually prohibit,
        use of the patent office file in aid of construction. There are
        good reasons: the meaning of the patent should not change
        according to whether or not the person skilled in the art has
        access to the file and in any case life is too short for the
        limited assistance which it can provide. It is however
        frequently impossible to know without access, not merely to
        the file but to the private thoughts of the patentee and his
        advisors as well, what the reason was for some apparently
        inexplicable limitation in the extent of the monopoly claimed.
        One possible explanation is that it does not represent what the
        patentee really meant to say. But another is that he did mean
        it, for reasons of his own; such as wanting to avoid arguments
        with the examiners over enablement or prior art and have his
        patent granted as soon as possible. This feature of the
        practical life of a patent agent reduces the scope for a
        conclusion that the patentee could not have meant what the
        words appear to be saying."

 This Court is furthermore also cautious of using either <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_58">Section 3(d)</a> or the
abandonment of a subsequent patent application to read into the terms of a
prior application which has to be construed on its own terms. Accordingly,
while the coverage of SPM is shrouded in some uncertainty that requires
detailed examination of facts and evidence, the Court notes that the
Sitagliptin free base is prima facie disclosed, claimed and thus covered by
the suit patent.
</blockquote><p id="p_93">57.    The Court notes here that Glenmark, - in its pleadings and also during
the course of oral arguments - emphasized that the suit patent is a Markush
claim that is overbroad, ambiguous and attempts to create a false monopoly
for compounds that have not been disclosed. For this reason, the
insufficiency of the disclosure, it is argued that the suit patent is invalid. It is
stated that the suit patent covers 4.9 billion possible combinations of
compounds, 372.4 billion possible combinations of compound salts, and that
such a patent - which lays claims to anonymous compounds, so to speak -
cannot be granted patent protection, which is meant only for inventions that
have been fully disclosed. The objection is- to borrow the phrase felicitously
used by the UK Court of Appeal in Dr Reddy's Laboratories (UK) Ltd v Eli
Lilly &amp; Company Ltd [2009] EWCA (Civ) 1362:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">        "you must not only pull out a plum but you must disclose that

<p id="p_94">58.    As the Draft Guidelines for Examination of Patent Applications in the
Field of Pharmaceuticals by the Office of the Controller General of Patents,
Designs and Trademarks note:
</p>



<p id="p_95">FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                            Page 46
         "Often broad ("generic") patent claims are drafted covering a
        family of a large number (sometimes thousands or millions) of
        possible compounds. The so-called „Markush claims‟ refer to a
        chemical structure with a plurality of functionally equivalent
        chemical groups in one or more parts of the compound."
</p>
<p id="p_96">59.    The suit patent does claim all pharmaceutically acceptable salts of
Sitaglptin, and is undoubtedly a „Markush‟ claim. As the Guidelines further
note, "Markush claims may invoke the question of sufficiency and plurality
of distinct groups of inventions surrounding such claims." That is precisely
the basis of Glenmark‟s challenge to the suit patent. Drafting of claims is
essentially an exercise in imagining alternate forms for an inventive idea.
Cornish notes (at page 181), the question is what is "legitimate
generalization"? Whilst it may be appealing at first blush to limit a
pharmaceutical patent only to the exact and precise compounds and
chemical structures disclosed, that may render genuine medical inventions to
naught. Patents cannot be construed so broadly so as to risk granting the
patentee an unduly broad monopoly, but equally, one must not construe
them narrowly and risk allowing competitors pick the closest imitation and
frustrate the monopoly. Such broad claims - or even amendments limiting
them later - have not been permitted as being "covetous" (John William
Howlett); wide and indeterminate or vague claims are construed as
insufficient (Rf. Eastman Kodak (supra)). The answer - the via media - lies
in determining the context of the industry involved, the nature of the
technical contribution and whether the crux of the invention is reflected in
the combinations claimed. This is the approach of the English Courts as well




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 47
 when they refer to the rule of "purposive construction" of patent claims. As
the House of Lords noted in Kirin-Amgen (supra):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">        "33. In the case of a patent specification, the notional
        addressee is the person skilled in the art. He (or, I say once
        and for all, she) comes to a reading of the specification with
        common general knowledge of the art. And he reads the
        specification on the assumption that its purpose is to both to
        describe and to demarcate an invention -a practical idea
        which the patentee has had for a new product or process -and
        not to be a textbook in mathematics or chemistry or a shopping
        list of chemicals or hardware. It is this insight which lies at the
        heart of "purposive construction" ... The purpose of a patent
        specification, as I have said, is no more nor less than to
        communicate the idea of an invention."</blockquote>

<p id="p_97">       Again, speaking of the seemingly limitless possibilities which a
pharma patent claim might comprehend, that decision stated this:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">        "46. As techniques improved and amounts of data became
        more substantial it became possible to do better than ESTs. It
        was possible to identify from published sequence data full
        length nucleotide sequences for proteins. Once that is done
        you can deduce the amino acid sequence of the protein
        encoded. And you should be able to make it (the details of how
        do not matter). But, unlike the days of wet-lab techniques
        (where you knew it at the outset), you do not know what
        function the protein has.</blockquote>

<p id="p_98">       47. Even at that stage, however, it is more than reasonable to
       suppose that it has some biological function - after all the body
       is carrying the gene for it. One can say in general terms that if
       there is a disease or condition involving a deficiency of the
       protein then it may be treatable with it. Or if there is a disease
       or condition caused by overproduction of the protein it may be
       treatable with an antibody to the protein. So in a very general
       sense one can say there is probably an application for the
       protein or its antibodies. As will be seen, however, that is not




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                             Page 48
        good enough to make the protein or its antibodies patentable.
       You have to say something more about their proposed use than
       they will probably be useful in medicine, though that is very
       likely to be so. The question in general is how much more you
       need to say and how reliable what you say needs to be.
</p><p id="p_99">         48. Without in vitro and ultimately in vivo assays, you cannot
         definitely know what the protein you have discovered actually
         does. However even before that stage it may, in the case of
         some proteins, be possible to make an informed guess. This
         can be done by seeing how closely the amino-acid sequence of
         your newly identified protein resembles the amino-acid
         sequence of a known protein or "family" of proteins. You look
         for homology between your protein and the known protein or
         family of proteins. If there is some degree of
         homology and you know or can predict reasonably well what
         the known family member(s) do then you can hazard a guess
         that your unknown one does something like it or them.
</p>
<p id="p_100">        49. Of course how likely it is that your guess will turn out to
        be true depends on a host of factors, for instance how
        homologous your protein sequence is to the other protein
        sequence(s), how specific the action of the known protein or
        family of proteins is known to be and how specific your
        surmise as to its function is. No doubt other factors also come

Markush patent may be invalid if the ambiguity is writ large, or the patent
can itself be valid, but in case of infringement, the question may arise
whether the Markush claim also covers a particular combination. Here, it
may be noticed that MSD's claim firstly addresses the objective of the
invention ("field") being towards compounds that are inhibitors of "the
dipeptidyl peptidase -IV enzyme ("DPP-IV inhibitors") and which are useful
in the treatment or prevention of diseases in which the dipetidyl peptidase IV

can result in hypoglycaemia. It flags the need for a new compound as DPP-

acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganics or organic bases,

also additionally discloses SPM; that question is left open. In this case, as
noted the patent sufficiently discloses the Sitagliptin free base, which in
itself is clear, precise and passes the triple test for patentability (novelty,
inventive step and industrial application). Accordingly, prima facie the
Markush patent in this case sufficiently discloses the active ingredient and to
that extent is valid. Secondly, in view of these observations, the question
whether the suit patent sufficiently discloses a particular combination (out of
the billions it claims to cover) may arise on a case to case basis, on
considering whether the combination has a different use, action, function,
chemical structure or value as to take it out of the coverage. For the limited
issue in these interim hearings, the Court notes - without the benefit of
evidence - that the Markush formula and all combinations (including SPM)
"share a common use or property" and "share common structure" - factors
relevant to determine the validity of a Markush patent, under the Draft
Guidelines. Accordingly, the ambiguity alleged by Glenmark does not in the
view of this Court imply prima facie invalidity. This section may be best
completed by the following fitting observations of the UK Court in

        as contended by Glenmark?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">62.    In view of the observations and prima facie determination that the
Sitagliptin free base is covered, the Court now proposes to deal with the
alternative argument advanced by Glenmark that the Sitagliptin free base in
itself as opposed to SPM has no industrial application, and the patent is
liable to be revoked under <a href="/doc/1378958/" id="a_59">Section 64(1)(g)</a> of the Act. Glenmark argues that
the free base is in itself unstable and cannot be administered as a commercial
drug. According to Glenmark,


        "[i]n so far as efficacy in the suit patent is concerned, only a
        general statement has been made to the effect that the
        compounds (which are billions in number) of the invention as
        detailed in the impugned suit patent have utility in treating and
        preventing a large number of diseases without actually giving
        any specific IC50 values for individual diseases. This when
        read along with the various admissions in the SPM patent its
        prosecution history establishes that neither Sitagliptin nor
        SHCL are capable of being used for pharmaceutical
        development. Thus, the suit patent lacks Industrial
        Applicability." (emphasis in original)

</blockquote><p id="p_104">63.    In order to address the industrial applicability of the suit patent, the
Court must consider the utility and usefulness of Sitagliptin. The patent
specification is the best starting point for this exercise, since it itself
discloses certain utility. The specification notes that




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                           Page 53
         "the utility of the compounds in accordance with the present
        invention as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme
        activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the
        art." (page 13)

       It is further disclosed that
        "[i]n particular, the compounds of the following examples had
        activity in inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme in the
        aforementioned assays, generally with an IC50 of less than
        about 1 uM." (page 14)

</p><p id="p_105">64.    Based on the functions of the DPP-IV enzyme, it is claimed that "the
subject compounds are useful in a method for the prevention or treatment of
the following diseases, disorders and conditions", which - as indicated in
pages 14-18 of the specification - includes type 2 diabetes, obesity, growth
hormone deficiency, intestinal injury, HIV infection, neuronal disorder,
osteoporosis, sperm motility and a host of other conditions. Further, possible
manners of administration (oral, rectal etc.) are detailed, as also the
recommended dosage based on body weight and other factors. The
specification - while dealing with the industrial applicability - also
recognizes that the compounds may be combined with other compounds for
effective delivery. Specifically, it notes at page 21:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">        "The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of
        the compounds of this invention may conveniently be presented
        in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the
        methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods
        include the step of bringing the active ingredient into
        association with the carrier which constitutes one or more
        accessory ingredients. in general, the pharmaceutical
        compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                          Page 54
         bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid
        carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if
        necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation, in
        the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is
        included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect
        upon the process or condition of diseases." (emphasis
        supplied)

</blockquote><p id="p_106">65.    The description of industrial applicability is of the "active ingredient",
i.e. Sitagliptin, instead of any individual compound, for example, a salt. It is
contemplated that the active ingredient - which refers to the chemical that
results in the therapeutic effect - will be combined with a carrier of some
form. The essential focus of the specification therefore is the industrial
application of the main therapeutic agent, or simply, the invention. There is
also an implicit admission that while it is the active ingredient - Sitagliptin
free base - that has a medical value in managing certain diseases and
conditions, it will be accompanied by a carrier that has no therapeutic value.
</p><p id="p_107">66.    It is in such context that the Court should consider the question
whether the disclosed invention, Sitagliptin free base, has industrial
application. <a href="/doc/34802049/" id="a_60">Section 2(1)(ac)</a> defines the phrase "capable of industrial
application" as an invention capable of being made or used in an industry.
The issue is whether Sitagliptin can be used in the medical industry. Quite
certainly, in view of the facts disclosed above, it provides a therapeutic
effect for various medical diseases and conditions as the DPP-IV inhibitor.
The real issue raised by Glenmark is that since Sitagliptin simpliciter cannot
be administered, it has no real application.
</p><p id="p_108">67.    This Court notes that a "specification must be read as a whole, just as
any document is" (Cornish at 183). The role of the specification is to teach




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                         Page 55
 (i.e written description) what the invention is and the method of making and
using it (i.e enablement). While the claim (claims 1 and 19) disclose the
Sitagliptin free base, the description relating to the issue of industrial
applicability recognizes that the Sitagliptin free base will be attached to
some carrier. That carrier, however, is not the crux of the invention, but only
an inert component that does not add value to the therapeutic or medical
value, which is the true core of the invention. It would be a far cry to hold
that Sitagiptin "is useless for any known purpose" (Chiron Corp v Murex
Diagnostics Ltd and Other, [1996] RPC 535). Sitagliptin was not known
before, and its introduction allows for the inhibition of the DPP-IV enzyme
in such a manner as previously unknown. It can - in that sense - be used,
whether through one inert carrier or another.
</p><p id="p_109">68.    The claim has thus moved from speculation to inventive perception to
the utility of the compound. As the UK Court of Appeal noted in Eli Lily v.
Human Genome Sciences, [2001] EWCA 33, there is "a real prospect of
exploitation ... derivable directly from the specification". „Directly‟, the
Court clarified, here means in a straightforward manner, without
undertaking further research. Whilst manufacturers may determine which
salt carries the active component the best - those carriers do not      in any
manner affect the therapeutic working of the active component itself. In
other terms, "what is disclosed must make it plausible that the invention
claimed will result in practical exploitation in an industry", especially given
the precise detail as to the manner of administration, dosage, list of diseases
and disorders that will be implicated etc. Four important elements were
identified by the Court of Appeal, in its discussion regarding industrial
application, which an article claiming patent had to fulfil:
</p>



<p id="p_110">FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                       Page 56
</p><p id="p_111">        i) The patent must disclose "a practical application" and "some
       profitable use" for the claimed substance, so that the ensuing
       monopoly "can be expected [to lead to] some ... commercial
       benefit";
</p><p id="p_112">        ii) A "concrete benefit", namely the invention‟s "use ... in industrial
       practice" must be "derivable directly from the description", coupled
       with common general knowledge;
</p><p id="p_113">        iii) A merely "speculative" use will not suffice, so "a vague and
       speculative indication of possible objectives that might or might not
       be achievable" will not do;
</p><p id="p_114">        iv) The patent and common general knowledge must enable the
       skilled person "to reproduce" or "exploit" the claimed invention
       without "undue burden", or having to carry out "a research
       programme";
</p><p id="p_115">69.    On a fair application of the above principles, as explained above, it is
concluded that prima facie there is a concrete basis for recognizing that the
contribution of the suit patent could lead to practical application in the
industry. As long as Sitagliptin is recognized to have a therapeutic effect in
humans, it is practically applicable, even if it is not commercially successful
due to an ineffective carrier, unless naturally the claim is made that the
active ingredient is incapable of being coupled with a carrier - a submission
that is not advanced. In such cases of pharmaceutical compounds, if the
function of the compound is disclosed, and that function is useful in the
medical industry, it is industrially applicable. The utility here refers to the
function alleged to be performed by the compound, which in this case is the
inhibition of the DPP-IV enzyme - clearly a beneficial addition to the




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 57
 medical industry that has been used as a fictional ingredient.           Justice
Blackwell remarked, "happy the inventor whose patent is infringed‟ for that
is the surest sign that he has devised something of utility and worth."
(<a href="/doc/1625825/" id="a_61">Gillette Industries Limited v. Yeshwant Brothers</a>, (1938) 40 Bom LR 478,
quoting Swan‟s Patents, Designs and Trade Marks).
</p><p id="p_116">70.    It would also be useful to note the observations of the Justice
Ayyangar Committee, quoted with approval by the Supreme Court in
Novartis (supra), that "[p]atent systems are not created in the interest of the
inventor but in the interest of national economy." The industrial applicability
of pharmaceutical patents - where the active component is often supported
by ancillary inert compounds - must therefore be seen in the light of
whether there is a concrete contribution to the medical industry and not just
a pre-emptive claim that "reserve[s] an unexplored field of research for an
applicant" (Max-Planck, European Patent Office, Decision T 0870/04 (May
2005)). Prima facie, as explained above, this does not appear to be merely a
pre-emptive claim, presently.

<p id="p_117">Was Sitagliptin disclosed in prior art- in EP 1406622

</p><p id="p_118">71.    The next challenge to the suit patent is that Sitaglptin was disclosed in
prior art -European Patent 1406622. Glenmark argues that the suit patent is
a "cut and paste job" from these two patents, that also disclose DPP
inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes. The Court notes here that
irrespective of whether the two patents are similar or not, EP 1406622 was
published on 13.01.2003 after the priority date for the suit patent, i.e.
06.07.2001, although the priority date for EP 1406622 is 20.6.2001. It is

 well-established that prior art is judged with reference to material that is
made, published or made public on the priority date of the suit patent. EP
1406622 - published later in time - is not prior art for the suit patent.
</p><p id="p_119">72.       Several   allegations   of   suppression   of    relevant      information,
concealment of subsequent and previous patent applications are urged by
Glenmark. The Court will deal with those issues at this juncture. Glenmark
alleges that MSD did not comply with its obligation under <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_62">Section 8</a> of the
Act to disclose patent applications made for the "same or substantially the
same invention" - it did not disclose 5948/DELNP/2005 (for Sitagliptin
Phosphate       Monohydrate),     1130/DELNP/2006         (Sitagliptin     Phosphate
Anhydrate), 2710/DELNP/2008 (Sitagliptin plus Metformin) or subsequent
international applications for these compounds either. It is argued that such
suppression and concealment - contrary to statutory obligations - results in
the invalidity of the patent, and at any rate, militates against the grant of an
interim injunction that is premised on good faith and complete disclosure.
Even the plaint, it is argued, does not disclose any of these applications.

 well, the words "in any country outside India" are rendered superfluous; if
the legislature had intended for all applications to be disclosed, it would
have omitted those words. This Court is aware that a contrary view was
taken by a Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_85">Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Cipla</a>,
(2009) 40 PTC 125 (DB), where it was noted that Hoffman was under an
obligation to disclose an application made in India as well, because the
Controller cannot be presumed to know of all pending applications as well.
In the opinion of this Court, this reading does not emanate from <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_86">Section 8</a>.
That interlocutory judgment was rendered in the context of a decision
affirming denial of injunction to a patent proprietor; the Division Bench then
appears to have cast an obligation on patent applicants beyond the express
provision of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_87">Section 8</a>. This Court highlights this aspect, because the final
judgment was not based upon non-disclosure; the patent was not cancelled
eventually. The findings of the learned Single Judge in that case interpret
that section in light of its clear text in the following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">        "141. It is, however, to be noted that the necessary ingredients

        India and not the Indian application. Therefore, the expression
        "any other application" should also be read in the context
        with the accompanying words which are "relating to the same

<p id="p_127">       An important element in this discussion is that at an interlocutory

the case, rejection of the claim for temporary injunction on the basis of such
facial understanding regarding non-disclosure of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_100">Section 8</a> would be drastic.
The possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, in cases where breach of the
provision is patent and manifest. In other cases, resting the decision not to
grant interlocutory relief (a powerful interim order, given the length of a
patent infringement trial) entirely based on infraction of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_101">Section 8</a> can
operate harshly - possibly even cause irreparable harm in itself. The non-
disclosure of 5948/DELNP/2005 (Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate),

ray Diffraction Pattern ("XRD") of Sitagliptin free base or SPM. Glenmark
argues that every crystalline compound produces a different pattern in a
technical analysis. XRD discloses the signature/blue print of the said
compound. In the case of crystalline compounds, Glenmark argues that the
established method of identifying a compound is XRD analysis, which MSD
has not filed in this case leading to the confusion between Sitagliptin free




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                          Page 65
 base and SPM - which in its view are different. Glenmark relies on the
decision of the Division Bench in Hoffman La Roche (supra) at paragraph 40
for the proposition that the disclosure of XRD analysis is mandatory:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">     "This Court holds that in an application seeking ad-interim
     injunction in a suit for infringement of patent, it would be
     incumbent on the plaintiffs to make a full disclosure of the
     complete specification of the product whose patent is claimed to
     have been infringed. The plaintiff will also have to disclose to the
     Court the x-ray diffraction data of the product, particularly if it
     is pharmaceutical drug."</blockquote>

<p id="p_129">     In this regard, this Court notes that: first, the view of the Division
Bench does not imply that disclosure of the XRD is mandatory such that it
results in invalidity or revocation of the patent, as Glenmark claims. Such an
interpretation would be tantamount to the impermissible addition of a
separate ground for revocation under <a href="/doc/1499217/" id="a_103">Section 64(1)</a>; and secondly, whilst
XRD may be relevant in various cases to determine the nature of complex
compounds and compare the infringing drug with the patent in question,
there is no universal rule that XRD must be disclosed in all cases as a matter
of rule; rather, this is a scientific matter to be judged by those in the field
and the patent examiner based on the facts of the case and the nature of the
drugs involved. Courts cannot, and are not in a position to, create a blanket
rule of law in this regard. Indeed, it appears that the case in Hoffman
concerned two polymorphs of the drug, Tarceva, A and B, for which the
XRD data was used as tool for differentiation. No question of differentiating
the polymorphs (or two versions of the same structure) arises in this case.
Moreover, the comparison and reading of XRD data - that is primarily if not
exclusively scientific information - is best left to experts, to whom the




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                           Page 66
 Courts cannot look at this stage of interim hearings. Reading of complex
scientific documents in interim hearings is not the Court‟s forte, and it
would be wise to exercise extreme caution.
</p><p id="p_130">79.    In view of this discussion, MSD has established a strong prima facie
case on the merits of the suit claim for the validity of its patent.
Accordingly, a case for the infringement by Glenmark - through its product
Zita - is established since it uses the Sitagliptin free base as the active
component in its chemical formulation. An argument was advanced by
Glenmark during the course of oral hearings that this is not the case since
Zita uses SPM, which is manufactured directly without using the Sitagliptin
free base. The Court is unimpressed with this submission - not only was no
evidence or document adduced to support this plea, but moreover, the
written submission and counter-claim do not in any meaningful manner
disclose such a case. Indeed, Zita - by account of all documents canvassed
before the Court - uses the Sitagliptin free base as the active component i.e.
the DPP inhibitor. Glenmark's explanation that it uses a different process to
produce the infringing article is facially unconvincing. It appears to this
court that the production of Sitagliptin Phosphate would precede use of
MSD's patented article, which entails infringement. Glenmark's US patent
claim (No. US 8,334,385 B2 made on 18-12-2012) states this:

thus infringing MSD's patent. This is irrespective of whether Sitagliptin
phosphate and Sitagliptin are same and are claimed in a single patent. Both

(plaint). The learned single judge, in the impugned judgment noted as much:

     a miniscule advancement could be recognized as an invention."
</p>
<p id="p_136">     MSD's argument regarding infringement however left the single judge
unmoved; he reasoned as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">     "26. The plaintiff in a suit restraining infringement of patent
     ought to have known the defence which the defendant has put
     forth and ought to have met the same in the plaint, as has been
     done in the arguments in rejoinder by arguing on "basic‟ and
     "improvement‟ patents. There is not an iota of pleading on the
     said aspect. The plaintiff, to show that the defendants product, in
     spite of combining Phosphate with patented SITAGLIPTIN,
     medically remained equivalent to SITAGLIPTIN, was expected to
     plead in detail on the aspects of efficacy of SITAGLIPTIN,
     reason for itself combining the same with Phosphate and the role
     of Phosphate being inconsequential in the disease which
     SITAGLIPTIN cures. It was for the plaintiffs to have made a case
     of Sitagliptin Phosphate being merely a new form of
     SITAGLIPTIN which does not result in the enhancement of the
     efficacy of SITAGLIPTIN or being a mere combination of other
     derivatives of SITAGLIPTIN. I am unable to find any pleading of
     the plaintiffs to the said effect. Rather, the plaint proceeds on the
     premise that Sitagliptin Phosphate is the same as SITAGLIPTIN
     but which is not found to be the case of the plaintiffs in its own




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                            Page 70

<blockquote id="blockquote_52">      27. On the contrary it has emerged that the plaintiff Merck itself
      has in USA taken an independent patent for Sitagliptin
      Phosphate and similarly applied in India and which has been
      rejected and while applying for independent patent in Sitagliptin
      Phosphate in USA, India and Europe having claimed it to be a
      new invention and a different product than SITAGLIPTIN."</blockquote>

<p id="p_137">      This is where, with great respect, this Court differs from the approach
of the learned Single Judge. Whether MSD secured a patent for Sitagliptin
Phosphate - but was denied, could not have been a rationale for denying the
inventive step involved in its granted patent, in India. Glenmark entirely
banked on the patent granted to it in the US- which in turn depended on
Sitagliptin as a foundational element.          The use of Sitagliptin without
authorization clearly amounted to infringement - as noted earlier, expressly
enjoined by <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_107">Section 48</a> (a). Thus, prima facie infringement of MSD‟s patent
is established, in the opinion of this Court.
</p><p id="p_138">80.    Having said this, in this exercise, the Court faces a limitation - the
issues involved require a minute examination of the facts (the patent claim
and its disclosures, prior art, subsequent applications, and the nature of
Glenmark‟s product) which the Court cannot engage in at this stage of
interim hearings. In the usual course, the Court benefits from a full trial with
pleadings and expert evidence, especially in matters as complicated as
pharmaceutical patents; these are absent today, and so, in attempting to
mimic that exercise in determining whether a prima facie case exists, we
must not conduct some sort of „mini-trial‟ (see, <a href="/doc/655601/" id="a_108">Anand Prasad Agarwalla v.
Takeshwar Prasad and Ors</a>., (2001) 5 SCC 568). The conclusions thus




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                          Page 71
 remain in some part tentative. The parties‟ claims have been adjudged as
best as possible at this point in time, but we recognize that the findings are
still open to debate. Importantly, since an interim injunction affects parties‟
legal rights based on a necessarily incomplete legal finding that may
possibly tilt the other way, so to speak, the other two factors - balance of
convenience and presence of an irreparable injury - become all the more
important. They too must be considered in similar detail, though a strong
case of infringement - as established in this case - will no doubt weigh
heavily in the ultimate decision.
</p><p id="p_139">81.    In determining the balance of convenience between the parties and
whether an irreparable injury may result, some observations on the approach
to be adopted by the Court are important. A judge considering the grant of
an interim injunction no doubt has discretion in the matter. As is variously
described, he must exercise it „judiciously‟ or with „care, caution and
circumspection‟. At one extreme, neither mathematical rules nor fixed
formulae can provide the answers; on the other, discretion is not
synonymous with the absence of demonstrable and intricate reason. This
discretion is not a „discretion-at-large‟ - so to speak - that permits judges to
reign free in their interpretation of what is „equitable‟. Rather, certain
equitable principles guide the exercise of that discretion, to which Courts
must be alive. This is not to limit judges‟ discretion in tailoring the decision
and the relief to the facts of each case. That aspect cannot and should not be
underestimated. But these principles must inform a judges‟ analysis and
conversely, the analysis must show how these principles apply to the
particular facts of a given case. Just as the triple-test (judicially created in
<a href="/doc/797639/" id="a_109">American Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd</a>, [1975] AC 396,             and subsequently




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 72
 adopted in Indian law) of a prima facie case, irreparable injury and balance
of convenience has assisted the exercise of judicial discretion, courts must
dig deeper and introduce greater nuance in their analysis by reference to
constantly evolving equitable principles. Mere assertions of doing „equity‟
or maintaining „interests of parties‟ in support of the grant or refusal of
interim relief belies a reasoned and principled decision capable of
contributing to this body of judge made law that so crucially affects parties‟
interests.
</p><p id="p_140">82.    Addressing these principles in the circumstances of the present case,
the Court notes six equitable principles that come into play in this case and
must be considered. First, and this principle is now well established in
Indian jurisprudence, the Court must look at the public interest in granting
an injunction, as access to drugs, especially one for a condition as prevalent
as diabetes, is an important facet of the patent regime. Here, the price
difference between the commercial products sold by Glenmark and MSD is
not so startling as to compel the court to infer that allowing Glenmark to sell
the drug, at depressed prices would result in increased access. Permitting
Glenmark to operate would not necessarily result in lowering of market
prices. Importantly, whilst lower prices may result from competition
amongst two competitors, no allegation has been made that MSD today sells
its drugs at a relatively high price that hinders access to the drug. MSD has
reduced its price by 1/5th from the United States, which shows some
receptivity to the Indian market; Glenmark has not disputed this submission.
</p><p id="p_141">83.    A little digression at this stage with respect to the pharmaceutical
formulation is necessary. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF)
claims to be an umbrella organization of over 230 national diabetes




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                       Page 73
 associations in 170 countries and territories, and represents the interests of
the growing number of diabetics and those at risk. It states, on its website,
(&lt;http://www.idf.org/diabetesatlas/5e/south-east-asia&gt;        accessed           on
17.02.2014) that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">      "Close to one-fifth of all adults with diabetes in the world live in
      the South-East Asia Region. Current estimates indicate that 8.3%
      of the adult population, or 71.4 million people, have diabetes in
      2011, 61.3 million of whom are in India. The number of people
      with diabetes in the region will increase to 120.9 million by
      2030, or 10.2% of the adult population. A further 23.8 million
      people have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in 2011, and this
      will increase to 38.6 million by 2030."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_142">84.    At this stage, the Court must address the issue of public interest in
respect of access to drugs. In the Hoffman La Roche case (supra) at the
interlocutory stage, both at the stage of the Single Judge and the Division
Bench, considerable attention was given to the nature of the drug and the
price differential. The Court also concluded prima facie that the defendant, a
generic manufacturer, had made out a credible defence and a credible
challenge to the validity of the patent. The Court located the public interest
concern in the debate on balance of convenience and noting that the price
differential was about 300% in relation to a life-saving drug (one which
treated lung cancer), held that balance of convenience did not lie in favour
of grant of injunction as the possibility of several thousands using the
generic product being denied access, and consequently their lives, was real.
Such consequence was an in-compensable eventuality. Here, no such
startling consequences are discernible. Diabetes is more of a lifestyle
disorder, which requires management and treatment. The new line of
treatment offered by MSD improves efficient management of the condition




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                            Page 74
 which cannot be termed as life threatening, so as to characterize the patented
product as a life-saving drug (without going into what are life-saving drugs,
because of an element of subjectivity and fact dependence, but recognizing a
broad distinction which is sufficient for the purposes of this case). In this
context, it would be useful to notice that in the World Health Organization's
(WHO's) Model list of Essential medicines, besides three forms of insulin,
"Glibenclamide Tablet: 2.5 mg; 5 mg" and                    "Metformin Tablet: 500 mg
(hydrochloride)" no other drug- including none with any Sitagliptin
combination has been shown.15
</p><p id="p_143">85.       This leads us to the second principle, which is whether the Court can
overlook the public interest in maintaining the integrity of the patent system
itself, so that a legitimate monopoly is not distorted. As this Court noted in
Bayer Corporation and Ors. v. Cipla, Union of India (UOI) and Ors., 162
(2009) DLT 371

        "[i]f, after a patentee, rewarded for his toil - in the form of
        protection against infringement - were to be informed that
        someone, not holding a patent, would be reaping the fruits of his
        efforts and investment, such a result would be destructive of the
        objectives underlying the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_110">Patents Act</a>.".
</p>
<p id="p_144">        The Court must be mindful - especially in a case where a strong case of
infringement is established, as here - there is an interest in enforcing the
Act. It may be argued that despite this no injunction should be granted since
all damages from loss of sales can be compensated monetarily ultimately if
the patentee prevails. This argument though appealing, is to be rejected


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">15</span>
     Ref. http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2011/a95053_eng.pdf?ua=1

 because a closer look at the market forces reveal that the damage can in
some cases be irreparable. This in turn leads to the third principle, which is
where an infringer is allowed to operate in the interim during the trial, it may
result in a reduction in price by that infringer since it has no research and
development expenses to recoup - most revenue becomes profit. The
patentee however can only do so at its peril. Importantly, prices may not
recover after the patentee ultimately prevails, even if it is able to survive the
financial setback (or "hit") during the interim, which may take some time.
The victory for the patentee therefore should not be pyrrhic but real. This
irreparable market effect in cases of a sole supplier of a product has also
triggered the decisions in SmithKline Beecham v. Generics, (2002) 25(1)
IPD 25005 and Smithkline Beecham Plc (2) Glaxosmithkline UK Ltd v.
Apotex, [2003] EWCA Civ L37, where in granting an interim injunction, it
was held that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the plaintiff
since it was the sole supplier of the product. New entrants to the market
would be likely to cause its prices to go into a downward spiral, and Smith
Kline‟s prices may not recover even if it wins eventually. Equally, granting
the injunction would not prejudice Glenmark to an equal extent since - if the
suit is dismissed - it may return to a market that is largely variable.

and the sheer number of patients, from all economic strata of society, the
demand for low-priced medicines will remain, rather than any distortion of
demand due to brand loyalty or a first mover‟s advantage to MSD. As
noticed earlier, the price differential between MSD‟s drug and the infringing
products is 30%, a significant portion of which is due to the customs duty
paid by MSD. Learned senior counsels appearing for MSD had stated that it




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                         Page 76
 would compensate Glenmark for loss of earnings if the suit were to be
dismissed. Thus this arrangement not only ensures that Glenmark will - if
successful - be able to return to the market without any handicap, but
moreover, it will be compensated at market value for the period for which it
was excluded. The balance of convenience thus clearly lies in favour of
MSD.
</p><p id="p_146">87.    A related concern that this Court heeds - the fourth principle
operative in this case - is that of the chronology of events and Glenmark‟s
decision to release Zita without first challenging Januvia or Janumet.
Undoubtedly, the Act creates a right to oppose patents even after grant.
There is no obligation to only utilize the pre or post grant opposition
mechanisms. Neither does a patent benefit from a presumption of validity if
it is challenged in the course of an infringement suit. However, if a
defendant is aware that there may be a possible challenge to its product, but
still chooses to release the drug without first invoking revocation
proceedings or attempting to negotiate, that is surely a relevant factor. The
defendant‟s legal right to challenge the patent at any point in time is intact,
but that does not mean that this factor cannot determine the interim
arrangement. This is more so where Glenmark today argues that MSD ought
to have disclosed international patent applications for SPM and Sitagliptin
plus Metformin since they were the "same or substantially the same" as the
suit patent under <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_111">Section 8</a>. That is Glenmark‟s stated position. Such being
the state of things, it is surely reasonable for Glenmark to detect the
possibility to challenge, when a US patent application for SPM filed by it
was opposed by MSD. Despite this, Glenmark released the drug without
initiating revocation proceedings under the Act, which is also a right vested




FAO (OS) 190/2013                                                        Page 77
 in Glenmark that would have obviated the need for the interim arrangement
we are today considering. This does not mean that Glenmark‟s right to
question the validity of the patent in an infringement is affected, but the
manner of challenge is a relevant factor against it at the interim stage. As
Justice Jacob noted in both Smithkline Beecham cases (supra):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">      "I remain of the same opinion that I was in the Generics case.
      Where litigation is bound to ensue if the defendant introduces his
      product he can avoid all the problems of an interlocutory
      injunction if he clears the way first. That is what the procedures
      for revocation and declaration of non-infringement are for."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">      Similarly, in the Australian decision of Pharmacia Italia S.p.A v.
</blockquote><p id="p_147">Interpharma Pty Ltd, [2005] FCA 1675, the Court noted the fact that Inter-
pharma had acted in full knowledge of Pharmacia‟s patent and the possible
consequences flowing from that. This consideration that the patentee is
already in the market and has been operating the patent has found favour in
Indian Courts as well. <a href="/doc/1812239/" id="a_112">In K. Ramu v. Adayar Ananda Bhavan and
Muthulakshmi Bhavan</a>, 2007 (34) PTC 689 (<a href="/doc/1176027/" id="a_113">Mad), Bajaj Auto Ltd. v. TVS
Motor Company Ltd</a>., 2008 (36) <a href="/doc/608642/" id="a_114">PTC417 (Mad) and National Research
Development Corporation of India v. The Delhi Cloth and General Mills
Co. Ltd. and Others</a>, AIR 1980 Del 132, the fact that the patentee was
already dealing in the market on the basis of the patent weighed in as a
factor in granting the interim injunction.
</p><p id="p_148">88.    Ultimately, the Court must look to the combination of the three
primary factors. A strong case can in some instances offset an equal balance
of conveniences between parties. In this case, MSD has established a prima
facie case of infringement, an interim arrangement that secures the interests
of both parties and which maintains the public interest involved is available,

 which also ensures that the possibility of irreparable harm to the patentee is
removed.
</p><p id="p_149">89.    Accordingly, for the above reasons, this Court holds that the order of
the learned Single Judge dismissing the application for grant of an interim
injunction is liable to be and is set aside. The interim injunction claimed for
by the plaintiff MSD in IA 5167/2013 is granted. Additionally, the following
directions are issued:

       for the damage or loss caused, including but not limited to loss of
       earnings. The affidavit shall be filed in two weeks.

       of one of its Board of Directors authorized directors, which shall also
       undertake to pay such damages, if any- which may be decided by the
       court if the ultimate result of the suit is a decree in favour of the
