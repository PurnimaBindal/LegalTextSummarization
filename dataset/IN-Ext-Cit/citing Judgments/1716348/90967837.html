CAV ORDER
 


	
 


</p><p id="p_5">1.	Heard
the learned senior advocate Mr. R.S. Sanjanwala with learned advocate
Mr.  Dhaval Vyas on behalf of the appellant. Learned senior advocate
Mr. Yatin Oza with Mr. Patel in the Civil Applications as aforesaid.
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_6">2.	The
appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel has filed a Special Civil Suit
No.399 of 2007 in the Court of learned Principal Senior Civil Judge
of Ahmedabad (Rural), Mirzapur at Ahmedabad. The appellant is a
plaintiff of Special Civil Suit No.388 of 2007. The said suit has
been filed by the plaintiff/appellant for the relief of declaration,
partition and perpetual injunction. In this suit, the plaintiff had
filed an application for the grant of interim temporary injunction
under the provisions of Order 39, Rule 1 and 2 read with the
provisions of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The
plaintiff has prayed for the relief of interim injunction vide
application Exhibit 5 that the defendants be restrained from
interfering with the possession of the suit land and further, the
defendants be restrained from alienating the suit land in any manner
whatsoever in favour of third person. At the initial stage, the
leaned Judge of the Trial Court has granted ex parte order of
status-quo in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">3.	Thereafter,
the application Exhibit 5 has been decided by considering the merits
and demerits of the case by the learned Judge of the Trial Court vide
judgment and order dated 4.12.2007. The learned Judge of the Trial
Court has rejected the application Exhibit 5 filed by the
plaintiff/present appellant for the grant of interim temporary
injunction and also vacated the ex parte order of status-quo granted
by the learned Judge of the Trial Court dated 19.10.2007.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_8">4.	Being
aggrieved and dissatisfied by the judgment and order passed by the
learned Judge of Trial Court below application Exhibit 5 dated
4.12.2007, the plaintiff of Special Civil Suit No.399 of 2007 has
preferred and filed the present Appeal From Order under the
provisions of Order 43, Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">5.	The
appellant/plaintiff has filed one affidavit/purshis on 26.9.2012. As
per the said affidavit filed by the appellant, the appellant has
prayed to withdraw the appeal unconditionally.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">6.	Learned
senior advocate Mr. Yatin Oza with Mr. Tatvam Patel have strongly
objected the withdrawal of the Appeal From Order No.441 of 2007.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">7.	One
Shri Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel has filed Civil Application No.6928
of 2011 in the said Appeal From Order No.441 of 2007, praying to be
joined as party and must be given an opportunity of being heard. In
short the applicant is opposing the withdrawal of the Appeal of the
appellant i.e. Parth Pravinbhai Patel as well as substitution as
appellant. It is an admitted position that Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel
is an executor of Will executed by late Manguben wd/o. Rambhai
Chhaganbhai Patel dated 1.6.1999. Under the said Will, late Manguben
wd/o. Rambhai Chhaganbhai Patel has given the suit lands to the
present plaintiff as the present plaintiff/appellant is a grandson of
the executant of the Will i.e. Manguben. The present Special Civil
Suit No.399 of 2007 has been filed by Parth Pravinbhai Patel himself.
The present Appeal has also been personally filed by Parth Pravinbhai
Patel, who is the beneficiary of the Will executed by late Manguben
wd/o. Rambhai Chhaganbhai Patel dated 1.6.1999.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">8.	Any
litigant has a right to unconditionally withdraw the proceeding. In
the present case, the parties to the present Appeal have not objected
to the withdrawal. But an application has been filed by Shri
Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel who is the plaintiff No.2 in the suit,
praying that he be joined as an applicant in the Appeal. Effectively
he seeks substitution as appellant in place of present appellant who
wishes to withdraw the Appeal. The said Ashwinbahi is the executor of
the Will of late Manguben, who has bequeathed her share in the lands
in question to the appellant, the beneficiary under the Will. The
appellant along with Ruchir Patel are the beneficiaries under the
Will. What is pertinent to note is that the appellant Shri Ashwin
Patel could have filed a substantive appeal against the order, which
has not been done. Moreover, though the said Ashwinbhai was not made
a party in the present Appeal, he did not apply for being joined as
party. It is not the case of Ashwinbhai that he was not aware about
the pendency of the Appeal From Order before the High Court. Only
when the beneficiary under the Will has sought leave to withdraw, he
has come forward with such an application, which is grossly
misconceived. The said Ashwinbahi can file a separate Appeal, if law
permits him to do so. Any Appeal by him would be beyond limitation
and would have to be accompanied by an application for condonation of
delay. Instead of following such course, the present application has
been filed to overcome the delay and other issues which would arise
in the Appeal that my be filed by the executor.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_13">9.	It
has been laid down by the Hon ble Supreme Court of India in the
case <a href="/doc/378453/" id="a_1">Bijayananda Patnaik V. Satrughna Sabu and Others</a> reported in AIR
1963, Supreme Court, 1566, that an appellant is entitled as of right
to withdraw his Appeal provided the respondent has not acquired any
interest there under. Here, in the present case, no such interest is
acquired and hence, according to the well settled principle of law,
the present appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel is entitled to withdraw
the Appeal unconditionally filed by him. The unconditional withdrawal
of Appeal is hereby granted.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">10.	It
is the strong and substantial argument on behalf of applicant of
Civil Application No.6928 of 2011, Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel that
the appellant of Appeal From Order No.441 of 2007 Parth Pravinbhai
Patel has filed the present Appeal malafidely as applicant Ashwinbhai
Naranbhai Patel has not been joined as party though the applicant
Ashwinbhai Naranbhai was a party in capacity of plaintiff No.2 in
original Special Civil Suit No.399 of 2007. It is the argument of the
learned advocate of the applicant that the Appeal has been filed with
a mala fide intention of misguiding this Court and with mala fide
intention to frustrate rights of present applicant in respect of the
suit land, the appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel did not join the
applicant even as pro-forma respondent and the appellant has not
joined a copy of amended plaint with the Appeal memo. It is the
argument of the learned advocate of the appellant that this is a
fraud which has been practiced upon this Hon ble Court as well as
upon applicant, Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel by the appellant and
solely on this count the Civil Application No.6928 of 2011 is
required to be allowed. The learned advocate on behalf of the
applicant relied upon the following reported judgments :

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_28">11.	It
is further argument of the learned advocate of the applicant that
these reported judgments lay down the law to the effect that fraud
vitiate everything. Not only that, they also lay down that
withholding of vital document or making false representation before
the Court or suppression before the Court also amounts to fraud. On
the other hand, it is the argument of the learned advocate of the
appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel that no question arise to consider
the allegation of the applicant Ashwinbhai that the appellant Parth
Pravinbhai Patel has committed fraud with the Court and with the
applicant. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant Parth
Pravinbhai Patel that the order to join the applicant in capacity of
plaintiff No.2 in original suit has been annexed with the plaint at
page 290 and the amended plaint has also been annexed at page 294.
Not only that, the appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel has not gained
anything by this act and no injury has been caused to the applicant
Ashwinbhai. Unless and until the appellant gains something by
misrepresentation or caused some injury upon the existing rights of
other side, then only the fraud can be said to have been committed.
The arguments advanced by the learned advocate on behalf of the
appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel is much appealable . If the
allegation of the fraud as argued by the learned advocate on behalf
of the applicant Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel would be considered,
there would be no question of committing fraud by the appellant Parth
Pravinbhai Patel. This is a matter of record and the appellant has
produced the copies of order of joining the present applicant has
produced the copies of order of joining the present applicant in
capacity of plaintiff No.2 before the Trial Court in original suit
and also annexed the copy of the amended plaint respectively at page
No.290 and 294 and it is also an undisputed fact that the present
appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel has acquired or obtained nothing.
Under these circumstances, as clarified by the learned advocate of
the appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel that it is a bona fide mistake
on the part of the appellant. As such it is not the allegation that
the appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel had adverse interest to that of
the applicant Ashwinbhai Patel and therefore, non-joinder does not
appeared to be for taking any undue benefit against the interest
claimed by Ashwinbhai Patel, but in view of the issue consider by
this Court in this reasoned order, question of fraud cannot be
established so the said issue cannot be considered. It is submitted
by the learned advocate that other side has committed fraud, but here
first of all the meaning of fraud is required to be
 


considered.
</p><p id="p_29">Normally, the meaning of fraud is to cheat the person with a view to
gain something. The meaning of fraud is required to be elaborated
here under :
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_30">12.	Fraud
means an intrinsic, collateral act, and fraud of an egregious nature
would vitiate the most solemn proceedings of court of justice. Fraud
is an act of deliberate deception with a design to secure something,
which is otherwise not true. The expression  fraud  involves two
elements, deceit and injury to the person deceived. It is a cheating
intended to get an advantage. As per Concise Oxford Dictionary, Word
 Fraud  means a criminal deception, use of false representation
to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick. Word  Fraud 
means deliberate deception, treachery or cheating which is intended
to gain certain advantage. Fraud means and includes any of the
following acts committed by a party to a contract or with his
connivance, or by his agent with intent to deceived another party
thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract. 
</p>
 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(1)</span>
<p id="p_31">the suggestion as a fact, of that which is not true, by one does not
believe it to be true;
</p> 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">(2)</span>
<p id="p_32">the active concealment of a fact by having knowledge or belief of the
fact;
</p> 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">(3)</span>
<p id="p_33">a promise mad without any intention of performing it;
</p> 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">(4)</span>
<p id="p_34">any other act fitted to deceive;
</p> 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">(5)</span>
<p id="p_35">any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be
fraudulent.
</p> 


<p id="p_36">Even
the meaning of fraud contains the words like injury is something
other than economic loss, that is, deprivation of property, whether
movable or immovable or of money and it will include and any harm
whatever caused to any person in body, mind reputation or such
others. It is a noneconomic or nonpecuniary
 


loss.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_37">13.	
In various decisions the meaning of fraud is defined by the Hon ble
Supreme Court. Therefore, looking to the averments made in the
application, it is nowhere transpired as to what and in which manner
the fraud is committed by the opponents. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_38">14.	It
appears that the clarification made by the appellant Parth Pravinbhai
Patel is acceptable and there is no element of fraud committed by
present appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel with this Court or with the
applicant. In background of these facts, the reported above stated
judgments of the Hon ble Supreme Court of India relied upon by the
learned advocate on behalf of the applicant are not applicable in
adjudication of the Civil Application No.6928 of 2011.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_39">15.	The
other argument of learned advocate for the applicant Ashwinbhai
Naranbhai Patel that under the provisions of Order 41, Rule 4 the
appellant cannot be allowed to withdraw the Appeal. It is submitted
on behalf of the applicant Ashwinbhai that when there are more than
one plaintiffs or defendants and the decree appealed from proceed on
any ground common to all, the plaintiffs or defendants, any one of
the plaintiff or defendant may appeal from the whole decree and
thereupon the Appellate Court may reverse or vary the decree in
favour of all the plaintiffs and defendants as the case may be. It is
the argument of the other side learned advocate on behalf of the
appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel that the provisions of Order 41,
Rule 4 only can be made applicable when the circumstances arises for
the Appellate Court to allow the Appeal and that too against the
final judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court. The learned
advocate on behalf of appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel relied upon
the reported judgment in case of Ganesh Cooperative Housing Society
Ltd. &amp; Others Vs. Ishwarbhai Keshavbhai Patel &amp; Others,
2001(3) G.LH. 702 (2002(1) G.L.R. 159). It is laid down by this Court
that Appeal is provided under Order 43, Rule 1(r) of the Code of
Civil Procedure against the order passed by the Trial Court in
exercise of power under the provisions of Order 39, Rule 1 and 2 of
the Code of Civil Procedure. The scope of this Appeal is limited only
to the order impugned below an application for temporary injunction.
The Appellate Court cannot exercise powers under the provisions of
Section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as the said Appeal is not
continuation of suit as the suit is already pending before the Trial
Court for final adjudication. The principle laid down in the
aforesaid reported judgment by this Court is completely applicable to
the facts of the present case. Not only that, in the present Appeal,
this is not the stage in which this Court has to consider the
provisions of Order 41, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
According to this Court, in case of withdrawal of Appeal by the
appellant under which the orders of Trial Court have been under
challenge and the suit is not finally adjudicated by the Trial Court,
the question does not arise for the Appellate Court to consider the
provisions of Order 41, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In
view of this reasoning, the arguments advanced by the learned
advocate on behalf of the applicant Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel are
not acceptable by this Court.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_40">16.	The
learned advocate on behalf of the applicant relies upon the reported
judgment in case reported in AIR 1986 Madras 367 and argued that any
party in partition suit can seek transposition from plaintiff to that
and/or of defendant and visa versa. The principle laid down by the
Madras High Court can be made applicable during the course of trial
before the Trial Court. The principle laid down in the said reported
judgment by the Madras High Court cannot be made applicable in an
Appeal filed under the provisions of Order 43, Rule 1(r) of the Code
of Civil Procedure. The transposition of defendant as plaintiff is
only permissible when the circumstances do not arise. The
transposition of defendant in capacity of plaintiff can be only
permitted when the plaintiff withdraws or abandons the suit under the
provisions of Order 23, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and
substantial question is required to be decided. Here, in the present
case, no such exigencies have been arisen. The applicant has not been
joined in capacity of defendant either in the present Appeal or in
original suit. Whatever the rights claimed by the present applicant
Ashwin Naranbhai Patel are in existence, it will be decided at the
time of final adjudication of the suit by the Trial Court. The
applicant himself is a plaintiff No.2 in the original suit and hence,
the present applicant has already opportunity to prove his right
whichever the applicant has claimed in this present Appeal.  The
rights claimed by the applicant Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel are
neither in question nor required to be decided in the present Appeal.
The applicant Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel had independent right to
challenge the order passed by the Trial Court. If the applicant
himself does not exercise his right to challenge the judgment, how
the applicant is entitled to claim for the adjudication of his rights
after lapse of more than 5 or 6 years period. This Court cannot allow
the applicant Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel to knock the doors of this
Court from the real side.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_41">17.	The
case made out by the applicant to join him as party in the present
Appeal From Order does not fall or cover under the ambit of
provisions of Order 1, Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The
applicant must require to show    that how the adjudication of the
suit or proceedings in his absence are likely to be affected
adversely to the existing rights of the applicant. 
</p>
 


	
 


<p id="p_42">18.	It
is also one of the arguments of the learned advocate on behalf of the
applicant Ashwinbhai Naranbhai Patel that there is a violation of
Rule 32(a) of the Gujarat High Court Rules. According to this Court,
there is no violation of the Gujarat High Court Rules 32(a) which may
cause prejudice to the existing rights of the applicant Ashwinbhai
Naranbhai Patel.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_43">19.	In
the result, this Court passes following order:
</p> 


<p id="p_44">	The
appellant Parth Pravinbhai Patel is permitted to unconditionally
withdraw the present Appeal From Order No.441 of 2007. The Appeal
From Order is disposed of as withdrawn. The Civil Application
No.15331 of 2007 is disposed of, as the Appeal From Order is
withdrawn.
</p> 


<p id="p_45">	Civil
Application Nos.6928 of 2011 and 7845 of 2011 filed by Ashwinbhai
Naranbhai Patel is hereby dismissed.
</p> 


<p id="p_46">	The
costs of both the litigation shall be borne by the parties
themselves.
</p>

	After
pronouncement of the order, learned senior advocate Mr. Yatin Oza for
learned advocate Mr. Patel requests to stay of the order for a period
of six weeks, as the applicant wants to file Special Leave Petition
(SLP) before the Hon ble Supreme Court. Learned senior advocate Mr.
R.S. Sanjanwal for Mr. Vyas has opposed the same.
</p> 


<p id="p_48">	However,
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, request is
required to be considered. Hence, stay of the order is granted for a
period of six weeks.
