</pre>
<p id="p_1">Balakrishnan Nair, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       The point that arises for decision in this Writ Petition is whether the

University is bound to grant affiliation to a B.Ed. College, for which the

petitioner has obtained recognition under Section 14(3)(a) of the National

Council for <a href="/doc/202695/" id="a_1">Teacher Education Act</a>, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the

NCTE Act) from the Southern Regional Committee of the National Council

for Teacher Education, notwithstanding the report of the Sub Committee of

the University that the College does not have the requisite infrastructural

facilities.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       2. The brief facts of the case are the following: The petitioner Trust

was an applicant for establishing a B.Ed. College at Kaipamangalam in

Thrissur District since 2002. It is unnecessary to re-state the travails faced

by the petitioner in pursuing its application. Suffice it to say, finally, the

Southern Regional Committee of the NCTE by Ext. P1 order dated

23.3.2007, granted recognition to Vikram Sarabhai B.Ed.              College,

Kaipamangalam, Kodungallur, Thrissur District for conducting B.Ed.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC 15339/2007                          2</span>

Course of one year duration with an annual intake of 100 students. The

recognition was granted under Section 14(3)(a) of the NCTE Act. The grant

was subject to the condition that the College should shift to its own

premises/building within three years from the date of recognition. It was

also stipulated that the recognition is subject to fulfilment of all such other

requirements as may be prescribed by other regulatory bodies like U.G.C.,

affiliating University/bodies, State Government, etc., as applicable. The

said order reads as follows:

</blockquote>

<p id="p_4">On receipt of Ext.P1 order of recognition, the petitioner submits, it filed an

application before the 1st respondent University of Calicut, praying for

grant of affiliation to its College. Ext.P2 is the application for affiliation

submitted by it.     The University had, earlier, on 23.8.2005 agreed in

principle to grant provisional affiliation to the proposed B.Ed. College

under the management of the petitioner at Kaipamangalam, Thrissur District

for the academic years 2005-06 and 2006-07, subject to approval of the

Government of Kerala and the National Council for Teacher Education.

But, according to the petitioner, the University was under instructions from

the Kerala Government, not to grant affiliation to any self-financing B.Ed.

College. Therefore, the University was sleeping over the matter. So, this

writ petition was filed, seeking the following reliefs:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">             "i) Issue a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the
      respondents 1 and 2 to grant affiliation so as to enable the
      petitioner to commence the academic session during the
      academic year 2007-08 pursuant to the grant of recognition as
      per Ext.P1.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             ii) Issue a writ declaring that in terms of Section 14(6)(a)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC 15339/2007                         5</span>

       of the NCTE Act the University is statutorily bound to grant
       affiliation when recognition is given by NCTE under <a href="/doc/1791053/" id="a_2">Section
       14(3)(a)</a> and the University cannot frustrate       the grant of
       recognition by refusing affiliation as sought and required to be
       issued."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">According to the petitioner, once the NCTE grants recognition, the

University is bound to grant affiliation. In support of that submission,

reliance was placed on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1036462/" id="a_3">State of

Maharashtra v. Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya</a>

[(2006)9 SCC 1].
</p>
<p id="p_6">       3. The Registrar of the University of Calicut has filed a counter

affidavit, resisting the prayers in the Writ Petition. Relying on Chapter

XXII    of the First Statutes, concerning affiliation of     Colleges to the

University of Calicut, it was contended that for getting affiliation for a

course for the academic year 2007-08, the petitioner should have applied in

the prescribed form before 31st October, 2006. The University also relied

on para 4 of Ext.P1, which said that grant of recognition is subject to

fulfilment of requirements as may be prescribed by the affiliating University

etc. It was also contended that Ext.P3 consent of affiliation will not enable

the petitioner to get affiliation, unless other statutory requirements are

satisfied.   According to the University, the petitioner did not file any

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WPC 15339/2007                        6</span>

application for affiliation for the academic year 2007-08. The University

also relied on the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1768618/" id="a_4">Rural Education and Social

Trust v. University of Calicut</a> [2007(2) KLT 609] wherein a Division

Bench of this Court held that grant of affiliation is not an empty formality.

The said decision was rendered by the Division Bench after referring to the

decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1036462/" id="a_5">State of              Maharashtra v. Sant

Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya</a> [(2006)9 SCC 1].

</p><p id="p_7">      4. Since, in the counter affidavit, the very submission of Ext.P2

application was disputed by the University, the petitioner filed a reply

affidavit on 11.7.2007 as also an additional affidavit on 20.7.2007. Along

with the additional affidavit, materials were produced to show that Ext.P2

application was submitted by the petitioner. The University, thereupon filed

an additional counter affidavit on 1.8.2007. In the said affidavit, it was

submitted that the petitioner has not submitted any valid application by

remitting the necessary fees for affiliation of the course for the academic

year 2007-08.     An undated application received in the office of the

University on 11.5.2007 does not satisfy the requirement of law, it was

submitted. Since no valid application was submitted by the petitioner, the

University prayed for dismissal of the Writ Petition. The petitioner filed a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WPC 15339/2007                          7</span>

reply affidavit on 6.8.2007, dealing with the averments of the University. It

also produced Ext.P8 chalan receipt dated 2.8.2007, evidencing payment

of the requisite fee for affiliation.             The petitioner also filed

I.A.No.12218/2007 to receive Exts.P9 to Ext.P11. In the affidavit filed in

support of that petition, it was contended by the petitioner that the affiliation

fee is collected only after the actual grant of affiliation. The petitioner also

submitted that applications from similarly placed educational agencies were

entertained by the Calicut University and affiliation was granted to them,

while its application was being held under objection.

</p><p id="p_8">       5. The learned Single Judge who heard the Writ Petition referred the

case to the Division Bench, doubting the correctness of the decision of the

Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1768618/" id="a_6">Rural Education and Social Trust v.

University of Calicut</a> [2007(2) KLT 609]. The Division Bench, which

heard the Writ Petition on reference by the leaned Single Judge, took the

view that there is substance in the stand taken by the learned Single Judge

and therefore, referred the Writ Petition to be heard by the Full Bench. The

Division Bench also simultaneously on 4.10.2007 passed an interim order to

grant provisional affiliation to the petitioner's College.

</p><p id="p_9">       6. The 1st respondent filed I.A.16823/2007 to vacate the interim order

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WPC 15339/2007                         8</span>

passed by the Division Bench on 4.10.2007. The writ petitioner filed a

counter affidavit in the above I.A., and along with that, it has produced

copies of title deeds as Exts.P12 and P13, to show that the Trust managing

the College is having sufficient extent of land in its possession and

ownership, as mandated under the NCTE regulations. The petitioner has

also produced Ext.P14 order of the University, granting provisional

affiliation to a self-financing B.Ed. Training College established at

Koyilandy. According to the petitioner, the objections taken against it, were

available in that case also. The University, even then, has chosen to grant

affiliation to that College as per Ext.P14 order dated 10.12.2007. It is

alleged that the stand taken by the University in the case of the writ

petitioner is highly arbitrary and discriminatory.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       7. Mr.George Poonthottam, who appeared for the writ petitioner,

reiterated the contentions mentioned in the Writ Petition. According to him,

once the NCTE grants recognition, nothing remains for the University to

consider regarding the availability of infrastructural facilities. Once the

NCTE grants affiliation under Section 14(3)(a) of the NCTE Act, the

examining body, that is, the University is bound to grant affiliation under

<a href="/doc/932471/" id="a_7">Section 14(6)(a)</a> of the said Act. Heavy reliance was placed by the learned

counsel on the decision of the Apex Court in Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WPC 15339/2007                       9</span>

Shastra Mahavidyalaya 's case [(2006)9 SCC 1].
</p>
<p id="p_11">      8. The learned standing counsel for the University Mr.P.C.Sasidharan

reiterated the contentions of the University, which we have already noticed

above. According to him, the grant of affiliation is not an empty formality,

especially, in view of condition No.4 contained in Ext.P1, which makes it

mandatory to fulfill the requirements of the affiliating University also, for

grant of affiliation. Relying on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1243363/" id="a_8">Jaya

Gokul Educational Trust v. Commissioner &amp; Secretary to Government</a>

[2000(2) KLT 267 (SC)], it was submitted that for grant of affiliation, the

University can impose additional conditions, which are not inconsistent

with the NCTE Act or Regulations. The learned standing counsel also

relied on the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1768618/" id="a_9">Rural

Education and Social Trust v. University of Calicut</a> [2007(2) KLT 609],

in support of his submission that affiliation is not automatic on grant of

recognition by the NCTE.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      9.    We also had the benefit of hearing Mr.V.M.Kurian, learned

standing counsel for the NCTE, which was impleaded as additional 3rd

respondent in the Writ Petition, at the time of final hearing of it. The

learned standing counsel made available to us, the file leading to Ext.P1 for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">WPC 15339/2007                                        10</span>

our perusal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       10. Before dealing with the rival contentions of the parties, we feel

that it will be appropriate to refer to the statutory provisions that are

relevant in this case. The NCTE Act, 1993, as evident from its preamble, is

an Act to provide for the establishment of a National Council for Teacher

Education with a view to achieving planned and co-ordinated development

of the teacher education system throughout the country, the regulation and

proper maintenance of norms and standards in the teacher education system

and for matters connected therewith. <a href="/doc/177621/" id="a_10">Section 14</a> deals with recognition of

institutions offering course or training in teacher education. <a href="/doc/164852/" id="a_11">Section 14(1)</a>

deals with submission of application to the Regional Committee of the

NCTE for recognition. <a href="/doc/1791053/" id="a_12">Section 14(3)(a)</a> deals with grant of recognition.

The said provision reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "14. Recognition of institutions offering course or training in
      teacher education:--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      (1) ..............................................................................................
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      (3) On receipt of an application by the Regional Committee
      from any institution under sub-section (1), and after obtaining
      from the institution concerned such other particulars as it may
      consider necessary, it shall,--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">              (a) If it is satisfied that such institution has adequate
      financial resources, accommodation, library, qualified staff,
      laboratory and that it fulfils such other conditions required for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">WPC 15339/2007                          11</span>

      proper functioning of the institution for a course or training in
      teacher education, as may be determined by regulations, pass an
      order granting recognition to such institution, subject to such
      conditions as may be determined by regulations".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14"><a href="/doc/419690/" id="a_13">Section 14(4)</a> provides for publication of the order granting recognition in

the Official Gazette as also communication of the same to the examining

body, the local authority, the State Government and the Central

Government. Examining body is defined under <a href="/doc/39494/" id="a_14">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act as to

mean a University. Sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/177621/" id="a_15">Section 14</a> provides that once the

order of recognition is communicated under <a href="/doc/419690/" id="a_16">Section 14(4)</a>, the University is

bound to grant affiliation to the College. <a href="/doc/1540085/" id="a_17">Section 14(6)</a>, dealing with grant

of affiliation by the University, reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "(6) Every examining body shall, on receipt of the order under
       sub-section (4),--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">              (a) grant affiliation to the institution, where recognition
       has been granted; or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">              (b) cancel the affiliation of the institution, where
       recognition has been refused."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15"><a href="/doc/1825464/" id="a_18">Section 17</a> deals with cancellation of the recognition granted under <a href="/doc/532048/" id="a_19">Section

14(3)</a>. <a href="/doc/1813912/" id="a_20">Section 18</a> provides for appeals against the orders passed under

<a href="/doc/177621/" id="a_21">Section 14</a> or <a href="/doc/1825464/" id="a_22">Section 17</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       11. Going by the above statutory provisions, there cannot be any

doubt that normally, once the Southern Regional Committee of the NCTE

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WPC 15339/2007                        12</span>

grants recognition to the petitioner's College, the examining body, that is,

the 1st respondent University is bound to grant affiliation to the said

College. The same cannot be denied, relying on the technical contention

that the petitioner did not submit the application before the 30th October of

the preceding year, in view of the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1036462/" id="a_23">State of

Maharashtra v. Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya</a>

[(2006)9 SCC 1]. In the said decision the Apex Court held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">             "74. It is thus clear that the Central Government has
      considered the subject of secondary education and higher
      education at the national level. <a href="/doc/202695/" id="a_24">The Act</a> of 1993 also requires
      Parliament to consider teacher education system 'throughout
      the country'. NCTE, therefore, in our opinion, is expected to
      deal with applications for establishing new B.Ed colleges or
      allowing increase in intake capacity, keeping in view the 1993
      Act and planned and coordinated development of teacher
      education system in the country. It is neither open to the State
      Government nor to a university to            consider the local
      conditions or apply 'State policy' to refuse such permission. In
      fact, as held by this Court in cases referred to hereinabove, the
      State Government has no power to reject the prayer of an
      institution or to overrule the decision of NCTE. The action of
      the State Government, therefore, was contrary to law and has
      rightly been set aside by the High Court.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">             76.    We may state at this stage that the contesting
      respondents have placed heavy reliance on <a href="/doc/237683/" id="a_25">Section 12</a> of the
      Act which relates to functions of the Council and submitted
      that it is incumbent on the Council to lay down norms and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">WPC 15339/2007                       13</span>

    guidelines for ensuring planned and coordinated development
    of the teacher education and it is not open to the Council to
    delegate those 'essential functions' to the State Government.
    According to them, such delegation would be excessive and
    impermissible and abdication of power by the Council in
    favour of the State Government which is inconsistent with the
    provisions of the parent Act and must be held ultra vires. In
    reply, Mr.Andhyarujina submitted that the constitutional
    validity of the regulations       or guidelines had not been
    challenged before the High Court and the respondents now
    cannot be permitted to raise such point in this Court in the
    absence of the challenge. The respondents, however, urged
    that since they    succeeded before the High Court on other
    points, it was not necessary for them to challenge the vires of
    the Regulations. But when the State had approached this
    Court, they can support the judgment on any ground available
    to them including unconstitutionality of regulations and
    guidelines. In our opinion, it is not necessary to enter into the
    larger question since we are satisfied that in the facts and
    circumstances of the case, the High Court was justified in
    allowing the petitions filed by the colleges and setting aside the
    order dated 28.12.2004 passed by the State Government and
    also in dismissing the petition filed by the State holding that
    the order of the State was not legal. We may, however, observe
    that the learned counsel for NCTE, Mr.Raju Ramachandran is
    right in submitting that the guidelines permitted the State
    Government to collect necessary data and materials and make
    them available to NCTE so as to enable NCTE to take an
    appropriate decision. In accordance with the provisions of the
    1993 Act, final decision can be taken only by NCTE and once a
    decision is taken by NCTE, it has to be implemented by all
    authorities in the light of the provisions of the Act and the law
    declared by this Court.       It has been so held in St.Johns
    Teachers Training Institute [(2003)3 SCC 321],

</p><p id="p_19">      12. The Writ Petition happened to be referred to the Full Bench

because of the apparent conflict between the decision of the Apex Court

mentioned above and the above quoted decision of the Division Bench. A

close reading of both the decisions would show that in fact, there is no

conflict between the decision of the Division Bench and that of the Apex

Court. It is trite law that when the central body grants recognition, based

on the finding that the College has necessary infrastructural facilities, the

University has no power or authority to decline affiliation, on the ground of

lack of infrastructural facilities.    In view of the decision in Sant

Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya's case (supra), affiliation

cannot be declined on the ground that the application for the same was not

submitted in time in terms of the provisions of the Calicut University First

Statutes.     Going by the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1243363/" id="a_44">Jaya Gokul

Educational Trust v. Commissioner &amp; Secretary to Government</a> [2000

(2) KLT 267 (SC)], the University can insist that the requirements as per the

Statutes, which are not in conflict with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_45">Central Act</a> and

the Regulations, should be complied with, for grant of affiliation. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">WPC 15339/2007                         17</span>

decision in Rural Education and Social Trust (supra) only lays down this

principle. When understood in that manner, there is no conflict between

that decision and the decision of the Apex Court in Sant Dnyaneshwar

Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_20">      13. There may be a case where recognition is granted by the NCTE,

holding that the College has all infrastructural facilities and it may be found

by the University that no such facilities are available. In such a case, it can

be rightly said that the recognition has been obtained by fraud. If the

University feels that the affiliation has been granted illegally, it has several

options before it. It may bring the same to the notice of the NCTE, so that

the Council can cancel the affiliation under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_46">Section 17</a> of the Act. It may

challenge the recognition granted by filing an appeal under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_47">Section 18</a> of

the Act before the National Council for Teacher Education. The University

can also challenge the recognition before this Court by filing a Writ

Petition. In an appropriate case, for example, where recognition has been

obtained by fraud, the University may even collaterally attack the validity of

the recognition granted, in enforcement proceedings, like the present Writ

Petition.

<p id="p_21">      14. Going by the materials produced in this case, including the video

recording of the inspection, we find that accommodation has been provided

for the College in a rented building, which is, apparently, part of a larger

shopping complex.      It appears, minimum infrastructural facilities are

provided by the petitioner for starting the College. As evident from para 3

of Ext.P1, the application was processed        and dealt with as per the

Regulations notified in the Official Gazette on 13.1.2006. The said

Regulations bearing No.F.49-42/2005-NCTE (N&amp;S) were framed on

27.12.2005. They were enforced with effect from 13.1.2006. As per

Regulation 8 of the said Regulations, which contains the conditions for

grant of recognition, the College should have its own building, as evident

from Regulation 8(5) read with Regulation 8(8). The said sub-regulations

and Regulation 11 are quoted below for convenient reference:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "8(5) No institution shall be granted recognition under these
      regulations unless it is in possession of required land on the
      date of application. The land free from all encumbrances could
      be either on ownership basis or on lease for a period of not less
      than 30 years. In cases where under relevant State/UT laws
      the maximum permissible lease period is less than 30 years, the
      State Government/UT Administration law shall prevail."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      "8(8) At the time of inspection, the building of the institution
      shall be complete in the form of a permanent structure on the
      land possessed by the institution in terms of Regulation 8(5),
      equipped with all necessary amenities and fulfilling all such
      requirements as prescribed in the norms and standards."

      the date the above new regulations come into force,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">      1. .........., except Regulation 8(i) containing the norms and

</blockquote>


<p id="p_22">Going by Regulation 11 of the said Regulations, the earlier Regulations

were all repealed, except Regulation 8(i) of NCTE (Form of application for

recognition, the time limit of submission of application, determination of

norms and standards for recognition of teacher education programmes and

permission to start new course or training) Regulations, 2002.      As per

Regulation 8(i) of the said Regulations, the provisions contained in

Appendix 7 of it are applicable to B.Ed Education Programme. As per para

7(d) of Appendix 7, pending construction of permanent building, the

institution can be run in suitable temporary premises up to a maximum

period of three years. Para 7(d) reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">      "To provide these facilities the Management/Institutions shall
      at the time of making application have in its possession
      adequate land/land and building on ownership basis free from
      all encumbrances. Govt. land acquired on long-term lease as
      per the law of the concerned State/UT will also be considered
      valid for the purpose.      Pending construction of permanent
      building in the above land, the institution may provide these
      facilities in suitable temporary premises up to a maximum
      period of 3 years before expiry of which the institution should
      shift to its permanent building."

<p id="p_23">Ext.P1 stipulates that the petitioner should shift to its own permanent

building within three years from the date of Ext.P1. Subsequently, with

effect from 21.7.2006, new norms have been introduced, wherein there is no

provision for opening the College in temporary premises. The Southern

Regional Committee of the NCTE dealt with the pending applications,

based on the norms prevailing at the time when they were submitted and

processed.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      15. We have already answered the point referred for our decision that

there is no conflict between the decision of the Apex Court and that of the

Division Bench of this Court mentioned above. Going by the materials on

record, we find it difficult to hold that this is a case where no facilities are

provided for the conduct of the course. If the inspection report of the

University is correct, certain facilities may be inadequate in accordance with

the NCTE norms and to that extent, the grant of recognition by the NCTE

may not be proper. But, we think, this is not the forum to adjudicate this

dispute, as this is not a case of "no facilities" or the recognition is obtained

by fraud. The University, therefore, cannot be permitted to collaterally

attack Ext.P1 in this Writ Petition. It has to take recourse to the remedies

available to it under the Statute against the grant of recognition by the

Southern Regional Committee of the NCTE allegedly without the essential

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">WPC 15339/2007                        21</span>

infrastructural facilities. Of course, if this was a case, where no facilities

were provided, this being a discretionary jurisdiction, we would have

declined to issue any direction in favour of the petitioner. But, this being a

marginal case, until the recognition is stayed or set aside by the competent

authority, we are of the view that the University is bound to act under

Section 14(6) of the NCTE Act and grant affiliation. If there are other

requirements to be satisfied by the petitioner like payment of any fee etc.,

which are not at variance with the NCTE Act, the Regulations framed

thereunder and the decision of the NCTE, then the University may ask the

petitioner to comply with such requirements within a time frame and

thereafter grant affiliation. Condition No.4 of Ext.P1 cannot override the

mandatory provisions of the NCTE Act. The said condition should be read

down to make it in conformity with the provisions of <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_48">Section 14(6)</a> of the

said Act.    If, so far, the University has not granted affiliation to the

petitioner's College, pursuant to the interim order of this Court, the same

shall be done within one month from the date of production of a copy of this

judgment.    If Ext.P1 order is stayed,        modified or recalled by the

competent authority or court, needless to say, this direction to grant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">WPC 15339/2007                         22</span>
