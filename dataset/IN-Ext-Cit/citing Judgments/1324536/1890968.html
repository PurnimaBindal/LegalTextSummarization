<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> and he was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a

period of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- and in dafault of payment

of fine, to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month for offence

sentences were ordered to run concurrently. It was also ordered that out of

amount of fine, if recovered, Rs.5000/- would be paid to Pritam Dass,

complainant

</p><p id="p_2">2.            Briefly stated, the case of prosecution is that Pritam Dass,

complainant was resident of Indhna         Kalaske, Police Station Goraya,

District Jalandhar. He was a carpenter. They were three brothers, eldest

being Garib Dass, who used to reside in Delhi.      Nazar Ram is younger to

Garib Dass and older to Pritam Dass, complainant. Pritam Dass has two

sons and one daughter. Yogesh Chander and Sukhwinder (now deceased)

were the sons of Pritam Dass.        Nazar Ram had three sons and three

daughters. All the daughters of Nazar Ram were married and his two sons

had gone abroad.    Pritam Dass along with his family used to reside in back

portion of the house, whereas his elder brother Nazar Ram and his family

used to reside in the front portion of the house.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.            On 25.10.2001, at about 7.00 p.m., Paramjit- accused was

abusing his father Nazar Ram and was asking him to leave the house.

Complainant and his sons heard the noise and they also came in the

common courtyard, where the accused and his father Nazar Ram were

standing.   Complainant and his sons Yogesh Chander and Sukhwinder

asked Paramjit to stop abusing his father and also asked him as to why he

was asking his father to leave the house. Paramjit-accused got enraged and

he challenged complainant and his sons that they could not stop him from

abusing his father and from turning him out of the house. Complainant and

his sons tried to persuade Paramjit and, however, he got enraged. Paramjit-

accused went inside his house and brought out a sua (a pointed big needle)

and gave a blow to Yogesh Chander, PW, which hit on his arm. Accused

gave another sua blow on the left side of chest of Sukhwinder (deceased)

due to which he fell down. Pritam Dass and his sons raised alarm. When

Paramjit noticed Sukhwinder falling on the ground, he throw the Sua at

the place of occurrence and ran away. The occurrence was witnessed by

complainant and the other members of the family as electric light was on in

the courtyard. Sukhwinder was being shifted to the hospital and, however,

he succumbed to the injury on the way.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.          The matter was not reported to the police in the night as the

complainant was frightened as the death of Sukhwinder had already taken

place and hence, he did not go out of the house in the night. In the morning

of 26.10.2001, after    leaving his son and co-villagers at the spot, he

proceeded towards the police station to report the matter and, however,

police met him on the way and recorded his statement, on the basis of

which the present case was registered.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Crl.A.No.886-DB of 2003                                 -8-</span>


Pritam Dass, complainant, got the First Information Report recorded and

investigated this case, as detailed above.
</p>
<p id="p_19">19.          Statement of accused in terms of <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. was

recorded, in which he admitted that he along with his father Nazar Ram,

</p>
<p id="p_20">20.          Accused examined Dr. Kewal Verma, Subsidiary Health

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                      "Patient was conscious and well oriented in time and
             space.     Blood pressure was 120/80.     Pulse was 80 p.m.
             Regular.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                      He was having an incised wound 7 cm x 4 cm, muscle

             deep over the dural aspect of left forearm running from above

             downwards about 3 cm below the elbow joint. Fresh bleeding

             was present. Gaping was present."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Crl.A.No.886-DB of 2003                                  -9-</span>


<p id="p_21">21.         He further deposed that the patient was advised X-ray of the

underline bone. He had proved carbon copy of Medico Legal Report as

Exhibit DX. In the cross-examination, he clarified that possibility of injury

being self suffered could not be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_22">22.         Learned trial Court convicted and sentenced the accused, as

aforementioned against which the present appeal has been filed.

</p><p id="p_23">23.         We have heard learned counsel for the appellant-accused and

learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab and have gone through the

whole record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_24">24.         It has been argued by learned counsel for the appellant that

there is inordinate delay in lodging the first information report, hence, no

reliance can be placed upon the testimony of prosecution witnesses. It has

further been argued that the prosecution has failed to explain the injury on

the person of the accused and the said fact also creates doubt in the verasity

of the prosecution story.   It is also contended that both the eye-witnesses

examined by the prosecution are closely related to the deceased and hence,

interested one and cannot be said to be independent witnesses. It has also

been argued that there was no motive on the part of the accused to have

committed murder of his cousin Sukhwinder.
</p>
<p id="p_25">25.         On the other hand, it has been argued by learned Additional

Advocate General, Punjab, that delay in lodging the first information report

has been duly explained hence, no doubt is created in the story of the

prosecution witnesses. It is further contended that the eye-witnesses are the

most natural witnesses, as admittedly complainant's family as well as the

family of the accused being closely related, used to reside in the same house

and having common courtyard and hence, their testimony cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> Crl.A.No.886-DB of 2003                                 -10-</span>


discarded merely on the ground that they are closely related to the deceased.

It is further contended that the injury on the person of the accused was self

suffered, just to create defence and that there was also motive for the

accused to have caused injury to his cousin Yogesh Chander and

Sukhwinder as they and their father used to tell the accused that he should

not abuse his father and that he should not ask his father to leave the house

without any reason.
</p>
<p id="p_26">26.         So far as delay in lodging the first information report is

concerned, there is no dispute that the occurrence had taken place on

25.10.2001 at about 7.00 p.m. and, however, the matter was reported to the

police on 26.10.2001 at about 12.15 p.m. and hence, there is delay of more

than 17 hours. However, it is settled law that case of prosecution cannot be

thrown merely on the ground of delay in reporting the matter to the police,

if the delay is properly explained. The occurrence had taken place in the

night time. Accused had run away from the house after causing injury to

both   of his cousins resulting into death of Sukhwinder.       It has been

deposed by Pritam Dass as well as by Yogesh Chander, PWs that they were

frightened and they did not go out of the house due to fear of the accused.

Hence, complainant preferred to go to the police on the next morning.

Police station was situated at a distance of about 7 kms from the village,

where occurrence had taken place.       However, when complainant was

proceeding to police Station for reporting the matter to the police, the Sub

Inspector met him on the way and he recorded his statement at 12.15 p.m.

Moreover the complainant as well as accused are closely related and

belongs to the same family, hence, it cannot be said that delay in lodging

the report with the police in this case is fatal to the case of prosecution.

Learned counsel has rightly placed reliance on <a href="/doc/1818602/" id="a_11">Ravinder Kumar v. State of

Punjab (SC</a>) 2001 Crl.L.J.4242, relevant paragraphs of which read as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  "14. When there is criticism of the ground that FIR in a
            case was delayed the Court has to look at the reason why there
            was such a delay. There can be a variety of genuine causes for
            FIR lodgment to get delayed. Rural people might be ignorant
            of the need for informing the police of a crime without any
            lapse of time.     This kind of unconversantness is not too
            uncommon among urban people also.               They might not
            immediately think of going to the police station.         Another
            possibility is due to lack of adequate transport facilities for the
            informers to reach the police station. The third, which is a
            quite common bearing, is that the kith and kin of deceased
            might take some appreciable time to regain a certain level of
            tranquility of mind or sedativeness of temper for moving to the
            police station for the purpose of furnishing the requisite
            information.     Yet another cause is, the persons who are
            supposed to give such information themselves could be
            physically impaired that the police had to reach them on
            getting some nebulous information about the incident.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                  15. We are not providing an exhausting catalogue of
            instances which could cause delay in lodging the FIR. Our
            effort is to try to point out the stale demand made in the
            criminal courts to treat the FIR vitiated merely on the ground
            of delay in its lodgment cannot be approved as a legal
            corollary. In any case, where there is delay in making the FIR
            the court is to look at the causes are not attributable to any
            effort to concoct a version no consequence shall be attached to
            the mere delay in lodging the FIR. Vide Zahoor v. State of
            U.P. 1991 Supl.(1) SCC 372; <a href="/doc/445291/" id="a_12">Tara Singh v. State of Punjab</a>

             observations:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                             `It is well settled that the delay in giving the
                FIR by itself cannot be ground to doubt the prosecution
                case. Knowing the Indian conditions as they are we cannot
                except these villagers to rush to the police station
                immediately after the occurrence. Human nature as it is,
                the kith and kin who have witnessed the occurrence cannot
                be expected to act mechanically with all the promptidue in
                giving the report to the police.       At times being grief
                stricken because of the calamity it may be immediately
                occur to them that they should give a report. After all it is
                but natural in these circumstances for them to take some
                time to go to the police station for giving the report.'"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">27.          So far as argument of learned counsel for the accused that both

the eye witnesses are closely related to the deceased and hence no reliance

should be placed on their testimony, the same is also devoid of any merit.

Testimony of Pritam Dass-PW7 and Yogesh Chander- PW8, who was also

injured in the occurrence, is consistent on all the material points. They are

the most natural witnesses of the occurrence, as they along with family of

the accused used to reside in the same house and it was but natural for them

to have come out of their house in the common courtyard of the house

where accused was abusing his father and was telling him to go out of the

<p id="p_30">29.          In the present case as well no evidence has come on the record

that anyone else besides the witnesses produced, had actually witnessed the

attack upon the deceased and the witness Yogesh Chander, except Nazar

rightly given up by the prosecution as having been won over by the

accused.

</p>
<p id="p_32">31.         So far as injury on the person of the accused is concerned, it

has been specifically deposed by both the eye-witnesses that they did not

cause injury to the accused. However, from the medical evidence adduced

by the accused, it is proved that he was having a simple injury on his person

as deposed by Dr.Kewal Verma, DW1. However, accused has failed to

prove the plea taken by him in his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_17">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., as

to the manner in which he sustained the said injury. Even his father did not

appear in the witness box to corroborate his version taken in his statement

under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_18">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. The Medical Officer specifically deposed in the

cross-examination that the injury on the person of Paramjit could be self

inflicted. It has been deposed by the Medical Officer that he had advised

X-ray examination and however, X-ray report was not shown to him which

shows that accused had sustained only simple injury on the forearm.

Hence, learned trial Court has rightly observed that the injury on the person

of accused was self suffered in order to create defence in his favour and has

rightly placed reliance upon <a href="/doc/29943/" id="a_19">Rizan and another vs. State of Chhatisgarh</a>

through the Chief Secretary, Govt. of Chhatisgarh, Raipur AIR 2003

Supreme Court 976. Relevant paragraph of the same reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                     "14. The number of injuries is not always a safe
              criterion for determining who the aggressor was. It cannot
              be stated as a universal rule that whenever the injuries are on
              the body of the accused persons, a presumption must
              necessarily be raised that the accused persons had caused
              injuries in exercise of the right of private defence.      The
              defence has to further establish that the injuries so caused on
              the accused probabilises the version of the right of private
              defence. Non-explanation of the injuries sustained by the

              accused at about the time of occurrence or in the course of
              altercation is a very important circumstance. But mere non-
              explanation of the injuries by the prosecution may not affect
              the prosecution case in all cases. This principle applies to
              cases where the injuries sustained by the accused are minor
              and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent,
              so independent and disinterested, so probable, consistent and
              creditworthy, that it far outweighs the effect of the omission
              on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries. .........."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">32.         Hence, there is no force in the argument of learned counsel for

the accused that due to non-explanation of one simple injury on the person

of the accused, the prosecution version becomes doubtful.

</p><p id="p_34">33.         So far as the argument of learned counsel for the accused that

there was no motive for the offence is concerned, it is settled law that in

cases where independent testimony is available to prove the murder charge

against the accused, the question of motive becomes more or less academic.

For this view reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/1081747/" id="a_20">Podda Narayana and others vs. State of

Andhra Pradesh</a> AIR 1975 Supreme Court 1252. Relevant paragraph of the

same reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                  "13. The learned Sessions Judge further held that the
            motive ascribed to the appellants for committing the murder of
            the deceased was not sufficient to impel them to plan the
            murder of the deceased. This finding of the learned Sessions
            Judge is based purely on speculation. Various persons react to
            circumstances in different ways and it is difficult to weigh the
            reaction of the persons in golden scales with absolute
            computerised accuracy. There is no doubt that the deceased
            had drawn the accused in a long litigation involving thousands
            of rupees as a result of which he had to attend the Court at
            Anantpur on various dates. The sequence of circumstances
            under which the deceased was murdered clearly shows that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> Crl.A.No.886-DB of 2003                                -16-</span>


           there could not have been any other motive but the institution
           of the suit.   The High Court has also pointed out that the
           prosecution has established good and sufficient motive for the
           murder of the deceased.        Furthermore, in view of the
           independent testimony of P.Ws. 1, 2 and 3 whom the High
           Court has believed, and we see no reason to differ from the
           view of the High Court, the question of motive becomes more
           or less academic. On this point also, in our opinion, the learned
           Additional Sessions Judge has taken an absolutely wrong view.
           We have been taken through the entire evidence of P.Ws. 1, 2
           and 3 who are independent witnesses and against whom no
           animus has been established by the accused and we do not see
           any reason to disbelieve their evidence.      The High Court,
           therefore, rightly believed their evidence in order to accept the
           prosecution case.   We do not find any error of law in the
           approach made by the High Court."

<p id="p_35">34.         In the present case it has come into evidence that the

complainant and his sons, i.e., Yogesh Chander and Sukhwinder (deceased)

used to object the accused for abusing his father Nazar Ram on earlier

occasions as well. Hence, on the day of occurrence when the complainant

and his sons objected to the accused as to why he was abusing his father

and as to why he was asking him to go out of the house without any reason,

he got enraged, went inside the house and brought out a Sua with which he

first caused injury to PW Yogesh which hit him on his arm and he gave

another injury to Sukhwinder (deceased) in his chest which proved fatal.

Hence, it cannot be said that injuries were caused by the accused to the

deceased and his brother without any motive.

reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                  "7.    It is undisputed that some bad blood existed
            between the deceased on the one hand and the appellants on

            been very bitter but then it is too much to say that it could not
            possibly form a motive for the occurrence. The variation in
            human nature being so vast murders are known to have been
            actuated by much lesser motives. In any case, it is not a sine
            qua non for the success of the prosecution that the motive must
            be proved. So long as the other evidence remains convincing
            and is not open to reasonable doubt, a conviction may well be
            based on it."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">36.         As already discussed above, admittedly occurrence had taken

place in the courtyard of the house, which was common to the complainant

as well as to the accused. Accused had also taken the plea in his statement

under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_22">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. that the complainant and his          son Yogesh

Chander     had come and caused injuries to him and that Sukhwinder

received injuries at their hands when he intervened. However, accused has

failed to prove the said plea. Even father of the accused did not appear in

the witness box to support his plea. No other member in his family has also

been examined in defence. The plea taken is also a vague one. Even it has

not been mentioned as to whether they came armed with any weapon in

their hands. Hence, learned trial Court rightly came to the conclusion that

accused caused injury with Sua first to PW Yogesh Chander and then to

Sukhwinder resulting into his death.
</p>
<p id="p_38">37          It has further been argued by learned counsel for the accused

that even if prosecution evidence is believed, no offence punishable under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17"> Crl.A.No.886-DB of 2003                                  -18-</span>


<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_23">Section 302</a> IPC is made out against him and at the most the offence made

out is under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_24">Section 304</a> IPC. It is argued that there was no previous

enmity between prosecution witnesses and the Sukhwinder (deceased) on

the one hand, and the accused on the other hand.

<p id="p_40">39.          On the other hand, it has been argued by learned Additional

Advocate General, Punjab,      that the aforementioned authorities are not

applicable on the facts of the present case and that in this case intention of

the accused to commit murder of Sukhwinder can be gathered from the fact

that he went inside his house, brought out a Sua and caused injury first to

Yogesh Chander PW and then Sukhwinder (deceased) on vital part of the

body, i.e., in the chest.
</p>
<p id="p_41">40.          We do not find any merit in the submission of the learned

counsel for the accused on the point, rather submission of learned

Additional Advocate General, Punjab is having force. Complainant Pritam

Dass along with both his sons Yogesh Chander-PW8 and Sukhwinder

(deceased) had come in the courtyard of their house when they heard

accused abusing his father Nazar Ram and telling him to leave the house.

Prosecution witnesses were closely related to Nazar Ram and hence, it was

but natural for them to have come out of the house and asked the accused

as to why he was abusing his father. In this case injury was not caused to

prosecution witnesses by the accused there and then, rather he went inside

his house and brought out a weapon, i.e., Sua. He first caused injury to

Yogesh Chander PW and however, the same did not hit on his vital part and

the same hit only on his arm. He did not stop there and caused fatal injury

to Sukhwinder in his chest. Receipt of injury on the body of Sukhwinder,

nature of weapon used in causing the injury, and the manner in which injury

was caused clearly show that accused had the requisite intention to commit

murder of Sukhwinder.
</p>
<p id="p_42">41.         On this point reliance has also been placed on <a href="/doc/174852/" id="a_28">Suraj Bhan vs.

State of Haryana</a> 2003(1) RCR (Criminal) 250, wherein accused had given

one lathi blow with force on head of deceased causing fracture and death

and, however, accused was held guilty of offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_29">Section 302</a> IPC.

Relevant paragraph 9 of the judgment reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                  "9. Learned counsel then argued that since the appellant
            has dealt only a single blow, the offence if at all, cannot be the
            one falling under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_30">Section 302</a> IPC or at the most, it would
            come under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_31">Section 304</a>, Part II, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_32">IPC</a> since there is absolutely
            on material to show that the appellant had any knowledge that
            he would be causing an imminent death of the deceased. In
            this regard we have examined the medical evidence and the
            manner in which the assault in question has taken place. The
            doctor has opined that the injury was caused in such a manner
            as to cause the death of the deceased which on dissection found
            by the doctor, had caused a fracture of the left parietal bone
            causing extra dural haemotoma. The doctor has opined that the
            death was due to shock and haemorrhage and as a result of the
            head injury which was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary
            course of nature. We are of the opinion that the appellant must
            be attributed with the knowledge that when he used a lathi
            forcefully on the head of a person, he was likely to cause death
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19"> Crl.A.No.886-DB of 2003                                 -20-</span>


             of the said person, the prosecution had also proved that this
             appellant had the intention to kill the deceased, therefore, we
             have no hesitation in rejecting the argument of learned counsel
             on this count also."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">42.          In the present case the injury with a sharp edged weapon was

caused in the chest of deceased by the accused and as per deposition of

PW2-Dr.Ram Parshad Verma, the wound passed through the tissues of the

3rd inter costal space and entered in the upper part of thorax cavity passing

through the substances of upper lobe of left lung and that the left chest

cavity was full of dark clotted blood and that his death was caused due to

shock and haemorrhage resulting from the said injury. Hence, prosecution

has been able to prove that the appellant-accused had the intention to kill

the deceased. Hence, the trial Court has rightly convicted the accused for

offences under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_33">Sections 302</a> and <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_34">324</a> IPC, and sentenced him to undergo
