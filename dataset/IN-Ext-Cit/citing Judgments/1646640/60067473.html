        petitions, the fixation of rate of transportation of bulk petroleum

        be mentioned as "R.O."). Another category of tank lorry

        transporters, who are the free lancer tank lorry owners primarily

        which has been mentioned in the tender notice are oppressive in

        nature, claiming that if the they would accept the rate mentioned in

        notice was published in the year 2014-17 for transportation of bulk

        petroleum products vide Tender No. BSO /PLO/BULK/1/2014-17

         local transportation of the bulk petroleum products within the area

         of 39 Kilometers rate was quoted Rs.131 per KL which is the higher

         rate than the rate mentioned in the present tender notice. The

         different elements involved in transportation, have been increased,

         too much, such as under the heading of salary of the drivers and

         cleaners, having been increased 10 to 20%. The price of fuel i.e.

         diesel has increased from Rs.58.65 to Rs.61.58 per liter, rate of

         insurance of the Tank Truck has increased from Rs.30,000/- to

</p><p id="p_56">        5.              It has been submitted that the rate which has been

        provided in the tender notice published in the year 2014-17 is much

        higher than the rate mentioned in the present tender notice, fixing the

        rate is nothing but is an oppressive in nature, leaving the person

        without any profit. The citizen run their business with the prime

        motive to a fair return on the investment, but in the present case, the

        investment is very high but return is completely oppressive in

        nature. As no tender was received, the Indian Oil Corporation has

        bulk petroleum products, in which the general transporter and R.O.

        dealers used to participate and the tanker/trucks were required to

        used to take different elements into consideration. General

        transporters and the R.O. owners used to participate simultaneously

        therein, in this process, they were not in any way discriminated. L-1

        rate was applicable for both the classes of tank lorry owners

        allowing their tanker trucks to be engaged for transportation of

        petroleum products to their outlets. It was made clear to the R.O.

        dealers that if they refused to fill up and sign the E.O.I., their tanker

        trucks would not be inducted for transportation of the petroleum

        products of the Company. If R.O. dealers were interested to engage

        their tanker trucks in the new transportation system for the years

        2017-2020, they would submit the E.O.I. by 21.10.2016. At that

        time, the R.O. dealers were not knowing the L-1 rate as the rate

        fixed for general transporters adopting the process of the N.I.T.

        would be applicable to them. The association raised objection about

        the manner they were treated, but they were coerced to put their

        signature on the dotted line without any deviation to the terms

        conditions of the E.O.I. Later on, on 20.12.2016, the Indian Oil

        the general transporters category through N.I.T., would be made

        applicable to the R.O. dealers. The R.O. dealers shall not have right

        E.O.I during or after finalization of tender or refuse to accept L-1

        rates arrived in general tender, E.M.D. shall be forfeited and will be

        disqualified from participating in the existing tender. In view of

        aforesaid narrations of facts, no bargaining power is available to the

        R.O. dealers, whereas in the case of general transporters, if L-1

        candidates are not sufficiently available to carry the load of bulk

        petroleum products, in that circumstance, the Oil Corporation will

        negotiate with L-2 and L-3 transporters and so on and so forth.

        However, this privilege has not been given to the R.O. dealers.

        Further grievance is that the benefit of RTKM upto 4000 Km. has

        not been made available to the R.O. dealers, thereby they have been

        deprived to use the vehicle up to the limit which has been made

        available to the general transporters.

        which has been prescribed for the current period. So, fixation of the

        base rate is completely arbitrary, rather the same is oppressive in

         like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. Second point has been taken

         that earlier for the period 2014-17 the rate of transportation was

         higher, but the same has been reduced for the tender period 2017-

         2020 i.e. for three years. Third point has been taken that the fixation

         of rate of transportation is completely arbitrary and discriminately

         exercised the power in fixation of rate of transportation in view of

         the fact that the rate of diesel in the State of Bihar is higher than that

         the rate of diesel fixed in other States, the cost of transportation has

         increased, in view of upside revision of salary of driver and

        tanker. Before changing the policy, extensive market survey was

        done and it was found that the general transporters are in

        disadvantage position to formalized and rationalized, so the Indian

        Oil Corporation has brought the new scheme to reduce or remove

        disadvantages of general transporter.

<p id="p_101">
</p><p id="p_102">        31.             It has been submitted that the R.O. dealers-cum-

        transporters are supposed to transport petroleum products for the use

        of their own R.Os and for consortium. The tender finalization policy

        was revised with effect from October, 2016. Earlier, the tenders

        were finalized for dealers and transporters simultaneously. However,

        as per the new policy, the dealer has to submit the E.O.I. for own

        T.T. and the L-1 rate has to be accepted which will be finalized

        through the public tender of general transporters. In the earlier

        system, when both the R.O. dealers-cum-transporters as well as the

        general transporters used to participate simultaneously, it was found

        that the general transporters were facing problem as after allotment

        of work, got attachment with R.O. dealer, in currency period of

        contract on induction of their own fresh tank truck lorry by R.O.

        dealer, the working and business area of general transporters got

        diminished, thereby effected, causing serious prejudice to the

        business interests of the general transporters as has been explained in

        following manner; if „A‟ is R.O. dealer and general transporter was

        selected to supply the bulk petroleum product and during the

        currency of the contract „A‟ R.O. dealer purchases new tank truck

        lorry for the supply of their own R.O. centre and for consortium,

        automatically, on induction of fresh tank lorry would hamper the

        business of general transporters. As admittedly the R.O. dealers

        would prefer to use their own transport tanker for the supply of bulk

        petroleum products to their R.O. centre and for consortium. To avoid

        the conflict of interest of R.O. dealers and the general transporters, it

        has been submitted that to demarcate the area, which would be

        occupied by the R.O. dealers, showing Expression of Interest left

        out, retail outlets were available for the general transporters, to

        rationalize the system, the policy of E.O.I. has been introduced,

        whatever, L-1 rate for general transporters will equally and

        identically be applicable to the R.O. dealers.

        the R.O. dealers transport bulk petroleum products through their

        own T.T. would create a peace in mind. The moment, T.T. comes

        under the control of the R.O. dealer will not remain dependent on the

        wisdom and choice of general transporters. The R.O. dealers

        constitute different and distinct class, they were treated in different

        manner as the R.O. dealers-cum-transporters are required to make a

        security deposit of Rs.50,000/-, whereas, the general transporters has

        to deposit Rs.8,00,000/- that itself shows that both have been treated

        differently for different purposes with the object sought to be

        achieved, which has been explained hereinabove. It has further been

        stated that the condition of invitation for tender are not open to the

        judicial scrutiny unless the same is tailor-made to benefit any

        particular tenderer or class of tenderers. In the present case, the

        petitioners have failed to show the conditions have been

        incorporated just to accommodate a particular class of transporters

        or the same are detrimental to the public interest. The invitation of

        tender is not a compulsion, whoever desire may participate there and

        the conditions attached with N.I.T. or E.O.I. cannot be said to be

        suffers from arbitrariness. The principle of fixation of rate of

        transportation and the component which were taken into

        transportation charge will be fixed whereas, there the issue is

        royalty, completely divergent issue having no nexus to each other

        and as such, that case is not applicable in the present case, but to

        buttress his argument, he placed reliance on the decision of the

        Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/187501619/" id="a_13">Michigan Rubber (India)

        Limited vs. State of Karnataka and Others</a>, reported in 2012(8)

        within the bounds of reasonableness. In the present case, the fixation

        of L-1 rate of transportation having been fixed through public tender

        for general transporters, thereby they have been given a far superior

        benefit than to the R.O. dealers, who have employed their tankers. It

        has been argued that the petitioners should not be confined to the

        condition made in the Expression of Interest (E.O.I.) but they should

        also be treated identically in the matter of rate of transportation

        down in the manner that it will vary at the same rate as and when the

        rate is enhanced to other general tank lorry transporters, if it is not

        read down in such manner, it would violate the <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article-14</a> of the

        Constitution of India. It has also been argued that judicial scrutiny is

        not only applicable in the case of tailor-made rate to benefit a

        particular tenderer or class of tenderer, but it will equally be

        applicable if the classification does not satisfy twin test of

        reasonableness of classification and the objects sought to be

        achieved. He has further stated that even if the reasonable

        classification test is satisfied, but unless it is satisfied that the

        classification has been made for a particular goal to be achieved,

        cannot be said to have been tested and affirmed on the anvil of

        that this has been done in order to stop the pilferages of the Oil and

        quality of the petroleum products will not be compromised, as it

        appears that the classification has been done with sole purpose that

        the R.O. transporters should remain in peace and will be able to lift

        the petroleum products without any disturbance in the mind and it

        will get a pure material without having any mental distress, cannot

        be said to have satisfied the test of reasonableness for the object

        par with the general transporters. It has further been stated that the

        rate which has been mentioned in paragraph no. 21 of the counter

        affidavit cannot said to be reasonable if the table no. C and D minus

        10 percent is taken for classification of the profit, in such

        depends on various factors including factors such as, loading in

        shifts, bottom/top loading. While fixing the rate, the location factors

        are important in arriving at the estimated transportation rate and the

        said rates can vary from one location to other location as Patna

        Terminal is far better equipped than Barauni Terminal because

        terminal operating at Patna is carried out in two shifts which help in

        drastic reduction in down time of vehicles as the vehicles can take 2-

        3 loads in a single day, depending upon the distance of previous

        trips. Even, when the distance is long, upon its return it gets an

        opportunity for immediate loading if reporting between 0600 hours

        to 2200 hours at Patna Terminal. Whereas, Barauni Terminal

        operators only between 0830 hours and 1700 hours, gets an

        opportunity for loading and the remaining period gets converted into

        down time as the Barauni Terminal being a single shift operating

        Barauni Terminal have to stand idle for taking next load due to

        single shift, in order to compensate the loss, the operators at Barauni

        has been provided higher rate than to the Patna Terminal. While

        fixing the rate at Barauni Terminal the essential and proper elements

        essential commodities fixed under <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_19">Essential Commodities Act</a>. The

        Hon‟ble Supreme Court has held that the Court cannot sit in appeal

        grounds of denial of the right guaranteed by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_20">Article 14</a>, if it is

        that it was open to the subordinate legislative body to prescribe and

        has jurisdiction of interference to enquire into the question, in

        subordinate legislating body which held the inquiry and became a

        basis for fixation of rate of objectives on the basis of such inquiry.

        The provision for such an enquiry is generally an enabling provision,

        intended to facilitate the subordinate legislative body to obtain

        relevant information from all and whatever source considered

        necessary. It is the sort of enquiry which the legislature itself may

        cause to be made before legislating, an enquiry which will not confer

        any right on anyone other than the enquiring body. So the inquiry

        has to be conducted keeping in mind the aim and object for

                    is not to detract from the character of the activity as
                    legislative and not quasi judicial. But, where the legislature
                    has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing, no one
                    can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read

                    be questioned on the ground that the considerations stipulated
                    by the order as relevant were not taken into account. It may
                    also be questioned on any ground on which a subordinate
                    legislation may be questioned, such as, being contrary to
                    constitutional or other statutory provisions. It may be
                    questioned on the ground of a denial of the right guaranteed
                    by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article-14</a> if it is arbitrary, that is, if either the guidelines
                    prescribed for the determination are arbitrary or if, even
                    though the guidelines are not arbitrary, the guidelines are
                    worked in an arbitrary fashion. There is no question before us
                    that paragraph 3 prescribes any arbitrary guideline. It was,
                    however, submitted that the guidelines were not adhered to
                    and that facts and figures were arbitrarily assumed. We do
                    not propose to delve into the question whether there has been
                    any such arbitrary assumption of facts and figures. We think
                    that if there is any grievance on that score, the proper thing
                    for the manufacturers to do is bring it to the notice of the
                    Government in their applications for review. The learned
                    counsel argued that they were unable to bring these facts to
                    the notice of the Government as they were not furnished the
                    basis on which the prices were fixed. On the other hand, it has
                    been pointed out in the counter affidavits filed on behalf of the

                    furnished in the course of the hearing of the review

                    that particulars were not furnished. We are satisfied that the
                    procedure followed by the Government in furnishing the
                    requisite particulars at the time of the hearing of the review
                    applications is sufficient compliance with the demands of fair
                    play in the case of the class of persons claiming to be affected
                    by the fixation of maximum price under the Drugs (Prices
                    Control) Order. As already stated by us, manufacturers of
                    bulk drugs who claim to be affected by the Drugs (prices
                    Control) Order, belong to a class of persons who are well and
                    fully informed of every intricate detail and particular which is
                    required to be taken into account in determining the price. In
                    most cases, they are the sale manufacturers of the bulk drug
                    and even if they are not the sole manufacturers, they belong to
                    the very select few who manufacture the bulk drug. It is
                    impossible to conceive that they cannot sit across the table
                    and discuss item by item with the reviewing authority unless
                    they are furnished in advance full details and particulars. The
                    affidavits filed on behalf of the Union of India show that the
                    procedure which is adopted in hearing the review
                    applications is to discuss across the table the various items
                    that have been taken into account. We do not consider that
                    there is anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the
                    Government. If necessary it is always open to the
                    manufacturers to seek a short adjournment of the hearing of
                    the review application to enable them to muster more facts
                    and figures on their side. Indeed we find that the hearing
                    given to the manufacturers is often protected. As we said we
                    do not propose to examine this question as we do not want to
                    constitute ourselves into a court of appeal over the
                    Government in the matter of price fixation.

                    the determination of rates of royalty for supply of forest
                    produce to paper mills is not governed by any statute or
                    a statutory order. The Government while entering into
                    the agreement with the paper mills had undertaken to
                    supply a certain specified quantity of wood each year for
                    a period of 20 years. The government had not assured
                    the mills that it will supply bamboo and other forest
                    produce required by them at a particular rate. Nor was
                    there an agreement between them with respect to the
                    manner in which the rates of royalty would be
                    determined. There was no assurance that the mills would
                    be consulted or associated while fixing the rates of
                    royalty. Even where the matter is governed by a statute

                      determination of the price. For example, if the

                      prescribed the factors which should guide the
                      determination of the price, we will, if necessary, enquire
                      into the question whether the policy and the factors are
                      present to the mind of the authorities specifying the
                      price. But our examination will stop there. We will go
                      no further. We will not deluge ourselves with more facts
                      and figures. The assembling of the raw materials and
                      the mechanics of price fixation are the concern of the
                      executive and we leave it to them. And, we will not re-

                      demonstrably injurious to some manufacturers or
                      producers. The court will, of course, examine if there is

                    whether the considerations for fixing the price mentioned
                    in the statute or the statutory order have been kept in
                    mind while fixing the price and whether these factors
                    have guided the determination. The courts would not go
                    beyond that point. In the present appeals, there is no law,
                    or any statutory provision laying down the criteria or the
                    principles which must be followed, or which must guide
                    the determination of rates of royalty. No doubt, any
                    arbitrary action taken by the State would be subject to
                    the scrutiny by the courts because arbitrariness is the
                    very antithesis of rule of law. But this does not mean that
                    this Court would act as an appellate authority over the
                    determination of rates of royalty by the government.
                    Government is the owner of the products. While it had
                    agreed to supply a particular quantity every year for
                    specified period, it had never agreed to supply at a
                    particular rate; not did it stipulate with the mill owners
                    the basis upon which it would determine the rates of
                    royalty. It is open to the government to fix such price as
                    it thinks appropriate having regard to public interest,
                    which interalia, may include interest of revenue,
                    environmental, ecology, the need of mills and the
                    requirements of other consumers. The price is not to be
                    fixed keeping in mind the requirements of the mills alone.

                    therefore, not to be held identical with the doctrine of

                        "15. While the discretion to change the policy in exercise
                        of the executive power, when not trammelled by any
                        statute or rule is wide enough, what is imperative and
                        implicit in terms of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_58">Article 14</a> is that a change in policy
                        must be made fairly and should not give the impression
                        that it was so done arbitrarily or by any ulterior criteria.
                        The wide sweep of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_59">Article 14</a> and the requirement of every
                        State action qualifying for its validity on this touchstone
                        irrespective of the field of activity of the State is an
                        accepted tenet. The basic requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_60">Article 14</a> is
                        fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in
                        essence and substance is the heartbeat of fair play.
                        Actions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review
                        only to the extent that the State must act validly for a
                        discernible reason, not whimsically for any ulterior

                        test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any

                        itself shall be labelled as arbitrary. Every State action
                        must be informed by reason and it follows that an act

                        it would be legitimate to take into consideration the
                        national priorities and adopt trade policies. As noted
                        above, the ultimate test is whether on the touchstone of
                        reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed.

</p><p id="p_158">                        23. Reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an
                        objective manner and from the standpoint of interests of
                        the general public and not from the standpoint of the
                        interests of persons upon whom the restrictions have been
                        imposed or upon abstract consideration. A restriction
                        cannot be said to be unreasonable merely because in a
                        given case, it operates harshly. In determining whether
                        there is any unfairness involved; the nature of the right
                        alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of
                        the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil
                        sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the
                        imposition, the prevailing condition at the relevant time,
                        enter into judicial verdict. The reasonableness of the
                        legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect
                        to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in
                        question. Canalisation of a particular business in favour
                        of even a specified individual is reasonable where the
                        interests of the country are concerned or where the

                    experience as such and if he did not satisfy this condition of

                    This was the standard or norm of eligibility laid down by

                    actions to be judged and it must scrupulously observe those
                    Standards on pain of invalidation of an act in violation of
                    them. This rule was enunciated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in

                        of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I

                    welfare and social service functions, increasing control of
                    material and economic resources and large scale assumption
                    of industrial and commercial activities by the State, the power
                    of the executive Government to affect the lives of the people is
                    steadily growing. The attainment of socio-economic justice
                    being a conscious end of State policy, there is a vast and
                    inevitable increase in the frequency with which ordinary
                    citizens come into relationship of direct encounter with State
                    power-holders. This renders it necessary to structure and
                    restrict the power of the executive Government so as to
                    prevent its arbitrary application or exercise. Whatever be the
                    concept of the rule of law, whether it be the meaning given by
                    Dicey in his "The Law of the Constitution" or the definition
                    given by Hayek in his "Road to Serfdom' and 'Constitution of
                    liberty" or the exposition set-forth by Harry Jones in his "The
                    Rule of Law and the Welfare State", there is as pointed out by
                    Mathew, J., in his article on "The Welfare State, Rule of Law
                    and Natural Justice" in "democracy Equality and Freedom,"
                    "substantial agreement is in juristic thought that the great
                    purpose of the rule of law notion is the protection of the
                    individual against arbitrary exercise of power, wherever it is
                    found". It is indeed unthinkable that in a democracy governed
                    by the rule of law the executive Government or any of its
                    officers should possess arbitrary power over the interests of
                    the individual. Every action of the executive Government must
                    be informed with reason and should be free from
                    arbitrariness. That is the very essence of the rule of law and
                    its bare minimal requirement. And to the application of this

                    principle it makes no difference whether the exercise of the
                    power involves affection of some right or denial of some
                    privilege.

<p id="p_175">                    11. Today the Government, is a welfare State, is the regulator
                    and dispenser of special services and provider of a large
                    number of benefits, including jobs contracts, licences, quotas,
                    mineral rights etc. The Government pours forth wealth,
                    money, benefits, services, contracts, quotas and licences. The
                    valuables dispensed by Government take many forms, but they
                    all share one characteristic. They are steadily taking the
                    place of traditional forms of wealth. These valuables which
                    derive from relationship to Government are of many kinds.
                    They comprise social security benefits, cash grants for
                    political sufferers and the whole scheme of State and local
                    welfare. Then again, thousands of people are employed in the
                    State and the Central Governments and local authorities.
                    Licences are required before one can engage in many kinds of
                    business or work. The power of giving licences means power
                    to withhold them and this gives control to the Government or
                    to the agents of Government on the lives of many people.
                    Many individuals and many more businesses enjoy largesse in
                    the form of Government contracts. These contracts often
                    resemble subsidies. It is virtually impossible to lose money on
                    them and many enterprises are set up primarily to do business
                    with Government. Government owns and controls hundreds of
                    acres of pubic land valuable for mining and other purposes.
                    These resources are available for utilisation by private
                    corporations and individuals by way of lease or licence. All
                    these mean growth in the Government largess and with the
                    increasing magnitude and range of governmental functions as
                    we move closer to a welfare State, more and more of our
                    wealth consists of these new forms. Some of these forms of
                    wealth may be in the nature of legal rights but the large
                    majority of them are in the nature of privileges But on that

                    account, can it be said that they do not enjoy any legal
                    protection ? Can they be regarded as gratuity furnished by
                    the State so that the State may withhold, grant or revoke it at
                    its pleasure? Is the position of the Government in this respect
                    the same as that of a private giver? We do not think so. The
                    law has not been slow to recognise the importance of this new
                    kind of wealth and the need to protect individual interest in it
                    and with that end in view, it has developed new forms of
                    protection. some interests in Government largess, formerly
                    regarded as privileges, have been recognised as rights while
                    others have been given legal protection not only by forging
                    procedural safeguards but also by confining/structuring and
                    checking Government discretion in the matter of grant of such
                    largesse. The discretion of the Government has been held to
                    be not unlimited in that the Government cannot give or
                    withhold largess in its arbitrary discretion or at its sweet will.
                    It is insisted, as pointed out by Prof. Reich in an especially
                    stimulating article on "The New Property" in 73 Yale Law
                    Journal 733, "that Government action be based on standards
                    that are not arbitrary or unauthorised." "The Government
                    cannot be permitted to say that it will give jobs or enter into
                    contracts or issue quotas or licences only in favour of those
                    having grey hair or belonging to a particular political party
                    or professing a particular religions faith. The Government is
                    still the Government when it acts in the matter of granting
                    largesse and it cannot act arbitrarily. It does not stand in the
                    same position as a private individual.

                    relevant principle which is non- discriminatory: it must not be
                    guided by any extraneous or irrelevant considerations,
                    because that would be denial of equality. The principle of
                    reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well as
                    philosophically an essential element of equality or non-
                    arbitrariness is protected by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_78">Article 14</a> and it must
                    characterise every State action, whether it be under authority
                    of law or in exercise of executive power without making of
                    law. The State cannot, therefore, act arbitrarily in entering
                    into relationship, contractual or otherwise with a third party,
                    but its action must conform to some standard or norm which
                    is rational and non-discriminatory. This principle was
                    recognised and applied by a Bench of this Court presided
                    over by Ray, C.J., in <a href="/doc/743328/" id="a_79">Erusian Equipment and Chemicals v.
                    State of West Bengal</a> (supra) where the learned Chief Justice
                    pointed out that

                        "the State can carry on executive function by making a
                        law or without making a law. The exercise of such powers
                        and functions in trade by the State is subject to Part III of
                        the Constitution. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_80">Article 14</a> speaks of equality before the
                        law and equal protection of the laws. Equality of
                        opportunity should apply to matters of public contracts.
                        The State has the right to trade. The State has there the
                        duty to observe equality. An ordinary individual can

                    State is entitled to refuse to enter into relationship with any

        illegality, which means the decision maker must understand

        correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must

        give effect to it. Second, irrationality, namely, Wednesbury

        unreasonableness, it applies to a decision which is so outrageous in

        its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible

        person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could

        have arrived at, and third is procedural impropriety, but the Court

        has said that the action of the State must not be suffers from vice of

        jurisdiction to interfere in the matter, but also mentioned that the

        has further held that Judicial review is not concerned with the merits

        of a decision, but to test the manner in which the decision was made.

        The Judicial review is entirely different from an ordinary appeal. It

        is effective tool of the Court to control the administrative decision

        without substituting its own decision, and contrast to the power of

        appeal where the appellate tribunal substitutes by its own decision

        on the merits for that of the administrative officer. The judicial

        review is a great weapon in the hands of the Judge to correct illegal

        and arbitrary exercise of power.

         authorities who have to enter into contract, giving them liberty to

         have been taken in bona fide manner although not strictly following

         principle laid down by Justice Holmes, that Courts while judging

                      terms. If the decisions have been taken in bona fide manner
                      although not strictly following the norms laid down by the

                      constitutional validity of executive decisions must grant

                          transactions". The activities of the Government have a
                          public element and, therefore, there should be fairness
                          and equality. The State need not enter into any contract

                          without discrimination and without unfair procedure.'

</p><p id="p_186">                    94. The principles deducible from the above are :

                      "(1) The modem trend points to judicial restraint in
                      administrative action.
</p>
<p id="p_187">                      (2) The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely
                      reviews the manner in which the decision was made.

                      (3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the
                      administrative decision. If a review of the administrative
                      decision is permitted it will be substituting its own decision,
                      without the necessary expertise which itself may be fallible.

                      (4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to
                      judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is in the
                      realm of contract.
</p>
<p id="p_188">                      Normally speaking, the decision to accept the tender or
                      award the contract is reached by process of negotiations
                      through several tiers. More often than not, such decisions
                      are made qualitatively by experts.
</p>
<p id="p_189">                      (5) The Government must have freedom of contract. In
                      other words, a fair play in the joints is a necessary
                      concomitant for an administrative body functioning in an

                      administrative sphere or quasi-administrative sphere.
                      However, the decision must not only be tested by the
                      application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness
                      (including its other facts pointed out above) but must be
                      free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by
                      mala fides.
</p>
<p id="p_190">                      (6) Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative
                      burden on the administration and lead to increased and
                      unbudgeted expenditure."
</p>
<p id="p_191">                    Based on these principles we will examine the facts of this

        commercial decision considerations which are paramount are

        commercial considerations. The State can choose its own method to

        arrive at a decision. It can fix its own terms of invitation to tender

        and that is not open to judicial scrutiny. It can enter into negotiations

        before finally deciding to accept one of the offers made to it. Price

        need not always be the sole criterion for awarding a contract, but the

        selection should be bona fide based on reasonableness. It may not

        accept the offer even though it happens to be the highest tenderer.

                    relaxation. It may not accept the offer even though it happens

                    this Court, the „classification‟ test was adopted which allowed
                    for a classification between entities as long as it was based on
                    an intelligible differentia and displayed a rational nexus with
                    the ultimate objective of the policy. <a href="/doc/1905739/" id="a_130">Budhan Chaudhry vs.
                    State of Bihar</a> referred to in <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_131">Shri Ram Krishna Dalmiya vs.
                    Shri Justice S.R. Tendolkar</a> explained it in the following
                    terms: (Budhan Chaudhry case, A.I.R. p.193, para-5)

                        "5....It is now well established that while <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_132">article 14</a>
                        forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable
                        classification for the purposes of legislation. In order,
                        however, to pass the test of permissible classification two
                        conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the
                        classification must be founded on an intelligible
                        differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are
                        grouped together from others left out of the group and, (ii)
                        that that differentia must have a rational relation to the
                        object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.
                        The classification may be founded on different bases;
                        namely, geographical, or according to objects or
                        occupations or the like. What is necessary is that there
                        must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the
                        object of the Act under consideration. It is also well
                        established by the decisions of this Court that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_133">Article 14</a>
                        condemns discrimination not only by a substantive law but
                        also by a law of procedure."

                    Bhagwati J. (as his Lordship then was) articulated the
                    dynamic      nature     of    equality   and   borrowing   from
                    Shakespeare‟s Macbeth, said that the concept must not be
                    "cribbed, cabined and confined" within doctrinaire limits:
                    (SCC p.38, para 85)
                      "85... Now, what is the content and reach of this great
                      equalising principle? It is a founding faith, to use the words
                      of Bose. J., "a way of life", and it must not be subjected to
                      a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot
                      countenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing
                      scope and meaning, for to do so would be to violate its
                      activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with
                      many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be "cribbed,
                      cabined and confined" within traditional and doctrinaire

        or policy decision has been challenged on the ground of

        discrimination, then the Court has to see whether there is rationality

        in creating two classes and the classification is based on rationality

        with the object sought to be achieved. So it can be bifurcated on

        three parts; first the classification of two classes is based on

        rationality; second, it has to be examined whether creation of two

        class has been made with any object sought to be achieved, by

        applying a rational discrimination and third, it has to be seen

        whether the fixation of rate for transportation has been arrived after

        taking into consideration element and component which are

        necessary for fixation of rate of transportation or the elements which

        are necessary has been left out or decision arrived is so arbitrary, no

        to such conclusion, fairness and reasonableness has been observed.

        deduced hereinabove. It appears from the counter affidavit of the

        Indian Oil Corporation that it has constituted a team of Cost

        Accountant, they have conducted the market survey with respect to

        earning of general transporters vis-à-vis R.O. dealers while

        transporting the bulk petroleum products and it was found that the

        general transporters were adversely affected on account of following

        facts; R.O. dealers as well as the general transporters were called to

        participate together in the tender for transportation of bulk petroleum

        products and L-1 rate of transportation was applicable to both

        classes transporters. During market survey, it was found that some

        time, the R.O. dealers used to prefer the transportation through the

        general transporters, during currency of the contract, if they

        themselves purchased the tank lorry for the purposes of

        transportation of bulk petroleum product, in such circumstance, it

        was found, such R.O. dealers were employing their own tanker lorry

        and lost interest with general transporters. The interest of general

        transporters were adversely affected to the extent that they were kept

        out of the job of transportation by the R.O., to mitigate this

        predicament of general transporters as well as maintain purity of the

        petroleum products supplied to the R.O. for creation of peace in

        mind, R.O. dealers have been offered that they are at liberty to

        employ their lorry for transportation of petroleum products called

        upon them to show their Expression of Interest, R.O. dealers would

        be benefited from this new scheme to keep movement of T.T. under

        their control, they would not be required to compromise with the

        quality of the petroleum products, and for that the Corporation took

        policy decision to introduce the system Expression of Interest

        (E.O.I.), notifying the R.O. dealers if they intended to introduce their

        own lorry they would be allowed in terms and conditions made

        under E.O.I. in order to find out the actual number of R.O. dealers

        are interested for carrying the bulk petroleum product and after

        identification of the petrol pump where the petroleum products will

        be supplied by the R.O. dealers left out the petroleum outlet, would

        be made available to the general transporters.


</p><p id="p_218">        67.             One of the conditions mentioned in the E.O.I., once

        given option, cannot be allowed to resile from the option, the left out

        outlets were to be identified by the Indian Oil Corporation and

        accordingly, the N.I.T. was published, calling upon the general

        transporters and the R.O. dealers to participate, the L-1 rate which

        would be fixed after the finalization of the tender, will be applicable

        with regard to transportation of bulk petroleum products by the R.O.

        dealers. On comparison of the condition mentioned in the E.O.I. and

        N.I.T. it reflects different and distinct condition has been attached

        for R.O. transporters vis-à-vis as E.M.D. cum-security amount is a

        meager amount of Rs.50,000/- whereas, the general transporters has

        to deposit E.M.D.-cum- security amount of Rs.8,00,000/-. It can

        safely be said that the R.O. transporters dealers are quite different

        and constitute distinct class than to the general transporters. They

        not only earned the profit from running their outlets, but also they

        have been allowed to participate in the E.O.I. as well as the N.I.T.

        itself indicates, both are not one and the same rather, two different

        and distinct classes, which cannot be said to be irrational

        classification with the object that there should be continuity of

        business during currency of contract to the general transporter with

        the surety of fair and proper return. The new policy chalked out with

        the purpose to identify the left over outlet which were not opted,

        R.O. dealer transporters would be made available for public auction

        for general transporters to avoid overlapping which would not cause

        adverse impact upon the general transporters or the R.O. dealer

        transporters. Another angle, for R.O. dealers, the movement of

        transportation will remain under their control, will not be dependent

        on other transporters, which will give benefit to avoid in pilferage,

        security of quality and purity of petroleum products. So in my view,

        it cannot be said the new policy, creating two classes transporters

        devoid of object sought to be achieved, but the creation of two

        classes are based on rationality. So, this Court is of the view the new

        scheme satisfies the test of primary judicial review as has been held

        in Om Kumar‟s case (supra).

        as has been claimed the R.O. dealer transporters should be given the

        identical privilege as has been given to the general transporters.

        Primarily, the thrust has been laid on clause, whereby it has been

        stated that if sufficient number of L-1 transporters are not available,

        the Corporation would negotiate with L-2, L-3 and L-4 for

        transportation of petroleum products, in such situation, general

        transporters would be in better position, so the claim has been made

        same benefit would be made available to the R.O. dealers

        transporters. It has been argued that when the E.O.I. was circulated

        they were not knowing the L-1 rate or the proposed approximately

        base L-1 rate, after two and half months they floated the N.I.T. and

        fixed the estimated base rate, which was completely unknown to

        them. It has further been stated that the benefit of L-2, L-3 and L-4

        rate has been given to the general transporters, but the R.O. dealers

        have been deprived, in such circumstance, the L-1 rate which has

        been mentioned in the terms of the E.O.I. should be read in such a

        manner that it will vary as and when the rate of transportation fixed

        for the general transporters varies. The E.O.I. is invitation to the

        tender, stipulating terms and conditions, no compulsion was exerted

        to accept or opt E.O.I, it is the wisdom of R.O. dealer to participate

        in the E.O.I. as it was not compulsion from the Indian Oil

        Corporation to accept it, but it was made clear whoever are

        interested they may participate in the E.O.I. and in view of the

        judgment passed in <a href="/doc/884513/" id="a_146">Tata Cellular vs. Union of India</a> (supra) and

        <a href="/doc/899938/" id="a_147">Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa</a> (supra) the terms of the invitation

        to the tender is outside the judicial review unless the same is

        arbitrary, tailor-made to grant advantage to certain persons, violates

        <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_148">Article-14</a> of the Constitution of India, in my view, there was no

        compulsion for the R.O. dealers to participate in the E.O.I. and when

        they accepted the terms of the E.O.I. knowing well L-1 rate will be

        declared later on in the event of public auction for general

        transporters, where estimated transportation rate would be decided,

        cannot be a ground for the Court to interfere in the matter inasmuch

        as the petitioners have not shown in what manner the public interest

        is being affected as the present matter is out and out a commercial

        venture falls squarely in the realm of contract and the Court should

        keep his hand off while exercising the power of judicial review.

        petitioners that the Oil Corporation should have provided the

        estimated rate while calling upon the R.O. dealers to participate in

        the E.O.I. proceeding is not acceptable in view of the fact, if they

        were feeling aggrieved they should have asked clarification about

        the estimated rate, but instead of doing so, they have entered into the

        contract and now complaining about arbitrary condition of E.O.I.

        beyond the pale of judicial scrutiny, is completely not permissible in

        the eye of law to test the reasonableness terms of E.O.I. The R.O.

        dealers transporters cannot claim equality with general transporters,

        as both constitute different and distinct class, both classes have

        different and distinct condition and stipulations, both stand on

        different platform, equality cannot be claimed in unequal.


</p><p id="p_222">        70.             Now, the question has been raised by the petitioners

        that the rate which has been fixed, is punitive in nature. Even in

        certain cases, the rates in the State of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh

        are batter than to the Patna. It has been argued by the Corporation,

        the rates are being fixed taking into account several factors, market

        force, dependent upon the nature of road, distance of terminal,

        technology used in loading at the terminal, the rate of transportation

        is fixed taking into consideration the different elements such as

        loading in shifts, bottom/top loading, location factors are equally

        important in arriving into the estimated transportation rate. During

        the argument, they have pointed out that the Barauni terminal rate is

        better rate than to the Patna Terminal rate, it has been replied in the

        counter affidavit, the working hours of Patna Terminal is 06:00 to

        22:00 hours whereas at Barauni terminal TTs available only between

        08:30 hours and 17:00 hours and is working in single shifts, whereas

        Patna Terminal have an opportunity to have the double shifts. In

        paragraph no.16 of the counter affidavit different element which

        have been considered while fixing the rate has been mentioned,

        which are as follows:-

</p><p id="p_224">        71.              It has been argued by the Indian Oil Corporation that

        the transportation rate is fixed on terminal to terminal basis, taking

        into account the several factors including loading system, top

        loading is based on different mechanism than to bottom loading, in

        this system, the tanker owner is required to install special type of

        fitting, has to bear heavy cost of amount, which is kept in mind

        while fixing rate of transportation to compensate cost incurred in

        extra fitting.
</p>
<p id="p_225">
</p><p id="p_226">        72.              In such view of the matter, it is very difficult to say that

        in the present case the fixation of the rate is based upon any

        irrationality. In view of the decision passed in the case of Cynamide

        India Ltd. and Anr (supra) and Rayalseem Paper Mill Ltd. (supra)

        this Court is required to see the fairness and rationality has been

        observed in fixing the rate of transportation, as also the fact that

        whether the essential elements which are necessary for fixation of

        the transportation rate has been taken into consideration or not. This

        Court does not feel any irregularity committed by the Indian Oil

        Corporation for fixating the rate of transportation for the reasons as

        stated hereinabove.

        itself. The Court has rejected the submission and held that price

        fixation is not within the function nor forte of the Court nor

        concerned with policy, nor rate, but examination is limited, whether

        proper factors have been taken into consideration, in view of

        aforesaid preposition, the Court has to see that while determining the

        rate of transportation whether the necessary elements for arriving to

        a proper conclusion have been taken into consideration, as the

        fixation of rate of transportation is not based on statutory provision

        similar to that case where also fixation of royalty was not based

        upon the statutory provision, but examination was confined on the

        principle of reasonableness on the touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_149">Article-14</a> and

        while making a judicial scrutiny the Superior Court does not act as

        an appellate authority.

        interference of this Court is very limited with respect to the fixation

        of the rate, it is found that necessary components have been taken

        into consideration for fixation of rate as has been explained in

        paragraph no.16 of the Counter affidavit proper factors have been

        taken into consideration in fixation of transportation rate. It is also

        very difficult to accept the contention that in certain special

        circumstances transporters are offered the L-2 rate, in the event of

        non- availability of sufficient L-1 transporter, the identical relief

        should be given to them as the terms of the stipulation in the E.O.I.

        is quite lucid, different to the N.I.T. Both constitute a different and

        distinct class based on different consideration with different

        stipulation. So, asking the same opportunity or benefit which has

        been given to the general transporters, in my view, is not permissible

        and cannot be accepted on the premise, unequal cannot be treated

        equal as well as equal cannot be treated unequal, if submission is

        accepted, it amounts to treating unequal as equal, is prohibited in

        <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_150">Article-14</a> of the Constitution. In net result, if the R.O. dealers

        transporters are treated equal to the general transporters, would

        the rate, even they have done their exercise, in my view, is not

        acceptable as primarily, the report of the Expert Committee cannot

        be a subject matter of judicial review as has been held in the case of
