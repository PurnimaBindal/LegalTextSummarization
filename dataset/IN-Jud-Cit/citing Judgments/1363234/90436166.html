HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER

JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER

Preface:-

1.      The captioned writ petition falls in a narrow compass. There are two
short issues which arise for consideration in this case. First, whether the
petitioner's candidature is rightly resisted by the University of Delhi (in
short "University") on the ground that he produced the Other Backward
Classes (OBC) certificate on a date beyond the cut-off date when the reason
communicated via its official web-portal is "non-payment of fees"?
1.1.    In other words, can the affidavit of the University set out reasons
different from what was officially communicated to the petitioner?



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                         Pg.1 of 24
 1.2.    Second, even if it is assumed that the University can take recourse to
the defence, which is, that the petitioner's OBC certificate dated 07.09.2019
was produced after the cut-off date and hence it cannot be considered - is
such a defence valid in the facts and circumstances obtaining in the instant
case?
Background:-
2.      Thus, in order to adjudicate upon these core issues, the following
broad facts are required to be noticed.
2.1.    The petitioner's family hails from Mathura in the State of Uttar
Pradesh. The petitioner's father belongs to the "Quraishi" community. The
petitioner's parents, however, carry on business in Kolkata in the State of
West Bengal.
2.2.    The petitioner was born on 16.11.1993 in Kolkata.
2.3.    The petitioner cleared his grade-XII exam in 2013 from a school
affiliated to the Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Uttar
Pradesh.
2.4.    The petitioner obtained a degree in B.A. (Hons.), in 2019, from Baba
Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Uttar Pradesh.
2.5.    In June 2019, the University invited applications for various courses
and programmes including the 3-year LL.B. programme (in short "LL.B.
programme"). The petitioner filed an application qua the LL.B. programme
under the OBC (Non-Creamy Layer) category [in short "OBC-NCL
category"].
2.6.    As required, the petitioner sat for the Delhi University Entrance Test,
2019 (in short "entrance exam"). Based on the result of the entrance exam,
the petitioner's name was shown in the 2nd combined admission list at S. No.



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                            Pg.2 of 24
 95.    This list disclosed that the petitioner had been ranked 139 in the
entrance exam.
2.7.    Pertinently, even before the 2nd combined admission list was issued,
on 15.06.2019, the petitioner had applied to the office of the Welfare Officer
for Backward Classes in Kolkata, State of West Bengal, for issuance of an
OBC certificate. This step was taken by the petitioner under a bona fide
belief that he could obtain the certificate from the State of West Bengal
being the State in which he was born.
2.8.    On 01.08.2019, the petitioner approached the concerned officer in the
University along with the requisite documents for seeking admission. On
that date, the petitioner's request for grant of admission was not entertained.
2.9.    According to the petitioner, the impediment put forth, albeit orally,
was that he did not possess the OBC certificate. The petitioner avers that he
informed the concerned officer in the University that even though he had
applied for an OBC certificate to the concerned authority in the State of
West Bengal he had not received the same and therefore he be given some
leeway.
3.      The petitioner further claims that in support of his plea, he had
produced before the University official the acknowledgement slip issued to
him by the concerned office in the State of West Bengal.
3.1.    The petitioner claims that based on a written undertaking submitted
by him, the concerned officer in the University granted him a leeway of 15
days to produce the OBC certificate. The petitioner further avers that on his
request made on 22.08.2019, time for submission of the OBC certificate was
extended up until 26.08.2019, albeit, once again, via oral instructions.
3.2.    The petitioner claims that upon visiting the web-portal of the



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                            Pg.3 of 24
 concerned department of the State of West Bengal (with which he had made
an application for issuance of an OBC certificate), it got revealed that his
application had been rejected, inter alia, on the ground that his father was a
permanent resident of State of Uttar Pradesh and not of State of West
Bengal.
3.3.    A perusal of this very order does disclose though that an observation
is made that the petitioner's father and his siblings had been issued OBC
certificates, on 13.08.2004, by the State of Uttar Pradesh.
3.4.    Given this development, on that very date i.e. 26.08.2019, the
petitioner approached the concerned officer in the University for being
granted further time to produce the OBC certificate from the State of Uttar
Pradesh.
3.5.    A formal request in this behalf was made by the petitioner with the
Registrar of the University on 27.08.2019.        In this representation, the
petitioner, inter alia, adverted to the fact that he belongs to the Quraishi
community which stood categorized as OBC under the Central List. The
representation was, inter alia, accompanied by the acknowledgement slip
dated 15.06.2019 issued at the relevant point in time by the concerned office
of State of West Bengal as also the order of rejection issued by the very
same office which was downloaded by the petitioner on 26.08.2019.
3.6.    Furthermore, the OBC certificates issued to his siblings by the State
of Uttar Pradesh were also enclosed with the representation.
3.7.    In order to hasten the process of obtaining the OBC certificate, an
application was made by the petitioner, on 27.08.2019, to the concerned
office in the State of Uttar Pradesh.
3.8.    To the petitioner's surprise, the University, without taking any action



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                            Pg.4 of 24
 on his representation, on 28.08.2019, rejected his candidature, not on the
ground that he had failed to produce the OBC certificate, but on the ground
that he had not paid his fees.
3.9.    Left with no alternative, the petitioner moved this Court by way of the
instant writ petition. The petition was filed on 30.08.2019 (Friday).
4.      The petition came up for hearing on 02.09.2019. However, the matter
could not be taken up on that date due to non-availability of one or the other
counsel for the parties. The matter was, thus, posted for hearing on
05.09.2019 when the Court did not convene.
4.1.    The matter could, thus, be heard only on 17.09.2019 when briefly, the
contours of the controversy in issue were etched out. On that date, Mr.
Mohinder J.S. Rupal, Advocate, appeared on behalf of the University and
sought time to obtain instructions as to the reason why the petitioner's
admission had been cancelled. The matter was, thus, posted for further
hearing on 27.09.2019.
4.2.    On 27.09.2019, on behalf of the University, further time was sought
and, accordingly, time was granted to file a counter-affidavit in the matter.
4.3.    The matter was posted for hearing on 01.11.2019 when Mr. Rupal
appeared and assured the Court that the counter-affidavit will be filed with
the Registry by the next date. A copy of the same was, however, handed
over to the petitioner's counsel in Court.         Liberty was given to the
petitioner's counsel to file a rejoinder in the matter.      The matter was,
thereafter, taken up on 27.11.2019 when Mr. Rupal sought accommodation
to confirm as to whether the OBC certificate dated 07.09.2019 issued to the
petitioner fell within the ambit of the Central List.
4.4.    It is in this background that the matter was posted for 12.12.2019. On



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                            Pg.5 of 24
 12.12.2019, Mr. Rupal informed me that he had obtained instructions from
the University via an email to the effect that the Quraishi community to
which the petitioner belongs is recognized as a backward class by the
Government of India and that the OBC certificate submitted by the
petitioner pertains to the Central List.
4.5.    Having said so, Mr. Rupal emphasized that since the OBC certificate
is dated 07.09.2019 and the admission process closed on 31.08.2019, no
relief could be granted to the petitioner.
4.6.    Mr. Rupal, however, did not dispute the fact that the seats were still
available in the LL.B. programme.
Analysis and Reasons: -
5.      Therefore, given this backdrop, the following has emerged qua which
there can be no dispute:
(i)     That the petitioner sat for the entrance exam and passed the same.
(ii)    The petitioner was ranked 139 in the combined merit list.
(iii)   On 15.06.2019, the petitioner applied for being issued an OBC
certificate to the concerned office under the aegis of State of West Bengal.
(iv)    In June 2019, the petitioner applied for admission to the LL.B.
programme under the OBC-NCL category.
(v)     The petitioner's name appeared in the 2nd combined admission list,
which was, published on 30.07.2019.
(vi)    The petitioner's request for admission made on 01.08.2019 was
declined.
(vii) On 26.08.2019, the petitioner downloaded the order issued by the
concerned office in the State of West Bengal whereby his application for
being issued an OBC certificate was rejected on the ground that his father



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                              Pg.6 of 24
 was a permanent resident of the State of Uttar Pradesh and that his father
and his siblings had been issued the OBC certificates by the State of Uttar
Pradesh.
(viii) On 27.08.2019, the petitioner filed a representation with the Registrar
of the University for being accorded further time to furnish the OBC
certificate and in the meanwhile, be granted provisional admission.
(ix)    On that very date i.e. 27.08.2019, the petitioner made an application
to the concerned office in the State of Uttar Pradesh for being issued an
OBC certificate.
(x)     On 28.08.2019, the petitioner's candidature was rejected, albeit, on
the ground of "non-payment of fees".
6.      Therefore, given the aforesaid undisputed facts what is required to be
examined is whether the University's stand is legally tenable?
6.1.    The petitioner, as is apparent from the dates and events recorded
hereinabove, did everything which was in his power to obtain an OBC
certificate in order to seek admission under the said category.
6.2.    The petitioner filed an application for the first time in that behalf,
albeit, erroneously, as he discovered to his grief, with the concerned office
in the State of West Bengal on 15.06.2019. It is when he downloaded the
rejection order on 26.08.2019 that he brought this fact by way of a formal
communication to the notice of the Registrar of the University on the very
next date i.e. 27.08.2019.
6.3.    Crucially, the representation made by the petitioner to the Registrar of
the University, in no uncertain terms, adverted to the fact that he belonged to
the Quraishi community which was categorized as OBC under the Central
List. Besides this, the representation was accompanied by an order dated



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                             Pg.7 of 24
 26.08.2019 passed by the concerned office in the State of West Bengal
which, inter alia, alluded to the fact that the petitioner's father and siblings
had been issued OBC certificates by the State of Uttar Pradesh.
6.4.    For the reasons best known to him, the Registrar of the University
chose not to take any action on the petitioner's representation. The
petitioner's candidature, though, was rejected on an entirely different ground
which was non-payment of fees.
6.5.    As is clear from the record, the payment of fees was never an issue up
until then. It is because the petitioner had not been allowed to take
admission as he did not have the OBC certificate in his hand, he could not
deposit the fees.
6.6.    Had the concerned officials in the University been as diligent (as they
were upon a direction issued by the Court), they would have found out that
what the petitioner stated in his representation, which is, that the Quraishi
community fell in the Central List, was correct.
6.7.    That the petitioner belonged to the Quraishi community would have
been evident to anyone, in particular, the Registrar, had he taken the time
out to peruse the representation and the annexures appended to the
representation, in particular, the OBC certificates issued by the State of Uttar
Pradesh to his siblings.
6.8.    A little bit of effort and cross-referencing would have revealed that
the Quraishi community, as was averred by the petitioner in his
representation, fell in the Central List issued by the Government of India.
Though, the petitioner made an application for being issued an OBC
certificate to the concerned office in State of Uttar Pradesh on 27.08.2019,
i.e. well before the purported cut-off date, it came to fruition only on



W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                            Pg.8 of 24
 07.09.2019.
7.      Given these circumstances, can one say that the delay in procuring the
OBC certificate on account of the systemic deficiencies should be laid at the
door step of the petitioner resulting in denial of admission?
7.1.    While the argument that the documents required for admission should
be filed before the cut-off date is sustained more often than not, inter alia,
on account of administrative necessity, it has lent itself to one exception,
which is, where the eligibility/status of the candidate is not in dispute and
the delay in producing the proof of the same is not attributable to the
candidate.
7.2.    There are series of judgements which the Supreme Court has rendered
in this behalf. I may, for the sake of convenience, cite the following three
judgements and the dicta laid down therein :
<a href="/doc/826277/" id="a_1">Charles K. Skaria vs. Dr. C. Mathew</a>, (1980) 2 SCC 752
           "19. Now we come up against the other limb of the argument
       which appealed to the High Court. The three candidates already
       admitted to the ophthalmology course secured their seats on the
       basis of 'diploma marks'. Had they no diplomas they would have
       been screened out. The High Court has taken the view that the
       diplomas of the appellants should have been excluded from
       consideration by the selection committee. Why? The ground is given
       by       the      Full       Bench       in      appeal        thus:
       .......................................................................
</pre><p id="p_1">           20. There is nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in adding 10
       marks for holders of a diploma. But to earn these extra 10 marks,
       the diploma must be obtained at least on or before the last date for
       application, not later. Proof of having obtained a diploma is
       different from the factum of having got it. Has the candidate, in
       fact, secured a diploma before the final date of application for
       admission to the degree course? That is the primary question. It is
       prudent to produce evidence of the diploma along with the




W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                           Pg.9 of 24
       application, but that is secondary. Relaxation of the date on the first
      is illegal, not so on the second. Academic excellence, through a
      diploma for which extra mark is granted, cannot be denuded
      because proof is produced only later, yet before the date of actual
      selection. The emphasis is on the diploma; the proof thereof
      subserves the factum of possession of the diploma and is not an
      independent factor. The prospectus does say:
</p><p id="p_2">          "(4)(b) 10% to diploma holders in the selection of candidates to
      M.S., and M.D., courses in the respective subjects or sub-
      specialities.
</p><p id="p_3">          13. Certificates to be produced: In all cases true copies of the
      following documents have to be produced:
</p><p id="p_4">          (k) Any other certificates required along with the application."
          This composite statement cannot be read [in] [a] formalistic
      fashion. Mode of proof is geared to the goal of the qualification in
      question. It is subversive of sound interpretation and realistic
      decoding of the prescription to telescope the two and make both
      mandatory in point of time. What is essential is the possession of a
      diploma before the given date; what is ancillary is the safe mode of
      proof of the qualification. To confuse between a fact and its proof is
      blurred perspicacity. To make mandatory the date of acquiring the
      additional qualification before the last date for application makes
      sense. But if it is unshakeably shown that the qualification has been
      acquired before the relevant date, as is the case here, to invalidate
      this merit factor because proof, though indubitable, was adduced a
      few days later but before the selection or in a manner not
      mentioned in the prospectus, but still above-board, is to make
      procedure not the handmaid but the mistress and form not as
      subservient to substance but as superior to the essence.
</p><p id="p_5">          21. Before the selection committee adds special marks to a
      candidate based on a prescribed ground it asks itself the primary
      question: Has he the requisite qualification? If he has, the marks
      must be added. The manner of proving the qualification is indicated
      and should ordinarily be adopted. But, if the candidate
      convincingly establishes the ground, though through a method
      different from the specified one, he cannot be denied the benefit.
      The end cannot be undermined by the means. Actual excellence
      cannot be obliterated by the choice of an incontestable but




W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                             Pg.10 of 24
       unorthodox probative process. Equity shall overpower technicality
      where human justice is at stake.
</p><p id="p_6">          22. The present case is a capital illustration of nominalism
      battling with realism for judicial success. Both sides admit that the
      appellants before us had secured diplomas. They further admit
      (ignoring for a moment the submission on 2% for outsiders) that if
      the diploma scores were added, the applicants, by the measure of
      marks, deserve to be selected, provided the diploma obtained in the
      examination held in 1979 is within time. Then, why did the High
      Court upset their selection? Because the certificates of diploma
      were not attached to the applications and communication by the
      Registrar of the University to the selection committee was an
      unauthorised mode of proof, deviating from the prospectus, though
      authentic in fact. Two flaws vitiate this verbally virtuous approach.
      True, the prospectus directs that certificates shall be produced
      along with the applications for admission. The purpose obviously is
      to have instant proof of the qualification.
</p><p id="p_7">          23. We are aware that when a statute vests a public power and
      conditions the manner of exercise of that power then the law insists
      on that mode of exercise alone. We are here unconcerned with that
      rule. A method of convenience for proving possession of a
      qualification is merely directory. Moreover, the prospectus itself
      permits government to modify the method, as the learned Single
      Judge has pointed out. In this view, we see nothing objectionable
      with the government directive to the selection committee, nor in the
      communication to the selection committee by the university, nor
      even in their taking into consideration and giving credit for
      diplomas although the authentic copies of the diplomas were not
      attached to the application for admission. A hundred examples of
      absurd consequences can be given if the substance of the matter
      were to be sacrificed for mere form and prescriptions regarding
      procedures.
</p><p id="p_8">          24. It is notorious that this formalistic, ritualistic, approach is
      unrealistic and is unwittingly traumatic, unjust and subversive of
      the purpose of the exercise. This way of viewing problems
      dehumanises the administrative, judicial and even legislative
      processes in the wider perspective of law for man and not man for
      law. Much of hardship and harassment in administration flows from




W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                             Pg.11 of 24
       over-emphasis on the external rather than the essential. We think
      the government and the selection committee rightly treated as
      directory (not mandatory) the mode of proving the holding of
      diplomas and as mandatory the actual possession of the diploma. In
      actual life, we know how exasperatingly dilatory it is to get copies
      of degrees, decrees and deeds, not to speak of other authenticated
      documents like mark-lists from universities, why, even bail orders
      from courts and Government Orders from public offices. This
      frustrating delay was by-passed by the State Government in the
      present case by two steps. Government informed the selection
      committee that even if they got proof of marks only after the last
      date for applications but before the date for selections they could be
      taken note of and secondly the Registrars of the Universities
      informed officially which of the candidates had passed in the
      diploma course. The selection committee did not violate any
      mandatory rule nor act arbitrarily by accepting and acting upon
      these steps. Had there been anything dubious, shady or unfair about
      the procedure or any mala fide move in the official exercises we
      would never have tolerated deviations. But a prospectus is not
      scripture and common sense is not inimical to interpreting and
      applying the guide-lines therein. Once this position is plain the
      addition of special marks was basic justice to proficiency measured
      by marks.
</p><p id="p_9">          25. We thus reach the conclusion that the three candidates who
      had been eventually admitted by the selection committee could not
      be ousted merely for the reason that the certificate of diploma had
      not been produced together with the application for admission. Nor,
      indeed, could government be faulted for issuing a directive to the
      selection committee that applications from students of the diploma
      course could be considered subject to the condition that they would
      "produce the diploma certificates before finalising the selection to
      post-graduate courses". The equity of this instruction of the
      government comes into bold relief when we realise that no party in
      this Court has a case that the candidates admitted by the selection
      committee did not secure a diploma in opthalmology.
</p><p id="p_10">          26. Even so, there is a snag. Who are the diploma holders
      eligible for 10 extra marks? Only those who, at least by the final
      date for making applications for admissions possess the diploma.

<p id="p_11">W.P. (C) No. 9525/2019                                            Pg.12 of 24
       Acquisition of a diploma later may qualify him later, not this year.
      Otherwise, the date-line makes no sense. So, the short question is
      when can a candidate claim to have got a diploma? When he has
      done all that he has to do and the result of it is officially made
      known by the concerned authority. An examinee for a degree or
      diploma must complete his examination -- written, oral or practical
</p><p id="p_12">      -- before he can tell the selection committee or the court that he
      has done his part. Even this is not enough. If all goes well after
      that, he cannot be credited with the title to the degree if the results
      are announced only after the last date for applications but before
      selection. The second condition precedent must also be fulfilled viz.
      the official communication of the result before the selection and its
      being brought to the ken of the committee in an authentic manner.
      Maybe, the examination is cancelled or the marks of the candidates
      are withheld. He acquires the degree or diploma only when the
      results are officially made known. Until then his qualification is
      inchoate. But once these events happen his qualification can be
      taken into account in evaluation of equal opportunity provided the
      selection committee has the result before it at the time of -- not
      after -- the selection is over. To sum up, the applicant for post-
      graduate degree course earns the right to the added advantage of
      diploma only if (a) he has completed the diploma examination on or
      before the last date for the application, (b) the result of the
      examination is also published before that date, and (c) the
      candidate's success in the diploma course is brought to the
      knowledge of the selection committee before completion of selection
      in an authentic or acceptable manner. The prescription in the
      prospectus that a certificate of the diploma shall be attached to the
      application for admission is directory, not mandatory; a sure mode,
      not the sole means. The delays in getting certified copies in many
      departments have become so exasperatingly common that realism
      and justice forbid the iniquitous consequence of defeating the
      applicant if, otherwise than by a certified copy, he satisfies the
      committee about his diploma. There is nothing improper even in a
      selection committee requesting the concerned universities to inform
      them of the factum and get the proof straight by communication
      therefrom -- unless, of course, this facility is arbitrarily confined
      only to a few or there is otherwise some capricious or unveracious

       touch about the process.
</p><p id="p_13">          27. Judged by the above tests it is conceded that while the
      Calicut University's diploma holders had completed their
      examination before the last date for M.D. applications and
      produced the certificate before the selection, the Kerala University
      diploma holder completed his diploma examination including
      publication of results only after the last date for applications and
      produced the certificate before the selection. By this token he is
      ineligible for admission because his diploma result was published
      only after the last date for applications. The accident of time has
      cheated him even as in human affairs generally, be it individual or
      collective, fortune ebbs and flows, influenced critically by
      happenstances of time and circumstances of life. That is the
      Relativity of Life, if one may look at problems philosophically. We,
      therefore, hold that Appellants 2 and 3 are entitled to admission
      and their appeal must succeed. By the same token the appeal of
      Appellant 1 must be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_14">          28. To dismiss an appeal is merely to declare that judicial
      remedy will not issue and not that by other processes justice should
      not be sought or granted. From the humane perspective and with a
      view to helping Appellant 1 to pursue his relief through the
      university or other appropriate State agency, we directed the
      impleadment of the Indian Medical Council which is the statutory
      body concerned, at the national level, with higher medical degrees
      and courses. The Medical Council has not appeared before the
      court though its presence would have helped the forensic process to
      heal the fractured academic course. But we cannot wait longer. It
      behoves the State to give academic justice -- not legal remedy -- to
      Appellant 1 if circumstances permit, having regard to the fact that,
      with diploma qualification, he has spent months in doing his
      opthalmology degree course. In law he fails, in justice he need not,
      if marginal adjustments by increasing one seat more were possible
      without injury to academic efficiency. What we mean is that though
      Appellant 1 has no legal claim to a seat, the overall circumstances
      will merit compassionate consideration, and we direct the Kerala
      University and the Indian Medical Council to permit him to
      complete his course by adding one more seat, for this year only, to
      the opthalmic degree course."

       view of its great importance, the full text of his speech delivered in
      the Constituent Assembly on the point is appended to this judgment.
      But I shall now read a few passages from it. Dr Ambedkar stated:
</p><p id="p_30">           "... firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity, secondly,
      that there shall be reservations in favour of certain communities
      which have not so far had a 'proper look-in' so to say into the
      administration. ... Supposing, for instance, we were to concede in
      full the demand of those communities who have not been so far
      employed in the public services to the fullest extent, what would
      really happen is, we shall be completely destroying the first
      proposition upon which we are all agreed, namely, that there shall
      be an equality of opportunity. ... Therefore the seats to be reserved,
      if the reservation is to be consistent with sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_17">Article
      10</a>, [Ed.: The matter between two asterisks has been emphasised
      in Indra Sawhney case, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217.] must be confined
      to a minority of seats [Ed.: The matter between two asterisks has
      been emphasised in Indra Sawhney case, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217.] .
      It is then only that the first principle could find its place in the
      Constitution and effective in operation. ... we have to safeguard two
      things, namely, the principle of equality of opportunity and at the
      same time satisfy the demand of communities which have not had so
      far representation in the State...." [Constituent Assembly Debates,
      Vol. 7, pp. 701-02 (1948-1949).]
           These words embody the raison d'être of reservation and its
      limitations. Reservation is one of the measures adopted by the
      Constitution to remedy the continuing evil effects of prior inequities
      stemming from discriminatory practices against various classes of
      people which have resulted in their social, educational and
      economic backwardness. Reservation is meant to be addressed to
      the present social, educational and economic backwardness caused
      by purposeful societal discrimination. To attack the continuing ill
      effects and perpetuation of such injustice, the Constitution permits
      and empowers the State to adopt corrective devices even when they
      have discriminatory and exclusionary effects. Any such measure,
      insofar as one group is preferred to the exclusion of another, must
      necessarily be narrowly tailored to the achievement of the
      fundamental constitutional goal.' (Indra Sawhney case [<a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_18">Indra

          "11. ... '15. The matter can be looked into from another angle
      also. As per the advertisement dated 11-6-1999 issued by the
      Board, vacancies are reserved for various categories including SC
      category. Thus in order to be considered for the post reserved for
      SC category, the requirement is that a person should belong to SC
      category. If a person is SC he is so by birth and not by acquisition
      of this category because of any other event happening at a later
      stage. A certificate issued by competent authority to this effect is
      only an affirmation of fact which is already in existence. The
      purpose of such certificate is to enable the authorities to believe in
      the assertion of the candidate that he belongs to SC category and
      act thereon by giving the benefit to such candidate for his belonging
      to SC category. It is not that petitioners did not belong to SC
      category prior to 30-6-1998 or that acquired the status of being SC
      only on the date of issuance of the certificate. In view of this
      position, necessitating [sic: insisting] upon a certificate dated prior
      to 30-6-1998 would be clearly arbitrary and it has no rationale
      objective sought to be achieved.
</p><p id="p_32">          16. While taking a particular view in such matters one has to
      keep in mind the objectives behind the post of SC and ST categories
      as per constitutional mandate prescribed in Articles 15(4) and
      16(4) which are enabling provisions authorising the Government to
      make special provisions for the persons of SC and ST categories.
      Articles 14(4) [sic: <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_22">Article 15(4)]</a> and <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_23">16(4</a>), therefore, intend to
      remove social and economic inequality to make equal opportunities
      available in reality. Social and economic justice is a right
      enshrined for protection of society. The right in social and

      as candidates belonging to these categories are unable to compete
      with the candidates belonging to the general category as a result of
      facing centuries of oppression and deprivation of opportunity. The

       the Constitution as well as Articles 14, 15, 16 and 39-A of the

       giving equal opportunity to all sections of the society. The Division
       Bench, thus, erred in reversing the judgment and order passed by
       the learned Single Judge. Hence, the impugned judgment and order
       passed by the Division Bench in Letters Patent Appeal No. 562 of
       2011 is not only erroneous but also suffers from error in law as it
       has failed to follow the binding precedent of the judgments of this

9.7.    Besides this, the University, in my opinion, ought not to be allowed to
furnish a reason in its counter-affidavit for denying admission to the
petitioner different from the reason officially communicated to him. [See:
<a href="/doc/941815/" id="a_36">Mohinder Singh Gill vs. Chief Election Commissioner</a>, (1978) 1 SCC 405]
9.8.    It now appears that the reasons given by the University in its counter-
affidavit that the Quraishi community did not fall in the Central List was a
ruse used to delay the petitioner's admission.

referred to the judgement of the Division Bench of this Court rendered in
<a href="/doc/21295234/" id="a_37">Ravi Yadav vs. University of Delhi</a>, (2017) SCC OnLine Del 12187 in
support of his plea that since the OBC certificate was not submitted by the

admission in the LL.B. programme.
</p><p id="p_38">10.1. A careful perusal of the aforementioned judgement would show that
its ratio decidendi veers around the failure of the petitioner, in that case, in
submitting the result of his supplementary examination within the stipulated
period.
</p><p id="p_39">10.2. In Ravi Yadav's case, the petitioner had neither averred nor did he
submit the OBC certificate to the University, which, in any event, as noticed
above, did not form the main plank of the decision arrived at in the matter.
Hence, the aforementioned judgement is clearly distinguishable on facts.
Conclusion: -

petitioner. The petitioner will be given admission in the LL.B. programme in
the OBC-NCL category in the academic session 2019-2020.
