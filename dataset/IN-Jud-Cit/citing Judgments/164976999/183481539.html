                  2.6     The suit was listed before the learned Joint Registrar (Judicial) for
                 further proceedings on 20.08.2019, when it was pointed out to the learned
                 counsel for the defendants that the written statement, the affidavit of
                 admission/denial of the plaintiff‟s documents, and the documents filed
                 were not on record. The statement of the learned counsel for the plaintiff
                 was also recorded to the effect that the written statement had not been
                 filed within the statutory period. On this submission, the learned counsel
                 for the defendants sought time for filing an appropriate application
                 seeking condonation of delay in filing of the written statement.
                 2.7     The learned counsel for the defendants/appellants submits that the
                 office objection on the written statement was finally raised by the
                 Registry of this Court on 15.11.2019, and the said written statement was
                 returned under objection to the defendants/appellants only on 18.11.2019.
                 The same was immediately thereafter re-filed on 20.11.2019, and an
                 application seeking condonation of delay in filing of the written
                 statement, being I.A. No. 16400 of 2019, was separately filed on
                 21.11.2019.
</p><p id="p_10">                 2.8     The application seeking condonation of delay has been dismissed
                 by the learned Joint Registrar (Judicial) by way of the impugned order
                 dated 21.03.2022 on the ground that when the written statement was filed
                 by the defendants in the suit on the 118th day of service of summons, no
                 application for condonation of delay was filed with it.     The application
                 for condonation of delay was filed only on 21.11.2019, after an objection
                 had been raised by the Registry of this Court. The same having not been
                 filed within the statutory period of 120 days prescribed under the
                 Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (in short, „Commercial Courts Act‟),

                  therefore, was not maintainable in law and the defendants/appellants have
                 forfeited their right for filing the written statement. In reaching the above

                 Submissions on behalf of the defendants/appellants:
                 3.1     The learned counsel for the defendants/appellants submits that the
                 ratio of the judgment in Ok Play India (supra), insofar as it held that a
                 written application supported by an affidavit is a must for seeking
                 condonation of delay in filing of the written statement, is per incuriam.

                 Singh and Another v. Baidyabati Sheoraphuli Cooperative Bank
                 Limited and Another</a>, (2021) 7 SCC 313, he submits that, in fact, it is not
                 mandatory to file an application in writing before relief under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_4">Section 5</a>
                 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (in short, „the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_5">Limitation Act</a>‟) can be granted
                 to the applicant and had such an application been mandatory, <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of
                 the Limitation Act would have expressly provided so.

                 can also be filed later, and it is not necessary that such an application

                 Contractors Private Limited</a>., (2021) 6 SCC 460, he submits that merely
                 because the present suit is a commercial suit, it cannot be said that
                 <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_12">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act would not have any application or would
                 have a restricted application. He submits that therefore, the principles
                 that are applicable to <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_13">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act must be applied
                 while considering the application of the defendants/appellants seeking
                 condonation of delay in filing of the written statement in the suit.
                 3.4     The learned counsel for the defendants/appellants, further placing
                 reliance on the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/164976999/" id="a_14">Red Bull AG v. Pepsico India
                 Holdings Pvt. Ltd. and Another</a>, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 9901, submits

                  defendants/appellants. He submits that, in fact, the same learned Single
                 Judge who passed the judgment in Ok Play India (supra), in a later
                 judgment dated 27.09.2021 passed in CM(M) 335 of 2021, titled

                 Corporation</a>, opined that the judgment in Ok Play India (supra) cannot
                 be used to re-open the decision condoning the delay in filing of the
                 written statement passed earlier thereto. He submits that merely because
                 the application of the defendants/appellants seeking condonation of delay
                 in filing of the written statement had remained pending, the
                 defendants/appellants cannot be denied a similar benefit as granted in
                 Superior Aircon Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
</p><p id="p_13">                 3.6     On merits, the learned counsel for the defendants/appellants
                 submits that in the present case the delay in filing of the written statement
                 occurred because the suit was filed by the plaintiff without impleading its
                 Indian subsidiary, with whom the defendants had business dealings since
                 2012; the defendant no. 1 being its authorized distributor. The
                 agreements and the records between the parties were old and voluminous,
                 thus took a substantial amount time to collect. Further, on receipt of
                 summons, the defendants, in order to understand and resolve the issue
                 met the officers of the plaintiff and their counsel. As the same did not
                 materialize, the defendants/appellants engaged a counsel to defend them
                 in the present suit. A further delay was attributed to the commencement
                 of the Court Vacation, not permitting the defendants to be able to get in
                 touch     with      their   counsel.   He   submits   that   therefore,     the
                 defendants/appellants were entitled to condonation of delay in filing of
                 the written statement.

                 120 days of service of summons on the defendants/appellants, has been
                 rightly dismissed by the learned Joint Registrar (Judicial). He submits

                 defendants/appellants have not been able to make out any case for the
                 grant of condonation of delay in filing of their written statement.
                 5.2     The object and purpose of the Commercial Courts Act is to ensure
                 that the commercial cases are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at a
                 reasonable cost to the litigant. The Commercial Courts Act was enacted
                 with the intent to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of
                 commercial cases.

                 summarised the effect of the above provisions as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                            &quot;A perusal of these provisions would show that
                                            ordinarily a written statement is to be filed within
                                            a period of 30 days. However, grace period of a
                                            further 90 days is granted which the Court may
                                            employ for reasons to be recorded in writing and
                                            payment of such costs as it deems fit to allow such
                                            written statement to come on record. What is of
                                            great importance is the fact that beyond 120 days
                                            from the sate of service of summons, the defendant

                                            buttressed by the proviso in Order 8 Rule 10 also
                                            adding that the court has no further power to

                  5.5     Therefore, the Commercial Courts Act brings about a substantial
                 change in the provisions relating to the period of filing of the written
                 statement and the power of the Court to condone the delay in filing of the
                 written statement as far as the commercial suits are concerned.
                 5.6     In the present case, the written statement was filed on the 118 th day
                 from the date of service of summons on the defendants/appellants. It was
                 not accompanied with an application seeking condonation of delay in
                 filing of the same. In fact, on 20.08.2019, the learned counsel for the
                 plaintiff warned the defendants/appellants that the written statement was
                 not on record as it was not accompanied with an application seeking
                 condonation of delay. The learned counsel for the defendants/appellants,
                 instead    of      giving     any     reason     on    the    basis    of   which       the
                 defendants/appellants could seek condonation of delay, prayed for time to
                 file an appropriate application in that regard. The order dated 20.08.2019
                 passed by the learned Joint Registrar (Judicial) is reproduced
                 hereinbelow:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                            &quot;      It is submitted by counsel for the defendants
                                            that the defendants have filed written statement,
                                            affidavit of admission/denial of the documents and

                                            809088 &amp; 809042. However, the same have not
                                            come on record. Counsel for the defendants seeks
                                            time for taking appropriate steps in this regard.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                                    It is submitted by counsel for the plaintiff
                                            that the defendants have not filed written
                                            statement within statutory period. It is submitted
                                            by counsel for the defendants that the written
                                            statement could not be filed within 30 days but the
                                            same has been filed within the period of 120 days.
                                            Counsel for the defendants seeks time for filing

<p id="p_27">                 5.7     Even thereafter, the defendants/appellants did not file any
                 application seeking condonation of delay in filing of their written
                 statement, till 21.11.2019. The submission of the learned counsel for the
                 defendants/appellants that the same was filed only when the Registry of
                 this Court returned the written statement under objection on 18.11.2019,
                 to say the least, is the most fallacious and reflects the callous manner in
                 which the defendants/appellants have tried to defend the suit filed by the
                 plaintiff. The defendants/appellants, already having been warned that
                 their written statement would not come on record for there being no
                 application seeking condonation of delay in filing of the same, were not
                 expected to await the return of the written statement by the Registry of
                 this Court. On their own, they were supposed to file an application
                 seeking condonation of delay so that their written statement could be
                 brought on record. Clearly, the defendants/appellants were trying to take
                 advantage of the process of the Court and delay the adjudication of the
                 present suit. To accept the same would be to defeat the very object and
                 purpose of the Commercial Courts Act.
</p><p id="p_28">                 5.8     As rightly held in Ok Play India (supra), delay in filing of the
                 written statement can be condoned by the court &quot;for reasons to be
                 recorded in writing&quot;. Such reasons cannot be presumed by the Court, but
                 are to be provided by the defendants. The defendant cannot take its own
                 sweet time to supply such reasons to the court. The court is not to await
                 endlessly for the same.

                  5.9     Even otherwise, the reasons given by the defendants/appellants for
                 seeking condonation of delay in filing of their written statement cannot
                 be accepted.          It is contended that the delay occurred as the
                 defendants/appellants applied for and were supplied with the copy(ies) of
                 the report(s) of the Local Commissioner(s) only on 31.07.2019. As noted
                 hereinabove, the commission was executed on 27.03.2019 in the presence
                 of the representative of the defendants/appellants. The application
                 seeking condonation of delay in filing the written statement does not
                 disclose what steps were taken by the defendants to seek copy(ies) of the
                 report(s) of the Local Commissioner(s) earlier and, in any case, how the
                 non-availability of the same hampers the filing of the written statement in
                 time by the defendants in the suit. In fact, as noted hereinabove, the
                 defendants/appellants had filed another application, being I.A. No. 9172
                 of 2019, on 10.07.2019 seeking an order of injunction against the
                 plaintiff. It is not explained why the written statement was not filed even
                 at that stage. The submission of the defendants/appellants that the delay
                 occurred as they were first trying to get the dispute amicably resolved; or
                 in locating and contacting their counsel; and/or in compiling the
                 documents and records of their past dealings with the Indian subsidiary of
                 the plaintiff, again does not give sufficient justification to the defendants
                 for not filing the written statement within the statutory period.
                 5.10 For the above reasons, even otherwise, the defendants/appellants
                 were not entitled to the condonation of delay in filing of the written
                 statement and the same has been rightly rejected. The judgments referred
                 to by the learned counsel for the defendants/appellants cannot come to
