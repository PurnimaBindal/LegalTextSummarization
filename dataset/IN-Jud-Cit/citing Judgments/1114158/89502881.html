         the use of the words American and the Outfitters in the mark

         that the present suit was filed without any basis and documents;
         or even that            defendant company never ever involved in

         legal knowledge of Trade Marks laws but he knew what are the
         restricted words or what are common words in Trade Mark
         registration as a layman. He deposed that no document relied

         search in the Trademark Registry in Class 25 for conflicting
         marks before suggesting the impugned mark to defendant
         company. He stated that the examination report issued by
         Registrar of Trademark was shown to him and he asked the
         defendant to file reply; that he advised Sh. Arun Kumar Maurya
         that the words &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Outfitters&quot; are generic words

         should be in conjunction of device of FOX along with jumble
         words and that trademarks in examination report were neither
         similar nor same. He further deposed that Sh. Arun Kumar,
         during the marketing of clothing, manufactured ready­made
         garments in the name of &quot;American Fox Outfitters&quot; and
         distributed the same to shops and response thereto was

         market research and he created &amp; designed the trademark in the
         year 2012, he could say that the defendants are using
         &quot;AMERICAN FOX OUTFITTERS&quot; since 2012. He stated that

<p id="p_94">         upon research, he found that there are many brands which

         American and Outfitter and if someone has exclusive rights on
         these words, the same should not have been used by others;
         that since there were already many people, in the trademark
         register, with the words American and Outfitters, he suggested
         the defendants to use American Fox Outfitters as it would create
         no problem. He further deposed that he designed the device
         FOX in defendants&#x27; trademark, which he picked from the

<p id="p_129">    36.             The plaintiff&#x27;s case is that the adoption of the trademark
         &quot;AMERICAN FOX OUTFITTERS&quot; with device Fox by the

         similar to the mark of the plaintiff &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE

         features but also structurally. It is their case that the defendants
         have infringed their marks, and as well are liable for
         consequences arising out of passing off considering the
         deceptive similarity of the marks, the identical trade and the
         defendants&#x27; failure to desist from using the mark despite Cease
         &amp; Desist Notice. The defendants&#x27; narrative, on the other hand, is
         that not only the adoption of mark &quot;AMERICAN FOX
         OUTFITTERS&quot; is honest one, effected only after due diligence by
         means of market research, and search in the trademark registry,

<p id="p_130">         but also cannot be interfered with for the reasons that the words
         &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Outfitters&quot; are generic terms, and no monopoly
         can be claimed by the plaintiff on such elements.
</p>

<p id="p_131">    37.            The narratives in conflict foreground various aspects for
         the consideration of the court, respecting priority of the user,
         similarity of the marks, distinctiveness or lack of it, as well as
         infringement and passing off.
</p>

<p id="p_132">    38.            To begin with, the question of priority of adoption and
         user is taken up. The plaintiff has invited the attention of the
         court towards various documents proved on record while
         contending that it was in the year 1977 that the plaintiff started
         using the said trademark in relation with its trade of garments.
         The attention of the court is also invited towards Ex.PW1/27­
         list of registrations of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE
         OUTFITTERS&quot;             in different countries. It transpires that the
         earliest      registration        of     the     mark   &quot;AMERICAN      EAGLE
         OUTFITTERS&quot; relates to the year 1993. Attention of the court is
         also invited towards Ex.PW1/29 - registration of trademark in
         India, which shows that the trademark &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE
         OUTFITTERS&quot; was registered at No. 905098 under Class­25 on
         22.02.2000, and the mark is disclosed to be used eversince
         01.01.1991. In respect of mark &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE&quot;, the
         registration pertains to 12.09.2006, although it is shown to be
         &quot;proposed to be used&quot;. As regard the device, the device stands

<p id="p_133">         registered in the name of the plaintiff under Class­99 on
         30.01.2008.
</p>

<p id="p_134">    39.            So far as          the defendants mark is concerned, it is
         defendants own case that they have started using the impugned
         mark &quot;AMERICAN FOX OUTFITTERS&quot; since the year 2012. Even
         if the records pertaining to the registration of the plaintiff&#x27;s
         trademark with other countries is over looked for a moment, the
         registration certificate proved as Ex.PW1/29 (colly.) clearly
         indicate that the Trademark of the plaintiff &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE
         OUTFITTERS&quot; was being used by the plaintiff since 1991 under
         Class­25 and registered in India on 22.02.2000. The device as
         well stands registered as on 30.01.2008 and the trademark
         &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE&quot; also stands registered as on 12.09.2006.
         The said certificates read with other material proved on record
         clearly and adequately establishes that the plaintiff is the prior
         adapter, user, and also is registered in respect of the trademark
         &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS&quot; and &quot;AMERICAN EAGLE&quot; as
         well as device are concerned.

<p id="p_135">    40.            Priority of adoption and use of a mark is one of the most
         central tenets of the law relating to intellectual property rights.
         It rigidity neutralizes or trivializes a number of defences that it
         may counter in a given case. The priority of adoption, use and
         registration of plaintiff&#x27;s mark, definitely makes the defendants&#x27;
         burden to prove its mark to be falling within exceptions

</p>

<p id="p_137">    41.            This brings the court to the contention of the defendants
         as to existence of distinguishing features/ dis­similarities.
         Insofar as the distinctive features are concerned, it has been
         contended by the Learned counsel for the defendants that not
         only the marks in question are using different font style/ type,
         font size but also the fact that the plaintiff&#x27;s mark contains the
         word and device &#x27;Eagle&#x27; whereas the defendants&#x27; mark contain
         the word and device &#x27;Fox&#x27; which are clearly distinguishable. It is
         also contended that the plaintiff cannot claim any rights in font
         colour and as also failed to prove the font style as the same. The
         plaintiff side, on the other hand, has contended that there is
         enough similarity between the two so as to cause confusion,
         which is clear from the structure, placement of the text,
         placement of device and the colour used by the defendants. It is
         impressed that the same could not have occurred except by
         dishonest adoption by the defendants.
</p>

<p id="p_138">    42.            It has also been contended by the Learned counsel for the
         defendants that for the trademark to be evaluated, it is to be
         seen as a whole and cannot be dissected for the purpose of
         evaluation. It is, accordingly, pressed that the over all
         appearance of two marks in itself are distinguishable and thus,
         there is no likelihood of deception.

                     to be &quot;in the course of trade&quot;, the question whether there
                     has been an infringement is to be decided by comparison
                     of the two marks, Where the two marks are identical no
                     further questions arise; for then the infringement is
                     made out. When the two marks are not identical, the

                     the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff&#x27;s

                     the words &quot;likely to deceive&quot; and it has sometimes been
                     answered by saying that it is merely an extension of the
                     earlier test and does not add very materially to the

                     establish that the trademark used by the defendant in
                     the course of trade in the goods in respect of which his
                     mark is registered, is deceptively similar. This has
                     necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two
                     marks­ the degree of resemblance which is necessary to
                     exist to cause deception not being capable of definition
                     by laying down objective standards. The persons who

                      phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the
                      plaintiff&#x27;s mark. The purpose of the comparison is for
                      determining whether the essential features of the
                      plaintiff&#x27;s trademark are to be found in that used by the
                      defendant. The identification of the essential features of
                      the mark is in essence a question of fact and depends on
                      the judgment of the Court based on the evidence led
                      before it has regards the usage of the trade. It should,
                      however, be borne in mind that the object of the equity
                      in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by the
                      defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the
                      registered mark of the plaintiff.&quot;

                      copied ? 2) mode in which the parts are put together
                      differently i.e. whether dissimilarity of the part or parts
                      is enough to make the whole thing dissimilar and 3)
                      whether when there are common elements, should one
                      not pay more regard to the parts which are not common,
                      while at the same time not disregarding the common
                      parts ?. In examining the marks, keeping the aforesaid
                      three tests in mind, it came to the conclusion, seeing the
                      manner in which the two words were written and the
                      peculiarity of the script and concluded that the above

                      and various differences yet the main idea left on the mind
                      by both may be the same. A person acquainted with one
                      mark, and not having the two side by side for
                      comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were
                      allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a
                      belief that he was dealing with goods which bore the
                      same mark as that with which he was acquainted. Thus,
                      for example, a mark may represent a game of football;
                      another mark may show players in a different dress, and
                      in very different positions, and yet the idea conveyed by
                      each might be simply a game of football. It would be too
                      much to expect that persons dealing with trademarked
                      goods, and relying, as they frequently do, upon marks,
                      should be able to remember the exact details of the marks
                      upon the goods with which they are in the habit of
                      dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general
                      impressions or by some significant detail than by any
                      photographic recollection of the whole. More­over,
                      variations in detail might well be supposed by customers
                      to have been made by the owners of the trademark they
                      are already acquainted with for reasons of their own.</blockquote>

                     whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the

                      whether they are of such character as to prevent one
                      design from being mistaken for the other. It would be
                      enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall
                      similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to
                      mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the
                      other if offered to him. In this case we find that the
                      packets are practically of the same size, the colour
                      scheme of the two wrappers is almost the same; the
                      design on both though not identical bears such a close
                      resemblance that one can easily be mistaken for the
                      other. The essential features of both are that there is a
                      girl with one arm raised and carrying something in the
                      other with a cow or cows near her and hens or chickens
                      in the foreground. In the background there is a farm
                      house with a fence the word &quot;Gluco Biscuits&quot; in one and
                      &quot;Glucose Biscuits&quot; on the other occupy a prominent place
                      at the top with a good deal of similarity between the two
                      writings. Anyone in our opinion who has a look at one of
                      the packets today may easily mistake the other if shown
                      on another day as being the same article which he had
                      seen before. If one was not careful enough to note the
                      peculiar features of the wrapper on the plaintiff&#x27;s goods,
                      he might easily mistake the defendants wrapper for the
                      plaintiffs if shown to him some time after he had seen the
                      plaintiffs&quot;. After all, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted
                      with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Page 1614
                      Homes. We have therefore no doubt that the defendants
                      wrapper is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs which was
                      registered.&quot;

                    marks actually before him when he makes his purchase.
                    The eye is not an accurate recorder of visual detail and
                    that marks are remembered by general impression or by
                    some significant detail rather than by any photographic
                    recollection of the whole. While judging the question as
                    to whether the defendant has infringed the trade mark by
                    colourable imitation of the mark or not, the Court has to
                    consider the overall impression of the mark in the minds
                    of general public and not by merely comparing the

         to be done by looking at the marks as a whole, however, the law
         does not completely proscribes the comparison of dominant and
         essential features of the marks in question. Besides, the
         principles governing the evaluation of marks are &quot;similarity&quot;
         centric as it has been held that for the purpose of arriving at a
         conclusion, the court has to look into the similarities between

<p id="p_158">         weighs the dissimilarities. The selection of words &quot;American&quot; &amp;
         &quot;Outfitters&quot; per se, cannot be a mere chance. The use of words
         in Capital letters, and the placement of the word &quot;American&quot; in
         the beginning and the word &quot;Outfitters&quot; towards the end of both
         the marks contributes heavily towards similarity of the marks.
         No doubt, the word in between the two i.e. &quot;Eagle&quot; in the case
         of the plaintiff and &quot;Fox&quot; in the case of the defendants, with
         their corresponding device perched atop are different, however,
         the structural appearances and the first impression of two marks
         are found to have a striking connection. Although, it has been
         impressed by the Learned counsel for the defendants that the
         court cannot dissect the marks so as to find the similarities,

         defendants cannot heard to say that word &quot;American&quot; or

         of the marks. As regards the dis­similarities, true that the device

         by other dominant and essential features and the dis­similarity
         on this count is muted further by use of same colour and
         placement of the device. Over all impression of the defendants
         mark shows that its configuration is more aligned towards
         resemblance with plaintiff&#x27;s mark, to such a degree that
         confusion amongst the class of purchasers, cannot be ruled out.
         There is an extraordinary coherence between the two marks and
         the dissimilarities, as induced by &quot;Fox&quot; and &quot;Fox Device,&quot; are
         not too strong or prominent enough to offset the similarities
         that define the marks in question.

         side is estopped from claiming any lack of distinctiveness or that

         Besides, it is the defendants&#x27; own contention, as also recorded in
         their written submissions that their mark should be seen in
         conjunction/ conjugation to Fox device along with jumbled
         words &quot;AMERICAN FOX OUTFITTERS&quot;, which in itself is
         suggestive of the fact that the said words, when read with
         conjunction with other words can be claimed to be distinctive.

<p id="p_174">                      is found by the court that such a mark has attained
                      distinctiveness and is associated with the business of the
                      plaintiff for time and thereafter the defendant adopts a
                      similar word as one of his two marks to induce innocent
                      users to use or buy the product of the defendant, which
                      establishes dishonest intention and bad faith, the court
                      would grant an injunction to protect the business of the
                      plaintiff. User of similar word by a competitor coupled
                      with dishonest intention and bad faith would empower a
                      court to restrain such user/misuser to do equitable

         to the word &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Outfitters&quot; being generic or
         descriptive does not do the defendants&#x27; case any good.

<p id="p_176">    62.            In order to buttress this contention further, Learned
         counsel for the defendant has also vehemently impressed that in

         that the words &quot;American&quot; &amp; &quot;Outfitters&quot; as well as &quot;Eagle&quot; are
         being used by various third parties including registered
         trademark owners pertaining to the same Class. The court,
         however, is of the opinion that the said contention would not
         advance the case of the defendants as the rights of the parties to
         the lis are to be determined, and existence of several other
         parties using the similar mark would not alter this position.

         the defendant, holding:­


                      &quot;11. It was next submitted by counsel for the defendant

                      devoid of any force. In this connection it is sufficient to
                      say that under the law it is the right of two parties

                            the law relating to passingoff. But it differs from
                            that law in two particulars, namely (1) it is
                            concerned only with one method of passing off,
                            namely, the use of a trade mark, and (2) the
                            statutory protection is absolute in the sense that
                            once a mark is shown to offend, the user of it
                            cannot escape by showing that by something
                            outside the actual mark itself he has distinguished
                            his goods from those of the registered proprietor.
                            Accordingly, in considering the question of
                            infringement the Courts have held, and it is now
                            expressly provided by the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_97">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1938,

                            by exact imitation but by the use of a mark so
                            nearly resembling the registered mark as to be

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">                  &quot;13.     An action for passing off, as the phrase &quot;passing off
                     itself suggests, is to restrain the defendant from passing
                     off its goods or services to the public as that of the
                     plaintiff&#x27;s. It is an action not only to preserve the
                     reputation of the plaintiff but also to safeguard the
                     public. The defendant must have sold its goods or offered
                     its service in a manner which has deceived or would be
                     likely to deceive the public into thinking that the
                     defendant&#x27;s goods or services are the plaintiff&#x27;s. The
                     action is normally available to the owner of a distinctive
                     trademark and the person who, if the word or name is
                     an invented one, invents and uses it. If two trade rivals
                     claim to have individually invented the same mark, then
                     the trader who is able to establish prior user will
                     succeed. The question is, as has been aptly put, who gets
                     these first? It is not essential for the plaintiff to prove
                     long user to establish reputation in a passing off action.
                     It would depend upon the volume of sales and extent of

                        plaintiff in a passing off action is misrepresentation by
                        the defendant to the public. The word misrepresentation
                        does not mean that the plaintiff has to prove any
                        malafide intention on the part of the defendant. Of
                        course, if the misrepresentation is intentional, it might
                        lead to an inference that the reputation of the plaintiff is

                        it. An innocent misrepresentation would be relevant only
                        on the question of the ultimate relief which would be
                        granted to the plaintiff. What has to be established is the
                        likelihood of confusion in the minds of the public, (the
                        word &quot;public&quot; being understood to mean actual or
                        potential customers or users) that the goods or services
                        offered by the defendant are the goods or the services of
                        the plaintiff. In assessing the likelihood of such confusion
                        the courts must allow for the &quot;imperfect recollection of a

                      plaintiff&#x27;s mark must be registered under the Act; the

                      necessary for the plaintiff to prove further that the use
                      of defendant&#x27;s trademark is likely to deceive and cause
                      confusion as the registration shows the title of the
                      registered proprietor and the things speak for
                      themselves. In an infringement action, once a mark is
                      used as indicating commercial origin by the
                      defendant, no amount of added matter intended to

                      of a trade mark, the onus to prove deceptive similarity is
                      on the defendant who seeks non­registration, or removal
                      of the trade mark from the register.
</p>
<p id="p_195">                  (iii) &quot;Confusion&quot; refers to the state of mind of the customer
                      who, on seeing the mark, thinks that it differs from the
                      mark on the goods which he has previously bought, but
                      is doubtful whether that impression is not due to
                      imperfect recollection. The question is one of first
                      impression.
</p>
<p id="p_196">                  (iv) This is especially true in the matter of phonetic
                      similarity. A meticulous comparison of the words,
                      syllable by syllable, is to be avoided. The possibility of
                      careless pronunciation and speech, both on the part of
                      the buyer walking into the shop, as well as the shop
                      assistant, is also required to be factored into
                      consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_197">                  (v) The matter has to be examined from the point of view of
                     a person of average intelligence and imperfect
                     recollection. It has to be seen as to how such a purchaser
                     would react to the trade mark, the association which he
                     would form and how he would connect the trade marks
                     with the goods he would be purchasing.
</p>
<p id="p_198">                  (vi) The Pianotist test, postulated over a century ago, has
                      repeatedly been endorsed by the Supreme Court, as the
                      definitive test to be adopted while comparing rival trade
                      marks. According to this test, the Court is required to
                      judge the rival trade marks by their look and sound, and

                         marks is used in the normal way as the trade mark
                         for the goods of the respective owners. While doing
                         so, the common part of the words forming the
                         competing marks may not be decisive. The overall
                         similarity of the composite words is required to be
                         seen, having regard to the            circumstance (if
                         applicable) that both are on like goods of similar
                         description. The test to be applied is whether, if the
                         two marks are used in a normal and fair manner,
                         there is likelihood of confusion or deception.
</p>
<p id="p_204">                  (vii) The whole word/mark is to be considered. An ordinary
                      man would not split a word or name, in a trade mark,
                      into its components, but would go by the overall
                      structural and phonetic similarity of the marks at the
                      nature of the goods previously purchased, or of which he
                      has been told and which he wants to purchase. It has to
                      be examined whether the totality of the trademark of the
                      defendant is likely to cause deception/confusion or
                      mistake in the minds of the persons accustomed to the
                      existing trade mark of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_205">                  (viii) The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the
                      basic idea represented by the plaintiff&#x27;s mark. The Court
                      is, however, required to apply both the phonetic and the
                      visual tests. At times, ocular similarity may be sufficient
                      to find possibility of confusion/deception, even if the
                      marks are visually dissimilar, though ocular similarity,
                      by itself, may not, generally, be the decisive test. Where,

                      word/words, in the marks, which are phonetically
                      similar, cannot be regarded as the dominant word, or
                      essential feature, in the marks, and

                      of confusion, it has been held that deceptive similarity
                      cannot be found to exist merely on the basis of phonetic
                      similarity or even identity. The matter, apparently, is
                      always one of fact. The Court would have to decide, on a
                      comparison of the two marks, and the parts thereof
                      which are phonetically similar, as to whether such
                      phonetic similarity is likely, considering all other
                      circumstances, to confuse or deceive a purchaser of
                      average intelligence and imperfect recollection, always
                      bearing in mind the nature of the goods, and the degree
                      of circumspection which would be expected of the
                      purchasers who would purchase such goods.
</p>
<p id="p_208">                  (ix) The Court is required to examine whether the essential
                      features of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark are to be found in the
                      mark of the defendant. Identification of the essential
                      features is a question of fact, left to the discretion of the
                      Court.
</p>
<p id="p_209">                  (x) No objective standards are possible, regarding the degree
                     of similarity which is likely to cause deception. It has to
                     be seen from the viewpoint of the purchasers of the
                     goods.
</p>
<p id="p_210">                  (xi) The test to be applied would depend on the facts of the
                      case. Precedents are valuable only to the extent they
                      specify tests for application, and not on facts.

<p id="p_211">                  (xii) On the issue of deceptive similarity, and especially with
                      respect to the aspect of phonetic similarity, English cases
                      are not of relevance. English cases are useful only to the
                      extent they aid in understanding the essential features of

                      India.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_213">    73.              Having regard to the factual calculus and the law as
         discussed above, the court comes to the following conclusions:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_56">                1. There is a striking similarity between the two marks and
                   the mark of the defendants can be legitimately treated as
                   deceptively similar mark. The similarity, especially, in
                   terms of the placement of words &quot;American&quot; and
                   &quot;Outfitters&quot; and the placement of the device on the top of
                   the Text is such that it can hardly be a coincidence or an
                   honest adoption. The adoption of the mark in question by
                   the defendants is of questionable intent, if not downright
                   dishonest. The similarity in terms of the font, the
                   reproduction of text in capital letters, their placement vis a
                   vis the device, indicate the intention of the defendants to
                   bring its own mark as close to that of the plaintiff. The
                   similarities are far more fundamental and have far greater
                   and stronger over reach, over the dis­similarities. In the
                   overall impression, the dis­similarities are too weak to be
                   qualify the test of confusion amongst the purchasers.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">                2. Although the words &quot;American&quot;, &quot;Outfitters&quot;, and &quot;Eagle&quot;
                   are generic / are not distinctive by themselves, there
                   conjunction with other and depiction in a particular
                   format, renders the same as distinctive, and it is for this
                   reason that the plaintiff has been able to secure with the
                   registration of its mark. To believe or to hold that there is
                   no distinctiveness in the mark of the plaintiff would
                   amount to leach the mark of its very protection
                   guaranteed by registration.</blockquote>
<p id="p_214">                3. The defendants have not been able even to carve out their
                   case as honest and concurrent user, although there is a
                   feeble attempt by the defendants to impress upon the court
                   that the adoption of the impugned mark is honest and

<p id="p_215">                    pursuant to due research.
</p>
<p id="p_216">                4. The fact that the defendants have themselves applied for
                   the registration, implies a clear divestiture of right to
                   claim that the words &quot;American&quot; &amp; &quot;Outfitters&quot; used in
                   plaintiff&#x27;s mark are descriptive/generic.
</p>
<p id="p_217">                5. The probability of confusion amongst the class of buyers is
                   high having regard to the quotient of similarity between
                   the marks in question, which is further sharpened by the
                   fact that the marks are being used in identical trade.
</p>
<p id="p_218">                6. The plaintiff is a prior user of the mark, and considering
                   the rigidity that defines the rights of the prior adapter
                   and user, the defendants cannot be permitted to use the
                   mark identical or deceptively similar to that of the
                   plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_219">    74.            Since the plaintiff has been able to prove the mark of the
         defendants to be deceptively similar, the plaintiff has been able
         to prove it to be a case of infringement as well as passing off.
         What factors in significantly here is that the defendants
         continue to proceed with his business even after the issuance of
         Cease &amp; Desist Notice.

</p><p id="p_224">    76.            Although, it is impressed upon the court that the plaintiff
         is entitled to damages, having regard to the fact that there is no
         evidence by the plaintiff as to suffering of any pecuniary
         damages, the court is not inclined to grant of damages to the
