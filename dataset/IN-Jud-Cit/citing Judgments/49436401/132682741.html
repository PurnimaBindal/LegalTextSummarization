                      defendants have ridiculed and defamed the plaintiff company, its news
                      channels, its employees and Management, and have published various
                      videos and articles containing false, malicious, defamatory and
                      derogatory information on their website as well as on various social-
                      media platforms. The attempts through these videos and articles of the
                      defendants No.1 to 9 were to consistently denigrate, deprecate, ridicule
                      and derogate the news broadcast by the plaintiff‟s channels as well as the
                      anchors who hosted these news broadcasts. Thus, the false and
                      defamatory statements have lowered the reputation of the plaintiff in the
                      eyes of the right-thinking members of the society as also caused
                      defamation to the plaintiff, its news channels, its anchors, its employees
                      and its Management and have seriously caused prejudice to their
                      commercial reputation and goodwill.

                      claimed in the plaint, which is not permissible in law. It is further
                      submitted that the issues, as raised in the plaint, are triable issues, which
                      can only be considered after evidence is led and cannot be adjudicated at
                      this stage. Furthermore, since the plaintiff has suppressed material facts
                      by editing and showing only that portion of the videos that helps its case,
                      the plaintiff cannot be granted any protection. It is also submitted that the
                      use of the plaintiff‟s content by them is covered under „Fair Use‟
                      inasmuch as they give due credit to the plaintiff and in no manner, try to
                      portray to its subscribers/viewers/customers that the video/copyrighted
                      material used of the plaintiff is of the defendants. It is stated that since
                      their business and work model is unique, their actions do not constitute
                      commercial disparagement, also because their content includes original
                      reportage, interviews and podcasts and in no way, amounts to the
                      infringement of the copyrighted work of the plaintiff. Additionally, it is
                      submitted that the plaintiff has made misrepresentation to this court and
                      therefore, cannot be entitled to any discretionary relief.

                      that the defendants No.1 to 9 had utilized the content created by the
                      plaintiff and broadcast on its various channels and reproduced the same in
                      their own programmes, namely, „TV Newsance‟, „Criticles‟, and „NL
                      Tippani‟, etc., and published various videos and articles, which they
                      broadcast on their social-media platforms, and if a chart was to be
                      prepared, it would show that 90% of the programme comprised of the
                      content taken from the plaintiff‟s news channels or similar other channels
                      and it was less than 10% that constituted the programming of the
                      defendants No.1 to 9. It was submitted that as observed in Hubbard v.

                       of the videos in question also sufficiently reflected that the content of the
                      programmes of the defendants No.1 to 9 was formed majorly out of the
                      content produced by the plaintiff. It was submitted that the plaintiff had to
                      spend money and effort to create content and in order to protect such
                      creation, copyright protection was available to it. It was further submitted
                      that unlicensed reproduction in the manner that the defendants No.1 to 9
                      were doing, infringed the broadcasting rights of the plaintiff and had to be
                      straightaway injuncted. Reliance has been placed on the decision of a
                      Coordinate Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/576454/" id="a_5">Super Cassettes Industries Limited v.

                      observations, particularly in respect of the ―violation of copyright‖ and
                      ―fair dealing‖, had not been disturbed.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                      26.    The further contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff was
                      that the remarks and the language used in the videos of the defendants
                      No.1 to 9 reflected defamatory content. It was submitted that specific
                      words were used which resulted in ―commercial disparagement‖,
                      particularly, the description of the programme as a &quot;shit programme&quot;, the
                      capacity of an anchor to create a riot, to derisively comment on a new
                      channel called „Good News Today‟, which has intended only to
                      disseminate positive news, since in usual course, these do not get
                      reported. Also, an attempt has been made to disparage the revenue model
                      of the plaintiff by proclaiming that they were an „ad-free‟ news channel.

                      only a suit, which related to immovable property, would be maintainable
                      as a commercial suit and none others. Thus, if a suit was a composite one,
                      it had to go before the ordinary civil court. According to the learned
                      senior counsel, though the prayer „a‟ would make out a commercial suit,
                      since prayers „b‟ to „h‟ would make out only a civil suit for defamation
                      and damages, therefore, this was a „composite suit‟, and had to be tried
                      only in the ordinary civil jurisdiction and not in the special jurisdiction of
                      the commercial courts.

                      of composite filing, the very system would get clogged and the purpose

                      &quot;dramatic&quot;, &quot;musical&quot; or &quot;artistic&quot; work would not constitute

                      available to &quot;fair dealing&quot; with &quot;any&quot; work. It was also argued that what
                      the defendants No.1 to 9 had done was to „comment‟ on the reporting
                      quality of the plaintiff and therefore, the content that may have been
                      created by the plaintiff was being used only for criticism or review and

                      which was an absolute defence and no interim injunction could be issued.

                      injunction, also because of misrepresentation of facts. It was contended
                      that the chart that was being used to show that the content of the plaintiff
                      was being reproduced by the defendants No.1 to 9, was in fact false, as
                      the videos clearly show the anchor of the defendants No.1 to 9 making
                      her comments even in the backdrop of the footage of the plaintiff‟s
                      programme and therefore, there was no copying and it was an original
                      piece of programming that was being aired by the defendants No.1 to 9. It
                      was submitted that the programme comprised of, what were the words
                      being used by the anchor as a comment on the small footage that was
                      taken as a context for the comment, which would not amount to any
                      infringement of copyright or defamation, but the improper depiction in
                      the chart showing large sections in red as if the entire programme of the
                      defendants No.1 to 9 constituted a complete copy of the contents of the
                      plaintiff‟s programming, disentitled them to any discretionary relief.

                      plea of „commercial disparagement‟ was not made out. It was the case of
                      the learned senior counsel for the defendants No.1 to 9 that the plaintiff
                      and the defendants No.1 to 9 operate in different spheres inasmuch as the
                      plaintiff was in the Electronic Media of TV news and News based
                      programmes, whereas the defendants No.1 to 9 operated only on social-
                      media platforms. Further, there was nothing in the videos that would
                      show &quot;disparagement&quot;, as whatever was being said was to indicate that
                      the plaintiff‟s channels had a bias, including of hesitancy to criticize the

                       Government, and that all that the defendants No.1 to 9 were doing was to
                      show them the mirror. It was further submitted that when the aim of the
                      defendants No.1 to 9 was only to critique and point out the flaws in the
                      reporting on the plaintiff‟s channels, there could be no evident malice.
                      Moreover, the defendants No.1 to 9 must be given an opportunity to
                      establish this defence during trial, that the comments were based on truth.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                      34.    It was further submitted by the learned senior counsel that the right
                      of the defendants No.1 to 9 to create such programmes was based on their
                      Fundamental Right to free speech and the same could not be curtailed
                      even without any specifics being pleaded in the plaint as to in which way,
                      „commercial disparagement‟ had occurred. It was urged by the learned
                      senior counsel that when the balance was to be sought between the
                      „pecuniary loss‟, if at all that may have resulted, and the „freedom of
                      speech‟, then the latter must be upheld.

<p id="p_44">                      35.    It was submitted that though the print-media had a watchdog, since
                      the electronic media had none, persons like the defendants No.1 to 9
                      actually acted in public interest, by keeping a check on the news
                      channels. According to the learned senior counsel, on account of one such
                      programme criticizing an anchor of the plaintiff, namely, Anjana Om
                      Kashyap, she faced a lot of backlash, after which she herself publicly
                      apologized. Thus, the interest of the public being served by the
                      programmes of the defendants No.1 to 9, there was no ground at all to
                      direct the taking down of these videos. In any case, it was emphasized
                      that each video would have to be considered independently to know
                      whether it contained any disparaging material. Thus, without trial, no

                      could be tried as a „commercial suit‟ despite inclusion of reliefs of
                      „infringement of copyright‟ and „commercial disparagement‟ since it was
                      covered under the definition of a „commercial dispute‟ as arising out of

                      According to the learned counsel for the plaintiff, the ―classes‖ of
                      disputes have been defined in the nature of „arrangements‟, „transactions‟
                      or „rights‟ and any dispute arising out of such „arrangements‟,
                      „transactions‟ or „rights‟ would come within the four corners of
                      „commercial dispute‟. To merely refer to the reliefs that were claimed
                      would, therefore, be improper. Furthermore, the reliefs could not be
                      bifurcated as it would contravene the provisions of Order II Rules 1 and 2
                      CPC. Thus, it was submitted that the suit was maintainable as a
                      „commercial suit‟. Arguments on merits were reiterated to urge for an
                      injunction against the defendants No.1 to 9.

                      defendants No.1 to 9, the instant suit could not be considered a
                      „commercial suit‟ since it was not covered under any of the clauses of
                      <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_38">Section 2(1)(c)</a> of the Act, considering that relief not only pertaining to
                      copyright violations had been claimed, but a relief qua defamation was
                      also claimed. It was urged that the Explanation limited the expansion of
                      the definition of a commercial dispute only in respect of an immovable
                      property and therefore, the present suit is not maintainable as a

                       be incorrect to hold that it sets out an exhaustive list of disputes that
                      qualify as commercial disputes. If that was the intent, the words used
                      would simply have been - ―the following are commercial disputes‖.
                      Instead, the words used are ―arising out of‖. That is, the source of the
                      dispute must be one of the clauses listed in <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_42">Section 2(1)(c)</a> of the Act.
                      The clauses do not limit the contours of the dispute that may arise. What
                      would be the actual dispute in respect of ordinary transactions of
                      merchants, or export and import of merchandise, or carriage of goods, or
                      construction and infrastructure, and so on and so forth, would remain
                      what would arise in ordinary course between two parties in the course of
                      these engagements and activities. Thus, such a dispute could be a breach
                      of contract or the enforcement of terms of contract entailing recovery not
                      only of the price, but possibly damages; disputes may relate to mutual
                      rights or obligations under Joint Venture Agreements or rights and
                      obligations in respect of Consultancy Agreements; disputes arising out of
                      technology development agreements could entail rights to the sharing of
                      the know-how and/or confidentiality, and so on and so forth. In short, if
                      the disputes were relatable to any of the clauses, the disputes would be
                      clothed with the additional adjective of being „commercial‟ in nature. The
                      classification has been given to make available a special procedure for
                      trial and speedy disposal of such disputes that impact economic activity.

                      the relief of defamation in the present suit took it out of the commercial
                      court‟s jurisdiction. This Court is unable to accept this argument.
</p>
<p id="p_66">                      45.    In fact, the Division Bench of this court in <a href="/doc/6085319/" id="a_43">Jagmohan Behl v. State
                      Bank of Indore</a>, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 10706 and the Supreme Court in
                      Ambalal Sarabhai (supra) have interpreted Explanation-A differently.
                      Where disputes arose out of Agreements relating to immovable property
                      used exclusively in trade and commerce i.e., under <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_44">Section 2(1)(c)(vii)</a>
                      and where that dispute also additionally involved action for recovery of
                      immovable property or realization of monies out of immovable property
                      given as security or involved any other relief pertaining to immovable
                      property, such immovable property referred to in the Explanation-A
                      would have to be one that was in ‗actual&#x27; and exclusive use in trade or
                      commerce. That alone would not render a dispute not commercial in the
                      light of Explanation-A read with <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_45">Section 2(1)(c)(vii)</a>. It is crystal clear
                      that these decisions do not conclude that the Explanation-A is to be read
                      with every clause under <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_46">Section 2(1)(c)</a>. This Court is also not convinced
                      otherwise.

                      definition of commercial disputes as provided under the Act. It was held
                      by the Supreme Court that a narrow interpretation alone would give effect

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">                                   ―14. In that view it is also necessary to carefully

                             the definition ―commercial disputes‖ as provided under the
                             Act. In the instant case, as already taken note neither the
                             agreement between the parties refers to the nature of the
                             immovable property being exclusively used for trade or
                             commerce as on the date of the agreement nor is there any
                             pleading to that effect in the plaint. Further the very relief
                             sought in the suit is for execution of the mortgage deed
                             which is in the nature of specific performance of the terms of
                             Memorandum of Understanding without reference to nature
                             of the use of the immovable property in trade or commerce
                             as on the date of the suit. Therefore, if all these aspects are
                             kept in view, we are of the opinion that in the present facts
                             the High Court was justified in its conclusion arrived
                             through the order dated 1-<a href="/doc/97516015/" id="a_47">3-2019 [K.S. Infraspace

                      clauses and therefore, just as in that case the pleadings were referred to,

                      „commercial dispute‟ and fitted into one of the clauses, that exercise

                       has alleged that the defendants No.1 to 9 have infringed their copyright in
                      content created by them for their own programme by investing human
                      and material resources and that a mandatory injunction be issued to
                      restrain the defendants No.1 to 9 from using the content so created by the
                      plaintiff and in which, under law, they were entitled to copyright
                      protection. The plaintiff has additionally submitted that while so
                      infringing the rights of the plaintiff in its created content, the defendants
                      No.1 to 9 had made defamatory and derogatory statements on the
                      programming content, quality of the content, the anchors, reporters and
                      editors of the plaintiff and the revenue model of the plaintiff, which also
                      amounted to commercial disparagement.
</p><p id="p_70">                      49.    It is therefore, evident that the suit is not just for relief against
                      defamation, which would certainly not constitute a „commercial suit‟, but
                      is one in which the violation of the intellectual property rights, namely, in
                      copyright,     has   allegedly       resulted   in   defamation/commercial
                      disparagement also. It is clear that the cause of action is the same,
                      namely, the uploading of the videos on YouTube and articles and other
                      content on the website of the defendants No.1 to 9 as well as on
                      Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. To hold that the plaintiff would have to
                      limit its relief before the commercial court only to the extent of violation
                      of intellectual property rights and must be asked to approach the civil
                      court for relief qua defamation, etc., would be against the objective of

                      purpose of procedure is to facilitate disposal and cannot be intended to

                       Bench of this Court in Jasper Infotech (supra) while dealing with a suit
                      seeking permanent and mandatory injunction restraining disparagement,
                      defamation, passing off, treated that suit to be a „commercial dispute‟.
                      Since a case for protection against commercial disparagement has been
                      pleaded in the instant plaint, a different yardstick need not be adopted
                      here.

<p id="p_72">                      51.     It is clear that relief in respect of copyright violations can be sought
                      only before the commercial court in view of the clause (xvii) of Section
                      2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act. If the other reliefs claimed by the
                      plaintiff ―arise‖ out of such intellectual property rights, clearly the
                      commercial court would have the jurisdiction to try the suit. ―Arising out
                      of‖, on a plain reading, would cover situations such as in the present case,
                      where the reliefs are so closely intertwined, where disparagement is
                      alleged by the very use and portrayal of the copyrighted content of the
                      plaintiff by the defendants No.1 to 9.

<p id="p_73">                      52.     Thus, it is concluded that the dispute at hand is a „commercial
                      dispute‟ and the commercial court has jurisdiction to try the suit.

                      under &quot;broadcasting rights&quot;. The plaintiff creates programmes for
                      broadcast on its television channels and the social-media. A similar
                      exercise is undertaken by the defendants No.1 to 9 on their social-media

                      Broadcast is defined under <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_50">Section 2(dd)</a> of the Act, as below:-

                      channel on YouTube or other similar platforms, in the considered opinion
                      of this Court, recourse need not be taken to the definition of
                      „cinematographic film‟ to enforce copyright. The question whether there
                      can be copyright within such programmes, is not being considered here as

                      events and current affairs. Criticism or review of such programmes would
                      be both on content and the reporting of such current events and current
                      affairs. Reporting would, obviously, entail the coverage of current events
                      and current affairs in a particular manner and style, in keeping with the
                      philosophy of the T.V. channel or social-media channel. It is clear that to
                      comment on the act of reporting itself would be covered under
                      ―criticism‖ or ―review‖ under <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_68">Section 52</a> and <a href="/doc/921365/" id="a_69">Section 39</a> of the

                      <a href="/doc/921365/" id="a_70">Section 39</a> and/or <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_71">Section 52</a> of the Act and is actually in the nature of

                      be whether the comment was actuated by malice, or was an honest and
                      genuine opinion of the one expressing it and was in public interest.

                       defence of &quot;fair comment&quot; would be a good defence. A caution may be

                      question of ―fair comment‖ in respect of alleged copyright infringement.
                      Lord Denning MR observed as below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">                                   ―It is impossible to define what is ―fair dealing.‖ It
                              must be a question of degree. You must consider first the
                              number and extent of the quotations and extracts. Are they
                              altogether too many and too long to be fair? Then you
                              must consider the use made of them. If they are used as a
                              basis for comment, criticism or review, that may be fair
                              dealing. If they are used to convey the same information as
                              the author, for a rival purpose, that may be unfair. Next,
                              you must consider the proportions. To take long extracts
                              and attach short comments may be unfair. But, short
                              extracts and long comments may be fair. Other
                              considerations may come to mind also. But, after all is said
                              and done, it must be a matter of impression. As with fair
                              comment in the law of libel, so with fair dealing in the law
                              of copyright. The tribunal of fact must decide. In the
                              present case, there is material on which the tribunal of fact
                              could find this to be fair dealing.‖

                       ―fair dealing‖. The learned Single Judge in <a href="/doc/543688/" id="a_78">Super Cassettes Industries
                      Ltd. v. Hamar Television Network Pvt. Ltd</a>., 2010 SCC OnLine Del 2086
                      discussed various decisions and summarized the broad principles of law
                      in para No.8, as below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">                                 ―8. If I may summarise the broad principles of law which
                              have enunciated in the judgments cited before me on the
                              aspect of ―fair dealing‖. These appear to be as follows:--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">                                 (i) It is neither possible nor advisable to define the exact
                              contours of fair dealing;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">                                 (ii) It is a question of fact, degree, and at the end of the
                              day overall impression carried by the court;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">                                  (iii) In ascertaining whether extracts taken from
                              copyrighted work have been put to fair use, the extent and
                              the length of the extracts may be relevant. Long extracts
                              followed by short comments may in certain circumstances
                              be unfair, while short extracts followed by long comments
                              may be fair. In certain circumstances even small extracts,
                              which are taken, on regular basis may point to unfair use of
                              the copyrighted work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">                                  (iv) The right to make fair use or to deal fairly with the
                              copyrighted work includes the right to criticize not only the
                              style, but also as the underlying doctrine or philosophy of
                              the copyrighted work. In this regard criticism could be both
                              ―strong‖ and ―unbalanced‖. Such criticism by itself will
                              not result in forfeiture of the defence of fair dealing.
                              Malicious and unjustified criticism may give to the
                              aggrieved party a cause for instituting an action for
                              defamation but it would certainly not confer a right founded
                              in copyright.

                              without having regard to the qualitative aspect. In other

                              person in whom inheres the copyright. This may be
                              particularly true in the case of musical works where a few
                              notes may make all the difference;

                      plaintiff that the discussion on ―fair dealing‖ could be referred to
                      profitably even if the final relief was declined. It is considered apposite to
                      reproduce para No.27 thereof as below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">                                    ―27. Before I proceed to deal with the case law cited
                              by the parties and examine the position on facts, I think it
                              appropriate to make a few preliminary observations
                              according to my understanding of the statutory position on a
                              plain reading of <a href="/doc/1013176/" id="a_80">Section 52</a> of the Act. What <a href="/doc/1247029/" id="a_81">Section 52(1)(a)</a>
                              permits is that the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
                              work may be reproduced without fear of infringement of
                              copyright in such works, if such reproduction is a fair
                              dealing of the copyright work in question, for the purpose of
                              criticism or review whether of that work or any other work.</blockquote>
<p id="p_117">                              Therefore, firstly it has to be ―fair dealing‖ of the work in
                              question. This means that the dealing with the copyrighted
                              work is not an unfair dealing. Only that part of the literary,
                              dramatic, musical or artistic work may be utilized for the
                              purpose of criticism or review, which is absolutely
                              necessary, and no more. The purpose - ostensibly or
                              obliquely, should not be to ride piggy back on the work of
                              another. The focus of attention, and interest of the
                              producer/author of the work and the viewer/listener should
                              not be the work of another, but the work created by the
                              person who may, bona fide be using the work of another for
                              the specific purpose of criticism or review of that work, or of
                              any other work. The work of another cannot be used for any
                              other purpose. The copyright protected work of another
                              cannot be used out of context. There has to be an intellectual
                              input and an original mental exercise undertaken by the
                              person bona fide lifting or copying the literary, dramatic,

                              cannot, in the name of ―fair dealing‖, lift or copy literary,
                              dramatic, musical or artistic work of another to such an
                              extent that it ceases to be a ―fair dealing‖ and becomes a
                              blatant act of copying the work of another.‖

</p><p id="p_118">                      69.    It is evident from these decisions that when work that is subject to
                      copyright or broadcast rights, is used, and a plea of infringement of those
                      rights is raised in a suit, the defence of ―fair dealing‖ by use of excerpts
                      is a plausible defence to such a plea. The court would then look into the
                      validity of the defence raised on parameters, such as, whether the
                      comments were devoid of malice; they were honestly made; and in public
                      interest; the reproduction was of short excerpts; there was some creative
                      input of the copier/reproducer; they constituted criticism and review, and
                      there was no blatant act of copying. But as observed in Hubbard (supra),
                      these are all questions of fact and have to be decided by the Trial Court.
                      One of the pleas urged by the defendants No.1 to 9 is that though they
                      were using excerpts from the programmes of the plaintiff, they were
                      doing so with an intent to comment and remove bias from reporting,
                      which was in public interest, and there was „transformative use‟ inasmuch
                      as the excerpts were superimposed with the comments by the defendant
                      No.5/Manisha Pandey (Newsance) and the defendant No.8/Atul
                      Chaurasia (Tippani). This defence raised will also have to be established

</p><p id="p_120">                      70.      It is the contention of the plaintiff that not only are the defendants
                      infringing the copyright of the plaintiff, but were portraying the content in
                      such a manner, with comments, that amounted to commercial
                      disparagement. Reputation, to put simply, is life itself. The high test laid
                      down in Bonnard v. Perryman, [1891] 2 Ch. 269 before an injunction
                      could be granted restraining publication affecting reputation, has since
                      been eased in England in Taveta Investments Limited Vs. The Financial
                      Reporting Council, [2018] EWHC 1662 (Admin). In India too, it has
                      been held that right to reputation is sacrosanct. In Subramanium Swamy
                      (supra), the Supreme Court while dealing with the constitutional validity
                      of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_82">Section 499</a> and <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_83">Section 500</a> IPC has recognized „reputation‟ as being
                      an inherent component of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_84">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and that no one
                      could be allowed to sully the reputation of another by claiming the right

                      apart from the fact that the plaintiff is also broadcasting through
                      television channels. ―Commercial Disparagement‖ would occur when
                      one player in the field derides a rival and belittles or discredits or detracts
                      from the reputation of such a rival in respect of its products, services or

                      for economic activity. It informs the consumers of the existence of
                      various goods and services, the quality of these products and services, the
                      product origin etc. It also builds up reputation. It is in this context that the

                      an organization to proclaim before the public their superiority over rivals.
                      What is however prohibited is to call the rival‟s products or services as
                      poor or make untrue statements or mis-statements about the rival‟s
                      products or services. So also in the field of copyright and broadcast
                      rights, where a plea is taken of fair dealing, for if the rubicon is crossed,
                      the comment would make the defendant liable for defamation, harm to
                      reputation and disparagement. In other words, the programmes of the
                      defendants No.1 to 9 must not be showing the plaintiff‟s programmes in
                      poor light, asking viewers to stop watching the plaintiff‟s channels while
                      claiming their own to be the best. This, of course, will again be a question
                      of fact as to whether commercial disparagement has occurred or not. The
                      ―defence of truth‖, it may be noted, would be available as an absolute
                      defence to the plea of defamation/disparagement. This defence too is to

                              injunction is at a stage when the existence of the legal right
                              asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both
                              contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are
                              established at the trial on evidence. The court, at this stage,
                              acts on certain well settled principles of administration of
                              this form of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary
                              and discretionary. The object of the interlocutory
                              injunction, it is stated
                                     ―...is to protect the plaintiff against injury by
                              violation of his rights for which he could not adequately be
                              compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the
                              uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The
                              need for such protection must be weighed against the
                              corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against
                              injury resulting from his having been prevented from
                              exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be
                              adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need
                              against another and determine where the ‗balance of

                      injunction‖, we may now determine whether the plaintiff is entitled to the

<p id="p_131">                      CONCLUSION
</p><p id="p_132">                      77.    The right to free speech and expression has been enshrined in our
                      Constitution as a Fundamental Right. The right to free expression has
                      therefore been stoutly protected by the courts. No doubt, the right to free
                      speech is not unbridled nor is it recognized as absolute. It is subject to
                      reasonable restrictions, which includes the right to reputation, as has been
                      recognized in several judgments, particularly, Subramanium Swamy
                      (supra). <a href="/doc/539407/" id="a_92">In Secy., Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting, Govt. of
                      India v. Cricket Assn. of Bengal</a>, (1995) 2 SCC 161, the right to freedom
                      of speech and expression has been found to include the right to acquire
                      information and disseminate it and includes the right to disseminate ideas.
                      Quite clearly, the right to broadcast programmes would be included in the
                      right to free speech and expression. As has been held in <a href="/doc/243002/" id="a_93">Sakal Papers (P)
                      Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, (1962) 3 SCR 842, the right to free speech and
                      expression carries with it the right to publish and circulate one‟s ideas,
                      opinions and views with complete freedom and by resorting to the

                       available means of publication, which, in the opinion of this Court, would
                      also mean and include not only the electronic media and T.V. channels,
                      but also the social-media platforms as the object of publication and
                      broadcast is the same i.e., to reach out to the public.
</p>
<p id="p_133">                      78.    As observed by the Supreme Court in Subramanium Swamy
                      (supra) reputation is an integral part of the dignity of an individual and if
                      reputation is damaged, society as well as the individual would be the
                      loser. The old Bonnard Principle which set the high thresh-hold for grant
                      of injunction restraining publications on the ground of defamation and
                      harm to the reputation, has been watered-down by the courts, as noticed
                      above. The right to free speech is an important right, but reputation is an
                      equally important right. The courts, over a period of time, have
                      pronounced that reputation is an internal and central facet of right to life,
                      as protected under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_94">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Thus, a balance would
                      have to be struck between the two rights, one under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_95">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and
                      the other under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_96">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_134">                      79.    The defendants No.1 to 9, in the present case, have however
                      asserted another right and that is the unrestricted „right to comment‟. This
                      right to comment on the content created by others is claimed by them as
                      an exercise in public interest. It was the submission of the learned senior
                      counsel for the defendants No.1 to 9 that since the media had unbridled
                      power on account of the impact of its broadcast and reach, and since
                      unlike the print media, there was no regulation of the T.V. channels and
                      also the social-media, an unrestricted right to comment on each other‟s
                      content would steer the media into communicating and disseminating

</p>
<p id="p_135">                      80.    This Court cannot accept this self appointment by the defendants
                      No.1 to 9 as a „Regulator‟ of the content of the media, for the reason that
                      mechanisms exist for redressal of grievances relating to content of news
                      channels and for social-media content, set-up statutorily, including by the
                      platforms themselves. It is obvious that there can be no &quot;free for all&quot; in
                      the regulatory sphere. Every individual or organization cannot claim
                      authority to regulate - the chaos can be imagined - there will be only
                      regulators and none willing to bide by regulations!! But, dehors this claim
                      to the status of a regulator, albeit an informal one, what is seen is that
                      basically, the defendants No.1 to 9 disapprove of the coverage of current
                      news both, in the style, as well as its prioritization, by the main stream
                      media and T.V. channels or even the social-media platforms. But that
                      would be the opinion of the defendants No.1 to 9. The plaintiff may have
                      a contrary view regarding the prioritization and presentation of current
                      events by the defendants No.1 to 9. Therefore, ex facie, there is no public
                      interest in the particular programming of the content and broadcast of
                      such content by the defendants No.1 to 9. Every media house and channel
                      on T.V. or the social-media platforms, including that of the defendants
                      No.1 to 9, have their own philosophy, which gets reflected in the manner
                      of reportage and content of the programmes and that is not necessarily a
                      bad thing.
</p>
<p id="p_136">                      81.    What is not acceptable is the assertion of a supervisory right by one
                      media over another, as is the claim of the defendants No.1 to 9 in the
                      present case. Also hyperbolic is their claim that it is their criticism of the

                       programmes of the main stream media, including of the plaintiff, that
                      push them into rectifying mistakes and that therefore, their programmes
                      were invaluable in public interest, and as a corollary, therefore, their right
                      to comment and criticize cannot be restricted.
</p>
<p id="p_137">                      82.    Leaving aside such assertions, this Court would accept that the
                      right to comment on content created on social-media or on T.V. channels
                      has also to be recognized as a facet of the right to free speech and
                      expression under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_97">Article 19(1)(a).</a> In fact, the availability of a multitude
                      of reporting styles, prioritization and presentation of events that occur
                      daily, would always be in public interest, since broadcast is intended to
                      communicate to the public. Dissemination of a spectrum of information
                      by many players would result in a better informed society. Different
                      priorities would result in a range of information being readily available
                      with regard to current events. Varied presentations and discussions would
                      result in the availability of several shades of opinion before the public,
                      which can then come to its own conclusion. It would definitely be in the
                      interest of the public that every broadcaster has the right of fair comment
                      on current events and of criticism and review, including of the
                      programmes created by others.

<p id="p_138">                      83.    However, once again, if the right is one to be protected under
                      <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_98">Article 19(1)(a</a>), it will have to be subjected to reasonable restrictions

                      that threaten national security and law and order, which would need some

                       disparaging in content and/or presentation. Of course, the right to privacy
                      and reputation cannot be violated in the garb of freedom to comment.
                      Other than that, the ability to express an opinion must be freely available
                      for all who hold an opinion.

<p id="p_139">                      84.    It is the case of the plaintiff that the programmes of the defendants
                      No.1 to 9 actually use words that portray the plaintiff in very poor light
                      that they are engaging anchors who could ―create a riot‖ or ―their
                      business model was below par‖, since the defendants No.1 to 9 did not
                      seek advertisement and so on. This is countered by the defendants No.1 to
                      9 saying that they were justified in their comment. It is trite that while
                      determining whether the broadcast or the telecast contained defamatory
                      or disparaging content, it would be necessary to examine the intent and
                      the absence of malice as also the overall effect of the programme
                      commented upon, not just on the subscribers/loyal viewers of the
                      television or the social-media channels, but its impact on a reasonable
                      person, who is generally interested in viewing such programmes. Or to
                      put it succinctly, it is a question to be determined by the trial judge,
                      whether or not the comments and programmes are ―fair comment‖ or not
                      and that determination can be only after the conclusion of the trial.

                       indeed satire. It must be self-evident and by its very character can never
                      be a case of copyright infringement or defamation or even disparagement.
                      Satire cannot be explained or else it would lose its flavour. Satire allows
                      the satirist to criticize in the harshest of terms and critique actions of all,
                      particularly of those in positions of power and/or authority and
                      leadership. The intention of the satirist is to simultaneously highlight an
                      action and its negative fallout, so that rectificatory action could be taken.
                      It is never intended to disparage or harm reputation and thus is
                      completely devoid of malice. Satirists, at all times in our culture, have
                      been greatly respected and there are several art forms in this country that
                      allowed such criticism of even the Rulers in the heydays of Monarchy
                      and which art forms still exist. Examples, that come to mind are
                      &quot;Ottamthullal&quot; and the &quot;Chakiyaarkoothu&quot;, both in Kerala. Sharp use of
                      language conveys the message intended by the artists, but in a cultured
                      and nuanced manner. Such creative genre must, without doubt, be
                      encouraged and protected. Since the defendants No.1 to 9 claim their
                      programme is satire, they need to explain which one of their programmes
                      is &quot;satire&quot;, what portion is &quot;comment&quot; and what justified &quot;criticism&quot;. But
                      whether the comment is satirical or malicious would have to be
                      established as a fact and therefore, would require trial and a presumption
                      either way cannot be drawn at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_141">                      86.    In this background, it would be necessary to determine whether the
                      plaintiff has satisfied the three cardinal principles for grant of interim
                      injunction. It may be mentioned that the interim injunction is sought at a
                      time when the rival claims are yet to be determined for their merit.

                       Additionally, in the case of defamation, it is also to be seen, what is the
                      defence raised, and if the defence is of ―truth‖ or ―justification‖ that has
                      been raised, ordinarily, no injunction would follow as the defendant has
                      to get the opportunity to prove such a defence. In the present case,
                      ―truth‖ was pleaded, but without disclosing whether the ―truth‖ relates
                      to the events covered, or the ―truth‖ of the manner of coverage of current
                      events by the plaintiff, or the ―truth‖ of the comments of the defendants
                      No.1 to 9. It does not seem that in the present case, truth is available as a
                      defence. At best, what is portrayed in the programmes of the defendants
                      No.1 to 9 is an opinion. That opinion is claimed to be, firstly, in the
                      public interest and, secondly, an honest and fair comment. The comments
                      do not seem strictly in public interest, except as part of the larger picture
                      of the right to express an opinion adding to the availability of myriad
                      such opinions to the public at large. Whether the comments constitute
                      honest and fair comment will require trial.

                      shown that the content created by them is protected by the statute under
                      broadcast rights and the defendants No.1 to 9 have not sought nor have
                      been granted any licence for reproduction. The extracts given in the

                      of the plaintiff. The use of words such as, &quot;shit standards&quot;, &quot;shit playing&quot;
                      on the channel, &quot;shit reporters&quot;, &quot;shit show&quot;, would show, that the words

                       programmes/shows of the plaintiff are bad. The other extracts may, at this
                      stage, appear as criticism and an opinion that the defendants No.1 to 9
                      could seek to justify. Again, to say that one of the anchors was engaged
                      as she had great potential for starting a riot, would seem disparaging of
                      the capacity of the plaintiff to engage capable anchors apart from a
                      questioning of the anchors own capabilities, and how such statements
                      would be justified by the defendants No.1 to 9, is not evident.

<p id="p_144">                      88.    The other suggestive comments, that seeking advertisements was
                      bad as a revenue model and that the model of the defendants No.1 to 9 of
                      seeking subscriptions alone ensured a free and unbiased reporting, would
                      be commercial disparagement, as advertisements on T.V. channels or
                      even social-media cannot be a ground for rejecting a channel‟s view point
                      or reporting. There is no gainsaying that advertisements plays a
                      significant role in informing the public of availability of goods and
                      services and the wide reach of the electronic media and T.V. channels as
                      also the social-media, often lead manufacturers of goods and services to
                      advertise on these platforms and thus, expand their own business. These
                      statements call for justification by the defendants No.1 to 9.

<p id="p_145">                      89.    On these facts, which have been noted, it cannot be denied that a
                      ―prima facie case‖ is disclosed. But disclosure of a prima facie case
                      alone will not entitle a plaintiff to interim injunction. The other two
                      requirements of ―balance of convenience‖ and ―irreparable loss and
                      injury‖ will need to be established before such injunction can be granted.
                      Since ―justification‖ and ―fair dealing‖ have been pleaded as defence,

                       given an opportunity to prove justification during trial. Furthermore, the
                      extent of infringement or fair use for fair comment and criticism would
                      also be a matter of trial as each video would have to be considered to
                      determine whether the excerpts are significant to be outright copying, or
                      constitute fair use without infringement. The contents of the individual
                      videos, the articles, the Facebook and Instagram posts will have to be
                      looked into individually to determine if they contain malicious, dishonest,
                      defamatory and disparaging statements or constitute honest and possible
                      satirical opinion. In short, the decision has to be deferred till after the
                      conclusion of the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_146">                      90.    The ―balance of convenience‖ would, therefore, tilt in favour of
                      the defendants No.1 to 9 as, in the event they are able to establish
                      justification and fair comment and fair dealing, the plaintiff would fail,
                      both in respect of their claim against copyright infringement/broadcast
                      right violation as also defamation/disparagement. If there is no
                      justification, there could probably be no fair comment either and thus no
                      defence against defamation either. Moreover, no injunction in futuro can
                      be issued, as has been held in Khushwant Singh (supra) and <a href="/doc/501107/" id="a_101">R.
                      Rajagopal v. State of T.N</a>., (1994) 6 SCC 632. Admittedly, some of the
                      videos and articles and posts in question, have been in existence since
                      2018 and hence, no real urgency has been shown even for the removal of
                      even those words noted hereinbefore, by issuing mandatory injunctions to
                      take them down. It must be kept in mind that a mandatory injunction is
                      issued at the interim stage only in rare and extraordinary situations. It
                      would be useful to reproduce the guidelines of the Supreme Court

                                   in the light of the facts and circumstances in
                                   each case. Though the above guidelines are
                                   neither exhaustive nor complete or absolute
                                   rules, and there may be exceptional
                                   circumstances needing action, applying them as
                                   prerequisite for the grant or refusal of such
                                   injunctions would be a sound exercise of a
                                   judicial discretion.‖        (emphasis added)

                      in circulation for a few years now, do not, in the opinion of this Court,
                      constitute exceptional circumstances for the issuance of directions in the
                      nature of mandatory injunction. Were the defendants No.1 to 9 to succeed
                      in their defence, the harm caused to the defendants No.1 to 9 would
                      outweigh the loss caused to the plaintiff. This is so also because the
                      plaintiff would be entitled to be compensated with damages, which the
                      plaintiff has actually quantified to the tune of Rs.2,00,00,100/- (Rupees
                      Two crores and one hundred). Thus, no ―irreparable loss or injury‖ that
                      cannot be recompensed by damages will be caused to the plaintiff in the

                      have ample opportunity to show the extent of reproduction made by the
                      defendants No.1 to 9 of the content of the plaintiff, in their own
