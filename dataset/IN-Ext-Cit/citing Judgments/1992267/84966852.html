                                 3




                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned Senior Advocate Shri M.S.Rajendra

Prasad appearing for the Counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Government Advocate as well as the Counsel for

Respondent no.1.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The facts are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_3">      It is the petitioner's case that the land bearing Survey

No.58/2 measuring 26 guntas, 59/3 measuring 1 gunta and

Survey No.61/2 measuring 11 guntas, of Dasanapura village,

Bangalore North Taluk, are said to be joint family properties

and the petitioner is said to be the karta of the joint family. It

is stated that these lands were subject matter of acquisition

proceedings for the purpose of constructing a direct approach

road to a proposed Truck Terminal to be established. It is

stated that the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation

(BMTC), had established a depot in land bearing Survey No.45

of Dasanapura village, and it is now proposed to establish a

Truck Terminal therein and accordingly, a preliminary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 4</span>




notification   dated 27.10.2010 was        issued, to which the

petitioner had filed objections, to the effect that the existing

state of affairs was not taken into consideration and that there

was no need to proceed with the acquisition proceedings. It is

stated that the third respondent has prepared a sketch, which

indicates a proposed approach       road   passing through      the

subject land and two other lands, namely, land bearing Survey

Nos.58/2 and 59/3 belonging to the petitioners. However,

those lands, namely, Survey Nos. 58/2 and 59/3 do not figure

in the    preliminary as well as the final notification.     It is

specifically contended that there is already a tar road running

from Gejagadahalli to Ravathanahalli and this is carved out of

gomal land and is therefore bounded on either side by gomal

land.    If the said road is widened and lead till D.Devaraj Urs

Truck Terminal, there would be no requirement of acquiring

the cultivated land and that it would amply serve the purpose

sought to be achieved      by the acquisition proceedings and

therefore, there was no need to proceed with the acquisition.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 5</span>




</p><p id="p_4">       It is also stated that there is a temple and two residential

houses of the petitioner and a cattle shed belonging to one

Thimmaiah and the same would be displaced in the event the

acquisition proceedings marching forward. The proposed road

passes through     several agricultural lands and        therefore

jeopardizes several items of agricultural lands.     On the other

hand, if alternative road is utilised, not more than 20 guntas of

agricultural land would be required for laying the same. The

learned Counsel would also allege that the proposal is only to

facilitate access to lands, which have been purchased by a

former Chief Minister through a benami holder and that there is

no public purpose involved.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      3.     The learned Senior Advocate       would also place

reliance on a decision of the apex court in <a href="/doc/1992267/" id="a_2">Dev Sharan and

others vs.   State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, 2011 AIR SCW 1778,

wherein it has been held that the concept of public purpose

must also be read into the provisions of emergency power

under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_3">Section 17</a> with the consequential dispensation of right
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>




of hearing under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_4">Section 5-A</a> of the LA Act. These questions

are to be examined carefully when little Indians lose their small

property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of

the State.   If public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering

common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of

acquisition, the Courts before sanctioning the acquisition, must

in exercise of its power of judicial review, focus its attention on

the concept of social and economic justice. While examining

these questions of public importance, the Courts, especially, the

High Courts, cannot afford to act as mere umpires.            The

learned Senior Counsel would submit that the said decision

would squarely apply to the facts and circumstances of the

present case and therefore, seeks that the petition be allowed.

</p><p id="p_6">      4. On the other hand, the learned Government Advocate

would point out, by reference to Annexure R.1 produced by

respondent no.4, the impracticability of utilizing the alternative

road by widening the same and connecting it to the proposed

Truck Terminal and would submit that it would require the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 7</span>




acquisition of several items of land and existing houses, while it

would not serve the purpose, as there is no independent access

to heavy trucks, which would be utilizing the proposed road to

access the Truck Terminal. A common road for other vehicles

as well as trucks is not intended and this is to be an exclusive

road for heavy trucks to access the Truck Terminal. The

acquisition has not been resisted by the other land owners,

whose lands are proposed to be acquired, except the present

petitioner. Even in so far as the present petitioner's lands are

concerned, it is only an extent of 11 guntas, that is proposed to

be acquired and there are other items of land available to the

petitioner and therefore, the hardship and inconvenience

pleaded or the contention that there is no public purpose served

by reference to an alleged extent of land held by the former

Chief Minister, are without any basis. Therefore, the need for

the Truck Terminal, in the absence of which, the trucks are

parked on the busy Bangalore-Tumkur Highway, NH-4,

resulting in traffic congestion and possible accidents, and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 8</span>




urgency in acquiring the land of the petitioner for the said

project, cannot be said to be illegal and unwarranted.

</p><p id="p_7">      5. The learned Counsel for the respondent no.4, on the

other hand, would also endorse the contention of the learned

Government Advocate and would submit that respondent no.4

is the beneficiary of the acquisition and has already invested a

large sum of Rs.12.00 Crore and that the project     is seriously

affected by virtue of these proceedings, when no other land

owner has sought to resist the acquisition, except the petitioner

and in view of the project has been brought to a stand-still by

virtue of the interim orders passed in this petition. As rightly

pointed out by the learned Government Advocate, this is the

only feasible road access to the Truck Terminal, which has

been scientifically deigned after much study of the terrain and

alignment. The alignment consists of seven horizontal curves

and it is in an upward gradient and the existing road crosses a

high tension line and has a culvert with two pipes of 900mm

dia. The alignment is unpaved road surrounded by buildings
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 9</span>




at the commencement of the road and cultivable lands as the

alignment approaches the project location.     The road has a

width of 6 metres to 8 metres, which is wholly inadequate. On

the other hand, the proposed alignment is the second shortest

option for the project site with total length of 960 metres. The

alignment is in the steep gradient unsuitable for truck

movements.     On the other hand, the proposed alignment is to

connect the Truck Terminal exclusively. The length of the

alignment is 750metres and consists of three horizontal curves

and it is in ruling gradient and it passes through the open land

and it is most convenient in all respects.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      6. The learned Senior Advocate, by way of reply, would

insist that   the land belonging to the petitioner in   Survey

Nos.58/2 and 61/2        are adjoining each other and were

conveniently being cultivated and by virtue of the formation of

the present road, the said extents of land are divided thereby

rendering cultivation impracticable and inconvenient and

therefore it is not merely the land which would be actually
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 10</span>




occupied by the proposed road, that would be lost, but also

other lands, which would be unavailable for convenient

cultivation.   It is also claimed that the plan, sought to be

produced at Annexure R.1, is not an accurate depiction of the

actual state of affairs. As for instance, the silver oak plantation

which is referred to in the said plan are non-existent and the two

items of land, which were earlier shown, have not been

included, which indicates a total lack of application of mind on

the part of the authorities in the proposed formation of the road.

The learned Senior Advocate would contend that the widening

of the existing road is far simpler and the contention that it

crosses high tension wires is not a tenable reason, as it is not

unusual for a road to pass under high tension wires and that the

other objection as regards the alternative option can also be

addressed by taking appropriate measures and would seek to

stand by the contention that the present formation of the road

is totally unnecessary.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 11</span><p id="p_9">




</p><p id="p_10">      7. Given the above contentions,       it is not disputed that

there are no other objectors      to the acquisition except the

present petitioner. In any event, there are no objections pending

which have been filed by other land owners questioning the

acquisition   proceedings, except the present petition.       The

extent of land that is sought to be occupied by the road is also

not in dispute. Therefore, the contention that the petitioner is no

longer capable of conveniently cultivating his land by the

formation of the road, is an aspect, on which the petitioner

may possibly urge a claim for enhanced compensation. That

however would not be a reason to set aside the acquisition

itself. In so far as the contention that it is not a public purpose

and there is no urgency involved cannot also be accepted on

the face of it. The facility has to be provided for the heavy

trucks plying on the high way and it cannot be said that it would

not be a public purpose and that there is no urgency involved if

the trucks which are presently parked along the highway are to

be moved away to ease the traffic and to avoid expenses. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 12</span>




further contention that the plan is conceived        with ulterior

motives is also not for the petitioner to decide nor for this court

to sit in appeal as it were as regards the feasibility or the

advisability of the formation of the said public road. It is

expected that the authorities involved       in the exercise are

adequately qualified and experienced in taking those decisions.

In so far as the legality of the acquisition proceedings itself is

concerned, except to state that the same causes hardship to the

petitioner, there is nothing that is sought to be urged. The

reference to the decision of the Supreme Court in Dev Sharan,

supra, is held not relevant having regard to the facts and

circumstances of that case wherein it was held that the need for

invocation of the emergency clause and the propriety of the

same was not established. Insofar as the suggestion that there is

an existing road, which could be widened to provide access to

the Truck Terminal, is also not an aspect, on which this court

would be competent to hold in favour of the petitioner.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               13</span>




Therefore, on the grounds that are urged, there is no substance

to sustain the challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Accordingly the petition stands dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      The Senior Advocate, at this stage, would fervently

appeal that instead of monetary compensation, the petitioner be

granted alternative land in lieu thereof.     Since there is a

provision under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_5">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894, for the State to

consider such an option, the petitioner may make appropriate

representation, which the State shall take into consideration in

addressing his claim for compensation.
