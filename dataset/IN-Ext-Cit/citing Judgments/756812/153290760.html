     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482 OF
CR.P.C.   PRAYING   TO   QUASH     THE  PROCEEDINGS    IN
CR.NO.139/2022 (ANNEXURE-A AND B) REGISTERED BY THE 1ST
RESPONDENT AGAINST THE PETITIONER UNDER SECTIONS 304B,
313 AND 498A OF <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>, PENDING ON THE FILE OF THE VIII
A.C.M.M., BENGALURU.


    THIS CRIMINAL PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS ON 06.07.2022, COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:-
                               ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner calls in question registration of a crime in

Crime No.139 of 2022 for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_2">Sections

304B</a>, <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_3">313</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_4">498A</a> of the IPC.
</p>

<p id="p_2">      2. Though the matter is listed in orders, with the consent

of parties, it is taken up for final hearing.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      3. Brief facts leading to the filing of the present petition, as

borne out from the pleadings, are as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The petitioner is the husband of one S.V.Raksha, who dies

committing suicide.      The complainant/2nd respondent is her

father and father-in-law of the petitioner. Marriage between the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>



petitioner and S.V.Raksha takes place on 11-12-2017 at

Chikmagalur. The same came to be registered on a later date. It

is the case of the petitioner that relationship between the wife

and the husband did not go well immediately after marriage and

they had serious compatibility issues between them. When

incompatibility   became   inevitable,   the   daughter   of   the

complainant appears to have left the matrimonial home and

began to reside with her parents at Bangalore. All efforts of

reconciliation which were on for over two years are said to have

failed. On the score of irreconcilable incompatibility both the

petitioner and the daughter of the complainant filed an

application for divorce under <a href="/doc/439618/" id="a_5">Section 13B</a> of the Hindu Marriage

Act, by mutual consent, in M.C.No.2415 of 2022. An application

is also filed for waiver of 6 months period for separation by

mutual consent. During the pendency of the said petition before

the Family Court, it transpires, on the morning of 13-06-2022

when the petitioner was at Mysore, he received a call from his

mother-in-law that their daughter had committed suicide by

hanging herself in the bed room of the parental house and a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         4</span>



report of suicide was made before the jurisdictional police. On

the said incident, a complaint came to be registered by the

complainant which becomes a crime in Crime No.139 of 2022 for

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_6">Sections 304B</a>, <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_7">313</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_8">498A</a> of the

IPC.         It     is   this   registration   of   crime   that    drives   the

petitioner/husband to this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_5">       4. Heard Sri Arun Govindaraj, learned counsel appearing

for    the        petitioner,   Sri   K.S.Abhijith,   learned      High   Court

Government Pleader appearing for respondent No.1 and Sri

M.R.C.Manohar, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.2.
</p>

<p id="p_6">       5. The learned counsel Sri Arun Govindaraj, appearing for

the petitioner would contend with vehemence, that a strained

relationship between the husband and the wife for over two

years has led the daughter of the complainant to leave the

matrimonial house and reside in her parents&#x27; house. The family

of the complainant also has a problem amongst themselves, as

there were several communications between the deceased and

brother of the deceased with regard to the behavior of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              5</span>



deceased towards the family of the petitioner or petitioner

himself. He would submit that ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_9">Section 304B</a> of the

IPC are not satisfied even to the remotest sense, as the

ingredients should be of such harassment for demand of dowry

that would lead to the death of the deceased/wife.      That not

being in place, he would seek quashment of entire proceedings

and would place reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court

in the case of <a href="/doc/258994/" id="a_10">SURESH KUMAR SINGH v. STATE OF UTTAR

PRADESH</a> - (2009) 17 SCC 243.
</p>

<p id="p_7">     6. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for

the 2nd respondent/complainant Sri M.R.C.Manohar, would

vehemently refute the submissions to contend that the death

has occurred only 15 days ago and the case is registered on

13.06.2022. The investigation is still on. At this stage, what is

to be looked into is only whether prima facie the complaint

satisfies the ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_11">Section 304B</a> of the IPC. He would

further submit that there are other offences alleged under

<a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_12">Sections 313</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_13">498A</a> of the IPC which are all cognizable. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     6</span>



would place reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the

cases of DINESHBHAI CHANDUBHAI PATEL v. STATE OF

GUJARAT AND OTHERS - (2018) 3 SCC 104, KAPTAN SINGH

v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH AND OTHERS - (2021) 9 SCC

35 and NEEHARIKA INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LIMIED v.
</p>
<p id="p_8">STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND OTHERS - 2021 SCC OnLine

SC 315. On the strength of the submissions and the judgments

relied on, the learned counsel seeks dismissal of the criminal

petition.
</p>

<p id="p_9">      7. The learned High Court Government Pleader would toe

the lines of the learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent

to contend that investigation material and Section 164 Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_10">statement would lead to the crime against the petitioner and,

therefore it is a matter of trial for the petitioner to come out

clean.
</p>

<p id="p_11">      8.    I   have   given   my       anxious   consideration   to   the

submissions made by the respective learned counsel and have

perused available material on record.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>




<p id="p_12">      9. The marriage between the petitioner and the daughter of

the complainant who is now dead is not in dispute. The

contention of strained relationship between the petitioner and

the deceased is also borne out from the records. The complaint

itself narrates that the deceased had left the matrimonial house

and was residing at her parental house. Whether this can be

enough circumstance to drive home any of the allegations under

<a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_14">Sections 304B</a>, <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_15">498A</a> or <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_16">Section 313</a> of the IPC is what falls for

consideration at this juncture in the case at hand? The daughter

of the complainant commits suicide on 12-06-2022.                  The

complainant on 13-06-2022 registers the complaint / report of

death before Sanjay Nagar Police Station, Bangalore. The report

so registered on that date is germane to be noticed and it reads

as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               &quot;It is to report that my daughter S.V.Raksha has
      committed suicide by hanging in my house. She was married to
      a planter Mr.Niranjan Hegde of Thannodi, Chikkamaglur Dist. in
      the year 2017 Dec. She was not finding her life comfortable
      with him eversince she got married. His parents and we too
      have had workedout to make the life of the couple happy but

     succeeded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           Raksha was working from home living in her room was

     had gone to her room to call for her tea and found Rakshas
     body was hanging from ceiling of her bed room in the I floor.
     As she started crying we asked her what happened she showed
     us the hanging body of the Raksha. I saw the dead body with
     my wife Dr.Ambujakshi and it was a shock and unexpected
     death. Raksha was unhappy in her life although had studied
     B.E., M.Tech and MBA. Her married life misery could have
     driven her to take the ultimate step to end her life. I have tried
     to inform her in-laws but the calls were not reachable, however,
     informed her husband Mr .Niranjan Hegde about his wifes
     suicide.   She might have committed her suicide last night
     i.e.12th Jun 22 after 09=00 pm.

            Please take necessary legal action deem necessary.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_13">The narration in the complaint by the father of the complainant

died by hanging herself from the ceiling of her bedroom in the

parental house. This was the initial report that was made to the

police by the father of the deceased. On the next day, a detailed

A perusal at the complaint registered on 14-06-2022 would

indicate circumstances which would touch upon the ingredients

of the offence, as the father narrates on 12-06-2022 the

petitioner and the deceased were in long conversation and after

the conversation it is the narration in the complaint that the

daughter was in deep mental stress and tears. The complaint

also narrates that when the daughter was pregnant in the year

2019, the petitioner husband takes her to a hospital and gets

forcible abortion to her. The complaint also narrates transfer of

certain money at intermittent intervals to the son-in-law. In the

teeth of this complaint, it is germane to notice the allegations

made qua the offences punishable under the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>. <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_18">Section 304B</a>

of the IPC which is the crux of the allegations reads as follows:

     otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven
     years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before
     her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by
     her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in
     connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall
     be called &quot;dowry death&quot;, and such husband or relative

on the night of 12-06-2022 just before the fateful incident she

was   in   conversation   with    her   husband.   Whether   the

conversation with the husband before her death has led to

commission of suicide or it was collective harassment for years

that has exploded in the said commission of suicide is a matter

to be necessarily tried, as prima facie the complaint narrates

such instances which could become ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_21">Section 304B</a>

of the IPC.</blockquote>

has placed on record the transactions between the account of

the father of the deceased and the son-in-law which narrates

certain amounts being transferred intermittently. So are the

amounts transferred from the account of the husband/petitioner

to his wife. But, nonetheless from the father-in-law, there are

transfers of amounts to the son-in-law. The quantum of amount

is not the issue, but the transfer of amounts would require

evidence as to whether it was demand of dowry or otherwise. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                     14</span>



phrase &#x27;soon before&#x27; as obtaining under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_22">Section 304B</a> IPC has

been interpreted by the Apex Court while interpreting <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_23">Section

304B</a> of the IPC. A three Judge Bench of the Apex Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/1263837/" id="a_24">KANS RAJ v. STATE OF PUNJAB1</a> has held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                &quot;15. It is further contended on behalf of the
         respondents that the statements of the deceased referred
         to the instances could not be termed to be cruelty or
         harassment by the husband soon before her death. &quot;Soon
         before&quot; is a relative term which is required to be considered
         under specific circumstances of each case and no
         straitjacket formula can be laid down by fixing any time-
         limit. This expression is pregnant with the idea of
         proximity test. The term &quot;soon before&quot; is not
         synonymous with the term &quot;immediately before&quot; and
         is opposite of the expression &quot;soon after&quot; as used
         and understood in <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_25">Section 114</a>, Illustration (a) of the
         <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_26">Evidence Act</a>. These words would imply that the
         interval should not be too long between the time of
         making the statement and the death. It contemplates
         the reasonable time which, as earlier noticed, has to
         be understood and determined under the peculiar
         circumstances of each case. In relation to dowry deaths,
         the circumstances showing the existence of cruelty or
         harassment to the deceased are not restricted to a
         particular instance but normally refer to a course of
         conduct. Such conduct may be spread over a period of
         time. If the cruelty or harassment or demand for
         dowry is shown to have persisted, it shall be deemed
         to be &quot;soon before death&quot; if any other intervening
         circumstance showing the non-existence of such
         treatment is not brought on record, before such
         alleged treatment and the date of death. It does not,
         however, mean that such time can be stretched to
         any period. Proximate and live link between the

         effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the
         consequential death is required to be proved by the
         prosecution. The demand of dowry, cruelty or
         harassment based upon such demand and the date
         of death should not be too remote in time which,
         under the circumstances, be treated as having
         become stale enough.&quot;

The Apex Court holds that there cannot be straight jacket

formula for interpretation of the phrase &#x27;soon before&#x27;. It is a

relative term which is required to be considered under specific

circumstances of each case. &#x27;Soon before&#x27; is not synonymous

with the term &#x27;immediately before&#x27;. The Apex Court in a later

judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/10522469/" id="a_27">SURINDER SINGH v. STATE OF

HARYANA2</a> while again dealing with <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_28">Section 304B</a> of the IPC has

                 been subjected by such person to cruelty or

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">             &quot;304-B.Dowry death.--(1) Where the death of
      a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or

      that soon before her death she was subjected to
      cruelty or harassment by her husband or any
      relative of her husband for, or in connection with,
      any demand for dowry, such death shall be called
      &#x27;dowry death&#x27;, and such husband or relative shall be
      deemed to have caused her death.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">       17. Thus, the words &quot;soon before&quot; appear in
<a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_31">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 and also in
<a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_32">Section      304-B</a>     IPC.     For     the    presumptions
contemplated under these sections to spring into
action, it is necessary to show that the cruelty or
harassment was caused soon before the death. The
interpretation of the words &quot;soon before&quot; is,
therefore, important. The question is how &quot;soon
before&quot;? This would obviously depend on the facts
and circumstances of each case. The cruelty or
harassment differs from case to case. It relates to the
mindset of people which varies from person to person.
</blockquote><p id="p_22">Cruelty can be mental or it can be physical. Mental cruelty
is also of different shades. It can be verbal or emotional
like insulting or ridiculing or humiliating a woman. It can
be giving threats of injury to her or her near and dear ones.
It can be depriving her of economic resources or essential
amenities of life. It can be putting restraints on her
movements. It can be not allowing her to talk to the outside
world. The list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Physical
cruelty could be actual beating or causing pain and harm
to the person of a woman. Every such instance of
cruelty and related harassment has a different
impact on the mind of a woman. Some instances may
be so grave as to have a lasting impact on a woman.
Some instances which degrade her dignity may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                            17</span>



remain etched in her memory for a long time.
Therefore, &quot;soon before&quot; is a relative term. In matters
of emotions we cannot have fixed formulae. The time-
lag may differ from case to case. This must be kept
in mind while examining each case of dowry death.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       18. In this connection we may refer to the judgment
of this Court in <a href="/doc/1263837/" id="a_33">Kans Raj v. State of Punjab</a> [(2000) 5 SCC
207: 2000 SCC (Cri) 935] where this Court considered the
term &quot;soon before&quot;. The relevant observations are as
under: (SCC pp. 222-23, para 15)

             &quot;15. ... &#x27;Soon before&#x27; is a relative term which is
      required     to   be    considered     under    specific
      circumstances of each case and no straitjacket
      formula can be laid down by fixing any time-limit.
      This expression is pregnant with the idea of
      proximity test. The term &#x27;soon before&#x27; is not
      synonymous with the term &#x27;immediately before&#x27; and
      is opposite of the expression &#x27;soon after&#x27; as used and
      understood in <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_34">Section 114</a>, Illustration (a) of the
      <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_35">Evidence Act</a>. These words would imply that the
      interval should not be too long between the time of
      making the statement and the death. It contemplates
      the reasonable time which, as earlier noticed, has to
      be understood and determined under the peculiar
      circumstances of each case. In relation to dowry
      deaths, the circumstances showing the existence of
      cruelty or harassment to the deceased are not
      restricted to a particular instance but normally refer
      to a course of conduct. Such conduct may be spread
      over a period of time. If the cruelty or harassment or
      demand for dowry is shown to have persisted, it
      shall be deemed to be &#x27;soon before death&#x27; if any
      other intervening circumstance showing the non-
      existence of such treatment is not brought on record,
      before such alleged treatment and the date of death.
      It does not, however, mean that such time can be
      stretched to any period. Proximate and live link
      between the effect of cruelty based on dowry

               demand and the consequential death is required to
               be proved by the prosecution. The demand of dowry,
               cruelty or harassment based upon such demand and
               the date of death should not be too remote in time
               which, under the circumstances, be treated as
               having become stale enough.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_24">         Thus, there must be a nexus between the demand of
         dowry, cruelty or harassment, based upon such
         demand and the date of death. The test of proximity
         will have to be applied. But, it is not a rigid test. It
         depends on the facts and circumstances of each case
         and calls for a pragmatic and sensitive approach of
         the court within the confines of law.&quot;

is against the accused unless otherwise proved. The Apex Court

in <a href="/doc/940643/" id="a_45">Rajinder       Singh v. State     of    Punjab [Rajinder
Singh</a> v. State of Punjab, (2015) 6 SCC 477 : (2015) 3 SCC
(Cri) 225] , <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_46">Section 2</a> of the Dowry Act has been split into
six distinct parts for a better understanding of the said
provision, which are as follows : (SCC p. 485, para 8)

             &quot;8. A perusal of <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_47">Section 2</a> shows that this
      definition can be broken into six distinct parts:
</p><p id="p_28">             (1) Dowry must first consist of any
      property or valuable security-- the word &quot;any&quot;
      is a word of width and would, therefore,
      include within it property and valuable
      security of any kind whatsoever.
</p>
<p id="p_29">            (2) Such property or security can be given or
      even agreed to be given. The actual giving of such
      property or security is, therefore, not necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_30">            (3) Such property or security can be given or
      agreed to be given either directly or indirectly.
</p>
<p id="p_31">            (4) Such giving or agreeing to give can again be
      not only by one party to a marriage to the other but
      also by the parents of either party or by any other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                            21</span>



      person to either party to the marriage or to any other
      person. It will be noticed that this clause again
      widens the reach of the Act insofar as those guilty of
      committing the offence of giving or receiving dowry is
      concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_32">            (5) Such giving or agreeing to give can be at
      any time. It can be at, before, or at any time after the
      marriage. Thus, it can be many years after a
      marriage is solemnised.
</p>
<p id="p_33">             (6) Such giving or receiving must be in
      connection with the marriage of the parties.
      Obviously, the expression &quot;in connection with&quot; would
      in the context of the social evil sought to be tackled
      by the <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_48">Dowry Prohibition Act</a> mean &quot;in relation with&quot;

</p><p id="p_34">                                         (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_35">       12. In the light of the above provision that
defines the word &quot;dowry&quot; and takes in its ambit any
kind of property or valuable security, in our opinion,
the High Court fell into an error by holding that the
demand of money for construction of a house cannot
be treated as a dowry demand. In Appasaheb
case [<a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_49">Appasaheb v. State of Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9 SCC
721 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 468] referred to in the impugned
judgment [<a href="/doc/1281027/" id="a_50">Jogendra v. State of M.P., Criminal Appeal No</a>.
48 of 2004, decided on 10-9-2008 (MP)] , this Court had
held that a demand for money from the parents of the
deceased woman to purchase manure would not fall within
the purview of &quot;dowry&quot;, thereby strictly interpreting the
definition of dowry. This view has, however, not been
subscribed     to    in Rajinder    Singh    case [<a href="/doc/141748525/" id="a_51">Rajinder
Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, (2015) 6 SCC 477: (2015) 3 SCC
(Cri) 225] wherein it has been held that the said decision
as also the one in Vipin Jaiswal v. State of A.P. [Vipin
Jaiswal v. State of A.P., (2013) 3 SCC 684 : (2013) 2 SCC
(Cri) 15] , do not state the law correctly. Noting that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                            22</span>



aforesaid decisions were distinct from four other decisions
of this Court viz. Bachni Devi v. State of Haryana [Bachni
Devi v. State of Haryana, (2011) 4 SCC 427 : (2011) 2 SCC
(Cri) 280] , <a href="/doc/52804604/" id="a_52">Kulwant Singh v. State of Punjab [Kulwant

Singh</a> v. State of Haryana, (2014) 4 SCC 129 : (2014) 4

Punjab [Raminder Singh</a> v. State of Punjab, (2014) 12 SCC
582 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 116] , the Court opined that
keeping in mind the fact that <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_55">Section 304-B</a> was
inserted in <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_56">IPC</a> to combat the social evil of dowry
demand that has reached alarming proportions, it
cannot be argued that in case of an ambiguity in the
language used in the provision, the same ought to be
construed strictly as that would amount to defeating
the very object of the provision. In other words, the
Court leaned in favour of assigning an expansive
meaning to the expression &quot;dowry&quot; and held thus:
(Rajinder Singh case [<a href="/doc/141748525/" id="a_57">Rajinder Singh v. State of
Punjab</a>, (2015) 6 SCC 477: (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 225] ,
SCC p. 491, para 20)

            &quot;20. [Ed. : Para 20 corrected vide Official
      Corrigendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./16/2015 dated 6-4-
      2015.] Given that the statute with which we are
      dealing must be given a fair, pragmatic, and common
      sense interpretation so as to fulfil the object sought
      to be achieved by Parliament, we feel that the
      judgment in Appasaheb case [<a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_58">Appasaheb v. State of
      Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9 SCC 721 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri)
      468]     followed   by    the    judgment      of <a href="/doc/167568223/" id="a_59">Vipin
      Jaiswal [Vipin Jaiswal v. State of A.P</a>., (2013) 3 SCC
      684 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 15] do not state the law
      correctly. We, therefore, declare that any money
      or property or valuable security demanded by
      any of the persons mentioned in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_60">Section 2</a> of
      the Dowry Prohibition Act, at or before or at
      any time after the marriage which is
      reasonably connected to the death of a married

      woman, would necessarily be in connection
      with or in relation to the marriage unless, the
      facts of a given case clearly and unequivocally
      point otherwise.&quot;
</p><p id="p_36">                                    (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_37">      13. The Latin maxim &quot;Ut res magis valeat
quam pereat&quot; i.e. a liberal construction should be
put up on written instruments, so as to uphold them,
if possible, and carry into effect, the intention of the
parties, sums it up. Interpretation of a provision of
law that will defeat the very intention of the
legislature must be shunned in favour of an
interpretation that will promote the object sought to
be achieved through the legislation meant to uproot
a social evil like dowry demand. In this context, the
word &quot;dowry&quot; ought to be ascribed an expansive
meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a
woman, whether in respect of a property or a
valuable security of any nature. When dealing with
cases under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_61">Section 304-B</a> IPC, a provision legislated
to act as a deterrent in the society and curb the
heinous crime of dowry demands, the shift in the
approach of the courts ought to be from strict to
liberal, from constricted to dilated. Any rigid
meaning would tend to bring to naught, the real
object of the provision. Therefore, a push in the right
direction is required to accomplish the task of
eradicating this evil which has become deeply
entrenched in our society.
</p>
<p id="p_38">       14. In the facts of the instant case, we are of the
opinion that the trial court has correctly interpreted the
demand for money raised by the respondents on the
deceased for construction of a house as falling within the
definition of the word &quot;dowry&quot;. The submission made by
the learned counsel for the respondents that the deceased
was also a party to such a demand as she had on her own
asked her mother and maternal uncle to contribute to the
construction of the house, must be understood in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                            24</span>



correct perspective. It cannot be lost sight of that the
respondents had been constantly tormenting the deceased
and asking her to approach her family members for money
to build a house and it was only on their persistence and
insistence that she was compelled to ask them to
contribute some amount for constructing a house. The
Court must be sensitive to the social milieu from which the
parties hail. The fact that the marriage of the deceased and
Respondent 1 was conducted in a community marriage
organisation where some couples would have tied the knot
goes to show that the parties were financially not so well
off. This position is also borne out from the deposition of
PW 1 who had stated that he used to bear the expenses of
the couple. Before the marriage of the deceased also, PW 1
had stated that he used to bear her expenses and that of
her mother and brother (his sister and nephew) as her
father had abandoned them. In this background, the High
Court fell in an error in drawing an inference that since the
deceased had herself joined her husband and father-in-
law, the respondents herein and asked her mother or uncle
to contribute money to construct a house, such demand
cannot be treated as a &quot;dowry demand&quot;. On the contrary,
the evidence brought on record shows that the deceased
was pressurised to make such a request for money to her
mother and uncle. It was not a case of complicity but a
case of sheer helplessness faced by the deceased in such
adverse circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_39">       15. Now, coming to the second point urged by the
learned counsel for the State that the High Court has
overlooked the fact that Geeta Bai had been subjected to
cruelty/harassment at the hands of the respondents soon
before her death, which submission is strictly contested by
the learned counsel for the respondents, we may note that
the meaning of the expression &quot;soon before her death&quot; has
been discussed threadbare in several judgments.
In SurinderSingh [Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana,
(2014) 4 SCC 129 : (2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 769] , while relying
on the provisions of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_62">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act,
1872 (for short &quot;the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_63">Evidence Act</a>&quot;) and <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_64">Section 304-B</a> IPC,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                           25</span>



where the words &quot;soon before her death&quot; find mention, the
following pertinent observations have been made : (SCC
pp. 137-39, paras 17-18)

            &quot;17. Thus, the words &quot;soon before&quot; appear
     in <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_65">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 and
     also in <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_66">Section 304-B</a> IPC. For the presumptions
     contemplated under these sections to spring
     into action, it is necessary to show that the
     cruelty or harassment was caused soon before
     the death. The interpretation of the words
     &quot;soon before&quot; is, therefore, important. The
     question is how &quot;soon before&quot;? This would
     obviously     depend       on    the     facts     and
     circumstances of each case. The cruelty or
     harassment differs from case to case. It relates to the
     mindset of people which varies from person to
     person. Cruelty can be mental or it can be physical.
     Mental cruelty is also of different shades. It can be
     verbal or emotional like insulting or ridiculing or
     humiliating a woman. It can be giving threats of
     injury to her or her near and dear ones. It can be
     depriving her of economic resources or essential
     amenities of life. It can be putting restraints on her
     movements. It can be not allowing her to talk to the
     outside world. The list is illustrative and not
     exhaustive. Physical cruelty could be actual beating
     or causing pain and harm to the person of a woman.
     Every such instance of cruelty and related
     harassment has a different impact on the mind of a
     woman. Some instances may be so grave as to have
     a lasting impact on a woman. Some instances which
     degrade her dignity may remain, etched in her
     memory for a long time. Therefore, &quot;soon before&quot;
     is a relative term. In matters of emotions we
     cannot have fixed formulae. The time-lag may
     differ from case to case. This must be kept in
     mind while examining each case of dowry
     death.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                     26</span>



<p id="p_40">      18. In this connection we may refer to the
judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/6721405/" id="a_67">Kans Raj v. State of
Punjab [Kans Raj</a> v. State of Punjab, (2000) 5 SCC
207: 2000 SCC (Cri) 935] where this Court
considered the term &quot;soon before&quot;. The relevant
observations are as under: (SCC pp. 222-23, para
</p><p id="p_41">15)

       &#x27;15. ... &quot;Soon before&quot; is a relative term
which is required to be considered under
specific circumstances of each case and
no straitjacket formula can be laid down by
fixing any time-limit. This expression is
pregnant with the idea of proximity test. The
term &quot;soon before&quot; is not synonymous with the
term &quot;immediately before&quot; and is opposite of
the expression &quot;soon after&quot; as used and
understood in <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_68">Section 114</a>, Illustration (a) of
the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_69">Evidence Act</a>. These words would imply that
the interval should not be too long between the time
of making the statement and the death. It
contemplates the reasonable time which, as earlier
noticed, has to be understood and determined under
the peculiar circumstances of each case. In relation
to dowry deaths, the circumstances showing
the existence of cruelty or harassment to the
deceased are not restricted to a particular
instance but normally refer to a course of
conduct. Such conduct may be spread over a
period of time. If the cruelty or harassment or
demand for dowry is shown to have persisted,
it shall be deemed to be &quot;soon before death&quot; if
any other intervening circumstance showing
the non-existence of such treatment is not
brought on record, before such alleged
treatment and the date of death. It does not,
however, mean that such time can be stretched to
any period. Proximate and live link between the
effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the
consequential death is required to be proved by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                            27</span>



      prosecution. The demand of dowry, cruelty or
      harassment based upon such demand and the date
      of death should not be too remote in time which,
      under the circumstances, be treated as having
      become stale enough.&#x27;

Thus, there must be a nexus between the demand of
dowry, cruelty or harassment, based upon such demand
and the date of death. The test of proximity will have to be
applied. But, it is not a rigid test. It depends on the facts
and circumstances of each case and calls for a pragmatic
and sensitive approach of the court within the confines of
law.&quot;

            &quot;24. We endorse what has been said by
      these two decisions. Days or months are not
      what is to be seen. What must be borne in mind
      is that the word &quot;soon&quot; does not mean
      &quot;immediate&quot;. A fair and pragmatic construction
      keeping in mind the great social evil that has led to
      the enactment of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_75">Section 304-B</a> would make it clear
      that the expression is a relative expression. Time-
      lags may differ from case to case. All that is
      necessary is that the demand for dowry should

not satisfied in the case at hand is unacceptable. The contention

is that it should be &#x27;soon before death&#x27; and soon before death is

required to be interpreted as &#x27;immediately before death&#x27; and the

deceased leaving matrimonial house two years ago would not

mean immediately before death, are all repellable, as it is too far-

interjected at this juncture, as there are undoubtedly plethora of

         the aforesaid provisions, this Court has held that the two
         sections are not mutually exclusive. It was also held that
         a person charged and acquitted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_88">Section 304-B</a>
         could be convicted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_89">Section 498-A</a> without
         charge being there if such a case is made out. This
         Court, however, hastened to add that to avoid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">4</span>
    (2011) 12 SCC 319
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                            31</span>



technical defects it is necessary in such cases to
frame charges under both the sections and that if
the case is established then they can be convicted
under both the sections but no separate sentences
need be awarded under Section 498-A in view of the
substantive sentences being awarded for the major
offence under Section 304-B.

<p id="p_52">       9. In the decision in Shanti case [(1991) 1 SCC 371 :
1991 SCC (Cri) 191 : AIR 1991 SC 1226] , this Court
considered the scope and ambit of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_90">Section 304-B</a> IPC and
also of <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_91">Section 498-A</a> IPC. Reference was also made to
provisions of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_92">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act. It was held
that <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_93">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act lays down that if
soon before the death such woman has been subjected to
cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any
demand for dowry then the Court would presume that such
a person has committed the dowry death. It was also held
that the meaning of &quot;cruelty&quot; for the purpose of this section
has to be gathered from the language as found in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_94">Section
498-A</a> and as per that section &quot;cruelty&quot; means &quot;any wilful
conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the
woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or
danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical)
of the woman or harassment of the woman where such
harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person
related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any
property or valuable security or is on account of failure by
her or any person related to her to meet such demand&quot;.

The Apex Court holds that in an offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_95">Section 304B</a> of

the IPC, on reading of the complaint and the materials that are

available, no case was made out to quash the entire proceedings

by rejecting the contention of the complainant. The case at hand

is also one such, where the complainant has placed on record

such material that would demand further proceedings to be

continued against the petitioner and the petitioner has not

placed on record any document that is so unimpeachable and of

sterling   quality   which   would   entail   quashment of      entire

proceedings at the stage of registration of FIR itself.

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">             &quot;27. Keeping in view the aforesaid principle of law,
     which was consistently followed by this Court in later
     years and on perusing the impugned judgment, we are
     constrained to observe that the High Court without any
     justifiable reason devoted 89 pages judgment (see paper
     book) to examine the aforesaid question and then came to
     a conclusion that some part of the FIR in question is bad in
     law because it does not disclose any cognizable offence
     against any of the accused persons whereas only a part of
     the FIR is good which discloses a prima facie case against
     the accused persons and hence it needs further
     investigation to that extent in accordance with law.

     the evidence nor could draw its own inferences from the
     contents of the FIR and the material relied on. It was more
     so when the material relied on was disputed by the
     complainants and vice versa. In such a situation, it
     becomes the job of the investigating authority at such stage
     to probe and then of the court to examine the questions

     step in to initiate the probe to unearth the crime in

In the case of KAPTAN SINGH (supra), the Apex Court has held

as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">            &quot;9.1. At the outset, it is required to be noted that in
     the present case the High Court in exercise of powers
     under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_97">Section 482</a> CrPC has quashed the criminal
     proceedings for the offences under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_98">Sections 147</a>, <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_99">148</a>, <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_100">149</a>,

     the High Court in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_104">Section 482</a>
     CrPC quashed the criminal proceedings, by the time the
     investigating officer after recording the statement of the
     witnesses, statement of the complainant and collecting the
     evidence from the incident place and after taking statement
     of the independent witnesses and even statement of the
     accused persons, has filed the charge-sheet before the
     learned Magistrate for the offences under <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_105">Sections 147</a>,
     <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_106">148</a>, <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_107">149</a>, <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_108">406</a>, <a href="/doc/430601/" id="a_109">329</a> and <a href="/doc/1183069/" id="a_110">386</a> IPC and even the learned
     Magistrate also took the cognizance. From the impugned
     judgment and order [<a href="/doc/190973290/" id="a_111">Radhey Shyam Gupta v. State of U.P</a>.,
     2020 SCC OnLine All 914] passed by the High Court, it
     does not appear that the High Court took into consideration
     the material collected during the investigation/inquiry and
     even the statements recorded. If the petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_112">Section
     482</a> CrPC was at the stage of FIR in that case the
     allegations in the FIR/complaint only are required to be
     considered and whether a cognizable offence is disclosed
     or not is required to be considered. However, thereafter
     when the statements are recorded, evidence is collected
     and the charge-sheet is filed after conclusion of the
     investigation/inquiry the matter stands on different footing
     and the Court is required to consider the material/evidence
     collected during the investigation. Even at this stage
     also, as observed and held by this Court in a catena
     of decisions, the High Court is not required to go into
     the merits of the allegations and/or enter into the
     merits of the case as if the High Court is exercising
     the appellate jurisdiction and/or conducting the
     trial. As held by this Court in <a href="/doc/72067405/" id="a_113">Dineshbhai

SCC (Cri) 683] in order to examine as to whether
factual contents of FIR disclose any cognizable
offence or not, the High Court cannot act like the
investigating agency nor can exercise the powers like
an appellate court. It is further observed and held
that that question is required to be examined
keeping in view, the contents of FIR and prima facie
material, if any, requiring no proof. At such stage,
the High Court cannot appreciate evidence nor can it
draw its own inferences from contents of FIR and
material relied on. It is further observed it is more
so, when the material relied on is disputed. It is
further observed that in such a situation, it becomes
the job of the investigating authority at such stage to
probe and then of the court to examine questions
once the charge-sheet is filed along with such
material as to how far and to what extent reliance
can be placed on such material.</blockquote>

<p id="p_57">       9.3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in    the
aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand, we   are
of the opinion that the High Court has exceeded             its
jurisdiction in quashing the criminal proceedings            in
exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_121">Section 482</a> CrPC.
</p>
<p id="p_58">       10. The High Court has failed to appreciate
and consider the fact that there are very serious
triable issues/allegations which are required to be
gone into and considered at the time of trial. The
High Court has lost sight of crucial aspects which
have emerged during the course of the investigation.
The High Court has failed to appreciate and consider the
fact that the document i.e. a joint notarised affidavit of
Mamta Gupta Accused 2 and Munni Devi under which
according to Accused 2 Ms Mamta Gupta, Rs 25 lakhs was
paid and the possession was transferred to her itself is
seriously disputed. It is required to be noted that in the
registered agreement to sell dated 27-10-2010, the sale
consideration is stated to be Rs 25 lakhs and with no
reference to payment of Rs 25 lakhs to Ms Munni Devi and
no reference to handing over the possession. However, in
the joint notarised affidavit of the same date i.e. 27-10-
2010 sale consideration is stated to be Rs 35 lakhs out of
which Rs 25 lakhs is alleged to have been paid and there
is a reference to transfer of possession to Accused 2.
Whether Rs 25 lakhs has been paid or not the accused
have to establish during the trial, because the accused are
relying upon the said document and payment of Rs 25
lakhs as mentioned in the joint notarised affidavit dated
27-10-2010. It is also required to be considered that the
first agreement to sell in which Rs 25 lakhs is stated to be
sale consideration and there is reference to the payment of
Rs 10 lakhs by cheques. It is a registered document. The
aforesaid are all triable issues/allegations which are
required to be considered at the time of trial. The High
Court has failed to notice and/or consider the material
collected during the investigation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                            37</span>



<p id="p_59">       11. Now so far as the finding recorded by the High
Court that no case is made out for the offence under
<a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_122">Section 406</a> IPC is concerned, it is to be noted that the High
Court itself has noted that the joint notarised affidavit
dated 27-10-2010 is seriously disputed, however as per
the High Court the same is required to be considered in the
civil proceedings. There the High Court has committed an
error. Even the High Court has failed to notice that another
FIR has been lodged against the accused for the offences
under <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_123">Sections 467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_124">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_125">471</a> IPC with respect to the said
alleged joint notarised affidavit. Even according to the
accused the possession was handed over to them.
However, when the payment of Rs 25 lakhs as mentioned
in the joint notarised affidavit is seriously disputed and
even one of the cheques out of 5 cheques each of Rs 2
lakhs was dishonoured and according to the accused they
were handed over the possession (which is seriously
disputed) it can be said to be entrustment of property.
Therefore, at this stage to opine that no case is made out
for the offence under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_126">Section 406</a> IPC is premature and the
aforesaid aspect is to be considered during trial. It is also
required to be noted that the first suit was filed by Munni
Devi and thereafter subsequent suit came to be filed by the
accused and that too for permanent injunction only.
Nothing is on record that any suit for specific performance
has been filed. Be that as it may, all the aforesaid aspects
are required to be considered at the time of trial only.
</p>
<p id="p_60">       12. Therefore, the High Court has grossly erred in
quashing the criminal proceedings by entering into the
merits of the allegations as if the High Court was
exercising the appellate jurisdiction and/or conducting the
trial. The High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in
quashing the criminal proceedings in exercise of powers
under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_127">Section 482</a> CrPC.
</p>
<p id="p_61">       13. Even the High Court has erred in observing that
original complaint has no locus. The aforesaid observation
is made on the premise that the complainant has not
placed on record the power of attorney along with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                    38</span>



     counter filed before the High Court. However, when it is
     specifically stated in the FIR that Munni Devi has executed
     the power of attorney and thereafter the investigating
     officer has conducted the investigation and has recorded
     the statement of the complainant, accused and the
     independent       witnesses,     thereafter  whether    the
     complainant is having the power of attorney or not is to be
     considered during trial.
</p>
<p id="p_62">            14. In view of the above and for the reasons stated
     above, the impugned judgment and order [<a href="/doc/190973290/" id="a_128">Radhey Shyam
     Gupta v. State of U.P</a>., 2020 SCC OnLine All 914] passed
     by the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings in
     exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_129">Section 482</a> CrPC is
     unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and
     set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. Now,
     the trial is to be conducted and proceeded further in
     accordance with law and on its own merits. It is made
     clear that the observations made by this Court in the
     present proceedings are to be treated to be confined to the
     proceedings under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_130">Section 482</a> CrPC only and the trial
     court to decide the case in accordance with law and on its
     own merits and on the basis of the evidence to be laid and
     without being influenced by any of the observations made
     by us hereinabove. The present appeal is accordingly
     allowed.&quot;
</p><p id="p_63">                                            (Emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_64">     16. In the light of the facts obtaining in the case at hand

and existence of seriously disputed questions of fact which have

to be thrashed out only in a full blown trial, finding no ground to

interject or interfere with further proceedings, the Criminal

Petition   lacking   in   merit,    meets   its   dismissal,   and   is

consequently dismissed.

<p id="p_65">        It is made clear that the observations made in the course

of the order are only for the purpose of consideration of the case
