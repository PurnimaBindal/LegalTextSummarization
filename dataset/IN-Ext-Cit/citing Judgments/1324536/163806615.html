<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                       Page 12 of 48</span>
 filled near the house of the appellant i.e. Z-307, Narain Vihar, Prem Nagar-II,

Delhi. The seizure memo of the knife is Ex.PW-23/R. The testimony of PW-23

Inspector Ravinder Singh, the Investigating Officer, in this regard is significant.

PW-23 deposed that the appellant on 11.03.2007 was apprehended from his

house vide arrest memo Ex.PW-23/N.            The appellant made a disclosure

statement in his presence on 11.03.2007 itself and the same is Ex.PW-23/P.

PW-23 stated that a churra was recovered from the water near the house of the

appellant pursuant to the said disclosure. In his cross-examination, PW-23

deposed that he met Head Constable Gyan (not examined) at about 1:00-1:30

a.m. in the night intervening between 04.03.2007/05.03.2007. Head Constable

Gyan had informed PW-23 that on the day of the incident i.e., 04.03.2007, the

appellant and Raghu Raj had suffered injuries and were admitted in ESI

Hospital, Basai Darapur. He admitted information recorded in D.D. No.44

(Ex.PW-10/B) by Head Constable Gyan. He did not inquire from the doctors

treating the appellant regarding his condition or about the nature of injuries

suffered by the appellant and Raghu Raj. PW-23 saw the MLC report of the

appellant (Ex.PW-21/DA) and accused Raghu Raj. He was not able to record

the statement of the appellant as the appellant was not in a fit condition.

However, subsequently PW-23 mentions that on 05.03.2007, when he visited

ESI Hospital, the appellant refused to give a statement on the ground that he

was in terrible pain but verbally confessed his guilt. PW-23 has stated that he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                        Page 13 of 48</span>
 had not arrested the appellant from the hospital but had deputed two constables

at ESI Hospital for keeping the appellant under surveillance only for

05.03.2007.       He could not, however, say whether the surveillance was

continued up to 11.03.2007 or not.
</p>
<p id="p_21">18.   PW-18 SI Puran Pant deposed that during investigation a telephonic

message was received by the Investigating Officer Inspector Ravinder Singh

(PW-23) regarding the admission of the appellant and Raghu Raj who were the

accused in the present FIR at ESI Hospital Basai Darapur. PW-18 deposed that

he along with PW-23 Inspector Ravinder Singh reached the Hospital and was

informed that the appellant and Raghu Raj was undergoing treatment. The

MLC's of the said persons were also handed over to PW-23 in his presence.

Thereafter, PW-23 deputed two constables at ESI Hospital. In his cross-

examination, PW-18 deposed that the information about the appellant and

Raghu Raj being admitted to the Hospital was received by Inspector Ravinder

Singh (PW-23) at about 1:00 a.m. in the night and MLC's were handed over at

about 2:30 a.m. in the night intervening between 04.03.2007/05.03.2007. He

further stated that D.D. No.44 (Ex.PW-10/B) regarding information received

from the ESI Hospital was already registered and he verified the contents of the

same on reaching back police station Prem Nagar.
</p>
<p id="p_22">19.   We find that the testimony of PW-23 Inspector Ravinder Singh regarding

the arrest of the appellant from his house and recovery of the churra (knife) at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                      Page 14 of 48</span>
 the instance of the appellant after his arrest cannot be accepted. We say so for

the following reason. As per the first MLC report of the appellant which is

Ex.PW-21/DA, the appellant was admitted to the ESI Hospital on the

04.03.2005 at about 6:45 p.m. by one Rohit (Nephew of the Appellant) with

alleged history assault by 15 persons. From the testimony of PW-23 Inspector

Ravinder Singh, the Investigating Officer, it is clear that that he had full

knowledge about the admission of the appellant for treatment at ESI Hospital.

PW-23 in fact left them under surveillance. It is highly implausible that the

PW-23 placed the appellant under surveillance but did not arrest him despite the

statement (Ex.PW-1/A) made by PW-1 Shambhu Nath in which he certainly

named the appellant as the person who stabbed the deceased.

</p><p id="p_23">20.   At this stage, it is also relevant to note that the discharge slip (Ex.DW-

4/A) of the appellant demonstrates that the he was admitted to the ESI hospital

on 04.03.2007 and discharged on 10.03.2007. Further the record of Tihar Jail

Hospital which is Ex.DW-8/A reveals that the appellant remain admitted in the

Tihar Jail Hospital from 11.03.2007 till his discharge on 04.05.2007. The said

record has been proved by DW-8 Sh Munna Thakur who was working as an

Orderly in the Tihar Jail at the relevant point of time. These documents indicate

that soon after being released from the ESI Hospital the appellant was admitted

to the Tihar Jail Hospital though both the discharge slip (Ex.DW-4/A) and the

medical record of Tihar Jail (Ex.DW-8/A) do not mention any specific time as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                       Page 15 of 48</span>
 to discharge and admission respectively. Now as per arrest memo Ex.PW-23/N,

the appellant was apprehended on11.03.2007 at 12:30 p.m. and on 11.03.2007

itself the appellant was admitted in to Tihar Jail Hospital by the police

themselves and therefore, the place of arrest mentioned in the arrest memo

(Ex.PW-23/N) to be the house of the appellant does not appear to be correct.

However, even if the place of arrest is mentioned incorrectly, it cannot be

disbelieved that the appellant was arrested only on 11.03.2007.

</p><p id="p_24">21.   The factum of recovery of churra/knife (Ex.P-3) as per the disclosure

statement of the appellant (Ex.PW-23/P) is improbable and suspicious. PW-23

Inspector Ravinder Singh in his testimony stated that on 05.03.2007 when he

reached the ESI hospital, the appellant was not in a fit condition to be

interrogated by him but despite his deleterious condition he confessed his guilt

orally before him. What prevented PW-23 from reducing the disclosure of the

appellant in to a written form? It is also unlikely that the appellant confessed his

guilt but did not disclose where he had hidden the weapon of offence. There is

no indication in the testimony of PW-23 that whether after 05.03.2007 he made

any efforts to record the statement of the appellant who continued to remain

admitted in the ESI Hospital till 10.03.2007. The fact the as soon as the

appellant was released from the ESI hospital he made a disclosure statement

and instantly led the police to the place where he had hidden the knife (Ex.P-3)

is strange when as per PW-23 no such disclosure was made by the appellant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                         Page 16 of 48</span>
 from 04.03.2007 till 10.03.2007. What is also noticeable is that as per Ex.PW-

23/P, the disclosure was made in the presence HC Surender No.1404 who has

not been produced by the prosecution as a witness. In these circumstances, the

possibility of churra being implanted cannot be ruled out completely and hence

the recovery of the knife/churra (Ex.P-3) at the instance of the appellant is

disbelieved and rejected.

<p id="p_25">
SEIZURE OF CARD BOARD(EX PW-18/B)

</p><p id="p_26">22.   As per prosecution, a "gatta" (card board) (Ex.P-1) stained in blood was

seized from the spot 'B' as indicated in the Site plan (Ex.PW-23/A). At the

same spot deceased had fell after being stabbed. The CFSL Report Ex.PW-22/B

postulates that blood was detected on the "gatta". It is the case of the

prosecution that the when the appellant stabbed the deceased on the neck, he

fell on the card board or "gatta" which in turn got stained by blood. In order to

establish the presence of blood stained "gatta" Ex.P-1, the prosecution relied on

the testimony of PW-1 Shambhu Nath, PW-23 Inspector Ravinder Singh, PW-

18 SI Puran Pant. According to PW-1's testimony the deceased fell on the

"gatta" when the appellant stabbed him and that is how the "gatta" got tarnished

by blood. PW-23 Insp. Ravinder Singh has deposed that on reaching the site of

the incident i.e. Z-Block, Narain Vihar, Prem Nagar-II, Sultanpuri, Delhi, ASI

Krishan (PW-16), Ct. Surender (PW-19) and Ct. Rajbir (not examined) were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                       Page 17 of 48</span>
 already present at the spot. Thereafter, SI Puran Pant (PW-18) reached the spot

and handed over the MLC of the deceased and other injured Ravi (PW-5),

Netrapal (PW-2) and Dharambir (PW-7). He stated that the crime team arrived

at the spot and handed him the crime team report Ex.PW-14/A prepared on the

spot. One blood stained "gatta" was kept in the polythene bag and converted

into a cloth parcel. The "gatta" was seized vide memo Ex.PW-14/A. PW-18 SI

Puran Pant has deposed that the crime team inspected the spot. One empty

cartoon piece stained with blood was found lying at the spot which sealed by

the Insp. Ravinder Singh (PW-23).
</p>
<p id="p_27">23.   The learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that statements made

PW-23 Inspector Ravinder Singh and PW-18 SI Puran Pant are contradicted by

the Crime Team Report (Ex.PW-14/A) which does not indicate about the

presence of the any "gatta" at the crime spot.
</p>
<p id="p_28">24.   We find that the in the column 12 of the Crime Team Report

(Ex.PW-14/A) which provides space for mentioning the articles which may be

seized by the Investigating Officer it is written as NIL. The contents of the

crime team report are clearly contrary to the testimonies of PW-1 Shambhu

Nath, PW-23 Inspector Ravinder Singh and PW-18 SI Puran Pant. However,

even if we disregard the recovery and presence of the "gatta" (Ex.P-1) at the

crime spot, it would not be an irregularity or a lapse fatal to the entire version

put forward by the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_30"> 25.   On merits, there can be hardly any doubt about the fact that the appellant

inflicted a blow with the churra near the neck of the deceased. The said singular

blow proved to be fatal. The affirmation that the aforesaid blow was inflicted by

the appellant emerges from the statements of PW-1 Shambhu Nath, PW-2

Netrapal, PW-5 Ravi, PW-9 Gopal and PW-7 Dharambir. All the aforesaid

witnesses were present at the place of occurrence and Ravi (PW-5), Dharambir

(PW-7) and Netrapal (PW-2) sustained injuries as well. There is no reason to

doubt the veracity of the said eyewitnesses regarding the fact that the appellant

stabbed the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
NON EXPLANATION OF INJURIES ON THE PERSON OF THE
APPELLANT.
</p><p id="p_32">26.   The learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the alleged incident

did not take place in the manner as it is being projected by the prosecution. He

submitted that the occurrence took place on account of a sudden fight between

the parties and hence, the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the Exception 4

to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_8">Section 300</a> IPC. The counsel for the appellant further contended that the

Trial Court while convicting the appellant under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">Section 302</a> IPC has not taken

into consideration the injuries suffered by the appellant as also the defence

testimonies put forth on behalf of the appellant. The counsel has stressed that

the appellant suffered injuries of grievous nature which could not have been

caused by mere falling as stated by PW-1 Shambhu Nath and PW-5 Ravi. He

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                        Page 19 of 48</span>
 further submitted that the prosecution has nowhere explained the reason behind

the injuries suffered by the appellant and it was for the prosecution to illuminate

the cause of injuries on appellant's person. The grievous nature of injuries on

the appellant's body soon after the incident clearly evince the fact that the

unfortunate incident occurred on account of a sudden fight/quarrel between the

parties with no scheming on behalf of the appellant To buttress this contention,

the counsel for the appellant has relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/1432936/" id="a_10">Nagarathinam &amp; Ors vs. State</a>, (2006) 9 SCC 57. He also urged that the

due weightage has not been accorded to the defence put forth by the appellant

in his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_11">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

(for short '<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a>.').
</p>
<p id="p_33">27.   The learned counsel for the appellant next contended that even if the

singular blow from the knife/churra is taken to have been inflicted by the

appellant, which proved fatal and resulted in death of Hari Prasad, the appellant

could only be punished for the offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_13">Section 304</a> IPC, and not for an

offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_14">Section 302</a> IPC. The Counsel contended that the appellant had

no intention cause death of the deceased as the incident in which death ensued

was a result of sudden fight which erupted at the spur of the moment and in heat

of passion the deceased got killed. It was further pointed out that the evidence

produced by the prosecution does not reveal any prior enmity between the

deceased and appellant. There was no premeditation, deliberation or malice on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                        Page 20 of 48</span>
 the part of the appellant to commit the offence. It is further submitted that the

appellant has not acted in an unusually cruel manner by inflicting a single blow

with a knife on the neck of the deceased. In order to substantiate this

contention, the appellant has relied on the decision of Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1324536/" id="a_15">Satish

Narayan Sawant vs. State of Goa</a>, (2009) 17 SCC 724 and <a href="/doc/1316909/" id="a_16">R.P Tyagi vs.

State</a>, (2009) 17 SCC 445. In Satish Narayan Sawant (supra), the Supreme

Court held:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">               "40. That being the well-settled legal position, when we test
               the factual background of the present case on the principles
               laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions, we are
               unable to agree with the views taken by the High Court. As
               already noted, it is quite clear from the record that there was
               an altercation preceding the incident. The place of occurrence
               is a residence inhabited by both the parties and there is no
               evidence on record that the deceased was armed with any
               weapon. Initially the appellant-accused also did not have any
               weapon with him but during the course of the incident he
               went inside and got a knife with the help of which he stabbed
               the deceased. PW-7 in his cross-examination has
               categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in
               consequence of Injury 1 and all other injuries were superficial
               in nature. So, it was only Injury 1 which was fatal in nature.
               Factually therefore, there was only one main injury caused
               due to stabbing and that also was given on the back side of
               the deceased and therefore, it cannot be said that there was
               any intention to kill or to inflict an injury of a particular
               degree of seriousness.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">               41. Records clearly establish that there was indeed a scuffle
               between the parties with regard to the availability of
               electricity in a particular room and during the course of
               scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple
               in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and
               scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of
               stabbing took place. There is, therefore, provocation and the
               incident happened on the spur of the moment. That being the
               factual position, we are of the considered view that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                             Page 21 of 48</span>
              present case cannot be said to be a case under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_17">Section 302</a>
             IPC but it is a case falling under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_18">Section 304</a> Part II IPC. It is
             trite law that Section 304 Part II comes into play when the
             death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is
             likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of
             the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily
             injury as is likely to cause death."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_34">28.    The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the State has

vehemently opposed the conversion of conviction from <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_19">Section 302</a> IPC to

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_20">Section 304</a> IPC. It is submitted that the appellant had intended to cause the

injury which resulted in death of Babu @ Hari Prasad. The said injury was

sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature and therefore, the

appellant has rightly been convicted under Clause 3 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_21">Section 300</a> IPC. The

learned APP further submitted that the said injury was neither accidental nor

unintentional and the same is apparent from the fact that the appellant was

armed with a knife and the deceased was unarmed. He submitted that all the eye

witnesses in unison have stated that the appellant stabbed the deceased after

being exhorted. The learned APP further submitted that the appellant had

inflicted the singular blow with great force. The force invested by appellant in

inflicting the single injury is palpable from the post mortem report Ex.PW-15/A

which indicated that single injury on the supraclavicular region near the neck

was found entering in to the chest cavity and after cutting the muscles and sub

cutaneous tissue had entered into the upper lobe of the right lung cutting the

lung tissues. To substantiate his contention, the learned APP has relied upon the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                             Page 22 of 48</span>
 decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1173740/" id="a_22">Pulicherla Nagaraju vs. State of A.P</a>, (2006)

11 SCC 444. In said case the accused gave only one dagger blow near the neck

of the victim causing his death. The accused was held guilty under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_23">Section 302</a>

IPC. The Supreme Court observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             "29. Therefore, the court should proceed to decide the pivotal
             question of intention, with care and caution, as that will
             decide whether the case falls under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_24">Section 302</a> or 304 Part I
             or 304 Part II. Many petty or insignificant matters --
             plucking of a fruit, straying of cattle, quarrel of children,
             utterance of a rude word or even an objectionable glance, may
             lead to altercations and group clashes culminating in deaths.
             Usual motives like revenge, greed, jealousy or suspicion may
             be totally absent in such cases. There may be no intention.
             There may be no premeditation. In fact, there may not even
             be criminality. At the other end of the spectrum, there may be
             cases of murder where the accused attempts to avoid the
             penalty for murder by attempting to put forth a case that there
             was no intention to cause death. It is for the courts to ensure
             that the cases of murder punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_25">Section 302</a>, are not
             converted into offences punishable under Section 304 Part
             I/II, or cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder,
             are treated as murder punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_26">Section 302</a>. The
             intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a
             combination of a few or several of the following, among
             other, circumstances: (i) nature of the weapon used; (ii)
             whether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked
             up from the spot; (iii) whether the blow is aimed at a vital part
             of the body; (iv) the amount of force employed in causing
             injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel
             or sudden fight or free for all fight; (vi) whether the incident
             occurs by chance or whether there was any premeditation;

             provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of passion; (x)
             whether the person inflicting the injury has taken undue
             advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi)
             whether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows. The

 himself had received injuries. DW-3 prepared the MLC of the appellant which

is Ex.PW-21/DA and proved the same. DW-3 has deposed that on 04.03.2007,

he was posted in casualty in the ESI Hospital and at about 6:45 p.m. one patient

namely Radhey Shyam, the appellant herein was brought to the Hospital with

alleged history of physical assault by about 15 persons with iron rod. DW-3

deposed that he medically examined the appellant and found CLW (Clear

Lacerated Wound) on the forehead and injury on the right leg. The appellant

complained of pain in chest (lower side). After examining the appellant, DW-3

referred him to the surgical department. In his cross examination he denied that

the MLC Ex.PW-21/DA was manipulated later on.

<p id="p_36">31.   DW-4 Dr. J.P. Singh is a surgical specialist in the ESI Hospital. He

deposed that he had treated the appellant and Dr. B. Sakia prepared the

discharge summary pertaining to the appellant under his supervision. The same

is Ex.DW-4/A dated 10.03.2007 which bears the signature of Dr. Sakia. DW-4

stated that the appellant had suffered a fracture on his right leg and on account

of that he was unable to move till his discharge from the Hospital.

injury on the right shoulder and Right tibia of the appellant. The said discharge

summary does not indicate that the appellant suffered from a fracture. However,

DW-4 Dr. J.P. Singh under whose supervision the discharge summary was

prepared has in clear and categorical terms deposed that the appellant suffered a

 fracture in his right leg. We do not find any reason that creates a doubt or

suspicion with regard to the said testimony. Nothing inconsistent has appeared

in the cross examination either. The medicals records (Ex.DW-8/A) maintained

by Tihar Jail Hospital reveal that for approximately two months, i.e., from

11.03.2007 till 01.05.2007, the appellant was continuously undergoing

treatment. From the aforesaid discussion, it is apparent that the appellant had

suffered injuries on his person which were grievous and dangerous so as to

<p id="p_39">34.   From the statement tendered by the appellant under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_30">Section 313</a> Cr. P.C.,

it appears that on 04.03.2007 at about 5:00 p.m. there was a scuffle between

two parties with the deceased, Shambhu (PW-1), Ravi (PW-5), Avdesh (PW-4),

Netrapal (PW-2) and Dharambir (PW-7) on one side and appellant along with

Raghu Raj, Giri Raj and one Rohit on the other side. The appellant in fact stated

that it was the deceased who along with his companions attacked at the

appellant's residence and on this fight erupted between the two groups.

Resultantly, mutual blows were exchanged. The appellant has stated that

injuries were inflicted on him by the deceased along with his companions.

</p><p id="p_40">35.   We shall first deal with the aspect as to what would be the effect of non-

explanation of injuries by the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      In the case of <a href="/doc/927539/" id="a_31">Takhaji Hiraji vs. Thakore Kubersing Chamansing and

Ors</a>. reported in (2001) 6 SCC 145, the Supreme Court dealt with the question
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                        Page 27 of 48</span>
 of non-explanation of injuries sustained by the appellant by the prosecution.

The Supreme Court observed that in <a href="/doc/463140/" id="a_32">Rajender Singh vs. State of Bihar</a>, (2000)

4 SCC 298 : <a href="/doc/107487/" id="a_33">Ram Sunder Yadav vs. State of Bihar</a>, (1998) 7 SCC 365 and

<a href="/doc/1060754/" id="a_34">Vijayee Singh vs. State of U.P</a>., (1990) 3SCC 190, all three Judge Bench

decisions, the view taken consistently is that it cannot be held as a matter of law

or invariably a rule that whenever the accused sustained an injury in the same

occurrence, the prosecution is obliged to explain the injury and on the failure of

the prosecution to do so the prosecution case should be disbelieved. Before the

non-explanation of the injuries on the person of the accused by the prosecution

witnesses may affect the prosecution case, the court has to be satisfied of the

existence of two conditions: (i) that the injury on the person of the accused was

of a serious nature; and (ii) that such injuries must have been caused at the time

of the occurrence in question. Non explanation of injuries assumes greater

significance when the evidence consists of interested or partisan witnesses or

where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of

the prosecution. Where the evidence is clear, cogent and creditworthy and

where the court can distinguish the truth from falsehood the mere fact that the

injuries on the side of the accused persons are not explained by the prosecution

cannot by itself be a sole basis to reject the testimony of the prosecution

witnesses and consequently the whole of the prosecution case.

Supreme Court observed that it is true that every injury is not liable to be

explained when the accused pleads a defence but contrarily an obligation does

lie on the prosecution to explain the presence of a serious injury.

</p><p id="p_43">      <a href="/doc/1660698/" id="a_36">In State of Gujarat vs. Bai Fatima</a>, (1975) 2 SCC 7, the Supreme Court

prosecution may not affect the prosecution case. This principle would obviously

apply to cases where the injuries sustained by the accused are minor and

superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent, so independent and

disinterested, so probable, consistent and creditworthy, that it far outweighs the

effect of the omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries.

</p><p id="p_44">      The omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries on the

person of the accused assumes much greater importance where the evidence

consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version

             were thus initial aggressors i.e. the prosecution witnesses or
             the appellants, is difficult to say. The High Court has found

             object to cause death of the accused of (sic) the prosecution
             witnesses. We have noticed hereinbefore the nature of injuries
             on the persons of the appellants. The first appellant received
             two stab wounds and also an incised wound over the scalp at
             frontal region. Appellant 2 received deep-cut wound and an
             incised wound over the scalp left side parietal region.
             Appellant 3 also received an incised scalp wound over frontal
             parietal region. It is not denied and disputed that they were in
             the hospital as indoor patients for a few days. We have
             furthermore noticed hereinbefore that they were also arrested
             after a few days.

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">             33. In the facts and circumstances of this case and keeping in
             view the defence raised by them, we are of the view that it
             was obligatory on the part of the prosecution to explain the
             injuries on the persons of the appellants. In Bishna [(2005) 12
             SCC 657: (2006) 1 SCC (Cri) 696 : (2005) 9 Scale 204 : JT
             (2005) 9 SC 290] this Court held: (SCC pp. 674-75, para 50)
             "50. The fact as regards failure to explain injuries on the
             accused vary from case to case. Whereas non-explanation of
             injuries suffered by the accused probabilises the defence
             version that the prosecution side attacked first, in a given
             situation it may also be possible to hold that the explanation
             given by the accused about his injury is not satisfactory and
             the statements of the prosecution witnesses fully explain the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                             Page 30 of 48</span>
              same and, thus, it is possible to hold that the accused had
             committed a crime for which he was charged. Where injuries
             were sustained by both sides and when both the parties
             suppressed the genesis in the incident, or were coming out
             with the partial truth, the prosecution may fail. But, no law in
             general terms can be laid down to the effect that each and
             every case where prosecution fails to explain the injuries on
             the person of the accused, the same should be rejected
             without any further probe. (<a href="/doc/295629/" id="a_38">See Bankey Lal v. State of

consequences of failure on part of the prosecution to explain injuries on the

accused will vary according to the facts and circumstances of each case. In

cases where the genesis of an incident is under cloud, if the prosecution

witnesses fully explain as to how the accused received injury/injuries, then the

prosecution need not to probe further into the matter. However, no straitjacket

and circumstances.

<p id="p_46"> 36.   In the present case, PW-23 Inspector Ravinder Singh has deposed that he

was aware about the appellant's admission in the ESI Hospital for treatment of

several injuries on the night intervening between 04.03.2007/5.03.2007. He

stated that no interrogation could be made from the appellant as he was under

treatment. In cross examination, PW-23 deposed that he had seen the MLC of

the appellant (Ex.PW-21/DA) and other accused Raghu Raj but did not

remember what injuries were mentioned in the same. PW-23 further admitted

that he did not remember whether he mentioned about the injuries and fracture

on the body of the appellant and Raghu Raj at time submitting the challan under

<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_41">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. He did not inquire or look into the medical records or x-ray

report of the either the appellant of the co-accused Raghu Raj. PW-23

interrogated the appellant on 05.03.2007 but the appellant denied making a

statement although he verbally confessed his guilt. The statement made by

PW-23 with respect to the investigation conducted by him about the injuries

suffered by the appellant is highly unsatisfactory and disappointing. It appears

from his statement that he made no efforts to inquire in to cause of injuries or

the manner in which injuries of such serious nature could have been suffered by

the appellant soon after the alleged incident. Even after the transfer of the

appellant from ESI Hospital to Tihar Jail Hospital on 11.03.2007, no efforts

have been made by PW-23 to find out actual cause behind the injuries suffered

by the appellant. It is relevant to mention that the appellant underwent treatment

 at Tihar Jail Hospital for nearly two months. Such a long period treatment

would not have been necessary in case the appellant had suffered a simple

injury or a mere abrasion. It was incumbent upon PW-23, the investigating

officer to probe into the cause of the injuries suffered by the appellant as there

were not minor or superficial injuries. The appellant sustained fracture in his

right leg which cannot be said to be a superficial injury and it was obligatory on

part of the prosecution witnesses to explain the cause of injury sustained by the

appellant. Such an inquiry would have been beneficial in finding the truth as to

how the incident took place. Further, the explanation put forth by PW-1

Shambhu Nath and PW-5 Ravi in their respective testimonies that the appellant

suffered injuries because of falling while he was fleeing from the scene of crime

is unacceptable.

<p id="p_52">38.   At this stage it is relevant to note the testimony of DW-7 Head Constable

Ranbir Singh. DW-7 Head Constable Ranbir Singh was examined by the

appellant to show that a complaint (Ex.PW-7/B) had been lodged on 12.04.2007

by the one Rohit alleging attack on the appellant. DW-7 produced the complaint

register and proved the same. The relevant entries Ex.DW-7/A and DW-7/C

indicate that complaint No. 4158 was filed by Sh. Rohit and according to

DW-7, the said complaint was referred to Police Station Sultanpuri on

12.04.2007 for appropriate action. In the complaint Ex.DW-7/B, it is recorded

that on 04.03.2007 some assailants attacked the house of the appellant and tried

to put it on fire. A call on 100 number was also made by Rohit giving

information about alleged attack to the police. The said PCR form is Ex.DY and

it records that the complaint was received from Mobile Phone Number

9873313255 which as per Ex.DW-7/B belonged to the complainant Rohit.

From the aforesaid defence evidence, it can be seen that the appellant's nephew

Rohit had made a complaint about the attack on the house of the appellant to

 the police. However, the said complaint was lodged on 12.04.2007 nearly after

8 days of the incident and there is a possibility that the said complaint was

lodged as a counter blast.

<p id="p_53">      Nevertheless, as already noted above, the appellant had suffered injuries

of grievous nature and the same cannot be disputed. This fact cannot be lost

sight of. We find that the impugned judgment has not at all considered the

injuries suffered by the appellant and has proceeded to convict the appellant

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_50">Section 302</a> IPC on the premise of the ocular testimonies of the various

eye witnesses who in clear and categorical terms deposed that the appellant

stabbed the deceased. We are of the opinion that the trial court committed a

manifest error by not reflecting upon the injuries caused to the appellant.

</p><p id="p_54">      What is also noticeable is the fact that the dispute is alleged between

PW-1 Shambhu Nath and Raghu Raj (the brother of the appellant) but there is

no material on record to show that whether any injuries were inflicted on PW-1

himself. No MLC pertaining to PW-1 is on record. It is strange that the PW-1

Shambhu Nath before court stated that Raghu Raj and Giri Raj blamed him and

Gulle @ Avdesh (PW-4) for breaking the slab in front of their house but PW-1

himself was not attacked by either the appellant or Raghu Raj and Giri Raj. It is

difficult to accept that the complainant who was the bone of contention escaped

unscathed from such a perilous assault in which the deceased lost his life and

the appellant also received grievous injuries. Another fact which raises an eye

 brow about prosecution's version as to how the alleged incident took place is

that the appellant suffered injuries of serious nature whereas except the

deceased the other witnesses namely Netrapal (PW-2), Ravi (PW-5) and

Dharambir (PW-7) only suffered slight injuries. The MLC of Netrapal (PW-2)

is Ex PW-8/C which indicates that he was having an incised wound over the

right lumbar region sized 3cm x 1cm x 1cm. PW-8 Dr. Brijesh Singh opined

that the injuries were of simple nature and weapon used was sharp. MLC of

Ravi (PW-5) is Ex.PW-8/D which indicates a CLW 3cm x 0.5cm x 0.5cm.

MLC of Dharambir (PW-7) is Ex.PW-8/B which is proved by PW-8 Dr. Brijesh

Singh. PW-8 opined that Dharambir had an incised wound size about 3cm x

1cm x 1cm on the right elbow. The injury was simple and sharp. The MLC's

demonstrate that Netrapal (PW-2), Ravi (PW-5) and Dharambir (PW-7) had

suffered mere abrasions and no other significant injury was found on their

bodies. We also note that from the site plan Ex.PW-23/A it appears that the

houses of all the involved persons, including the deceased and the appellant, are

closely located and therefore, it was easily possible for the parties involved to

reach the spot within a short span of time. In view of the aforesaid discussion

above, it can be inferred that the manner in which the incident took place is not

clear and is cloaked with different versions. It can further be inferred that

injuries resulted on both parties and therefore, the possibility of the incident

merits acceptance.

doubt that the deceased died due the a stab injury meted out by the appellant

             peculiar condition or state of health that the internal harm

             is not an essential requirement of clause (2). Only the
             intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the
             offender's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing
             the death of the particular victim, is sufficient to bring the

             the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart, as
             the case may be. If the assailant had no such knowledge about

             much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses.
             It will be sufficient to say that clause (4) of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_77">Section 300</a>

<blockquote id="blockquote_50">             21. From the above conspectus, it emerges that whenever a
             court is confronted with the question whether the offence is
             "murder" or "culpable homicide not amounting to murder",
             on the facts of a case, it will be convenient for it to approach
             the problem in three stages. The question to be considered at
             the first stage would be, whether the accused has done an act
             by doing which he has caused the death of another. Proof of
             such causal connection between the act of the accused and the
             death, leads to the second stage for considering whether that
             act of the accused amounts to "culpable homicide" as defined
             in <a href="/doc/305371/" id="a_78">Section 299</a>. If the answer to this question is prima facie

             is the stage at which the court should determine whether the

       From a perusal of the aforesaid judgment it becomes clear that if the

intended injury is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, the

offence will fall under murder. Under Clause 3 of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_86">Section 300</a> IPC, the factum

of presence of bodily injury and nature of the injury are purely objective

investigations. Thereafter, it has to be discerned whether the injury is either

intentional or accidental. The next question is whether the injury is sufficient to

cause death in ordinary course of nature. This enquiry is also objective in nature

and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender. Once it is established

that the offence falls under Clause 3 of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_87">Section 300</a> IPC, the next thing which

has to be considered is whether the offence falls under any one of the five

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">             "5. In assailing the conviction, learned Counsel for the
             appellant contends that the appellant having struck a solitary
             blow on the head of the deceased with the blunt side of
             the gandhala, can be attributed with the knowledge that it
             would cause an injury which was likely to cause death and
             not with any intention to cause the death of the deceased. The
             offence committed by the appellant, therefore, amounted to
             culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable
             under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_96">Section 304</a>, Part II of the Code. He further contends,
             in the alternative, that there could be no doubt that the
             appellant acted in the heat of the moment when he hit the
             deceased and is, therefore, entitled to the benefit of Exception
             4 of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_97">Section 300</a> of the Code. On the other hand, learned
             Counsel for the State contends that the matter squarely falls
             within clause Thirdly of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_98">Section 300</a> of the Code. He submits
             that merely because the appellant rendered a solitary blow
             with the blunt side of the gandhala on the head would not
             necessarily imply that the offence amounted to culpable
             homicide not amounting to murder punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_99">Section

<blockquote id="blockquote_57">             6. A quarrel took place on the spur of the moment. The

             deceased was just passing by the road in front of the house of
             the appellant, his forehead dashed with the parnala of the
             house of the appellant which provoked the deceased to
             remonstrate the appellant. It is in evidence that there was
             exchange of abuses and at that time appellant gave a blow
             with a knife which landed on the chest of the deceased.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">             7. Undoubtedly, PW 2 Dr H.S. Gill opined that the blow on
             the chest pierced deep inside the chest cavity resulting in the
             injury to the heart and this injury was sufficient in the
             ordinary course of nature to cause death. The question is
             whether in the circumstances in which the appellant gave a
             blow with a knife on the chest, he could be said to have
             intended to cause death or he could be imputed the intention
             to cause that particular injury which has proved fatal? The
             circumstances in which the incident occurred would clearly
             negative any suggestion of premeditation. It was in a sudden
             quarrel to some extent provoked by the deceased, that the
             appellant gave one blow with a knife. Could it be said that
             para 3 of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_103">Section 300</a> is attracted. We have considerable
             doubt about the conclusion reached by the High Court. We

              cannot confidently say that the appellant intended to cause
             that particular injury which is shown to have caused death.
             There was no premeditation. There was no malice. The
             meeting was a chance meeting. The cause of quarrel though
             trivial was just sudden and in this background the appellant, a
             very young man gave one blow. He could not be imputed with
             the intention to cause death or the intention to cause that
             particular injury which has proved fatal. Neither para 1 nor
             para 3 of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_104">Section 300</a> would be attracted. We are fortified in
             this view by the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1529505/" id="a_105">Jagrup Singh v.State
             of Haryana</a> [(1981) 3 SCC 616 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 768 : (1981)
             3 SCR 839 : 1981 Cri LJ 1136] . It was subsequently followed
             in <a href="/doc/613163/" id="a_106">Randhir Singh v. State of Punjab</a> [(1981) 4 SCC 484 : 1981

             SCC 245 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 826] . Following the ratio of the
             aforementioned decisions, we are of the opinion that the
             appellant could not be convicted for having committed
             murder of the deceased Narinder Singh. His conviction for an
             offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_108">Section 302</a> IPC and sentence of imprisonment
             for life are liable to be set aside.

<blockquote id="blockquote_59">             8. The next question is what offence the appellant is shown to
             have committed? In a trivial quarrel the appellant wielded a
             weapon like a knife. The incident occurred around 1.45 noon.
             The quarrel was of a trivial nature and even in such a trivial
             quarrel the appellant wielded a weapon like a knife and
             landed a blow in the chest. In these circumstances, it is a
             permissible inference that the appellant at least could be
             imputed with a knowledge that he was likely to cause an
             injury which was likely to cause death. Therefore, the
             appellant is shown to have committed an offence under
             <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_109">Section 304</a> Part II of the IPC and a sentence of imprisonment

<p id="p_62">41.   Now let us consider the facts and circumstances in the instant case in

view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court. As noted above the genesis of

the occurrence is blurred. It is uncertain as to who were the aggressors. The

appellant has also suffered severe injuries. The occurrence appears to be an

outcome of sudden fight. There is no cogent evidence on record to demonstrate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                           Page 46 of 48</span>
 that there was previous enmity or animosity between the appellant and

deceased. As per PW-1 Shambhu Nath, the quarrel happened because PW-1

and PW-4 Gulle had broken the slab in front of the house of the appellant by

driving their bikes in the gali. The dispute regarding breaking of slab on the

street was a trifle and not the basis of the fatal attack. It is apparent that this

was the basis/foundation of the quarrel but not the motive to cause or commit

murder. There were heated arguments and exchange of words and the tempers

soured with both sides loosing self control and physically attacking each other.

Apparently, there was no premeditation or scheming to cause death of the

deceased as from the Site plan (Ex.PW-23/A) it is evident that the houses of the

deceased, appellant as well as the eye witnesses were closely located. The crime

spot was also within close vicinity. Burst of anger and rage resulted in sudden

violence which went out of control. The possibility of appellant getting hold of

knife from his house at the spur of the moment is apparent and demonstrable.

Undoubtedly, the appellant has inflicted a deep injury on the neck of the

deceased which pierced through the muscles and reached the lung, but it must

also be borne in mind that a person while quarrelling in heat of passion in a

sudden physical or violent fight can act in a manner to which can result into

death. Here the injuries suffered by the appellant are relevant and have to be

noticed. Further others belonging to the deceased group did not suffer serious

injuries. As per the Supreme Court each case has to be weighed on its own
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">CRL.A.1348/2012                                                        Page 47 of 48</span>
 merit and a holistic view of the entire transaction has to be taken into

consideration in order to find out the nature of the actual offence committed.

From the totality of the circumstances as narrated above coupled with the nature

of the guilt, we hold that the appellant entitled to benefit of Exception 4 to

<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_110">Section 300</a> IPC .The punishment is converted from <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_111">Section 302</a> IPC to one

The quantum of fine imposed by the trial court is upheld. It is noted that the

years and 11 months. The appeal is partly allowed in aforesaid terms.
