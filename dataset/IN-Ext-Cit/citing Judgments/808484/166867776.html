FOLLOWING:-


                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Aggrieved by the order dated 15.12.2015 passed

in writ petition 57597 of 2014 by the learned Single

Judge, whereby the learned Single Judge has dismissed

the writ petition, the writ petitioner-auction purchaser

has preferred the instant writ appeal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>


<p id="p_2">     2.   The parties will be referred to as per their

ranking in the writ petition before the learned Single

Judge.
</p>


<p id="p_3">     3. Brief facts of the case are as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_4">     One Sri Jayanna was originally the owner of the

non-agricultural land bearing No.RS 21, Khata No.3681,

Mathadakurubarahatty,       Pune-Bangalore        Highway,

Chitradurga Taluk.    This property was purchased by

Jayanna at a Court auction under the sale certificate on

23.1.1981.   It transpires that Jayanna died and his legal

heirs were carrying on the business of the partnership

firm that Jayanna had during his life time.       The legal

heirs of Jayanna offered the above mentioned property

as a security for a loan borrowed from M/s. UCO Bank

for the sum of Rs.10.00 crore, in the year 2008.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>


<p id="p_5">     4.    On default of payment, the Bank initiated

proceedings under the Securitisation and Reconstruction

of Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security Interest

Act</a>, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') by issuing

notice under <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_2">Section 13(2)</a> of the Act. On further default

of the borrower, the Bank assigned its right to recover

the money under the mortgage deed and possession of

the property was taken on 27.6.2013.          Pursuant to

which, a sale notice was issued on 10.1.2014 fixing the

date of auction as 24.2.2014.     The reserve price that

was fixed was at Rs.7.5 crore.       The writ petitioner,

which is a Company incorporated under the provisions of

the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_3">Indian Companies Act</a>, 1956, having its registered

office at Bengaluru, submitted its bid and was declared

to be the highest bidder at Rs.8.01 Crore.     The bid of

the petitioner was accepted by the Bank and on such

acceptance, he was called upon to pay       25 percent of

the bid amount and the petitioner is said to have paid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>


the said amount. The sale was endorsed by the Bank in

favour of the auction purchaser namely, the writ

petitioner.
</p>


<p id="p_6">      5.      After all the above stated proceedings, the

Bank for the first time, informed the petitioner that the

2nd respondent-borrower had filed an appeal before the

Debt Recovery Tribunal, Bangalore (hereinafter referred

to as 'the DRT') in S.A. No.205/2014 inter-alia praying

to set aside the sale notice issued on 21.3.2014 by the

1st respondent-bank for sale of the secured asset.         On

6.5.2014 i.e., the date on which the bank had to

complete the transaction with the petitioner, the DRT at

Bengaluru passed an order of stay, which read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "The respondent Bank is at liberty to
      go ahead with the proposed sale of the
      schedule property to be held through e-
      auction on 09.05.2014 between 3.00 P.M.
      and     4.00   P.M.   as   required   under   law.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       However,     confirmation      of     sale    stands
       deferred in respect to the schedule property,
       subject to the condition that the appellant
       shall deposit Rs.2.00 lakh prior to sale and
       Rs.3.00 lakh on or before 30.5.2014 into the
       loan   account     in      question     with     the
       respondent Bank.
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              If applicant fails to comply with the
       stipulated   conditions,    the     order    granted
       today by this Tribunal stands automatically
       cancelled and respondent Bank is at liberty
       to proceed further as required under law".</blockquote>



<p id="p_7">       6. It transpires that no amount was deposited by

the 2nd respondent-borrower in terms of the order of the

DRT.     In those circumstances, the 1st respondent

confirmed the sale in favour of the petitioner and called

upon the petitioner to pay 75 percent of the                  sale

consideration by its communication dated 3.6.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_8">The petitioner in reply to the letter, deposited the sale
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7</span>


consideration of 75 percent of the auction purchase

amount on 30.6.2014.
</p>


<p id="p_9">     7.   After this event, the 2nd respondent filed an

application seeking further time to deposit the amount in

the pending proceeding before the DRT.            The DRT

allowing the application again granted time to the 2nd

respondent-borrower to deposit the entire amount that

was in default by its order dated 25.11.2014, which

reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              " (1) The Confirmation of Sale in
              favour of respondent No.2 stands set
              aside subject to the condition that the
              petitioner/appellant shall pay entire
              loan amount to the satisfaction of the
              respondent Bank.</blockquote>


<p id="p_10">              (2) The petitioner/appellant shall pay
              entire loan amount to the satisfaction
              of the respondent Bank on or before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                    8</span>


15.12.2014 towards the loan account
of the borrower.
</p>

<p id="p_11">(3) If the petitioner/appellant fail to
pay loan amount as stipulated above,
the Bank is at liberty to issue Sale
Certificate in favour of respondent
No.2.
</p>

<p id="p_12">(4)     Respondent     No.1   Bank   shall
return the entire deposited amount
paid by respondent no.2 to respondent
no.2 forthwith. However, petitioner/
appellant shall pay interest on the said
deposited amount of respondent No.2
at the rate of 11% p.a., with quarterly
rests from the date of deposit of the
amount of respondent No.2 till full
amount is paid to respondent no.2 on
or before 15.12.2014.
</p>

<p id="p_13">(5) If the petitioner/appellant fails to
do so ie., pay interest as stipulated
above, the respondent no.1 Bank is at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                     9</span>


liberty to issue Sale Certificate as
required    under       law   in    favour    of
respondent No.2 in respect to the
secured asset.
</p>

<p id="p_14">(6) Respondent No.1 Bank is at liberty
to return the documents deposited by
the   Borrower          to    the     present
petitioner/appellant          only       after
obtaining   the     written    consent       and
concurrence       from        the     present
Borrower-Cum-Owner of the secured
asset as required under law.
</p>

<p id="p_15">(7) In the event of non-getting such
written consent and concurrence from
the Borrower-Cum-Owner of secured
asset, respondent No.1 Bank shall not
release the documents in favour of the
present petitioner/appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_16">(8) Consequently, present SA stands
disposed of as it does not survive for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              10</span>


             consideration in the light of disposal of
             Memo and I.A.No.5167/2014. "
</p>


<p id="p_17">It is the afore-extracted order of the DRT dated

25.11.2014, that was challenged before the learned

Single Judge in the writ petition, by the auction

purchaser.
</p>


<p id="p_18">     8.   The sole contention of the writ petitioner was

that under the Act and the Rules framed thereof, the

DRT could not have granted further time to the

defaulter-borrower and could not have reversed or

negated the auction sale in favour of the petitioner. It

was the contention of the petitioner that he had a right

to get the property transferred in his favour as he had

deposited the entire amount and a sale certificate had

been issued in his favour. It was the further contention

of the petitioner that under <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_4">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                           11</span>


Bank having confirmed the sale in favour of the

petitioner, called upon him to pay the remaining balance

of sale consideration. The only event that remained was

the execution of the sale certificate in favour of the

petitioner quoting <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_5">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act.        The

petitioner also contended that the DRT had no inherent

powers of extending time contrary to the statute.   The

petitioner had placed reliance on several provisions of

the Act to buttress his submission that the statute does

not confer inherent powers upon the DRT. He has also

placed reliance on the following judgments:

</p><p id="p_20">      9.    The learned Single Judge, following the

observations of the Apex Court in case of MATHEW

VARGHESE VS. M. AMRITHA KUMAR AND OTHERS -
</p>
<p id="p_21">(2014) 5 SCC 610, observed that <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_6">Section 13(8)</a> of the

Act, is specifically for the protection of the borrower

inasmuch as the ownership of the secured asset is a

constitutional right vested in the borrower and protected

under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_7">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of India.     The

learned Single Judge further observed that the borrower

is to be given an opportunity to take all possible steps

for retrieving his property.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               13</span>




<p id="p_22">     10. The learned Single Judge noticing the fact that

no certificate of sale was issued in favour of the auction

purchaser and in order to balance equities, ordered that

the DRT was well within its power under the statute to

grant time to give an opportunity to the borrower to

make good the entire amount in default, unless it could

be demonstrated that the transaction was vitiated by

fraud or any other irregularity.      Observing thus, the

learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition filed by

the auction purchaser. Feeling aggrieved by the order

passed by the learned Single Judge, the writ petitioner-
</p>
<p id="p_23">auction purchaser has preferred the instant writ appeal.
</p>



<p id="p_24">     11. We have heard Sri Paras Jain, learned Counsel

appearing   for   appellant   and   Sri   K.R.   Parashuram,

learned Counsel appearing for respondent No.1.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               14</span>


<p id="p_25">       Sri. Nandeesh Patel, learned Counsel appearing for

caveator respondent No.2 remained absent.
</p>


<p id="p_26">       12.    The undisputed facts are that the property

that was mortgaged to the Bank was brought to sale by

the    Bank   by   invoking   the   provisions of   the    Act.
</p>
<p id="p_27">The possession of the property was also taken by the

Bank and a sale notice on 10.1.2014 was issued fixing

the date of auction as 24.2.2014.            The petitioner

emerged as the highest bidder and the Bank accepted

the bid of the petitioner.    The petitioner was called upon

to deposit 25 percent of the amount, which the

petitioner has complied.        The sale was endorsed in

favour of the petitioner. It was at that point of time, the

Bank    revealed   to   the   auction   purchaser   that   the

borrower has initiated proceedings before the DRT. The

very confirmation of sale in favour of the auction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                              15</span>


purchaser was to be kept in abeyance until further

orders.
</p>


<p id="p_28">        13. The conditions stipulated by the DRT were not

complied with by the borrower, instead the borrower

preferred another application seeking further time for

making good the entire deposit amount.            In the

interregnum, the petitioner was called upon by the bank

to pay the remaining amount of 75% as the borrower

had not complied with the order of the DRT in depositing

the amount to the Bank.       The auction purchaser the

deposited     entire   remaining   amount   of   75%   on

30.06.2014. It transpires that even then, the borrower

had not make good the entire amount in default to the

Bank.     But the borrower chose to file an application

before the DRT for further extension of time to pay the

entire amount in default.      The   DRT considering the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                            16</span>


application filed by the borrower on 25.11.2014, allowed

the same with certain further conditions and      further

time was granted to the borrower to make good the

entire amount to the Bank on or before 15.12.2014.     If

the borrower would not make the entire amount on or

before 15.12.2014, the Bank was given liberty to issue

sale certificate in favour of the petitioner.   Thus, the

fact that would emerge from the aforesaid sequence of

event is that as on date the DRT passed the order i.e. on

25.11.2014, no sale certificate was issued in favour of

the petitioner.
</p>


<p id="p_29">      14.    Learned Counsel for the petitioner would

contend that it is impermissible in law for the DRT to

extend the date, thereby, negating the auction process

and the right of the petitioner, being the auction

purchaser.    The learned Advocate for the petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                    17</span>

        ' There is always peril in treating the
        words of a speech or a judgment as
        though they were words in a legislative
        enactment, and it is to be remembered

AIR p. 688, para 19)

     '19. ... Each case depends on its own
     facts and a close similarity between
     one case and another is not enough
     because even a single significant detail
     may alter the entire aspect. In deciding
     such   cases,   one    should    avoid   the
     temptation to decide cases (as said by
     Cardozo) by matching the colour of one
     case against the colour of another. To
     decide, therefore, on which side of the
     line a case falls, the broad resemblance
     to another case is not at all decisive.'

      'Precedent should be followed only so
     far as it marks the path of justice, but

<p id="p_113">     16. The first judgment relied on is in the case of

MATHEW VARGHESE VS. M. AMRITHA KUMAR AND

OTHERS - (2014) 5 SCC 610, wherein the Hon'ble

Supreme Court at paragraphs 55, 62, 65 and 68, has

held thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">             55. Therefore, once the securitisation
     application     of   the    borrowers,   namely,
     Respondents 1 and 2 was dismissed on
     27.12.2007, even assuming that there was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                         45</span>


no impediment for the secured creditor,
namely, the fourth respondent Bank to
resort to sale under the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_29">SARFAESI Act</a>, as held by us in the earlier
paragraphs, there should have been a fresh
notice issued in accordance with Rules 8(6)
and 9(1) of the 2002 Rules. Unfortunately,
the fourth respondent Bank stated to have
effected   the   sale    on   28.12.2007     by
accepting the tender of the appellant and by
way   of   further   process,     directed   the
appellant to deposit the 25% of the amount
on that very day and also directed to
deposit the balance amount within 15 days,
which was deposited by the appellant on
11.1.2008. In fact, after the deposit of the
25% of the amount on 28.12.2007, the
fourth respondent Bank is stated to have
confirmed the sale in favour of the appellant
on 31.12.2007. After the deposit of the
balance    amount       on      11.1.2008    by
communication dated 2.2.2008, the fourth
respondent Bank informed the first and
second respondents about the confirmation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                               46</span>


of sale and thereby, provided no scope for
Respondents 1 and 2 to tender the dues of
the secured creditor, namely, the fourth
respondent Bank with all charges, expenses,
etc., as has been provided under <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_30">Section
13(8)</a> of the SARFAESI Act. Therefore, the
whole procedure followed by the fourth
respondent Bank in effecting the sale on
28.12.2007 and the ultimate confirmation of
the sale on 11.1.2008, stood vitiated as the
same    was    not      in      conformity      with    the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_31">SARFAESI Act</a> and the
Rules framed thereunder. Though, such a
detailed consideration of the legal issues
was not made by the Division Bench while
setting aside the sale effected in favour of
the    appellant,       having        regard     to     the
construction       of     the      provisions    of     the
SARFAESI      Act,      the     RDDB Act        and     the
relevant Rules, we are convinced that the
judgment      of    the      Division    Bench        dated
8.3.2010, passed in M. Amritha Kumar v.
</blockquote><p id="p_114">Union of India [Writ Appeal No. 1555 of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                             47</span>


perfectly justified and we do not find any
infirmity with the same.
</p><p id="p_115">       62. Before adverting to the details of
the order dated 18.6.2010 passed in IA
No.437 of 2010, at the very outset it will
have to be stated that having regard to the
specific direction contained in sub-paras (i)
and (ii) of Para 5 of the judgment dated
8.3.2010 in M. Amritha Kumar v. Union of
India [Writ        Appeal    No.    1555    of    2009,
decided on 8.3.2010 (Ker)], by 8.5.2010,
when Respondents 1 and 2 failed to hand
over the demand draft of Rs 2,00,00,000, as
directed     by    the   Division    Bench       to   the
appellant, the writ appeal stood dismissed
without any further reference to anyone,
even    to   the    Court.    In    fact,   since     the
application for extension, namely, IA No.
437 of 2010 came to be filed only on
10.6.2010, it should be held that there was
no right in Respondents 1 and 2 or for the
eighth respondent herein to seek for any
further indulgence before the Division Bench
for further extension of time. It is relevant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                        48</span>


to note that the two months period expired
on 8.5.2010. Thereafter, Respondents 1 and
2 took their own time to file the application
for extension, namely, after more than 30
days, by which time the writ appeal stood
dismissed and there was no right available
with Respondents 1 and 2 or with the eighth
respondent herein to seek for any relief for
claiming any right in favour of the eighth
respondent, much less for cancellation of
the sale already effected in favour of the
appellant herein.
</p><p id="p_116">     65. In the light of our conclusion that
the judgment passed in M. Amritha Kumar
v. Union of India [Writ Appeal No. 1555 of
2009, decided on 8.3.2010 (Ker)] dated
8.3.2010, was a self-contained one and due
to the failure      of the first   and   second
respondents   in     not    handing   over   the
demand draft for Rs 2,00,00,000 to the
appellant within the stipulated time-limit,
namely, on or before 8.6.2010, the sale
effected in favour of the appellant stood
confirmed. Inasmuch as we have found
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                          49</span>


there was absolutely no justifiable grounds
for the Division Bench to grant further time
in its order dated 18.6.2010, we are of the
view that it will be travesty of justice if the
earlier    judgment     dated     8.3.2010    [Writ
Appeal No. 1555of 2009, decided on 8-3-
2010 (Ker)] , which worked itself out on 8-
5-2010, is to be reversed for the flimsy
grounds raised by the first and second
respondents that they could not raise funds
in spite of two months&amp;#39; time granted
to them for paying a sum of Rs 2,00,00,000
in favour of the appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_117">      68. At the risk of repetition it will have
to be stated that the ownership right which
got crystallised in favour of the appellant as
on 9-5-2010, could not have been snatched
away by the Division Bench by passing the
present impugned orders dated 18-6-2010
and 8-7-2010. Whatever is stated by us
with reference to the right of ownership of
the   first   and    second     respondents   with
reliance      upon    <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_32">Article    300-A</a>   of    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                 50</span>


     Constitution would equally apply to the
     appellant     as   well    in   such    a   situation.
     Therefore, such a right which accrued in
     favour of the appellant ought not to have
     been interfered with by the Division Bench
     and   the     orders      passed   in   the   interim
     application filed at the instance of the first
     and second respondents, along with the
     eighth respondent herein are not justified.
     Therefore, while upholding the judgment of
     the Division Bench dated 8-3-2010 passed
     in M. Amritha Kumar v. Union of India [Writ
     Appeal No. 1555 of 2009, decided on 8-3-
     2010 (Ker)] , for the reasons stated herein,
     the orders dated 18-6-2010 and 8-7-2010
     passed in IAs Nos. 437 and 507 of 2010 are
     set aside."

<p id="p_118">Referring to the aforementioned paragraphs, the learned

Counsel for the petitioner would contend that the

extension of time that was granted by the DRT was

unsustainable and the DRT could not have exercised its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                              51</span>


discretion to extend time for the final payment to the

borrower.
</p>

<p id="p_119">     17.    It is to be noticed that the law that is laid

down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the facts

obtaining in the each of the cases.
</p>
<p id="p_120">     The facts in Mathew Verghese's case (Supra) were

that the first and the second respondents therein were

the guarantors in respect of a credit facility, granted by

the bank, the fourth respondent therein, in favour of a

company-JM. The guarantors had created an equitable

mortgage in favour of the said bank, by depositing the

title deeds pertaining to several items of properties.
</p>
<p id="p_121">When the transaction became a non performing asset,

(NPA, as it is popularly called by the bankers), the

fourth   respondent   bank   is   said   to   have   filed   an

application (OA 31/2002) for recovery of the money with

interest thereon. It is said to have also issued a notice

under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_33">Section 13(2)</a> of the SARFAESI Act on 11.8.2006.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                            52</span>


<p id="p_122">On 20.2.2007, the bank is said to have taken possession

of the mortgaged properties, invoking <a href="/doc/1870587/" id="a_34">Section 13(4)</a> of

the said Act, read along with Rules 8 and 9 of the SIE

Rules.    The guarantors are said to have filed a

securitisation application (SA 20/ 2007) before the DRT,

challenging the possession notice and sought an order of

restraint against the bank from evicting them.         On

14.8.2007, the bank had issued         a notice to the

guarantors and others, of their intention to sell the

property. The sale notice having been published in daily

newspapers, the appellant and another are said to have

submitted their tenders.      It is thereafter that the

guarantors had filed a writ petition before the High Court

challenging   the   proceedings    initiated   under   the

<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_35">SARFAESI Act</a>. The petition is said to have been

disposed of with a direction to the DRT to hear the

application of the guarantors as well as that of the bank,

referred to above. The court also granted liberty to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                             53</span>


parties to arrive at a settlement on certain conditions

that were imposed. The proposed sale was directed to

be deferred by six weeks. The settlement had not come

about even after expiry of six weeks from the date of

Order, passed by the High court. It transpires that the

application of the guarantors was dismissed by the DRT.
</p>
<p id="p_123">The very next day, the bank is said to have accepted the

tender of the appellant. In terms of the bid, the

appellant is said to have deposited 25% of the bid

amount and he was required to deposit the balance

amount within 15 days. The sale is said to have been

confirmed on 31.12.2007. The appellant is said to have

deposited    the   entire   sale   price   thereafter.   The

guarantors were then said to have been informed by the

bank of the confirmation of sale in favour of the

appellant.   The guarantors had filed a Review petition

before the High Court in the writ petition filed earlier.
</p>
<p id="p_124">The said Review petition was said to have been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                             54</span>


summarily dismissed. The guarantors then were said to

have filed another writ petition challenging the vires of

the 2002 Rules, on the ground that it violated their right

of redemption by denying them adequate opportunity

and time to repay the borrowed sum and the action of

the bank in having sold the property mortgaged,

surreptitiously, without informing them. That petition

was also said to have been dismissed as it was held that

the guarantors had an alternative remedy.        The bank

then transferred the property in favour of the appellant

under a duly registered certificate of sale.   In an appeal

filed before a Division Bench, against the order of the

learned Single Judge, the appeal was allowed, holding

that the sale was not conducted in a fair and proper

manner, that when the sale was initially postponed by

six weeks, the Bank ought to have re-notified the sale or

at least extended the time for receiving further tenders.
</p>
<p id="p_125">And that the guarantors were also informed belatedly of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                            55</span>


the confirmation of sale. The sale was set aside on the

condition that the guarantors deposit Rs.2 crore in

favour of the appellant, within a period of two months.
</p>
<p id="p_126">There was also a direction to the Sub-Registrar to

restore the title in favour of the guarantors. The

guarantors did not deposit the amount as required. They

had sought further extension of time which was granted

by the Division Bench. And ultimately at the instance of

the guarantors, on the money being deposited, the sale

was directed to be made in favour of one Koshi Phillip.
</p>
<p id="p_127">It is in the above background that the appellant was

before the Apex Court. After a detailed reference to the

relevant provisions of law, the Apex Court based upon

the facts of the case as narrated hereinabove was

pleased to hold, at paragraphs 27 to 35, which reads as

follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">            "27. Under <a href="/doc/172827467/" id="a_36">Section 13(1)</a>, it is provided
      that any security interest created in favour of
      the secured creditor may be enforced without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                          56</span>


the intervention of the Court and Tribunal by
such    creditor    in   accordance     with   the
provisions of this Act. The nonobstante clause
in the opening set of expressions contained in
<a href="/doc/172827467/" id="a_37">Section 13(1)</a>, as pointed out by Mr. Singh,
learned Senior Counsel for the borrowers, is
restricted to <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_38">Section 69</a> or <a href="/doc/933049/" id="a_39">Section 69A</a> of the
T.P. Act. Apart from noting the said statutory
impediment, to be noted in <a href="/doc/172827467/" id="a_40">Section 13(1)</a>, the
more important feature to be noted is that a
free hand is given to the secured creditor for
the purpose of enforcing any security interest
created in favour of secured creditor, without
the intervention of the Court or Tribunal. The
only other relevant aspect contained in the
said sub- section is that such enforcement
should be in accordance with the provisions of
this   Act.   A    reading    of   <a href="/doc/172827467/" id="a_41">Section   13(1)</a>,
therefore, is clear to the effect that while on
the one hand any secured creditor may be
entitled to enforce the secured asset created
in its favour on its own without resorting to
any court proceedings or approaching the
Tribunal, such enforcement should be in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                        57</span>


conformity with the other provisions of the
<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_42">SARFAESI Act</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      28.    Keeping     the   said   stipulation
contained in <a href="/doc/172827467/" id="a_43">Section 13(1)</a> in mind, it will
have to be examined as to what are the other
statutory requirements to be fulfilled when
enforcement of a right created in favour of
any secured creditor in respect of a security
interest is created. As we are concerned with
the   sale   of   property   mortgaged   by   the
borrowers, for the present we leave aside any
other form or mode of enforcement, except
the one relating to the equitable mortgage
created in favour of the Bank. For that
purpose, we find that sub-section (8) of
<a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_44">Section 13</a> would be relevant.</blockquote>
<p id="p_128">      29. A careful reading of sub- section
(8), therefore, has to be made to appreciate
the legal issue involved and the submissions
made by the respective counsel on the said
provision.
</p><p id="p_129">      29.1 A plain reading of sub- section (8)
would show that a borrower can tender to the
secured creditor the dues together with all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                        58</span>


costs, charges and expenses incurred by the
secured creditor at any time before the date
fixed for sale or transfer. In the event of such
tender once made as stipulated in the said
provision, the mandate is that the secured
asset should not be sold or transferred by the
secured creditor. It is further reinforced to
the effect that no further step should also be
taken by the secured creditor for transfer or
sale   of   the   secured   creditor   asset.   The
contingency stipulated in the event of the
tender being made by a debtor of the dues
inclusive of the costs, charges, etc., would be
that such tender being made before the date
fixed for sale or transfer, the secured creditor
should stop all further steps for effecting the
sale or transfer. That apart, no further step
should also be taken for transfer or sale.
</p><p id="p_130">       29.2 When we analyze in depth the
stipulations contained in the said sub- section
(8), we find that there is a valuable right
recognized and asserted in favour of the
borrower, who is the owner of the secured
asset and who is extended an opportunity to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                        59</span>


take all efforts to stop the sale or transfer till
the last minute before which the said sale or
transfer is to be effected. Having regard to
such a valuable right of a debtor having been
embedded in the said sub- section, it will
have to be stated in uncontroverted terms
that the said provision has been engrafted in
the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_45">SARFAESI Act</a> primarily with a view to
protect the rights of a borrower, inasmuch as,
such an ownership right is a Constitutional
Right protected under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_46">Article 300A</a> of the
Constitution, which mandates that no person
shall be deprived of his property save by
authority of law.
</p><p id="p_131">      29.3. Therefore, de hors, the extent of
borrowing made and whatever costs, charges
were incurred by the secured creditor in
respect of such borrowings, when it comes to
the question of realizing the dues by bringing
the   property entrusted     with   the   secured
creditor for sale to realize money advanced
without approaching any Court or Tribunal,
the secured creditor as a TRUSTEE cannot
deal with the said property in any manner it

      likes and can be disposed of only in the
      manner prescribed in the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_47">SARFAESI Act</a>.'


      It was further elucidated that the effect of the

procedure prescribed under the SIE Rules and the

significance of the same being complied with to the

letter, thus :

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">            " 31. Once the said legal position is

<p id="p_132">      rule (6) of Rule 8 again states that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                            61</span>


authorized     officer     should   serve     to    the
borrower a notice of 30 days for the sale of
the immovable secured assets. Reading sub-
rule (6) of Rule 8 and sub- rule (1) of Rule 9
together, the service of individual notice to
the borrower, specifying clear 30 days time
gap for effecting any sale of immovable
secured asset is a statutory mandate. It is
also stipulated that no sale should be effected
before the expiry of 30 days from the date on
which the public notice of sale is published in
the newspapers. Therefore, the requirement
under Rule 8(6) and Rule 9(1) contemplates a
clear   30    days    individual    notice    to    the
borrower and also a public notice by way of
publication   in     the   newspapers.       In    other
words, while the publication in newspaper
should provide for 30 days clear notice, since
Rule 9(1) also states that such notice of sale
is to be in accordance with proviso to sub-
rule (6) of Rule 8, 30 days clear notice to the
borrower should also be ensured as stipulated
under Rule 8(6) as well. Therefore, the use of
the expression 'or' in Rule 9(1) should be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                            62</span>


read as 'and' as that alone would be in
consonance     with    <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_50">Section      13(8)</a>    of    the
SARFAESI Act.
</p><p id="p_133">     32.The other prescriptions contained in
the proviso to sub-rule (6) of Rule 8 relates to
the details to be set out in the newspaper
publication,   one    of    which   should    be    in
'vernacular     language'        with       sufficient
circulation in the locality by setting out the
terms of the sale. While setting out the terms
of the sale, it should contain the description
of the immovable property to be sold, the
known encumbrances of the secured creditor,
the secured debt for which the property is to
be sold, the reserve price below which the
sale cannot be effected, the time and place of
public auction or the time after which sale by
any other mode would be completed, the
deposit of earnest money to be made and any
other details which the authorized officer
considers material for a purchaser to know in
order to judge the nature and value of the
property.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                       63</span>


<p id="p_134">     33. Such a detailed procedure while
resorting to a sale of an immovable secured
asset prescribed under Rules 8 and 9(1). In
our considered opinion, it has got a twin
objective to be achieved:
</p><p id="p_135">     33.1 In the first place, as already stated
by us, by virtue of the stipulation contained in
<a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_51">Section 13(8)</a> read along with Rules 8(6) and
9(1), the owner/borrower should have clear
notice of 30 days before the date and time
when the sale or transfer of the secured asset
would be made, as that alone would enable
the owner/borrower to take all efforts to
retain his or her ownership by tendering the
dues of the secured creditor before that date
and time.
</p><p id="p_136">     33.2 Secondly, when such a secured
asset of an immovable property is brought for
sale, the intending purchasers should know
the nature of the property, the extent of
liability pertaining to the said property, any
other encumbrances pertaining to the said
property, the minimum price below which one
cannot make a bid and the total liability of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                       64</span>


borrower to the secured creditor. Since, the
proviso to sub- rule (6) also mentions that
any other material aspect should also be
made known when effecting the publication, it
would only mean that the intending purchaser
should have entire details about the property
brought for sale in order to rule out any
possibility of the bidders later on to express
ignorance about the factors connected with
the asset in question.
</p><p id="p_137">     33.3 Be that as it may, the paramount
objective is to provide sufficient time and
opportunity to the borrower to take all efforts
to safeguard his right of ownership either by
tendering the dues to the creditor before the
date and time of the sale or transfer, or
ensure that the secured asset derives the
maximum price and no one is allowed to
exploit the vulnerable situation in which the
borrower is placed.
</p>

<p id="p_138">     34. At this juncture, it will also be
worthwhile to refer to Rules 8(1) to (3) and in
particular sub- rule (3), in order to note the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                           65</span>


responsibility of the secured creditor vis-à-vis
the secured asset taken possession of. Under
sub- rule (1) of Rule 8, the prescribed
manner in which the possession is to be taken
by issuing the notice in the format in which
such notice of possession is to be issued to
the borrower is stipulated. Under sub- rule
(2) of Rule 8 again, it is stated as to how the
secured creditor should publish the notice of
possession as prescribed under sub- rule (1)
to be made in two leading newspapers, one of
which should be in the vernacular language
having sufficient circulation in the locality and
also such publication should have been made
seven days prior to the intention of taking
possession. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 8 really casts
much more onerous responsibility on the
secured creditor once possession is actually
taken by its authorised officer. Under sub-
rule   (3)   of    Rule   8,   the    property taken
possession of by the secured creditor should
be kept in its custody or in the custody of a
person authorized or appointed by it and it is
stipulated        that    such       person   holding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                            66</span>


possession should take as much care of the
property in its custody as a owner of ordinary
prudence would under similar circumstances
take care of such property. The underlining
purport of such a requirement is to ensure
that under no circumstances, the rights of the
owner till such right is transferred in the
manner known to law is infringed. Merely
because the provisions of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_52">SARFAESI Act</a>
and the Rules enable the secured creditor to
take     possession    of    such   an   immovable
property belonging to the owner and also
empowers to deal with it by way of sale or
transfer for the purpose of realizing the
secured debt of the borrower, it does not
mean that such wide power can be exercised
arbitrarily   or    whimsically     to   the     utter
disadvantage of the borrower.
</p>

<p id="p_139">       35. Under sub- rule (4) of Rule 8, it is
further stipulated that the authorized officer
should     take    steps    for   preservation    and
protection of secured assets and insure them
if necessary till they are sold or otherwise
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                        67</span>


disposed of. Sub-rule (4), governs all secured
creditor assets, movable or immovable and a
further   responsibility    is   created   on    the
authorised   officer   to   take   steps   for   the
preservation and protection of secured assets
and for that purpose can even insure such
assets, until it is sold or otherwise disposed
of. Therefore, a reading of Rules 8 and 9, in
particular, sub- rule (1) to (4) and (6) of Rule
8 and sub- rule (1) of Rule 9 makes it clear
that simply because a secured interest in a
secured asset is created by the borrower in
favour of the secured creditor, the said asset
in the event of the same having become a
non-performing asset cannot be dealt with in
a light- hearted manner by way of sale or
transfer or disposed of in a casual manner or
by not adhering to the prescriptions contained
under the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_53">SARFAESI Act</a> and the abovesaid
Rules mentioned by us."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                             68</span>


<p id="p_140">Thus, the facts in the case on hand and the facts in

Mathew Verghese's case (Supra), are entirely different

and not applicable to the facts on hand.
</p>


<p id="p_141">     18. The second judgment that is relied on by the

petitioner is in the case of Sadashiv Prasad Singh Vs.

Harendar Singh and Others          - (2015)5 SCC 574.
</p>
<p id="p_142">He would seek to place reliance on paragraphs 17 and

22, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">           17.    The   learned   counsel   for   the
     auction-purchaser Sadashiv Prasad Singh, in
     the first instance vehemently contended,
     that in terms of the law declared by this
     Court, property purchased by a third party
     auction-purchaser, in compliance with a
     court order, cannot be interfered with on the
     basis of the success or failure of parties to a
     proceeding, if the auction-purchaser had
     bona fide purchased the property. In order
     to substantiate his aforesaid contention, the
     learned      counsel   representing    Sadashiv
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                         69</span>


Prasad     Singh    placed   emphatic      reliance,
firstly, on a judgment rendered by this Court
in Ashwin S. Mehta v. Custodian [Ashwin S.
</blockquote><p id="p_143"><a href="/doc/808484/" id="a_54">Mehta v. Custodian</a>, (2006) 2 SCC 385] .
Our attention was drawn to the following
observations recorded therein: (SCC p. 407,
para 70)
             "70. In that view of the matter,
     evidently, creation of any third-party
     interest is no longer in dispute nor the
     same is subject to any order of this
     Court. In any event, ordinarily, a bona
     fide purchaser for value in an auction-</p><pre id="pre_5">
     sale    is    treated   differently   than   a
     decree-holder           purchasing        such
</pre><p id="p_144">     properties. In the former event, even
     if such a decree is set aside, the
     interest of the bona fide purchaser in
     an auction-sale is saved. (See Nawab
     Zain-ul-Abdin Khan v. Mohd. Asghar
     Ali Khan [(1887-88) 15 IA 12] .) The
     said decision has been affirmed by this
     Court in <a href="/doc/146543905/" id="a_55">Gurjoginder Singh v. Jaswant
     Kaur</a> [(1994) 2 SCC 368] ."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                           70</span>



<p id="p_145">      22. Since it was nobody's case that
Sadashiv Prasad Sinha, the highest bidder
at the auction conducted on 28-8-2008, had
purchased the property in question at a
price lesser than the then prevailing market
price, there was no justification whatsoever
to set aside the auction-purchase made by
him on account of escalation of prices
thereafter. The High Court in ignoring the
vested right of the appellant in the property
in   question,    after   his   auction    bid    was
accepted and confirmed, subjected him to
grave injustice by depriving him to property
which he had genuinely and legitimately
purchased    at    a   public   auction.    In     our
considered view, not only did the Division
Bench of the High Court in the matter ignore
the sound, legal and clear principles laid
down by this Court in respect of a third-
party auction-purchaser, the High Court also
clearly   overlooked      the   equitable        rights
vested in the auction-purchaser during the
pendency of a lis. The High Court also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                     71</span>


       clearly     overlooked       the        equitable    rights
       vested      in    the   auction-purchaser             while
       disposing of the matter.
</p>


<p id="p_146">       19.       Before considering the contention of the

petitioner     with      reference        to     the     afore-extracted

paragraphs, it is necessary to consider the facts of

Sadashiv Prasad Singh's case (Supra) which were that, a

partnership       firm   consisting       of     three     partners    had

mortgaged certain properties to a bank to secure a loan.
</p>
<p id="p_147">There was default in repayment and hence the bank had

filed an application before the Debts Recovery Tribunal

for recovery. The application was allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_148">       A direction was issued for recovery. The bank had

initiated recovery proceedings on 28.11.2000. During

the pendency of the recovery proceedings, one of the

partners had died. Just prior to his death a property

belonging to him, which was mortgaged, was said to

have    been      attached     by    the       recovery     officer.   The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                           72</span>


deceased partner's brother filed an objection petition

before the recovery officer, to the effect that the

attached property did not belong to the judgment

debtors and that it had been purchased by him from his

deceased brother under an unregistered agreement of

sale. That objection was pursued for some time and

abandoned.   The   recovery    proceedings   were   kept

pending for a further period of two years. Eventually,

there was an order for sale of the property. At the

auction, the appellant before the Apex Court was the

highest bidder. Accordingly, the sale was ordered in

favour of the appellant. And physical possession was

also delivered.    Mutation proceedings having been

initiated by the purchaser, the mutation entries were

also effected in favour of the purchaser- appellant.   It

was thereafter that the brother of the deceased partner,

filed a petition before the High Court assailing the

auction sale. That petition having been dismissed, by a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                            73</span>


learned single judge, an appeal was said to have been

preferred on the principal contention that the original

loan was Rs.14.70 lakh, the bank had sought to recover

Rs.75.75 lakh. The property was sold for Rs.13.20 lakh.
</p>
<p id="p_149">And that the appellant was ready to pay Rs.39 lakh

before the court.   It transpired that the bank agreed to

receive Rs.45 lakh, if Rs.15 lakh was paid immediately

and Rs.30 lakh over a period of two years. However,

there was no settlement. Eventually, the appellate

bench held that the Recovery Officer had failed to

comply with Rule 11, sub-rule (2) of the Second

Schedule to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_56">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961, which is made

applicable to proceedings before the Recovery Officer,

and set aside the proceedings, including the sale of the

property.   The Apex Court held that in the absence of

fraud or collusion, the High Court could not have

interfered with the auction sale. It was held that the

High Court could not have, in order to work out equities
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                74</span>


between the parties, proceeded to set aside the auction

sale. The agreement of sale set up by the brother of the

deceased to file objections before the Recovery Officer

was held to be a sham document. Secondly, the

Recovery   Officer    had   not     committed   any   fault   in

permitting the sale, as the objections filed before him

were abandoned by the applicant. Further, there was a

remedy of appeal under Section 30 of the RDDB Act.
</p>
<p id="p_150">     Based on the facts as narrated above, the Apex

Court at paragraphs 23.5 and 23.6 concluded as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">           "23.5. All these facts cumulatively lead
     to the conclusion that after 26.10.2005,
     Harender Singh had lost all interest in the
     property in question and had therefore,
     remained     a   silent   spectator   to   various
     orders which came to be passed from time
     to time. He had, therefore, no equitable
     right in his favour to assail the auction-
     purchase made by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha on
     28.8.2008.</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                      75</span>


<p id="p_151">     23.6. Finally, the public auction under
reference was held on 28.8.2008. Thereafter
the same was confirmed on 22.09.2008.
Possession of the property was handed over
to the auction-purchaser Sadashiv Prasad
Sinha on 11.3.2009. The auction-purchaser
initiated mutation proceedings in respect of
the property in question. Harender Singh did
not raise any objections in the said mutation
proceedings. The said mutation proceedings
were also finalized in favour of Sadashiv
Prasad Sinha. Harender Singh approached
the High Court through CWJC No.16485 of
2009 only on 27.11.2009. We are of the
view that the challenged raised by Harender
Singh ought to have been rejected on the
grounds of delay and latches, especially
because third party rights had emerged in
the meantime. More so, because the auction
purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for
consideration,   having    purchased     the
property in furtherance of a duly publicized
public auction, interference by the High
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                  76</span>


        Court even on ground of equity was clearly
        uncalled for."
</p>


<p id="p_152">Thus, the case of Sadashiv Prasad Singh (Supra) is also

distinguishable with the facts of the case on hand and

the law laid down therein is not applicable to the instant

case.
</p>


<p id="p_153">        20. The third judgment that is relied on is in the

case      of     STANDARD        CHARTERED           BANK       VS.

power or liberty to decide a dispute in the manner

contrary to law as it is not a Constitutional Court. The

paragraphs 32 and 34, which read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                32. At this juncture, we may clarify

     subtle distinction between the compensation
     and damages as canvassed at the Bar as
     that is not needed in this case. The thrust of
     the   matter    is   whether    DRAT      has     the
     jurisdiction to grant any liberty and, more
     so, in a case when the borrower and the
     auction-purchaser       have    entered    into    a
     compromise. As has been stated earlier, the
     Bank was not a party to the compromise.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">           34. In this context, we may refer to a
     three-Judge Bench decision in <a href="/doc/875816/" id="a_57">Upper Doab

     1963 SC 217] wherein it has been held that
     when the tribunal has not been conferred
     with the jurisdiction to direct for refund, it
     cannot do so. The said principle has been
     followed in Union of India v. Orient Paper
     and Industries Ltd. [(2009) 16 SCC 286]."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_155">The afore-extracted judgment would be distinguishable

with the facts in the present case. The Hon'ble Supreme

Court was considering the jurisdiction of the DRT to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                              78</span>


direct refund of the amount which would amount to

abuse of the process.     In that context, it was observed

that the DRT did not have any inherent powers to give

such directions in the garb of securing the ends of

justice. The situation in the case on hand is not one of

that kind.    The DRT was well within its power to grant

extension of time to the borrower to make good the

entire amount in default.         Thus, the afore-extracted

judgment also is of no aid to the petitioner.
</p>


<p id="p_156">     21. The fourth judgment that is relied upon by the

learned Counsel for the petitioner is VEDICA PROCON

PRIVATE LTD. VS. BALLESHWAR GREENS PRIVATE

LTD AND OTHERS - AIR 2015 SC 3103, he has

placed reliance on paragraphs 31, 34 and 50, which are

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">              31. In the alternative, it is submitted
     on behalf of the appellant that in the
     absence of any plea and proof that sale was

vitiated    by       fraud,    the    inadequacy   of
consideration especially when none of the
stakeholders in the company liquidation
raised such an objection on 17.12.2013 can
never be a ground for recalling an order of
accepting the highest bid at the instance of
an unsuccessful bidder on a subsequent
date on the ground that on a subsequent
date such unsuccessful bidder is willing to
offer higher price. Approving such course of
action would denude the proceedings of a
court of law and the sales undertaken in the
course of judicial proceedings, of all element
of certainty and finality. Such uncertainty
would      be    a     disincentive     for   genuine
prospective purchasers. It adversely affects
the possibility of attracting best offers in
court sales and would be detrimental to the
public interest.</blockquote>


<p id="p_157">      34. In support of the submission that
a concluded sale in an auction by the court
cannot be reopened except on the ground of
fraud, learned counsel for the appellant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                       80</span>


relied   upon   a   judgment   of   this   Court
reported in Valji Khimji &amp; Company v.
Official Liquidator of Hindustan Nitro Product
(Gujarat) Limited &amp; Others, (2008) 9 SCC
</p><p id="p_158">299. It was a case where the properties of a
company in liquidation were put to sale in
an auction. In the said auction, the highest
bid was Rs.3.51 crores which was accepted
by the court and the sale was confirmed.
The court directed the auction purchaser to
pay the consideration in certain instalments.
Some two and a half months later, a third
party sent a letter to the official liquidator
offering a higher amount of Rs.3.75 crores.
Almost a year later, another party offered
an amount of Rs.5 crores. Subsequently,
both the parties approached the Company
Judge seeking a recall of the order of
confirmation of the sale. Such application
was allowed by the Company Court. The
auction purchaser unsuccessfully carried the
matter in an intra court appeal and finally
landed up in this Court. This Court allowed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                          81</span>


the appeal upholding the order confirming
the sale. This Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">       "11. It may be noted that the auction-
       sale was done after adequate publicity
       in well-known newspapers. Hence, if
       anyone wanted to make a bid in the
       auction he should have participated in
       the said auction and made his bid.
       Moreover, even after the auction the
       sale was confirmed by the High Court
       only on 30.7.2003, and any objection
       to the sale could have been filed prior
       to that date. However, in our opinion,
       entertaining objections after the sale is
       confirmed should not ordinarily be
       allowed,   except      on   very   limited
       grounds    like   fraud,    otherwise    no
       auction-sale will ever be complete."</blockquote>

<p id="p_159">       50. The first respondent submitted
that   the   order   dated    17.12.2013       only
accepted the highest bid but it did not
confirm the sale and, therefore, the Court is
at liberty to decline confirmation of the sale
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                             82</span>


in view of the subsequent developments. In
our opinion, the said submission is to be
rejected because there is no specific format
in which a sale conducted by the official
liquidator    is    to     be    confirmed   by   the
Company Court. The mere absence of the
expression "that the sale is confirmed" in
the   order        dated        17.12.2013   is   not
determinative of the question. The totality
of the circumstances, such as, the very
tenor of the order (Footnote 1 supra) that
none of the stake-holders of the Company in
liquidation ever objected to the offer of the
appellant herein on the ground that it is
inadequate consideration for the property;
the fact that the official liquidator himself
understood the order dated 17.12.2013 to
be an order not only accepting the highest
bid of the appellant herein but also as an
order confirming the sale in favour of the
appellant, as evidenced by his letter dated
19.12.2013, (the relevant portion of which
is already extracted earlier) and the fact
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                           83</span>


that the first instalment of the payment of
25% of the sale consideration was accepted
both   by   the    official    liquidator     and     the
Company       Court       without       raising       any
objection for the same and the fact that the
first respondent withdrew its earnest money
deposit     without    raising        any     objection
regarding adequacy of the price offered by
the appellant herein, in our view, clearly
indicate that the sale in favour of the
appellant was confirmed by the order dated
17.12.2013.       Assuming      for     the    sake    of
argument that there is no confirmation, in
the absence of any legally tenable ground
for not confirming the sale, it cannot be
declined to the appellant as it was observed
in   Navalkha      case       (supra)       that    "...no
subsequent higher offer can constitute a
valid ground for refusing confirmation of the
sale or offer already made"

<p id="p_160">         22. It is here again necessary to notice the facts

of the case in the afore-extracted judgment and the

facts were that, a company, O, was said to have been

ordered to be wound up by the company judge of the

High Court, by an order dated 6.3.1990. The Official

liquidator was said to have been appointed as the

liquidator    of   the   Company.    By   an   order   dated

26.3.2013, the official liquidator was directed to put the

freehold land of the company to auction for sale by

inviting tenders. An upset price of Rs.55 crore and

earnest money deposit of 10% was said to have been

fixed.     It appears several offers were received and after

inter-se bidding, the appellant, before the apex court,

was said to be the highest bidder, with an offer of 148

crore. Whereas the first respondent, was said to be the

second highest bidder. The High Court is said to have

accepted the highest bid. The Official Liquidator (OL) is

said to have confirmed the sale by a letter dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                            85</span>


19.12.2013. The appellant was called upon to deposit

the sale amount in two instalments comprising of 25%

and 75% by 16.2.2014 and 16.4.2014, respectively. The

same was said to have been complied with. The OL had

then called upon the appellant to take possession of the

property by a letter dated 16.4.2014. Though the

appellant   had   deposited     the   entire   amount   on

16.4.2014, it transpires that it had made an application

prior to the said date seeking extension of time to

deposit the 75% of the amount. The High Court is said

to have granted time to deposit the same by 31.7.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_161">However, the amount had been deposited earlier as

stated above, without availing of the extension granted.
</p>
<p id="p_162">The first respondent is said to have challenged the order

of the company judge granting extension, in an appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_163">The first respondent is said to have expressed its

willingness to raise its offer to Rs.160 crore, in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                            86</span>


appeal.   On 17.4.2014, possession of the property is

said to have been delivered to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_164">     The Division Bench permitted the first respondent

to move the company judge, seeking permission to

apply afresh for the bid. The parties were directed to

maintain status quo till such time. The said order was

passed on 17.4.2014. The Single Judge is said to have

recalled his earlier order directing sale and directed

refund of the amount paid by the appellant and ordered

a fresh auction to be held.       The appellant having

challenged the said order before a division bench, the

same is said to have been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_165">     The Apex Court held that the High Court was not

justified in recalling the order dated 17.12.2013. The

highest bid of the appellant was accepted by the

Company Court and all the stake holders of the company

in liquidation were heard before such an acceptance.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                            87</span>


<p id="p_166">None objected to it, including the first respondent, at

that stage on any ground whatsoever, such as, that

there was any fraud or irregularity in the sale nor was

there any objection from any one of them that the price

offered by the appellant was inadequate. The appeals

were dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_167">     The petitioner cannot place reliance on the afore-
</p>
<p id="p_168">extracted judgments on a plain reading of the facts in

those judgments. All of them are distinguishable on the

facts obtaining in each case.
</p>


<p id="p_169">     23.    The learned Counsel has further placed

reliance on the judgment in case of VALJI KHIMJI AND

COMPANY       VS.     OFFICIAL     LIQUIDATOR         OF

HINDUSTAN      AND     NITRO    PRODUCT    (GUJARAT)

LIMITED AND OTHERS - (2008) 9 SCC 299, wherein

the relevant paragraphs 30 and 31, read as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                         88</span>


<p id="p_170">       30. In the first case mentioned above
i.e. where the auction is not subject to
confirmation by any authority, the auction is
complete on the fall of the hammer, and
certain   rights    accrue     in    favour   of   the
auction-purchaser.      However,         where     the
auction     is      subject         to   subsequent
confirmation by some authority (under a
statute or terms of the auction) the auction
is not complete and no rights accrue until
the sale is confirmed by the said authority.
Once, however, the sale is confirmed by
that   authority,    certain    rights    accrue    in
favour of the auction-purchaser, and these
rights cannot be extinguished except in
exceptional cases such as fraud.
</p><p id="p_171">       31. In the present case, the auction
having been confirmed on 30-7-2003 by the
Court it cannot be set aside unless some
fraud or collusion has been proved. We are
satisfied that no fraud or collusion has been
established by anyone in this case.

<p id="p_172">      24.     The facts of the case before the Hon'ble

Supreme Court are again distinguishable on the facts of

the case on hand.         In the facts of auction before the

Hon'ble Supreme Court, there was no necessity of

confirmation by any Authority, the auction was complete

on the fall of the hammer.         In the instant case, the

confirmation of sale itself was stayed by the DRT. Thus,

there could have been no confirmation of sale in favour

of   the    auction   purchaser.     Ultimately,   what   was

challenged in the writ petition by the auction purchaser

was an order of extension granted by the DRT to the

borrower to make good the entire payment in default.
</p>
<p id="p_173">The aforementioned judgment is also not applicable to

the facts of this case.
</p>


<p id="p_174">      25.    One factor that would emerge from the law

declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the afore-
</p>
<p id="p_175">extracted cases is that while assessing the right of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                             90</span>


borrower, the totality of the circumstances should be

taken into consideration as the provisions of the Act or,

as it stood at the relevant point of time, leaned in favour

of protection of the borrower.    On the principle of the

totality of circumstances, the right of the        auction

purchaser vis-a-vis the right of the borrower will have

to be analysed.       In terms of the      facts narrated

hereinabove and the law declared by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court and analysis of the same, it becomes

unmistakably clear that unless the certificate of sale was

issued in favour of the petitioner or the sale had been

registered in favour of the auction purchaser, the right

to the auction purchaser is always inchoate.        If that

happens, the Tribunal will have no power, once the sale

is registered and the certificate of sale is issued in

favour of the petitioner-auction purchaser.
</p>


<p id="p_176">        26.   The learned Counsel for the petitioner has

filed   a memo placing on record the communications
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">                              91</span>


between the petitioner and the bank with regard to

acknowledgement of deposit of the entire amount.          On

this ground, he contends that since he is the highest

bidder and he has performed his part of the duty by

making good the entire bid amount, it would be a

deemed confirmation of sale in his favour.     He relies on

the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in case

of M/S. GAURAV ENTERPRISES, GWALIOR VS.
</p>
<p id="p_177">STATE reported in       AIR 2012 MP 35 and to the

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">        "12. This issue came up for consideration
     before a Division Bench of Madras High Court
     in a case reported in AIR 2008 MADRAS
     108, <a href="/doc/97834/" id="a_58">K. Chidambara Manickam v. Shakeena</a>.

<p id="p_178">     "(i) Whether the sale of the secured asset in
     public   auction   as   per   <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_59">section   13(4)</a>   of
     SARFAESI Act, which ended in issuance of a
     sale certificate as per Rule 9(7) of the
     Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                         92</span>


(in short "the Rules") is a complete and
absolute sale for the purpose of <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_60">SARFAESI Act</a>
or whether the sale would become final only
on the registration of the sale certificate?"
</p>
<p id="p_179">   This question is answered by Madras High
Court as under:--
</p><p id="p_180">"In our considered view, the borrowers should

have approached the secured creditor or the

authorised officer before the date fixed for

sale and not after the sale, as provided under

sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_61">section 13</a> of the SARFAESI

Act.   As   discussed    earlier,   only   if   the

borrowers approach the secured creditor or

the authorised officer before the date fixed

for sale or transfer and tender or pay all the

dues to the secured creditor, the section

creates a bar on the secured creditor or

authorised officer to proceed further with the

proposed sale or transfer. In this case,

admittedly, the date fixed for the sale was

19-12-2005.    But,   even   according     to   the

version of the borrowers, they approached
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                      93</span>


the secured creditor only on 2-1-2006. In

such circumstances, the contention of the

learned Counsel for the borrowers is without

any basis and contrary to the provisions

contained in sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_62">section 13</a> of

the Act."
</p>

<p id="p_181">     13. In the present case also, the stand

of respondents is that mere issuance of sale

certificate will not bestow any right in favour

of the auction-purchaser and unless actual

sale deed is executed, there is no "sale" in

the eyes of law and power of redemption can

be exercised by the bank. In the opinion of

this Court, this argument is liable to be

rejected. The language of <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_63">section 13(8)</a> of

SARFAESI Act is very clear which contains the

words "before the date fixed for sale or

transfer". The intention of the Legislature

appears to be the date fixed for sale and not

the actual sale. The Statute is accordingly

designed and worded. Thus before date fixed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                        94</span>


for sale, the borrower could have exercised

the same and <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_64">section 13(8)</a> permits the bank

to do the same. In other words <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_65">section 13(8)</a>

even prohibits the bank to transfer or sell the

secure assets before the date fixed for sale

and gives an opportunity to the borrower to

repay all dues, costs, charges and expenses

incurred by the bank. However, once sale

certificate is issued, the bank cannot invoke

<a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_66">section 13(8)</a> of SARFAESI Act and <a href="/doc/102524/" id="a_67">section 60</a>

of T.P. Act has no application. Accordingly,

the judgment cited by Shri Raju Sharma

in L.K. Trust (supra) has no application in the

fact situation of this case.
</p>

<p id="p_182">      15. Sub-Rules (4), (6) and (7) of Rule 9

of 2002 Rules are of no assistance to the

respondents. Reading these rules with <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_68">section

13(8)</a> of the SARFAESI Act shows that the

intention of law-makers is that till the date

fixed for sale and not after the sale if

borrower tenders all dues to the secured
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                           95</span>


creditor, the section prohibits the secured

creditor or authorised           officer to      proceed

further with proposed sale or transfer. In this

case, admittedly, the date fixed for sale was

26.7.2011. This is also admitted position

between the parties that no payment was

made before 6.8.2011.               Accordingly, the

action of the bank cannot be said to be in

consonance    with        <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_69">section     13(8)</a>      of    the

SARFAESI     Act.    After     the        date   of    sale

aforesaid, it was not open for the bank to

accept the amount from the borrower and

return the amount to the auction-purchaser.
</p>
<p id="p_183">This action runs contrary to the scheme of

the   <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_70">SARFAESI      Act</a>    and      the    Rules      made

thereunder. I also find force in the argument

of learned counsel for the petitioner that the

settlement arrived at between the borrower

and the bank will not bind the present

petitioner, who was not a party in the said

settlement. Thus, examining it from any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                  96</span>


     angle,    either      as    per   <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_71">section   13(8)</a>   of

     SARFAESI        Act    or    from    the    angle   of

     implementation of the settlement, the action

     of the bank cannot be upheld."
</p>


<p id="p_184">Relying   on   the    afore-extracted      paragraphs,    it   is

contended that the auction purchaser, who is not a party

for the settlement between the Bank and borrower, and

since he is declared to be the highest bidder, the Bank

cannot give an opportunity to the borrower to repay all

his dues. Once the sale certificate was issued, the Bank

cannot invoke <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_72">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act and grant further

time to the borrower. The aforementioned judgment is

also not applicable to the facts on hand as the law

declared therein is that once the sale certificate was

issued, the Bank or the Tribunal, cannot extend time or

give an opportunity to the borrower in exercise of

powers under <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_73">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                              97</span>


<p id="p_185">      27. On a perusal of the memo, it is clear that it is

only a communication and acknowledgment of payment

of the entire amount and not the certificate of sale.    All

that the Bank had issued in favour of the petitioner-
</p>
<p id="p_186">auction purchaser was a communication with regard to

the auction purchase amount being made good.          At no

point of time, the Bank had issued a sale certificate

favouring the petitioner.    It was not the Bank that had

extended time and gave an opportunity to the borrower,

but it was DRT, in terms of <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_74">Section 13(8)</a> of the Act,

which extended time. Hence, the judgment, relied on in

the case abovementioned, is wholly inapplicable to the

facts of the case on hand.
</p>


<p id="p_187">      28.    All the judgments relied and considered

above, would lead to the principle that if the sale

certificate is issued or registration of the sale is made in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                              98</span>


favour of auction purchaser, the Bank or the DRT cannot

extend the time or give an opportunity to the borrower

to make good the dues.      That is not the fact situation in

the present case.       Thus, the right of the auction

purchaser had not crystallized to the extent that it would

over power the right of the borrower in terms of the

provisions of law and its interpretation by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court and other High Courts. The right of the

auction    purchaser   is   always   a   nebulous   right   in

comparison to that of the borrower.
</p>


<p id="p_188">     29.    In the light of the provisions of the Act and

the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the

other High Courts, it is not possible to accept the

contentions advanced by the petitioner that his rights

were crystalised on the date of the public auction and on

payment of the entire money and that the DRT had no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                            99</span>


power to extend the time. In our considered view and in

terms the unamended <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_75">Section 13</a> of the Act, the right of

the borrower to make good the total due was available

till the issuance of a sale certificate   in favour of the

petitioner-auction purchaser and the DRT was well

within its power to extend time and give an opportunity

to the borrower to clear the dues.            This is the

unequivocal tenor of the law as laid down by the Hon'ble

Supreme    Court   interpreting   the   provisions   of   the

Statute.
</p>

<p id="p_189">     30. The learned Single Judge having analyzed all

the facts and considered the provisions of the Act and

the relevant law, has rightly passed the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_190">The contentions of the parties are well considered. We

do not find any ground to interfere with the well

considered order of the learned Single Judge which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                100</span>
