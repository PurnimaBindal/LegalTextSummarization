Present:    Mr. Gagandeep Singh, Advocate for the petitioner.

A.N. Jindal, J
</pre><p id="p_1">            The petitioner has invoked the provisions of <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India for setting aside the order dated 17.3.2012 (Annexure
P5) passed by the trial court.
</p><p id="p_2">            The purpose of re-examination is to remove the patent
ambiguity and explanation for some unexplained facts. But, here in this
case, no such proposition has arisen. The learned counsel for the petitioner
has submitted that DW-3 Jagir Singh in examination in chief has stated that
the defendant is in possession of the suit property but when he was cross
examined he stated that the plaintiff is in possession of the suit property,
therefore, it was necessary to re-examine the witness to clarify the fact.
Learned counsel has placed reliance upon the judgment delivered in case
<a href="/doc/1210867/" id="a_2">Subhash Chandra vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors</a>., 2002 (2) Criminal Court
Cases 597 wherein it was observed as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "18. The party who calls a witness has the right to re-examine
            him on all matters arising out of the cross examination for the
            purpose of reconciling any discrepancies that may exist
            between the evidence on the examination in chief and that
            which has been given in cross-examination; or for the purpose
            of removing or diminishing any suspicion that the cross
            examination may have cast on the evidence in chief; or to
            enable the witness to state the whole truth as to matters which
            have only been partially dealt with in cross examination."</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">            I do not subscribe to this view as if the witness supported the
defendant in the examination in chief but did not support in the cross
examination, then in such situation it would amount to          declaring the
witness hostile after the cross-examination is conducted. That is not the true
intent and spirit of the provision envisaged in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_3">Evidence Act</a> regarding
re-examination. The witness could make any statement in examination in
chief and could clarify the same in cross examination but the party
examining the witness cannot be permitted to re-examine the witness to
bring him back to his earlier statement.
</p><p id="p_4">            No grounds to interfere.
</p><p id="p_5">            Dismissed.
