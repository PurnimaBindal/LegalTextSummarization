    SUMMARY OF THE JUDGMENT:

          The MMRDA and Government agreed to give land in PADS
    of an area of 230 acres to the Developer Hiranandanis on an




                                                ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 20:07:16 :::
                                    9/72

                                               APPL-189-15&amp;128-15.doc

    agreement that they would construct housing for Middle Income




                                                                      
    Group (MIG) flats admeasuring 40 square meters and 80 square
    meters.




                                              
         The developer entered into agreement with six owners who
    owned this land, after it vested in MMRDA.




                                             
         The State Government granted exemption from <a href="/doc/1005850/" id="a_5">Urban Land
    Ceiling Act</a> on that condition and a further condition that they




                                    
    would do so within 10 years.
                       
         The Hiranandanis in flagrant violation of that condition
                      
    developed luxurious flats and sold them to the Societies in Sector
    IV-A and utilized, prima facie, the entire FSI made available to
    them through the TDR which was given for set-back and roads
       


    and other amenities.
    



         PIL was filed and this Court deprecated this act of the
    developer and directed the developer to construct 40 square





    meters and 80 square meters flats in remaining vacant land and
    clarified that it did not mean that developer should develop it on
    Sector IV-A.





         Taking advantage of this, Hiranandanis obtained approval of
    construction of four buildings of 40 square meters and 80 square
    meters on Sector IV-A.


         The Societies filed suit claiming conveyance inter alia on the




                                              ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 20:07:16 :::

    ground that entire consumable FSI was exhausted on Sector IV-A




                                                                         
    and injunction restraining them from further construction.




                                                 
          The developer claimed that until entire development on the
    entire land of 230 acres was completed, they would continue to
    use TDR to develop these four buildings relying on Section 7A of




                                                
    MOFA.


          The learned Single Judge granted injunction. This Court has




                                        
    confirmed the order of injunction. This Court has inter alia held
                          
    by relying on the ratio of the judgment delivered by the Apex
    Court in <a href="/doc/1774237/" id="a_6">Jayantilal Investments vs. Madhuvihar Coop. Housing
                         
    Society and Others1</a> that it is not permissible to further construct
    by relying on a clause in the agreement which permits the
    developer to construct for eternity and deny conveyance of land
       


    to the    Societies   after   they   have   consumed,         prima       facie,
    



    consumable FSI.


          The note below the performance lease or any clause in the





    agreement does not give a right to a developer to develop land
    for eternity by denying right of conveyance in favour of the
    Societies after registration by taking advantage of TDR which
    may become available to them as a result of change in





    Development Control Rules or other legislation.


          PIL order also does not give the developer any such right for
    construction on Sector IV-A.

    will have to be construed on the basis of facts of that particular
    case and it cannot be read as a statute as held by the settled law
    of precedent declared by the Apex Court.




                                              
            Prima facie, there are huge other vacant lands which are
    available to the developer to construct 40 square meters and 80




                                     
    square meters flats on the remaining land.
                         
            A developer cannot be allowed to take advantage of his own
                        
    wrong after committing breach of tripartite agreement with
    MMRDA and the Government and breach of the provisions of

    Brief facts and gist of arguments on behalf of the





    Appellants/developer and Respondents/Plaintiffs:
</p>

    and the other by the original Plaintiffs (Hereinafter referred

    to as the "Societies") challenging the judgment and order




                                                                    
    passed by the learned Single Judge, who was pleased to
    grant an order of injunction restraining Hiranandanis from




                                            
    carrying out any construction on Sector IV-A of the Powai
    Area Development Scheme (For Short "PADS").                            The




                                           
    Societies have filed their appeal challenging the stay granted
    by the learned Single Judge to his own order for a period of
    12 weeks. Their principal objection is that having observed




                                  
    that Hiranandanis and MMRDA had in collusion with each
                      
    other violated the provisions of the MOFA and the original
    condition imposed by the State Government, the learned
                     
    Single Judge ought not to have permitted Hiranandanis to
    carry on the construction on Sector IV-A for a period of three
    months.

<p id="p_3">    2.   The questions which fall for consideration before us are:
    (1) Whether this Court should interfere with the impugned
    order passed by the learned Single Judge while exercising the





    appellate powers under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent; (2)
    Whether prima facie case was made out by the Plaintiffs for
    grant of interim relief in their favour and whether the balance





    of convenience lies in favour of Hiranandanis or the Societies
    and (3) To what extent a developer can construct additional
    buildings in the light of the law laid down by the Supreme
    Court and this Court after taking into consideration the
    provisions of <a href="/doc/914339/" id="a_7">Section 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_8">7-A</a> and other relevant provisions

<p id="p_4">    3.   Plaintiffs are 8 Societies which were formed after




                                           
    buildings were constructed by Hiranandanis at Sector IV-A of
    the PADS.    According to the Plaintiffs, after the existing




                                          
    buildings    were     constructed,     potential             of        the
    development/Floor Space Index as disclosed by Hiranandanis
    was exhausted and a suit was filed for direction, directing




                                    
    Hiranandanis to execute conveyance/assignment of the suit
                        
    land in favour of the Societies and also seeking injunction
    restraining Hiranandanis from carrying out any further
                       
    construction on Sector IV-A.
</p>

<p id="p_5">    4.   Hiranandanis, on the other hand, have argued that they
       


    are entitled to construct four additional buildings on Sector
    



    IV-A because the development potential on the said land is
    not yet exhausted. Secondly, the members of the Societies
    were made aware that Hiranandanis would be entitled to use





    additional FSI through TDR if it was sanctioned by the
    Corporation and lay out was approved and the members of
    the Societies were informed that till the land is fully





    developed Hiranandanis were entitled to carry on the
    construction on Sector IV-A.

<p id="p_7">    6    Mr. Chinoy, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on




                                        
    behalf of the Hiranandanis has tried to distinguish all the
    judgments while dissecting them for the purpose of
    advancing his submissions.     He has strenuously urged




                                
    that, later on, three buildings of the Societies were
                     
    constructed on the basis of TDR and, therefore, Societies
    are estopped from now saying that Hiranandanis cannot
                    
    construct four new buildings on the basis of TDR or
    contending that development potential/Floor Space Index
       

    has been fully exhausted. It has also been vehemently
    



    urged that the Hiranandanis were constructing four
    buildings for the purpose of accommodating/providing
    housing to middle income group people and the area of





    the flat was 40 meters and 80 meters only, which was
    the main condition imposed by the Government and
    MMRDA on the Hiranandanis and, therefore, Societies





    should not seek an injunction restraining Hiranandanis
    from doing what they were expected and supposed to do
    in the first place.   This, in brief, is the gist of the
    controversy between the parties at the interim stage.

             ignored the settled principles of law regulating
       


             grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. As
             appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be
    



             an appeal on principle. Appellate court will not
             reassess the material      and seek to reach a
             conclusion different from the one reasonably
             possible on the material. The appellate court





             would normally not be justified in interfering with
             the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on
             the ground that if it had considered the matter at
             the trial stage it wold have come to a contrary
             conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised





             by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial
             manner the fact that the appellate court wold
             have taken a different view may not justify
             interference with the trial court's exercise of
             discretion.   After referring to these principles

<p id="p_34">    25. The moot question which falls for consideration before
    this Court is : whether the developer can construct these four
                     
    additional buildings on Sector IV-A though they were not
    shown in the layout plan of 12/3/2004 by utilizing additional
    FSI under various Regulations such as DCR 33, DCR 35(4)
       


    etc. or whether Societies are entitled to get fungible FSI
    



    under the relevant provisions of DCR and consequently
    whether the Plaintiffs/Societies are entitled to seek direction
    to the developers to convey/assign the properties in Sector





    IV-A to them?
</p>

<p id="p_35">    26. According to the Plaintiffs, changes made to the layout





    of 2004 by the developers by the purported layout plan of
    2012 were without the knowledge and consent of the Co-
    operative Housing Societies and their members and the said
    changes were done behind their back.

    11/developers and MMRDA were brought to the notice of this
    Court. It was pointed out in the said PIL that the developers




                                             
    were supposed to construct the flats on the entire 230 acres
    for middle income housing group, the area of which was to
    be 40 square meters and 80 square meters.                  However, in




                                   
    gross violation of the said condition, it was alleged that the
                       
    developers had amalgamated the two Flats and constructed
    buildings which were far above the agreed area of 40 square
                      
    meters and 80 square meters and flats were falling under
    luxurious flats segment. The PIL court deprecated acts of the
    developers and MMRDA and directed the developers to
       


    construct flats admeasuring 40 square meters and 80 square
    



    meters only on the remaining vacant land. An application for
    clarification of the said order was filed by the Plaintiffs and it
    was clarified by PIL Court that they had not stated in their





    order that these flats should be constructed on Sector IV-A.

<p id="p_38">    28. It is the case of the Plaintiffs herein that taking





    advantage of the said order passed in PIL and under the
    pretext of compliance of orders of this Court in the said PIL,
    developers misrepresented to the authorities that they are
    bound to carryout such construction on certain part of the

              retarding the growth of construction of
              buildings and increasing the housing stock.

              building rules or building bye-laws for the

              impediment in construction of the additional
              buildings. While approving any proposals for
              construction of additional buildings in the

    obtained by the developer thereafter for construction of
    



    building in question with 6 wings.          The layout was again
    amended on 26/11/1994 after the co-operative society of flat
    purchasers was registered on 20/1/1993. This plan was duly





    sanctioned. This was done on account of additional TDR by

    dated 29/3/2001.     Trial Court partly decreed the suit,




                                           
    permitting the promoter to complete the construction as per
    amended plan dated 29/3/2001 and further period of three




                                          
    years was given to the promoter for executing conveyance in
    favour of the Society. Society filed an appeal in the Bombay
    High Court being aggrieved by the grant of three years time




                                 
    to the promoter to execute the conveyance. Promoter also
                       
    filed a cross appeal in the Bombay High Court.
    contended that under the agreement between the promoter
                                                                     It was
                      
    and the flat takers, no time limit for execution of the
    conveyance could be set as the promoter was entitled to
    exploit full potential of the plot in question and as long as
       


    this was not done, he was not statutorily obliged to execute
    



    conveyance in view of provisions of Section 7A of the MOFA.
    Bombay High Court allowed the appeal of the Society and
    dismissed the appeal filed by the developer. The High Court





    held that the scheme stood completed with the construction
    of the flats/shops and the garden and under Rule 8 of the
    said Rules, the promoter/appellant was obliged to convey





    the title to the Society. The High Court held that there was
    an implied trust created and the promoter was the trustee
    and that the beneficiaries were the flat purchasers and the
    promoter could not make additions in the structure of the
    building without prior consent of the Society.          It held that

         of unamended Section 7 of MOFA. Consequently, it
         was held that a promoter was not entitled to put up
         additional structures not shown in the original lay out
         plan without the consent of the flat takers. Thus,

     However, the right to make any construction of




                                                                 
     additional structures/ buildings would come into
     existence only on the approval of the plan by the
     competent authority. That, unless and until, such a




                                         
     plan stood approved, the promoter does not get any
     right to make additional construction. This position is
     clear when one reads the amended <a href="/doc/914339/" id="a_57">Section 7(1)(ii)</a>
     with Section 7-A of the MOFA as amended. Therefore,




                                        
     having regard to the Statement of Objects and
     Reasons for substitution of <a href="/doc/914339/" id="a_58">Section 7(1)(ii)</a> by the
     <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_59">Amendment Act</a> 36/86, it is clear that the object was to
     make legal position clear that even prior to the
     amendment of 1986, it was never intended that the




                               
     original provision of Section 7(1)(ii) of MOFA would
     operate even in respect of construction of additional
                   
     buildings. In other words, the object of enacting Act
     No. 36/86 was to change the basis of the judgment of
     the Bombay High Court in Kalpita Enclave case. By
                  
     insertion of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_60">Section 7-A</a> vide Maharashtra Amendment
     Act 36/86 the legislature had made it clear that the
     consent of flat takers was never the criteria applicable
     to construction of additional buildings by the
      

     promoters. The object behind the said amendment
     was to give maximum weightage to the exploitation of
   



     development rights which existed in the land. Thus,
     the intention behind the amendment was to remove
     the impediment in construction of the additional
     buildings, if the total lay out allows construction of





     more buildings, subject to compliance of the building
     rules or building bye-laws or Development Control
     Regulations. At the same time, the legislature had
     retained <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_61">Section 3</a> which imposes statutory obligations
     on the promoter to make full and true disclosure of
     particulars mentioned in <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_62">Section 3(2)</a> including the





     nature, extent and description of common areas and
     facilities. As stated above, Sub-section (1A) to <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_63">Section
     4</a> was also introduced by the legislature by
     Maharashtra Act 36/86 under which the promoter is
     bound to enter into agreements with the flat takers in
     the prescribed form. Under the prescribed form, every
     promoter is required to declare the FSI available in
     respect of the said land. The promoter is also required

     particulars of such utilization to the flat takers.

</p>       


<p id="p_78">    42. From the above observations, it can be seen that the
    



    Apex Court has not construed the amendment in <a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_73">Section 7(1)</a>
    and insertion of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_74">Section 7-A</a> in isolation but has interpreted it





    in the light of other relevant provisions viz Sections 3 and 4
    of MOFA and Clauses 3 and 4 of Form V of the said Rules and
    the obligation of the developer of registration of Society and





    conveying the title.      In a nutshell, therefore, though object
    behind    the    said   amendment        was     to     give        maximum
    weightage to the exploitation of development rights which
    existed in the land by construction of additional buildings

    same time this could be done only after full and true
    disclosure of particulars mentioned in <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_75">Section 3(2)</a> is made




                                            
    incorporating the same as provided under sub-section (1-A)
    to <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_76">Section 4</a> in the agreements with the flat purchasers,




                                           
    which has to be harmoniously read with Section 10 of the
    MOFA which cast obligation on the promoter to form a Co-
    operative Housing Society of the flat takers and under




                                  
    <a href="/doc/1519126/" id="a_77">Section 11</a> complete his title and convey the title to the

    is clear that the developer cannot claim that he can
       


    continuously exploit the building potential for eternity
    



    without conveying the land in favour of the Society.                   The
    obligation to convey the land in favour of the Society within a
    prescribed time and the obligation to make true and full





    disclosure under Clauses      3 and 4 of Form V remains
    unfettered.   If the full development potential of the land is
    exhausted and the obligation for conveyance of land in





    favour of the Society has arisen as per the Act and Rules and
    if the developer fails to do so then any further benefit which
    would accrue to the developer on account of any additional
    TDR or FSI made available, cannot be used by him for the
    purpose of construction of additional buildings. For example,

    that the FSI which would be available in the City of Greater
    Mumbai would be increased by 0.6.                 The benefit of this

    conveyed the property in favour of the Society though he




                                                  
    was under legal obligation to do so, having fully developed

    Clauses 3 and 4 of Form V of the said Rules. He, therefore,
                         
    cannot having failed in his obligation to convey the property
    within the time prescribed thereafter claim that full building
                        
    potential has not been utilized and claim right to construct
    further buildings.

<p id="p_80">    44. In our view, from the facts and circumstances of the
    



    present   case,      it   can   be      seen      that        though           the
    developer/promoter had fully utilized the full FSI/potential of
    the land and was under an obligation to convey the property





    after construction of the 10th building on Sector IV-A, he is
    now trying to construct four other buildings by claiming
    additional TDR and trying to load it on the four additional

    Investments (supra) is the only judgment on the point

    and will be binding on this Court for that purpose. In our
    view, it is not necessary to minutely scrutinize the ratio
    of the judgments which have been shown to us by Mr.



                                   
    Aspi Chinoy the learned Senior Counsel appearing on
                       
    behalf of the developer, though we can observe that the
    facts in most of these cases are different and, therefore,
                      
    even otherwise the ratio of these judgments will not
    apply to the facts of this case.       The contention of the
       


    developer that he is entitled to carry on the construction
    



    till the entire land i.e. the land not only in Sector IV-A but
    in all Sectors 1 to 13 is developed, is not correct.
    Neither the tripartite agreement nor the lease agreement





    executed between the land owners and developer                            nor
    the individual agreement between the developer and the
    flat purchasers can be construed in this manner as it





    would render the statutory provisions of MOFA nugatory.
    Even if such contractual conditions are mentioned in the
    contract,    statutory    obligation    would         override            the
    contractual clauses in the agreement.             Reliance on the

    section 32(1) of the BMRDA Act.          The Government of

    a period of 80 years and should be executed in favour of the
    licensees i.e. the landholders or their nominees. All the six
    landholders entered into agreement with Hiranandanis for
       


    the development of the entire land which was sub-divided
    



    into Sectors 1 to 13. Hiranandanis, thereafter, entered into
    separate agreements with flat purchasers. Out of 80 years,
    26 years have already elapsed till the Plaintiffs/Societies filed





    a suit seeking conveyance/assignment of the land in favour

<p id="p_89">    50. From the aforesaid clauses of the tripartite agreement
    and the individual agreement and the note which has been
    appended to the draft form of lease which was annexed to





    the tripartite agreement, it was contended that till the entire
    land     in   the   PADS    was     fully   developed              by       the
    promoter/developer, the question of conveyance/assignment
    of the property by lease in favour of the Societies did not
    arise.

<p id="p_91">    51. In our view, the said submission is fallacious and
    without any substance. A clause in the agreement between




                                           
    the flat purchasers and the developer cannot be construed to
    mean that the developer can continue to develop the land for
    eternity and on the basis of some clause in the agreement




                                  
    refuse to convey the property which is contrary to the
                      
    provisions of <a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_81">Section 7</a> read with <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_82">Section 7-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_83">Sections 3</a>
    and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_84">4</a> of the said Act and Rules 3 and 4 of Form V of the said
                     
    Rules. As observed in Jayantilal Investments (supra), all these
    provisions have to be construed harmoniously. The clauses
    in the agreement cannot be construed in such a way as to
       


    make the obligations cast on the developer under <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_85">Sections 3</a>
    



    and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_86">4</a> and Rules 3 and 4 and Rule 8 and 9 of Form V
    redundant. If these clauses are read in such a manner, the
    purpose of the Act would be defeated. The provisions of the





    Act and Rules seek to strike a balance between the right of
    the developer to develop the property to its full potential
    and, at the same time, protect the rights of the flat





    purchasers (i) to ensure that there is no alteration in the
    building and (ii) within a prescribed period title of the
    property is conveyed in favour of the Society. In the present
    case, the developer is trying to interpret clauses in the flat
    purchasers' agreement and the note annexed to the lease

    in getting the land conveyed in their favour.                            If the

    promoter/developer is accepted then till the entire 230 acres
    of land is not constructed/developed, the flat purchasers




                                                 
    would not get the land conveyed in their favour.                       A lease
    was to be executed for a period of 80 years out of which 26
    years have already been over. There is a large part of the




                                     
    vacant land in all the 13 Sectors. The promoter will continue
                         
    to develop the said property and refuse to convey the land in
    favour of the Societies.

<p id="p_92">    52. From the layout charts which have been shown to use, it
    can be seen that prima facie the Plaintiffs have made out a
       


    case   that the entire consumable FSI has already been
    



    consumed after 10th building was constructed. The additional
    FSI and TDR which was utilized for construction of last two
    buildings was made available to the developer from the road





    set back area and other amenities which were provided and
    out of that these 10 buildings have been constructed. Prima
    facie, promoter/developer has not been in a position to show





    that the buildings were constructed out of additional TDR
    such as Slum TDR or TDR which is purchased by the
    developer.       The development potential therefore, prima
    facie, in our view, has been fully consumed after the 10 th
    building was constructed and, therefore, even otherwise,

    been cited by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on
    behalf     of   the    developer.         All   those      judgments             are
    distinguishable on facts.             Much emphasis was laid on the




                                           
    Division Bench Judgment of this Court                           in    <a href="/doc/190426138/" id="a_87">Manratna
                            
    Developers, Mumbai vs. Meghratan Co-operative Housing
    Society Ltd</a>.1 It was contended that the Supreme Court had
                           
    not set aside the order passed by the Division Bench when it
    remitted the matter back to the Trial Court for deciding the
    Notice of Motion. This submission was vehemently opposed
       


    by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
    



    Plaintiffs. Reliance was placed on the observation made by
    the Division Bench more particularly on the observations that
    after the amendment of Section 7 MOFA and introduction of





    <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_88">Section 7-A</a>, consent of flat holders in building is not
    necessary in respect of construction in the scheme, after

    the building bye-laws or Development Control Rules.

<p id="p_94">          In our view, there cannot be any dispute regarding the

    have to be harmoniously construed with the other provisions
    with reference to facts and circumstances of each case. We




                                            
    are of the view, therefore, that nothing much turns on the

    Developers (supra) and these observations are not of much

<p id="p_95">    54. Mr. Chinoy, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on
                              
    behalf of the developer also strenuously urged that the
    judgment delivered by Gavai, J. in Malad Kokil Co-operative
                             
    Housing Society Ltd. &amp; Anr1 did not lay down the correct law.
    The same submission was made in respect of the judgment
    delivered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in <a href="/doc/166504654/" id="a_89">Megh
       


    Ratan Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. vs. Rushabh Rikhav
    



    Enterprises2</a>. We are really not inclined to dissect these
    judgments to say whether they lay            down the correct
    proposition of law, as we have noted hereinabove that the





    Apex Court in Jayantilal Investments (supra) has considered
    the various provisions of MOFA and has laid down the law
    and the ratio of the Apex Court judgment, therefore, is





    binding.

    the observation is made that a perusal of the agreement
    itself would show that the plaintiffs were aware that the plot




                                                   
    had to be developed in a phased manner and the plaintiffs
    could take an objection only when there was a change in the
    plans of their buildings and it was further observed that




                                       
    Plaintiffs could not insist that the Society must be registered
                             
    because as per the agreement the Society shall be registered
    only after the full development of the land had been
                            
    completed. In our view, these observations have been made
    in the context of the facts of the said case and, therefore,
    the observations made by the learned Single Judge in the
       


    said    case      cannot     be   of      any      assistance           to      the
    



    promoter/developer in this case.

<p id="p_97">    55. We are, therefore, not inclined to interfere with the





    order passed by the learned Single Judge and we concur with
    the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the prima

    interim relief.

    observations made by Gavai, J. in two judgments are per




                                                                      
    incuriam since they are contrary to the observations made
    by the Supreme Court.       On the basis of the observations




                                              
    made in these judgments, he has contended that as long as
    the plot of Sector IV-A is not fully developed, Hiranandanis




                                             
    are     not      under      obligation      to          make              any
    conveyance/assignment in favour of the Societites till such
    time the TDR can be loaded on the other buildings which




                                   
    could be constructed on Sector IV-A, if permission was
                       
    granted by the Planning and Local Authority. It is contended
    that the plans having been sanctioned, it is not open now for
                      
    the flat purchasers of other buildings to take an objection to
    the development of the remaining plot.
</p>       


<p id="p_124">    58. On the other hand, Mr. Rohit Kapadia, the learned
    



    Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Societies submitted
    that the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Jayantilal's case
    lays down the law and, therefore, the        entire FSI on Sector





    IV-A having been consumed, it was not open for the
    developer to further carry on the construction on the plot by
    loading TDR.

<p id="p_125">    59. In our view, it is quite well settled that ultimately ratio of

    held that if the building plans are to be altered or changes
    are made after the agreements were executed with the flat
    purchasers, their consent was necessary. The said judgment,
       


    essentially, was given in a case where there was one building
    



    constructed by the developer. There were several schemes
    where developer had planned to construct buildings on one





    lay out and very often the flat purchasers in one building
    were not entitled to raise an objection about construction of
    another building in the layout. In order to resolve the said
    anomaly which was arisen because of the judgment in





    Kalpita's case, <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_109">Section 7-A</a> was inserted.
</p>

<p id="p_140">    63. In view of addition of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_110">Section 7A</a> obligation which was
    cast on the developer to give true and proper disclosure
    continued in the form of <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_111">Section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_112">4</a> continued.

</p><p id="p_142">    64. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_113">Section 7-A</a> was therefore inserted to reconcile the

</p>



                                           
<p id="p_143">    The principal idea appears to be that the flat purchaser
    should not be deprived of the rights which were promised to




                                          
    him when he purchased the flat not only in respect of the
    plan which was shown to him in respect of the existing
    building but also the other amenities could not be reduced or




                                 
    taken away by obtaining permission from the Planning
                      
    Authority or Local Authority and, at the same time, right of
    the developer to construct the additional buildings which was
                     
    permissible under the law and after true and proper
    disclosure was made by him to the flat purchaser is also
    protected.   These conflicting interests therefore have been
       


    reconciled by <a href="/doc/1951219/" id="a_114">Section 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_115">Section 7A</a>. What was noticed
    



    by the legislature was that the developer, after construction
    of the building and formation of the Societies continue to
    carry on the construction unabatedly and did not convey the





    property in time and, therefore, restriction was put on him by
    the MOFA to convey the property as per terms of the contract
    or within four months or the competent authority could direct





    deemed conveyance to be made in respect of the said
    property under <a href="/doc/1519126/" id="a_116">section 11</a> of the said Act.     The developer in
    most of the cases was found to impose heavy maintenance
    charges on the members and would also continue with the
    development of the plot without proper and true disclosure

    and, therefore, the said restriction was imposed. The Apex




                                                                    
    Court, therefore, in the case of Jayantilal has observed that
    provisions of completion of conveyance/assignment by the




                                            
    developer and the provisions for construction of additional
    buildings as provided under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_117">Section 7A</a> have to be construed




                                           
    harmoniously.

<p id="p_145">    65.
                         
            In the present case, developer on the pretext that he
    has right not to convey till the plot is fully developed by
                        
    relying on note to the proforma lease agreement is trying to
    postpone      the   conveyance/assignment      to     eternity         and
    continue to exploit the land despite exploitation of FSI which
       


    was available to him on the land and, therefore, the learned
    



    Single Judge, in our view, has rightly come to the conclusion
    that prima facie case had been made out by the Societies





    and the point of hardship was also in their favour.                     We

            how the plaintiffs were dispossessed?
            We pin-pointed this question and heard
            the submission.         We refrain from
            discussing the evidence and recording




                                          
            our conclusions because evidence is still
            to be led and the contentions          and
            disputes have to be examined in depth
            and any expression of opinion by this

            party in having a fair trial and
                      
            uninhibited decision. Having given the
            matter our anxious consideration, we are
            satisfied that this is not a case in which
                     
            interim injunction could be refused.
            Similarly we are of the opinion that if
            respondents are allowed to put up
            construction by the use of the F.S.I. for
       


            the whole of the land including the land
            involved in dispute, the situation may
    



            become irreversible by the time the
            dispute is decided and would preclude
            fair and just decision of the matter. If on





            the contrary injunction is granted as
            prayed for the respondents are not likely
            to be inconvenienced because they are
            in possession of about 9000 sq. metres
            of land on which they can put up
