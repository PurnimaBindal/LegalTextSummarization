                                            Crl. Revision No. 413/2017

</pre><p id="p_2">2.    The brief background relevant for the disposal of the revision
      petition is that the above mentioned FIR was registered against
      the revisionist and his relatives on the basis of the complaint
      dated 17.07.2007 lodged by the complainant Smt. Sonia Gupta.
      The revisionist herein is the husband of the complainant. After
      the completion of investigation, chargesheet was filed against
      the revisionist and ten of his relatives on 16.09.2009. Vide order
      dated 07.12.2009, only the revisionist was summoned by the trial
      court.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.    Though the revisionist was discharged of the offence under
      <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_6">Section 406</a> IPC but prima facie sufficient material was found
      for framing charge for the offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_7">Section 498A</a> IPC
      against him by the trial court. Aggrieved with the said order on
      charge, the revisionist has approached this court. 
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.    The order has been assailed by the counsel for revisionist by
      contending that the trial court has failed to appreciate that the
      complaint had been lodged by the complainant as a counter blast
      to the divorce petition instituted by the revisionist on
      02.05.2007 so as to pressurize him to withdraw the same and
      that the complainant has failed to provide any medical record in

      support of her allegations of physical abuse at the hands of the
      revisionist on 04.04.2007. He argued that the trial court also
      erred in observing that the allegations in the complaint are
      sufficient to attract <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_8">Section 498A</a> IPC and failed to appreciate
      that the alleged demand of money by the revisionist from the
      complainant and her brothers after the marriage for the purpose
      of business or to meet the financial stringency can not be said to
      be demand of dowry. In support of his contention, the counsel
      for the revisionist placed reliance on <a href="/doc/861530/" id="a_9">Dhula Ram v. State of
      Rajasthan</a>, 1995 Crl. L.J 4057 and <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_10">Appasaheb v. State of
      Maharashtra</a>, 2007 AIR (SC) 763. Based on the above
      submissions, he urged that the impugned order be set aside and
      the revisionist be discharged of the offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_11">Section 498A</a>
      IPC. 
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.    On the other hand, Ld. APP for State submitted that there is no
      infirmity or illegality in the impugned order and therefore, no
      interference is called for.  
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.    The contention of the counsel for the revisionist that the alleged
      demand of money by the revisionist from the complainant and
      her brothers after the marriage for the purpose of business can

      not be said to be demand of dowry so as to attract <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_12">Section 498A</a>
      IPC is misconceived. In both the judgments i.e. <a href="/doc/861530/" id="a_13">Dhula Ram v.
      State of Rajasthan</a>, 1995 Crl. L.J 4057 and <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_14">Appasaheb v. State
      of Maharashtra</a>, 2007 AIR (SC) 763 relied upon by the counsel
      for the revisionist, the Hon'ble Courts were dealing with the
      appeals against conviction under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_15">Section 304B</a> IPC and after
      referring to the definition of 'dowry ' as provided under <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_16">Section
      2</a> of Dowry Prohibition Act, it had been held that a demand for
      money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting
      some urgent domestic expense can not be termed as demand for
      dowry and that in order to fall within the ambit of term 'dowry',
      the demand of money must have some co­relation with the
      marriage of the parties. While under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_17">Section 304B</a> IPC, which
      prescribes punishment for dowry death, the cruelty or
      harassment of the woman is for, or in connection with, any
      demand for 'dowry', <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_18">Section 498A</a> is of wider amplitude and
      encompasses all sorts of cruelties or harassments caused to the
      woman to meet any unlawful demand for property or valuable
      security irrespective of whether the same is in connection with
      marriage or otherwise. For the sake of convenience, <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_19">Section
      498A</a> IPC, which prescribes punishment for subjecting a women
      to cruelty by her husband or relatives of husband, is reproduced

       as under:­ 
       498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her
       to cruelty:­ Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the
       husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished
       with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall
       also be liable to fine, 

       Explanation:­ For the purpose of this section, "cruelty" means­
</p><p id="p_7">(a)    any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the
       woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb
       or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
</p><p id="p_8">(b)    harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to
       coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for
       any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any

       person related to her to meet such demand. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">       Hence, the judgments relied upon by the counsel for the
       revisionist are not applicable to the facts of the present case and
       do not render any assistance to him. 
</p>

<p id="p_10">7      At this juncture, it would be important to refer to the guidelines
       laid down by the Superior Courts to be kept in mind at the stage
       of framing of charge. <a href="/doc/1360078/" id="a_20">In Union of India v. Prafulla Kumar
       Samal</a>, AIR 1979 SC 366, the Hon'ble Apex Court laid down
       the following principles:

                                              Crl. Revision No. 413/2017

</pre><p id="p_11">    (i)   That the Judge while considering the question of framing the
          charges under <a href="/doc/470297/" id="a_21">Section 227</a> of the Code has the undoubted
          power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of 
          finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the
          accused has been made out;
</p><p id="p_12">    (ii) Where the materials placed before the Court disclose grave
         suspicion against the accused which has not been properly
         explained the Court will be fully justified in framing a charge
         and proceeding with the trial;
</p><p id="p_13">    (iii) The test to determine a prima facie case would naturally
          depend upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to lay
          down a rule of universal application. By and large however if
          two views are equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that
          the evidence produced before him while giving rise to some
          suspicion but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will
          be fully within his right to discharge the accused; and 
</p><p id="p_14">    (iv) That in exercising his jurisdiction under Section 227 of the
         Code the Judge which under the present Code is a senior and
         experienced Court can not act merely as a Post­Office or a
         mouth­piece of the prosecution, but has to consider the broad
         probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and
         the documents produced before the Court, any basic infirmities
         appearing in the case and so on. This however does not mean
         that the Judge should make a roving enquiry into the pros and
          cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was
          conducting a trial.

<p id="p_15">8         Upon testing the First Information Report, statements recorded
          under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_22">Section 161</a> CrPC and other material on record on the

                                           Crl. Revision No. 413/2017

      touchstone of the above principles, there can be no doubt that there
      exist the grounds to presume that the revisionist has committed an
      offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_23">Section 498A</a> Indian Penal Code. At this stage, the
      case of the prosecution can not be thrown out by disbelieving the
      averments or the allegations in the complaint        lodged by the
      complainant Smt. Sonia Gupta merely because the revisionist had
      filed the divorce petition against her prior to the lodging of the
      complaint. From a bare reading of the FIR, it is seen that there are
      clear and specific accusations against the revisionist in as much as
      the complainant has alleged that since the date of marriage on
      16.05.1991, the revisionist alongwith his family members started
      harassing her, physically as well as mentally, for demand of dowry;
      that the revisionist and his relatives were under the impression that
      her brothers were financially affluent and therefore, they used to
      pressurise her to bring money from her brothers as financial help for
      their business; that whenever she used to refuse to bring the money,
      the revisionist and his family members used to give beatings to her;
      that on 09.11.2003, she came to know from the family members of
      the revisionist that he was having illicit relations with some other
      woman; that compelled by the behaviour of the revisionist, father
      and brothers of the complainant provided financial assistance to the
      revisionist on various occasions; that on 04.04.2007, when the


Narender Kumar Gupta  v. State                          Page No.  7/ 8    
                                               Crl. Revision No. 413/2017

      complainant returned home after attending a function at her parental
      home, the revisionist gave beatings to her with a leather belt
      resulting in blue injury marks on her body; that on 10.04.2007, the
      revisionist contacted the father of the complainant and made
      demand of money; that on 25.04.2007, when the complainant gave a
      call to the revisionist and requested him to take her back to the
      matrimonial home, he refused by stating that she would not be
      allowed to return until and unless she brought the money; that on
      30.04.2007, when the complainant alongwith the children came to
      the matrimonial home on her own, the revisionist did not allow her
      to enter the house and called the police. In view of the above
      specific allegations, the trial court rightly formed the opinion that
      prima facie case was made out for framing charge for the
      commission of offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_24">Section 498A</a> IPC against the
      revisionist.    
</p><p id="p_16">9     For the forgoing reasons, I find no infirmity or illegality in the
      order dated 05.08.2017 passed by the Ld. MM. The revision petition
      is without merits and is accordingly dismissed.
