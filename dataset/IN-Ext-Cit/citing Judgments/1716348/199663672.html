persons opened attack on the complainant Madan Singh and his nephew

Amrik Chand while they were taking meal. The above said persons were

accompanied by some other persons. They entered the house of Madan

Singh. While Bashir Ram raised lalkara to teach them a lesson, Raj Pal and

others opened attack, which resulted in injuries to Madan Lal and Amrik

Chand.

             In the appeal preferred by the three convicts, learned counsel

representing them did not challenge the judgment of their conviction and

had requested for taking lenient view in the matter of sentence. Vide

judgment dated 13.12.2011, learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hoshiarpur

had upheld the conviction of all the three convicts and had set aside the

order on quantum of sentence and ordered release of the convicts on

probation on their furnishing personal bonds in a sum of Rs.20,000/- each

to the satisfaction of learned trial court subject to certain conditions.

</p><p id="p_7">             I have heard Mr. Arun Takhi, learned counsel for the petitioner,

Mr. K.D. Sachdeva, learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab for

respondent-State and Mr. J.B.S. Gill, learned counsel for respondents no.2

to 4 at length and have gone through the record carefully.

</p><p id="p_8">             Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the

judgment setting aside the order on sentence and releasing respondents no.2

to 4 on probation is bad. According to him, it violates the mandatory

provisions of <a href="/doc/937408/" id="a_17">section 4(2)</a> of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 under

which calling of report of Probation Officer before extending the relief of

probation of good conduct is a must. He has placed reliance on a decision

of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/1716348/" id="a_18">M.C.D. v. State of Delhi and another</a>

2005(3) RCR (Criminal) 13 where it is laid down as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "20. We have already reproduced <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_19">section 4</a> of the Probation of
       Offenders Act. It applied to all kinds of offenders whether
       under or above 21 years of age. This section is intended to
       attempt possible reformation of an offender instead of
                        Crl. Revision No.885 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>

      inflicting on him the normal punishment of his crime. The
      only limitation imposed by <a href="/doc/1054973/" id="a_20">section 6</a> is that in the first
      instance an offender under twenty one years of age, will not
      be sentenced to imprisonment. While extending benefit of
      this case, the discretion of the court has to be exercised
      having regard to the circumstances in which the crime was
      committed, the age, character and antecedents of the offender.
      Such exercise of discretion needs a sense of responsibility.
      The offender can only be released on probation of good
      conduct under this section when the court forms an opinion,
      having considered the circumstances of the case, the nature of
      the offence and the character of the offender, that in a
      particular case, the offender should be released on probation
      of good conduct. The section itself is clear that before
      applying the section, the Magistrate should carefully take into
      consideration the attendant circumstances. The second
      respondent is a previous convict as per the records placed
      before us. Such a previous convict cannot be released in view
      of <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_21">section 4</a> of the Probation of Offenders Act. The court is
      bound to call for a report as per <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_22">section 4</a> of the Probation of
      Offenders Act but the High Court has failed to do so although
      the Court is not bound by the report of the Probationer Officer
      but it must call for such a report before the case comes to its
      conclusion. The word "shall" in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_23">Section 4</a> is
      mandatory and the consideration of the report of the
      Probationer Officer is a condition precedent to the release of
      the accused as reported in the case of <a href="/doc/1926789/" id="a_24">State v. Naguesh G.
      Shet Govenkar and another</a>, AIR 1970 Goa 49 and a release
      without such a report would , therefore, be illegal."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Learned counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that

learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hoshiarpur has taken into account some

fact which is not available on the record. According to him, there was no
                         Crl. Revision No.885 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>



compromise between the parties and learned Additional Sessions

Judge,Hoshiarpur has been wrong in considering the fact of compromise

between the parties for extending the benefit of the <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_25">Probation of Offenders

Act</a>.</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">             Learned State counsel, on the other hand, has submitted that

calling of the report of the Probation Officer is not mandatory for extending

the benefit of the <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_26">Probation of Offenders Act</a>. According to him, the words

"shall take into consideration the report, if any," mentioned in <a href="/doc/937408/" id="a_27">section 4(2)</a>

of the Probation of Offenders Act clearly show that calling of report is

discretionary on the part of the court.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             Learned counsel for respondents no.2 to 4 has also reiterated

the submissions of learned State counsel regarding the nature of the

requirement of the report of Probation Officer. He has added that

respondents no. 2 to 4 have been facing trial for the last 14 years. According

to him, to Bashir Ram only a lalkara is attributed. He has further submitted

that there had been a compromise between the parties but the court did not

accept the same because the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_28">section 452</a> IPC

could not be compounded.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             As per the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case cited

above, the court is bound to call for a report as per <a href="/doc/14315/" id="a_29">section 4</a> of the

Probation of Offenders Act. It has also been held that even though the

court is not bound by the report of Probation Officer, yet it is obliged to call

for such a report before the case comes to its conclusion.
</p><p id="p_13">                         Crl. Revision No.885 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>



              In the reported case, the material before the court clearly

revealed that the offender had previous conviction to his discredit and

oblivious of this fact, without calling for a report of Probation Officer, the

benefit of probation was extended.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_30">Section 360</a> Cr.P.C. deals with the circumstances, in which a

convict could be released on probation of good conduct or even after

admonition.    <a href="/doc/1559838/" id="a_31">Section 361</a> Cr.P.C. which requires special reasons to be

recorded in the judgment if a case is not dealt with under the provisions of

<a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_32">section 360</a> Cr.P.C. is in the following terms:-
</p>
<p id="p_15">   "<a href="/doc/1559838/" id="a_33">Section 361</a> Cr.P.C.:- Special reasons to be recorded in certain cases:-
   Where in any case the court could have dealt with-
</p><p id="p_16">   (a) an accused person under <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_34">section 360</a> or under the provisions of the
   <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_35">Probation of Offenders Act</a>, 1958 (20 of 1958) or

   but has not done so, it shall record in its judgment the special reasons
   for not having done so."
</p><p id="p_18">              Class (a) of <a href="/doc/1559838/" id="a_36">section 361</a> Cr.P.C. as mentioned above clearly

shows that accused can be dealt with either under <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_37">section 360</a> Cr.P.C. or

under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_38">Probation of Offenders Act</a>,, 1958. The choice

is with   the court to deal with a case under the above mentioned

provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_19">              Nothing is apparent from the judgment of learned Additional

Sessions Judge, Hoshiarpur that the benefit of          probation has been

extended to respondents no.2 to 4 under the provisions of the Probation of
                         Crl. Revision No.885 of 2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>

<a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_39">Offenders Act</a>, 1958.      When it is not mentioned that the benefit is

extended under the provisions of the Act ibid, there would be no reason to

say that the benefit has not been extended under the provisions of <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_40">section

360</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_20">              The language employed in <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_41">section 360</a> Cr.P.C. shows that

stress is upon making an attempt at reforming a convict. To make it

obligatory on the part of the court to deal with a case under <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_42">section 360</a>

Cr.P.C, it has been clearly mentioned in <a href="/doc/1559838/" id="a_43">section 361</a> Cr.P.C. that if a case

is not dealt with <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_44">section 360</a> Cr.P.C., the court has to record special

reasons for not doing so in its judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_21">              Learned counsel for the petitioner could not show any

previous conviction on the part of respondents no.2 to 4. He could not

also bring to the notice of the court any other depravity in their character,

which may show them to be of incorrigible nature, which is required for

declining the benefit of probation to these convicts.              In these

circumstances, I find no infirmity, much less illegality in the approach of

learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hoshiarpur in the impugned order

granting benefit of probation to respondents no.2 to 4. Consequently the

revision petition is dismissed.
