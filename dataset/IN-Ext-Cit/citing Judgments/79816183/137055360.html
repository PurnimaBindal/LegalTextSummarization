                               Judgment &amp; Order

(Sanjay Karol, C.J.)


</pre><p id="p_5">              On 15.4.2012 Smt. Rupashree Debnath, aged 16 years

died as a result of multiple organ failure arising out of burn

injuries (80%). In relation to the said crime, her husband Jhutan

Das stands convicted for having committed an offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_1">Section 304B</a> of the Indian Penal Code (for short, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>).

Independently and additionally, Jhutan Das and his parents Sukha

Ranjan Das and Sabita Das stand convicted for having committed

an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_3">Section 498A</a> of IPC.


</p><p id="p_6">2.            Judgment of conviction and sentence dated 27.8.2015

is subject matter of challenge in these appeals on the following

grounds urged before us :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              (a)      There is unexplained and inordinate delay of 18
              hours in lodging the FIR;

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (b)      no independent witness from the neighbourhood
              was either associated or examined in Court;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              (c)      trial   stands       vitiated   on    account    of   non-

              testimonies of family members of the deceased, being
              interested witnesses, required corroboration, in any
              event there testimonies are full of improvements and
              embellishments rendering them to be unbelievable and
              the witnesses unreliable;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  Page 3 of 27</span>




<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             e)    prognosis of the burn injury caused by use of
             Kerosene oil is not supported by the father of the
             deceased or other evidence, scientific nature.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             (f)   additionally, on behalf of the accused parents, it is
             argued that there is no iota of evidence of their
             complicity in the crime.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_7">3.           Certain facts are not in dispute:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">             (a)   Marriage between accused Jhutan Das and Smt.
             Rupashree Debnath was solemnized sometime in the
             year 2010;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             (b)    on 15.4.2012 the wife died as a result of burn
             injuries; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">             (c)    the   incident     took     place   within   7   years   of
             marriage, in the matrimonial house, where the parties
             i.e. the husband and the wife, had been residing
             together till her last.</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">             Also from the record, unrefutedly, it stands revealed

that at the time of marriage, age of the deceased was 16 years

and that of her husband (accused) 18 years.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">4.           Through the testimonies of 18 witnesses, prosecution

wants the Court to believe that after eloping the deceased,

accused solemnized his marriage with her. With initial reservation,

parents of the deceased accepted such relationship and then all

was well. From the wedlock, a female child was also born.

However, just six months prior to the incident, all the accused

persons started subjecting the deceased to ill-treatment by raising

a    dowry   demand       of   Rs.40,000/-,      which    was    never   met.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                Page 4 of 27</span>




Continuously she was subjected to cruelties and eventually on

15.4.2012, they set her on fire by pouring Kerosene oil. On

16.4.2012 at 14:25 hours, Uttam Kr. Debnath, father of the

deceased, lodged an FIR which was investigated by police officials

Sri   Tapas    Deb   (PW-14)      and   Sri   Arunodaya    Das   (PW-17).

Investigation    revealed   the    accused     to   have   murdered   the

deceased for non-fulfillment of dowry demand. As such, challan

was presented in the Court for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">5.            The accused were charged for having committed

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Sections 498A</a>, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">304B</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">Section

34</a> of IPC. Alternative charge under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">Section

34</a> of IPC was also framed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">6.            We notice that the trial Court has not returned any

findings with respect to the alternate charge. We also notice that

the trial Court has found only the husband to have committed an

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_9">Section 304B</a> of IPC. It is a matter of

record that neither the complainant nor the State has preferred

any appeal assailing the findings or the judgment rendered by the

trial Court. It is only the convicts who have preferred these

appeals. Crl.A. No.21/2015 stands preferred by Sri Sukha Ranjan

Das and Smt. Sabita Das and Crl.A(J) No.45/2015 stands

preferred by Sri Jhutan Das.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">7.            It has come in the testimony of Sri Arunodaya Das

(PW-17) that on 15.4.2012 at about 11.10 p.m., the Duty Officer

of Melaghar Police Station received information on telephone that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               Page 5 of 27</span>




the deceased had committed suicide by setting herself on fire, in

relation to which an entry was made. He reached the spot for

verifying such information and found the deceased lying on the

floor of house of accused Jhutan Das. The injured had sustained

serious burn injuries and arranged her to be taken to the Melaghar

Sub-Divisional Hospital where the doctor declared her dead. The

following day, i.e. on 16.4.2012, pursuant to the request made to

the SDM, Sonamura, surathal report (Inquest Report)(Exhibit-2/3)

was prepared in the presence of the Executive Magistrate and

other witnesses. Postmortem was got conducted and viscera of

the deceased collected. On completion of formalities, body was

handed over to the father namely Sri Uttam Debnath who, on

16.4.2012 itself lodged a formal complaint of dowry death and as

such, request was made to the concerned Superintendent of Police

for making appropriate arrangements of investigation. Pursuant to

certain   directions, he   continued    with the investigation and

recorded statements of the father and one Sri Subhash Debnath

(PW-2), uncle of the deceased. From the place of occurrence of

the incident, he seized one blue coloured plastic drum having

smell of Kerosene oil and burnt orange coloured cloth (parda) vide

memo (Exhibit-3/2), in the presence of independent witnesses.

Since accused Jhutan Das had also sustained burn injuries, he was

also got medically treated.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">8.          From the testimony of Sri Tapas Deb (PW-14) it is

clear that further investigation was carried out by him. He
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               Page 6 of 27</span>




recorded statements of the witnesses; collected the postmortem

report and presented the challan in the Court for trial.


</p><p id="p_20">9.         From the conjoint reading of the cross-examination

part of testimonies of these two witnesses, two things emerge; (a)

informant Uttam Kr. Debnath did not furnish any explanation for

the delay in lodging the FIR and (b)Balaram Paul who furnished

information about the incident to the father of the deceased was

not examined by him.
</p>
<p id="p_21">           Since much emphasis is laid on such fact, we deem it

appropriate to deal with this issue here itself.



</p><p id="p_22">10.        Prosecution case does not rest on the testimony of said

Balaram Paul. Before we deal with the testimonies, let us examine

the contents of the complaint lodged by the father (PW.1). In the

complaint, he alleges that on 09.02.2012 one Balaram Paul

telephonically informed him that the accused husband was beating

the deceased. Immediately, he rushed to the spot and noticed

injuries on the body of his daughter, inflicted by her husband.

Resultantly, when he sought intervention of the parents (other co-

accused), they reiterated dowry demand of Rs.40,000/-. As a part

of such conspiracy, on 15.4.2012, all the accused persons killed

the deceased by strangulating and setting her on fire after pouring

Kerosene oil.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">11.         The reference of Balaram Paul is only with regard to

the alleged incident which took place on 09.02.2012, and not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              Page 7 of 27</span>




15.4.2012. We are of the view that by mere non-association of

Balaram Paul during investigation or non-examination in Court,

the genesis of the prosecution story cannot be said to have been

falsified, the edifice to fall for if through the testimonies of other

witnesses, guilt stands proven and established beyond reasonable

doubt, it would be sufficient to uphold the conviction of the

accused. Balaram Paul is a witness only to a single act of assault

which in any event stands established by other credible evidence.


</p><p id="p_25">12.         In any event, trial cannot be said to be vitiated only

on account of faulty, incorrect or incomplete investigation, if

otherwise this Court is convinced of the prosecution case.


</p><p id="p_26">13.        Mere error, illegality or defect in investigation cannot

be a ground to doubt the prosecution story. In fact, Court is duty

bound to examine as to whether such fact would result into

miscarriage of justice or not. Equally, the accused would be under

an obligation to prima facie show as to what prejudice, serious in

nature, stands caused to him. [See : <a href="/doc/113267195/" id="a_10">Yogesh Singh v. Mahabeer

Singh &amp; Ors</a>.,(2017) 11 SCC 195 (2 Judge Bench); <a href="/doc/1438332/" id="a_11">C Muniappan

and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, (2010) 9 SCC 567 (2 Judge

Bench) &amp; Abu Thakir and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR (2010)

SCC 2119 (2 Judge Bench)].
</p>
<p id="p_27">           It is also not the requirement of law that in every case

witnesses from the neighborhood must be examined by the police

or by the prosecution in the Court, more so in dowry related

cases.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              Page 8 of 27</span><p id="p_28">




</p><p id="p_29">14.        We do notice that the factum of dowry demand and

dowry death was first brought to the notice of the police only on

16.4.2012. There has been a delay of more than 18 hours.

However, we find the explanation, plausible and acceptable in

nature, emerging in the unrebutted testimony of PW-1 who does

state that "I was not in a position even to talk with any person. I

lost my mental balance to report anything to the police over the

entire episode." We notice that initially the father was silent in

explaining the delay, but then can it be said that such fact would

be fatal to the prosecution case or that it is a case of an

afterthought after due deliberation, with the purported object of

false implication of the accused. To our mind, not so. For we find

that the incident took place in a remote corner of the State.

Parties are residing not in an urban but rural area. Also it took

time for the police to reach the spot for carrying out spot

investigation. The inquest also was prepared the following day,

when itself, the complaint was lodged. Noticeably, accused do not

question the role of the police, to be partisan or allege false

implication. Hence, the question of delay pales into insignificance,

more so when we notice that the accused husband had also

sustained burn injuries, which remain unexplained on record and

that the unfortunate incident took place in the matrimonial house.


</p><p id="p_30">15.         Delay in lodging the FIR often results in embellishment

</p><p id="p_31">- creature of an afterthought. It loses its spontaneity. Danger of

often exaggerated story creeps in but then this alone is not the

settled principle of law. In every case the trial court is duty bound
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 Page 9 of 27</span>




to examine, as to whether the delay is colourded by an

afterthought or not. Prompt lodging of the FIR only helps ruling

out the possibility of introduction of a new or a distorted fact. Also

it lends assurance regarding the truth of the informants‟ versions.

However, delay per se cannot be said to be fatal in all cases. In

fact, Courts are duty bound to exhibit sensitivity in the cases of

dowry death where victim‟s closest relation are in a state of woe

and shock, but then appreciating such fact would also depend

upon the attending circumstances and the explanation furnished

during trial. Also, mental condition of the close relative needs to

be kept in mind. [See: Jitender Kumar v. State of Tripura, (2012) 6

SCC 204 (2 Judge Bench); <a href="/doc/160727992/" id="a_12">Manoj Kumar Sharma and ors. v. State of

whole of the body stood burnt. The cause of death is burn injuries

Debnath (PW-1) it has come on record that all the accused were

not residing together. The parents(co-accused) were residing

separately, though in close vicinity. It is in this backdrop, we are

of the considered view that at least the husband was obliged to

furnish plausible explanation about the manner in which his wife

sustained such burn injuries. Also how he sustained burn injuries

on his hands. It is not his suggested case to the Investigating

Officer/Court that the deceased set herself on fire by pouring

Kerosene oil. It is nobody‟s case that otherwise deceased was

temperamental in nature and/or suffering from some depression

under all circumstances and in any event that is to say, somehow

other reason which the witness may be harbouring against the

SCC 73 (2 Judge Bench), the Apex Court clarified that in a

criminal trial, the degree of proof is stricter than what is required

in civil proceedings. Further, in a criminal trial however intriguing

the facts and circumstances of the case may be, the charges made

against the accused must be proved beyond all reasonable doubts

and the requirement of proof cannot lie in the realm of surmises

and conjectures. Thus requirement of proof beyond reasonable

doubt does not stand altered even after introduction of<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_41"> S. 498A</a>,

conscience must be satisfied that the accused is not held guilty

when there are reasonable doubts about his complicity in the

crime. Further it must be borne in mind that there is no absolute

standard for proof in a criminal trial and the question whether

charges made against the accused stand proved beyond all

reasonable doubts must depend upon the facts and circumstances

of the case and the quality of the evidences adduced in the case

and the materials placed on record. It observed that the doubt

must be of a reasonable man and the standard adopted must be a

standard adopted by a reasonable and just man for coming to a

conclusion    considering    the   particular   subject   matter.    The

conscience of the court can never be bound by any rule but that is

coming itself dictates the consciousness and prudent exercise of

the judgment. Reasonable doubt is simply that degree of doubt

which would permit a reasonable and just man to come to a

conclusion. Reasonableness of the doubt must be commensurate

with the nature of the offence to be investigated. Exaggerated

devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt must not nurture fanciful

doubts or lingering suspicions and thereby destroy social defence.

Justice cannot be made sterile on the plea that it is better to let

hundred guilty escape than punish an innocent. Letting guilty

escape is not doing justice, according to law."

<p id="p_66">34.       Applying the aforesaid principles let us discuss the

evidence of the relevant witnesses. Prosecution case primarily

rests upon the testimonies of relatives of the deceased namely, Sri

Uttam Kumar Debnath(PW-1), Sri Subhash Debnath (PW-2), Smt.

Shipra Debnath (PW-4), Smt. Jayanti Deb (Das) (PW-5), Sri

Prasenjit Debnath (PW-7), Sri Narayan Debnath (PW-9) and Smt.

<p id="p_67">

</p><p id="p_68">35.       PW-1 states that two years prior to the incident,

accused „enticed away‟ the deceased and solemnized his marriage,

whereafter parties started residing together and gave birth to a

female child. Further, six months prior to the incident (which

means sometime in January, 2012 for the incident took place on

the 15th July, 2012) accused Jhutan Das started pressurizing the

deceased and all the accused subjected her to ill-treatment by

raising a demand of Rs.40,000/-. Acts of ill-treatment were

brought to his notice by the deceased but due to financial

constraints, he could not fulfill such demands. On many occasions,

she was brutally assaulted. „One day‟ at about 9.30 p.m., one

Balaram Paul informed that the deceased was being physically

assaulted by her husband and in-laws. Ensuring that her cries are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                            Page 20 of 27</span>




not heard by anyone, accused had loudly played a musical

instrument. Upon receipt of such information, he immediately

reached the spot and saw his daughter lying on the floor in a

"precarious condition". There were injuries on her body. At that

time, only accused Jhutan Das was in the house. Immediately he

brought the matter to the notice of co-accused Sukha Ranjan Das

and Sabita Das who were residing separately at a distance of 200

metres. However, Sukha Ranjan Das not only reiterated the dowry

demand but threatened of aggravating the mental torture. Also he

proposed transfer of ownership of 3 kanis of land having rubber

plantation. On 15.7.2012, this witness spoke with the deceased on

phone. Later at about 10.30-10.35 p.m. hearing cries from the

matrimonial house of his daughter, he ran and on reaching found

the deceased lying dead inside the room. Accused Jhutan Das who

had sustained burn injuries on his right hand was sitting outside

the bedroom and the other co-accused were there in the

courtyard.   When   queried,   Jhutan      Das   maintained   silence,

pretending as though he was in a state of shock over his wife‟s

death. Noticing the mosquito net covering the bed and finding

other articles, including the bicycle to be intact and only one

curtain of the door to be slightly burnt, he gathered an impression

that after murdering the deceased, accused had set her on fire. In

the meantime, friends and relatives assembled and someone

informed the police. The deceased was taken to the hospital where

she was declared dead. It was in the hospital that he lodged a

of marriage.

<p id="p_69">
</p><p id="p_70">36.        From the cross-examination part of his testimony, we

do not find the veracity of his statement or his credit to be

impeached in any manner. Fully inspiring in confidence, it is free

from embellishments, impeachments and contradictions. Non-

examination of neighbours would not render his testimony, in any

manner, to be doubtful. It does not require corroboration at all. It

is true that he does not remember the date and time when his

daughter was beaten up, but then he clarifies by stating that "I

am not in a position at this stage to say" so. One cannot be

oblivious of the fact that such statement was recorded after a

period of two years in Court. Be that as it may, assuming

hypothetically that the incident in relation to which Balaram Paul

apprised the accused remains unproven, however from the other

part of his testimony, to our mind, the factum of dowry demand

remains fully established about which there is no doubt. There is a

demand; of a specific amount and/or property; the persons to

whom and by whom it was so made. On his sole testimony the

charge of dowry demand and cruelty stands proven against all the

accused persons.

</p><p id="p_74">38.       Smt. Shipra Debnath (PW-4) who is the mother of the

accused substantially corroborates what is so stated by her

husband Sri Uttam Kr. Debnath (PW-1). However, we do notice

there are two contradictions in her statement; (i) the time of

marriage, which she unlike her husband refers to be 4 years prior

to the incident and (ii) her husband agreeing to meet the demand.

</p><p id="p_75">          But then, to our mind, this would, in no manner, render

the testimony of her husband to be unbelievable, impeaching his

credit, for she is categorical about (a) the dowry demand; (b)

made by the accused; (c) of a sum of Rs.40,000/-; (d) deceased

being subjected to cruelty (constant pressure), both mental and

physical; and (e) in the night of 15.4.2012, cries coming from the

house of the deceased when her husband went to see as to what

had really happened.

the Apex Court in Yogesh Singh (supra) in the following terms:

</p><p id="p_78">          "29.   It   is   well    settled   in   law   that   the   minor
          discrepancies are not to be given undue emphasis and
          the evidence is to be considered from the point of view
          of trustworthiness. The test is whether the same
          inspires confidence in the mind of the Court. If the
          evidence is incredible and cannot be accepted by the
          test of prudence, then it may create a dent in the
          prosecution version. If an omission or discrepancy
          goes to the root of the matter and ushers in
          incongruities, the defence can take advantage of such
          inconsistencies. It needs no special emphasis to state
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                 Page 23 of 27</span>




          that every omission cannot take place of a material
          omission       and,   therefore,       minor     contradictions,
          inconsistencies or insignificant embellishments do not
          affect the core of the prosecution case and should not
          be taken to be a ground to reject the prosecution
          evidence. The omission should create a serious doubt
          about    the    truthfulness   or     creditworthiness      of   a
          witness. It is only the serious contradictions and
          omissions which materially affect the case of the
          prosecution but not every contradiction or omission.

</p><p id="p_85">42.         Smt. Bakul Debnath (PW-6) and Sri Prasenjit Debnath

(PW-7) also corroborate what is so stated by PW-1.

</p><p id="p_86">            Sri Narayan Debnath (PW-9) is the uncle of the

deceased. On the issue of dowry demand, with regard to the time

and amount as also the acts of ill-treatment he corroborates the

testimony of PW-1. Also hearing cries, he reached the spot where

he noticed the body of the deceased lying on the floor with burn

injuries. He noticed smell of Kerosene oil. This witness, as is so

stated by PW-1, wants the Court to believe that the deceased was

first murdered whereafter her body was burnt.


</p><p id="p_87">43.         Smt. Binasri Debnath (PW-16) is the eldest sister of the

deceased. Significantly, she does state that at the night of the

incident, she had spoken with her sister on telephone and was told

that the accused had tortured her for not meeting the demand.

But then which one of the accused, she does not state. After some

time, hearing cries coming from the house of the accused, she
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                             Page 25 of 27</span>




tried to reach but could not, as she had to take care of her

mother, who as has come on record had fainted. Later on, she

learnt from her father that the accused had killed the deceased by

setting her on fire. Significantly, this witness in the cross-

examination part of her testimony does mention of having

informed the police of the telephonic conversation which she had

had with her sister.

</p><p id="p_89">44.        The theory of "last seen together" is squarely applicable

in the instant case as has been so held by the Apex Court in

</p><p id="p_91">45.        Hence, testimonies of all the witnesses cumulatively

establish the factum of dowry demand, the acts of cruelty meted

out to the deceased by all the accused persons; accused Jhutan

Das and Sukha Ranjan Das and Smt. Sabita Das to be residing

separately; at the time of the occurrence only accused Jhutan Das

was present in the house with burn injuries on his hand, but

accused Sukha Ranjan Das and Smt. Sabita Das who also reached

the spot were outside in the courtyard. The body of the deceased

in a burnt condition was taken to the hospital where she was

declared dead.

<p id="p_92">
</p><p id="p_93">46.        We do find the prosecution to have established through

the testimonies of relations of the deceased that a sum of

Rs.40,000/- was demanded, not only by husband but also by his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                             Page 26 of 27</span>




parents. In fact, father suggested transfer of land in lieu thereof.

This was in relation to an incident which had taken place six

months prior to the death. As such, their complicity in relation to

the offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_53">Section 498-A</a> stands conclusively established

beyond reasonable doubt. The deceased was subjected to cruelty

i.e. harassed with a view to coerce her to meet an unlawful dowry

demand which was never meet. In the instant case, presumption,

statutory in nature under <a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_54">Section 113-A</a> of the Evidence Act, is

thus clearly invokeable.
</p>
<p id="p_94">
</p><p id="p_95">47.        Persistently her husband pressed such demand and

subjected her to cruelty, also physical in nature. On the date of

the incident, the deceased had spoken with her sister, informing

the demand being pressed by her husband. Father of the

deceased does state that when he reached the spot i.e. the

matrimonial house, he found his daughter lying on the floor with

the body burnt. Also accused husband had sustained burn injury

on his hand. Well, the accused has not furnished any explanation

as to how he or his wife sustained the burn injury. It is not his

case that he tried to douse the fire which resulted into such

injuries. It is a matter of record that the death is unnatural. It

took place within 7 years of marriage. It was caused by a burn

injury. Consistently, dowry demand, specific in nature was made

by the husband of the deceased. As such statutory presumption

under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_55">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act is

clearly unshakeable.

</p><p id="p_97">48.          In this backdrop, we do not find the findings returned

by the Court below holding accused Jhutan Das to have committed

an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_56">Section 304B</a> of the IPC as also under

<a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_57">Section 498A</a> of IPC and the remaining two accused Sukha Ranjan

Das and Sabita Das to have committed an offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_58">Section 498A</a> of IPC not to be borne out from the record or

based on incorrect and improper appreciation of the material on

record or misinterpretation/misapplication of the provisions of law.
