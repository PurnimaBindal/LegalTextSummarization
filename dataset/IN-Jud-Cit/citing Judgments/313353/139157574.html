        passed by the Copyright Board under <a href="/doc/846220/" id="a_1">Section 50</a> of the Copyright Act,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">RFA 175-176/2009                                                  Page 1 of 15</span>
         1957 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;), by which the Copyright
        Board ordered for the expunction of five entries bearing registration
        numbers         A-58545/2001,        A-61480/2002   for   artistic    work
        AMPACHAN and A-61431/2002, A-64130/2003 and A-64132/2003
        for artistic work ROCHAK from the Register of Copyrights.
</p><p id="p_3">2.      The brief facts required to be noticed for the disposal of the present
        appeals are that the appellant is a registered partnership firm
        comprising of three partners being (i) Shri. Suresh Kumar Poddar; (ii)
        Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar; and (iii) Smt. Asha Devi Poddar. Shri. Suresh
        Kumar Poddar and Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar are real brothers, while
        Smt. Asha Devi Poddar is the wife of the third brother.
</p><p id="p_4">3.      The appellants claim to be an established firm engaged in the business
        of manufacturing and marketing ayurvedic and medicinal products
        such as churan tablets for digestive purpose since the year 1982. The
        appellant firm is registered with the Sales Tax Department, Delhi and
        has been allotted sales tax registration No. 07/107962/05/85. It is
        submitted that the appellant firm adopted the trade mark ROCHAK for
        the goods- churan tablets in the year 1982. They also, for the first
        time, invented and adopted an artistic label in the form of a pouch
        bearing the trade mark ROCHAK. An examination of the pouch
        would suggest the following distinctive features:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            a) a colour combination of blue, white and red
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            b) face of a person artistically designed in a manner so that the
                   face is mounted on the handle of the spoon and the spoon is
                   crisscrossed by a knife

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            f) the trade mark ROCHAK is written in English and Hindi.
</blockquote><p id="p_5">4.      The appellant claims a trade mark in colour combination and the entire
        label as well. The labels are in different sizes for different packaging
        but the principle is the same.
</p><p id="p_6">5.      It is submitted that the appellant invented and adopted an artistic label
        in the form of a pouch bearing the trade mark AMPACHAN for the
        goods - churan tablets, in the year 1985. An examination of the pouch
        would suggest the following distinctive features:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            a) a colour combination of light green, red, white and yellow
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            b) AMPACHAN is written in Hindi and English in an artistic
                   manner so that the first letter of the trade mark AMPACHAN
                   starts from the middle of an artistically designed mango
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">            c) two pairs of children are shown on the packet in a special

</pre><p id="p_8">7.      The Copyright Board vide order dated 21.01.2009 held that in all the
        five copyright registrations, Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar, being the first
        owner of the work, in terms of <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_2">Section 17</a> of the Act, did not comply
        with <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_3">Section 19</a> of the Act, which required him to grant the rights of
        the works to the firm through an assignment in writing.
</p><p id="p_9">8.      Learned counsel for the appellant contends that Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar
        is mentioned as the author of the said artistic works and the appellant
        firm is a family concern of the said Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar. Mr. Bhatia
        submits that Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar was an employee of the family
        concern from 1982 to 1987 and after 1987, he has become a partner.
        The copyright applications were specifically signed by Shri. Ratan Lal
        Poddar as partner of the appellant and the same mention that the
        registrations are sought in the name of the firm- M/s Visakha




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RFA 175-176/2009                                                      Page 4 of 15</span>
         Chemicals. The written statements filed in the rectification petition
        were also signed by Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar.
</p><p id="p_10">9.      Counsel further contends that the firm and Shri Ratan Lal Poddar
        always treated the trade mark/ labels ROCHAK and AMPACHAN as
        a partnership property. The partnership firm took a drug license for
        ROCHAK on 29.09.1982 and the trade mark registration ROCHAK
        was in the name of the firm. Moreover, a notice was issued by M/S
        K.G. Bansal and Co. in 1986 for the trade mark ROCHAK on behalf
        of the appellant. Further, litigations were filed and contested by the
        appellant firm for the trade mark ROCHAK/AMPACHAN.
</p><p id="p_11">10.     Counsel further contends that the Copyright Board has cancelled the
        five registrations on the solitary ground that Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar,
        being the author of the artistic work, did not assign the copyright
        works to the firm. Mr. Bhatia submits that the Copyright Board
        ignored that- firstly, there is no dispute inter se the partners and the
        firm; secondly, the applications for registration of Copyright were
        signed by Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar and the registration was sought in
        the name of the firm; and thirdly, the written statement and affidavits
        were filed by Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar in the proceedings to defend the
        firm. It is also submitted that the respondent, being a third party, has
        no locus standi to challenge the internal matters of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_12">11.     Counsel submits that the respondent sought to acquire copyright
        registration of labels ROCHAK and AMPACHAN in its own name
        and the same stand rejected. It is submitted that the Copyright Board
        has not disputed the copyright of Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar as the artist
        of the works, however, a rather technical approach has been adopted



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RFA 175-176/2009                                                       Page 5 of 15</span>
         without there being any protest or contest in any manner by the author
        who is none else but a partner of the firm and real brother of the other
        partner. Therefore, it is submitted that as only the assignment was
        disputed, the Copyright Board as an alternate, ought to have directed
        that the copyright registration may continue in the personal name of
        Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar or else granted time to cure the defect, if any.
</p><p id="p_13">12.     Counsel further contends that the order of the Copyright Board is
        contrary to provisions under <a href="/doc/804661/" id="a_4">Section 14</a> of the Partnership Act, 1932.
        <a href="/doc/804661/" id="a_5">Section 14</a> of the Partnership Act, 1932 reads as under: -

                   business of the firm, and includes also the goodwill of the

                   and rights and interests in property acquired with money
                   belonging to the firm are deemed to have been acquired for

        confectionery and baked products. The respondent carries on business
        in the name of and is the sole proprietor of Bindal Food Products.
</p><p id="p_16">15.     Counsel contends that three copyright applications were filed for
        ROCHAK in 2002 and 2003, and two applications for AMPACHAN
        were filed in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Further, the year of first
        publication of the copyrighted work for ROCHAK was identified as
        1982 and for AMPACHAN was identified as 1984. The registration of
        the copyrights was challenged before the Copyright Board and
        rectified essentially on the ground of faulty copyright registrations as
        Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar, being the first owner of the work under
        <a href="/doc/1593946/" id="a_13">Section 17</a> of the Act, retained his ownership over the artistic works in
        question. It is further contented that the provision under <a href="/doc/96884/" id="a_14">Section 19</a> of
        the Act required assignment via a written deed. We would like to

         Poddar and if it is the case that that the works were created by Shri.
        Ratan Lal Poddar in his capacity as an employee of the appellant, then
        the onus is on the appellant to prove the factum of Shri. Poddar&#x27;s
        employment through primary or secondary evidence.
</p><p id="p_22">20.     Learned counsel for the respondent has drawn the attention of this
        court to the materials filed/documents relied upon to prove the
        employment of the appellant, which we reproduce hereinunder:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">            a) An affidavit filed before the Copyright Board declaring that
                   Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar was an employee of the appellant at the
                   time of creation of the impugned works
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">            b) The particulars of Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar&#x27;s employment such as
                   the duration, his designation and responsibilities etc are not
                   disclosed nor is there any direct evidence of employment such
                   as Contract of Employment or Letter of Employment
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">            c) It is alleged by the counsel for the respondent that the
                   documents filed by the appellant along with the appeal do not
                   establish employment of Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar in the firm on
                   the stated dates i.e. 1982 and 1984 respectively.
                   They essentially comprise letters to the Rastriya Banijya Bank,
                   Kathmandu, Nepal signed by an unnamed person in the capacity
                   of &#x27;Manager.&#x27; Apart from the fact that the documents are of
                   1986 and not 1982 or 1984 when the artistic work was created,
                   and therefore cannot constitute proof of employment of Shri.
                   Ratan Lal Poddar in those years, in the appeal these documents
                   are referred in the grounds by the appellant with a mere
                   assertion that Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar was earlier an employee



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">RFA 175-176/2009                                                        Page 9 of 15</span>
                    and all the work were done by him. However, it neither
                   describes the capacity in which he was employed, nor does it
                   provide any secondary evidence of employment such as salary
                   slips, proof of deduction of TDS, reimbursement of expenses
                   etc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">                   Even if the said documents filed by the appellant are assumed to
                   pertain to Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar, despite the documents not
                   bearing his name, they would best prove as he was functioning
                   as manager/working the Sales Division of the appellant in 1986
                   which is irrelevant to the subject matter of the present
                   proceedings.
</blockquote><p id="p_23">21.     It is further contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that
        the sum and substance of the submissions made by the appellant are
        that Shri. Ratan Lal Poddar being a partner of the firm, the artistic
        works created by him will automatically inure to the benefit of the
        partnership under <a href="/doc/804661/" id="a_20">Section 14</a> of the Partnership Act, 1932. The
        arguments would have been correct and the ratio of the earlier
        decision of the Copyright Board in Hindustan Sanitary Ware and
        Industries Ltd v. Champion Ceramic, 2007 (34) PTC 695 (CB),
        would have been applicable to the present case provided Shri. Ratan
        Lal Poddar was a partner of the appellant at the time the work was
        created. That was however not the case, hence, <a href="/doc/804661/" id="a_21">Section 14</a> of the
        Partnership Act not apply.
</p><p id="p_24">22.    Learned counsel for the respondent places reliance on <a href="/doc/104189/" id="a_22">Nariman
       Aspandiar Irani v. Adi Merwan Irani</a>, AIR 1989 Bom 362, more
       particularly para 12, which is reproduced hereinunder:

                   stock of the firm`` <a href="/doc/804661/" id="a_23">Section 14</a> - <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_24">Partnership Act</a> . But this is
                   subject to contract between the partners. Under <a href="/doc/804661/" id="a_25">Section
                   14</a> of the Partnership Act , property belonging to a person ,
                   in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, does not, on
                   the person entering into a partnership with others, become
                   the property of the partnership, merely because it is used for
                   the business of the partnership. It will become property of
                   the partnership only if there is an agreement - express or
                   implied - that the property was, under the agreement of
                   partnership, to be treated as the property of the partnership
                   (Arjun Kanoji Tankar v. Santram Kanoji Tankar . ) In view
                   of this statement of law by the Supreme Court, the question
                   is whether there is any agreement to treat the tenancy of the
                   premises at 7, Jer Mession, Gowalia Tank Road, Bombay
                   26, as the property of the partnership deed and the balance-
                   sheets exclude inference of such agreement. Therefore,
                   when the Plaintiff made `` a gift`` of his ``half partnership
                   of the hospital``, he gave all his share except the share in
                   the tenancy, for, the tenancy was never the property of the
                   firm. This inference is difficult to escape.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">23.     Reliance is also placed on the decision rendered by the Division
        Bench of the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/1846072/" id="a_26">B.Mohammad v. M/S Prabha
        Singh</a>, 2008 (38) PTC 576, submitting that the said judgment is not
        applicable as it pertains to curing a defect in the assignment and
        cannot be applied to a situation when there is admittedly no
        assignment. The question of the Copyright Board cross examining
        Shri. Poddar as to the terms of his employment or its failure to accept
        his assertion to that effect in his affidavit, as urged in his grounds,
        cannot hold substance in the absence of an Assignment Deed and lack
        of any primary or secondary evidence of employment of Shri Poddar
        in the appellant firm in the year 1982. It is also submitted that the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">RFA 175-176/2009                                                          Page 11 of 15</span>
         Copyright Board is not required to cross examine the deponent and it
        is the appellant who has failed to discharge the burden on them.
</p><p id="p_26">24.     It is further contended that it may also be argued that the contents of
        the affidavit need not be gone into as in the absence of an assignment
        or proof of employment being at the time of applying for registration
        of copyright, the registration was obviously faulty and could not be
        rectified by the introduction of evidence in sub-sequential proceedings
        for cancellation of said copyrights, as the mandatory statutory
        threshold had not been met at the time of filing the application.
</p><p id="p_27">25.     It is further submitted that the argument as to an absence of a locus
        standi on the part of the respondent to challenge the assignment of the
        impugned work by Shri Poddar to the appellant is incorrect as it is not
        the merit of the assignment that has been challenged, which is a
        mandatory statutory pre requisite under <a href="/doc/96884/" id="a_27">Section 19</a> of the Act. Given
        that admittedly civil and criminal cases can be filed against the
        respondent on the basis of these copyright registrations, the respondent
        has a locus standi to challenge the appellant&#x27;s title in them. Therefore,
        it is contended on the basis of the facts and documents on record that
        the appellant cannot be entitled to the impugned copyright registration
        and therefore the order of cancellation of Copyright Board is correct in
        law.
</p><p id="p_28">26.     Ms. Swetashree Majumdar, learned Amicus Curiae submits that either
        Shri. Poddar ought to be free to reapply for the said registration in his
        own name and thereafter execute a Deed of Assignment in favour of
        the appellant firm as on the present date or the appellant should be
        permitted to seek the aforesaid registration in their own favour. It is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">RFA 175-176/2009                                                      Page 12 of 15</span>
         further submitted that given that registration of a copyright is not a
        mandatory pre-requisite condition under the Berne Convention, the
        absence of registration should not disentitle the owner of the copyright
        in the impugned labels, which appears to be Shri. Poddar at the present
        moment, or in enforcing them in ongoing and future civil and criminal
        actions.
</p><p id="p_29">27.     We have heard the learned counsels for the parties and the learned
        Amicus Curiae and considered their rival submissions.
</p><p id="p_30">28.     A perusal of the order passed by the Copyright Board shows that the
        Board has not questioned the ownership of Shri Ratan Lal Poddar over
        the works in question, but rather has observed that Shri Ratan Lal
        Poddar is exclusively the first owner of the said works. The Copyright
        Board has also observed that Shri Ratan Lal Poddar being the creator
        of the work, exercises an exclusive right over the same and his action
        of passing the same to the appellant consisting of three partners
        including Shri Ratan Lal Poddar, created collective interests which
        amounted to assignment in terms of <a href="/doc/214776/" id="a_28">Section 18</a> and <a href="/doc/96884/" id="a_29">19</a> of the Act.
        Counsel for the respondent, while relying upon the observation made
        by the Copyright Board, has strongly contended that under <a href="/doc/96884/" id="a_30">Section 19</a>
        of the Act, assignment in writing is a mandatory statutory prerequisite
        for permitting usage of the copyrighted works. The said contention of
        the respondent cannot be accepted and lacks merit for the reason that
        Shri Ratan Lal Poddar, while applying for the registration of the said
        artistic works, mentioned the appellant i.e. M/s Visakha Chemicals as
        the owner of the artistic works. Additionally, after examining the
        affidavit of Shri Ratan Lal Poddar, we may also note that the appellant



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">RFA 175-176/2009                                                     Page 13 of 15</span>
         is a family concern of Shri Ratan Lal Poddar and he had been working
        in the appellant firm as an employee since 1982 and in 1987 joined the
        appellant firm as a partner; and the artistic works in question were
        developed by Shri Ratan Lal Poddar for the appellant firm while he
        was employed in the firm. Also, as the ownership of Shri Ratan Lal
        Poddar over the challenged artistic works is not disputed and in the
        absence of any disputes regarding the creation or usage of the said
        artistic works amongst the partners in the firm, the signing of the
        application form for the registration of the copyright for the
        challenged artistic works amounts to assignment made in favour of the
        appellant firm.
</p><p id="p_31">29.     We may note that bare distinction in this case is that Shri Ratan Lal
        Poddar claims to be the author which is not disputed by the appellant
        firm. Shri Ratan Lal Poddar claims that he created artistic works for
        the appellant firm and applied for the registration in the name of the
        appellant firm which fact is not disputed by the partners in the firm.
        Moreover, Shri Ratan Lal Poddar is the real brother of one of the
        partners and it is claimed that at the time when he created the artistic
        works he was employed in the appellant firm. It is pertinent to
        mention that in Indian culture it is not unusual that the family
        members, irrespective of age and qualification, share the burden in the
        family business even while pursuing their education. Even otherwise,
        it is common knowledge that boys after college manage shops and
        other business centres with their respective fathers and other family
        members.

<p id="p_32"> 30.     We are also of the view that since there was no dispute regarding the
        usage of the said artistic works amongst the partners in the appellant
        firm, the respondent cannot challenge the assignment since neither the
        respondent is an assignor nor is claiming prior assignment. The
        respondent therefore being a third party has no locus to challenge the
        assignment made by Shri Ratan Lal Poddar.
</p><p id="p_33">31.     In view of the above discussion, we are of the view that the decision
        rendered by the Copyright Board in expunging the five entries bearing
