Sl.No.62



                  None appears.

                  The legality of the order dated 16.2.2005 passed by the Single

           Bench in W. P. No. 5066 (W) of 2001 has been questioned in the intra-

           court appeal.

                  The petitioner was allowed to retain his quarter at Purulia in

           1991, as his son was to appear in the Madhyamik Examination. The

           authority by their letter dated 24.9.1990 permitted the petitioner to

           retain the quarter till the examination of his son was over on payment

           of penal rent. Accordingly, the quarter was retained till the employee

           vacated the same since examination of his son was over.               The

           petitioner was charged penal rent and the same was directed to be

           deducted from his salary. The petitioner retired from his service and

           his retiral benefit was not fully paid. He preferred the writ petition.

                  It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that a sum of</pre>

<p id="p_1">           Rs.21,000/- was deducted from the retiral benefit on account of

           damaged rent payable to the authority by the petitioner as he did not

           vacate the quarter within the time stipulated.

</p><p id="p_2">                  The Single Bench has ordered that in terms of the direction of

           this Court the petitioner had been allowed to retain the quarter till his

           son's Madhyamik Examination was over. The authority also realised

           penal rent from the petitioner in terms of their Memo dated

           24.9.1990. There could not have been any further damage amount to

           be realised from the petitioner out of the retiral benefit and such

           action on the part of the authority was totally illegal and wrongful.

           The Single Bench directed the authority to refund the said sum of Rs.

           21,000/- together with interest at the rate of 5% per annum.

      In view of the above facts and circumstances, we find no

ground has been made out so as to interfere with the order passed by

the Single Bench.
