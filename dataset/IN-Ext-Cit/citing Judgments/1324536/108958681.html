     question     took place on 26.3.2005             which was the day
     after    'Holi    Festival'   which     is   called       'Dhoolivandan




                                                  
     Festival".       According to the prosecution, deceased Dilip
     informed the Appellant /Accused that he was going to
     sprinkle colour on the Appellant. However, the Appellant




                                    
     warned him not to do so. In spite of that, according to
                        
     the prosecution, Dilip sprinkled colour on the Appellant
     and as a result of which, there was an altercation
                       
     between          the   Appellant       and   deceased          Dilip       and,
     thereafter, the Appellant went inside the house, brought
     a knife and inflicted          two injuries on the person of
      


     deceased, as result of which the deceased collapsed and
   



     died. It is not in dispute that his death was homicidal.
     The doctor, who performed the post-mortem, has stated
     in his evidence that the deceased received three external





     injuries viz.; (i) Incise wound over, neck, anterior, 6
     inches X 3 inches, cavity deep, carotid artery and jugular
     vein cut through and through, trachea cut through and





     through; (ii)       Incise wound left anterior chest, 4 inches
     below left stemo-clavicular joint, size 1 inch X 0.5 inch
     muscle deep; (iii)        Incise wound left ear over pinna 0.5
     inch X 1/4th inch, skin deep.                   PW-2- Dr. Kantilal
     Sontakke who performed the postmortem has stated that

     i.e. carotid and jugular veins and trachea on account of

     stated that these injuries were sufficient to cause death.

     Appellant submits that even if the prosecution case is
                   
     accepted as it is, even then, according to him, the Trial
     Court ought to have      held that the offence would fall
                  
     under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">section 304-Part</a> II of IPC and not under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">section
     302</a> of IPC.    He submitted that there was sudden fight
     and there was altercation between the Appellant and the
      


     deceased and thereafter, the Appellant brought a knife
   



     and stabbed the deceased. He submitted that therefore,
     the case of the Appellant would squarely fall under the
     4th Exception to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_5">section 300</a> of the Indian Penal Code. In





     support of the said submissions, he has relied on the
     following judgments of the Apex Court -

     behalf of the State submits that the Trial Court had
     taken into consideration     the entire evidence on record
     and had rightly come to the conclusion that the




                                
     Appellant had committed offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">section 302</a> and
                      
     not under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_10">section 304</a> -<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11"> Part II of the Indian Penal Code</a>.
     He submitted that the eye witnesses had clearly stated
                     
     that after the deceased had sprinkled colour on the
     deceased, which is customary during the Holi Festival,
     the Appellant went inside the house,             brought a knife
      


     and thereafter, inflicted three injuries on his person
   



     which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
     cause death. He submitted that apart from that, it had
     come on record that there was prior enmity between the





     Appellant and the deceased and,             therefore, it could
     not be said that the said incident had taken place on the
     spur of the moment.         He submitted that the injury,





     which was caused by the Appellant, was                 on the main
     parts     of   the body   i.e. neck,    chest,       left ear        over
     pinna, thorax and, apart from that, there was a deep
     cut to the trachea which is a vital organ and as a result
     of the said stab wound, the deceased fell down and died

     on the spot. He, therefore, submitted that this is not a fit
     case for interfering with the impugned judgment and




                                          
     order passed by the Trial Court.
</p><p id="p_11">     7.   We have, with the assistance of the learned counsel




                                         
     for the Appellant and the learned APP for the State, gone
     through the impugned judgment and order passed by the
     Trial Court and also notes of evidence and other material




                                
     evidence on record.     In the present case, the learned
                   
     counsel for the Appellant has mainly submitted that the
     offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">section 302</a> of the IPC was not attracted
                  
     even if the prosecution case is accepted as it is. In view of
     this submission, in our view, it is not necessary to go
     through the     evidence for the purpose of finding out
      


     whether the prosecution has proved its case regarding
   



     the incident of assault by the Appellant herein.
</p>

<p id="p_12">     8.   The only question, therefore, which now falls for our





     consideration is: whether there was       sufficient material
     on record whereby the Court could have              come to the
     conclusion    that    the    Appellant      had         committed





     premeditated murder of deceased Dilip.           We have given
     our anxious consideration to the material on record, and,
     in our view, the evidence clearly suggests that the case
     of the Appellant would fall within Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_13">section
     300</a> of the Indian Penal Code. It is a common ground that

     the deceased came to the house of the Appellant and told
     him that he was going to sprinkle colour on him. For




                                          
     some reason, the Appellant did not wish to get sprinkled
     with the colour   though it was a Holi Festival and he




                                         
     warned the deceased that he should not               sprinkle the
     colour on him. In spite of warning being given by the
     Appellant, the deceased Dilip, who was the Appellant's




                               
     nephew, proceeded to sprinkle colour on him and
                   
     thereafter, there was an altercation and both the
     Appellant and the deceased abused each other and soon
                  
     thereafter, the Appellant went inside, brought               a knife
     and stabbed    the deceased thrice     on the upper chest.
     From the evidence on record, it is established that there
      


     was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation
   



     on the part of the Appellant. The evidence clearly
     discloses that the deceased came near the house of the
     Appellant and thereafter the incident in question took





     place. Though it is true that the Appellant went inside,
     brought a knife and then inflicted injuries, the said
     incident happened in fraction of a minute. If the injuries,





     which are caused to the deceased, are taken into
     consideration, it cannot be said that the Appellant has
     acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

     consideration the judgment of the Apex Court in the case

     of <a href="/doc/1324536/" id="a_14">Satish Narayan Sawant vs. State of Goa</a> (supra).
     The Apex Court in paragraph 28 of the said judgment




                                        
     has observed that if the provocation      and the incident
     happened at the spur of the moment, then the case




                                       
     would not fall   under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">section 302</a> of the Indian Penal
     Code, but it would fall under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">section 304-Part</a> II of the
     Indian Penal Code.    In the said case, the Apex Court




                               
     observed that the other injuries were superficial                and
                   
     only one injury was fatal in nature.       In the said case
     also, there was heated exchange of words and scuffle
                  
     between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing
     took place.   In the second case of <a href="/doc/1996721/" id="a_17">Sukhbir Singh vs.
     State of Haryana</a> (supra) also, there was a quarrel and
      


     the deceased gave slap to the Appellant and thereafter,
   



     the accused went home and came armed with the
     company of others and the time gap between the quarrel
     and the fight was of a few minutes only. The Apex Court





     held that there was no sufficient lapse of time between
     the quarrel and the fight and, therefore, the occurrence
     was "sudden" within the meaning of Exception 4 to





     <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_18">section 300</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

          to be accepted, even then an offence under

          out. Coming to the nature of the offence, we
          find it difficult to hold that an offence under<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_21"> S.

          was no previous enmity. There was a scuffle

          15-20     minutes later the           accused Jagpati
          accompanied       by his brother, Ram               Krishna
          came to the scene of occurrence. It can be seen
      


          that    because    of   the       trivial   incident        the
   



          subsequent occurrence appears to have taken
          place."

<p id="p_15">     11. In our view, the ratio of these judgments would
     squarely apply to the facts of the present case. In the





     present case also, there was a sudden quarrel.                             The
     deceased came to the house of the Appellant and tried to
     sprinkle the colour on the Appellant, though he was
     warned not to do so. An altercation ensued, followed by a
     scuffle and    then the Appellant went inside the house

     and brought a knife. In the present case also there was
     no sufficient lapse of time between the incident and the




                                        
     assault and, therefore, the fight was "sudden" within the
     meaning of Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_23">section 300</a> of the Indian




                                       
     Penal Code.     The submission made by the learned APP
     for the State   that since the Appellant had gone inside
     and brought the knife and caused a fatal injury with




                              
     the knife shows that there was an intention to commit
                     
     the murder, cannot be accepted. It is also urged that it
     had come on record that there was previous enmity
                    
     between the two, whereas in the judgment on which the
     reliance is placed, the Apex Court had noted that there
     was no previous enmity.      It is true that one of the
      


     witnesses had stated that    there was previous enmity
   



     between the Appellant and the deceased.                 However,
     apart from the mere statement, there      was no material
     on record to suggest that there





     was prior enmity between the two.       The Appellant was
     the uncle of the deceased and had there been a previous





     enmity, the deceased would not have came to the house
     of the Appellant on a Holi Festival to sprinkle the colour
     on him.   The submissions of the learned APP appearing
     on behalf of the State that there was a prior enmity and,
     therefore, the ratio of the judgments are not applicable,

     established that the Appellant had committed murder

     the knife and had inflicted 2/3 incised injuries on the
