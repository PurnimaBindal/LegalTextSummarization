</p><p id="p_4"> 2.      The factual scenario emerging from the record of this case is

that on 22nd December, 2009 at 10:57 p.m., DD No. 39A was lodged

at PS Kotwali regarding quarrel in building No. 2077, Gali Paranthe

Wali/ Gali Pagri Wali, Chandni Chowk, Delhi. The investigation was

entrusted to ASI Chatter Pal (PW22) who, along with Head Constable

Kishan (PW17), reached the spot. Meanwhile, on receipt of DD No.

21 B, Inspector I.K. Jha (PW21) along with the staff also reached the

place of occurrence where on one side of the room, dead body of a

female was lying on the floor with a towel/gamcha tied around her

neck. It is further the case of prosecution that Arif (PW7) aged about

14 years, son of the deceased met the police officials and his

statement, Ex.PW7/A was recorded on which endorsement,

Ex.PW17/A was made and the same was sent to police station on the

basis of which FIR Ex.PW4/B was registered. The crime team was

called at the place and the room was inspected. Photographs were

taken. Site Plan, Ex.PW2/C was prepared. The dead body was sent

for post mortem. The accused was ultimately arrested on 4th January,

2010 on the basis of secret information. As per the opinion of the

doctor, Rehana died of asphyxia due to ante mortem ligature




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                   Page 2 of 53</span>
 strangulation.         After completing investigation, charge sheet was

submitted against the accused.        The accused chose to contest the

charge u/s 302<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.      In order to substantiate its case, prosecution in all examined 22

witnesses. All the incriminating evidence was put to the accused

while recording his statement, u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>. wherein he admitted

that premises No. 2077, Gali Paranthe Wali/Gali Pagri Wali, Chandni

Chowk, Delhi was under his tenancy. The rest of the case was one of

denial simplicitor.          He claimed innocence and alleged false

implication in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.      The learned Trial Court relied upon 10 incriminating

circumstances against the appellant which established his guilt and

accordingly the accused was convicted and sentenced as aforesaid.

Those 10 incriminating circumstances as detailed in para 24 of the

judgment are as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        (i)     the accused was tenant in respect of a room on the third
                floor where he was imparting knowledge of embroidery
                to     his children PW7 Arif and PW8 Raisuddin and
                deceased Mst. Rehana used to visit the place now and
                then;

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (ii)    secondly, the accused was a drunkard and was in the
                habit of beating his wife and he was keeping an evil eye
                on Shabana, the daughter of deceased from first marriage
                which was probably resented by the deceased and the
                complaint was lodged with Delhi Commission for
                Women and the accused was counselled to behave
                properly;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (iii)   thirdly, the accused had liquor in the evening and sent
                PW7 and PW8 to fetch some meals;

                room from 8.00 PM till 10:30 PM or so;

                neighbour PW1 Sanjay;

                and committing the crime;

<p id="p_7"> 5.      We have heard Ms. Anu Narula, Advocate for the appellant and

Ms. Richa Kapoor, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State

and have perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.      It was submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that

the case of prosecution primarily rests on the testimony of PW-7 and

PW-8 who are the children of the deceased.             However, their

deposition cannot be relied upon and accepted to nail the accused.

They were at vulnerable age and nursing a lot of acrimony, anger and

ill feelings towards the appellant. They were tutored by their maternal

family. They developed a story of some Imran in consultation with

each other. Since improvements made by them are substantial, they

fall in the category of „unreliable witness‟ as per <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_5">Section 155</a> of the

Evidence Act.          Both these witnesses deposed that the appellant

consumed liquor at the place of occurrence, however, no liquor bottle

or glasses were recovered or seized during investigation. Prosecution

failed to examine material witnesses, viz., Imran or Shabana, the

daughter of the deceased. The investigation was also shabby as no

inquiry was conducted as to how the salwar of the deceased was wet.

Chance Prints were not lifted. Learned Trial Court went wrong in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                    Page 5 of 53</span>
 observing that the appellant was absconding and was arrested on 4 th

January, 2010 at the instance of a secret informer.         In fact, the

appellant himself has surrendered in the police station. As per police

officials, when the accused was arrested, at that time he was identified

by PW6, Vineet Gupta.         However, Vineet Gupta, in his cross-

examination, has denied that he identified the accused in Gali

Paranthe Wali. It was further submitted that motive to commit crime

is not proved. The alleged complaints by the deceased have not been

proved in accordance with law. The alleged grievances as scribed in

Mark16/X1 and 16/X2 do not match the allegation when she was

verbally questioned as revealed from the order sheet dated 15th

September, 2009, Ex.PW11/B. In any case, all the disputes were

settled and there was no further complaint by the deceased till the date

of incident. The alleged complaint is not in the handwriting of the

deceased. Rather it is signed by some Samim who has not been

examined.        Moreover, name of the husband as mentioned in the

complaint is some Atiq Ahmed whereas while recording statement of

the accused u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>., he has been asked if his name was Atiq

Rahman, to which he replied in affirmative. As such, the prosecution




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                     Page 6 of 53</span>
 has failed to prove the case against the accused. Alternatively, it was

submitted that as per the disclosure statement of the accused, he had

discovered his wife in a compromising condition and she was having

illicit relationship with someone. Although, the Investigating Agency

has failed to conduct investigation on these lines, however, the

disclosure statement so far as prosecution is concerned, is

inadmissible in evidence. However, the exculpatory portion has to be

appreciated in favour of the accused only. Even DD-39A shows that

there was a quarrel in the room. It is not the case of prosecution that

the appellant was laced with weapon or he came to the room with pre

meditation of eliminating his wife or apart from strangulation, there

was any other external injuries. As such, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> IPC is not made

out and at the most, offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_8">Section 304</a> is made out.

learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State submitted that the

 deceased was last seen with the accused in the room and it was proved

that the accused was the only person with the deceased in the room.

Same was deposed by PW7 Arif and PW8 Raisuddin, sons of

deceased which find corroboration from an independent witness,

namely, Sanjay, PW1. The FIR was registered at the earliest available

opportunity when there was no scope for any fabrication or

manipulation. All the minute details were given at the time of lodging

the FIR which gives an assurance regarding the truth of its version.

The mere fact that PW7 and PW8 were child witnesses is not

sufficient to discard their testimony as they were subjected to

gruelling cross examination but nothing could be elicited to discredit

their testimony. Moreover, the presence of the witnesses was quite

natural in the facts and circumstances of case. The accused had a

motive to kill the deceased which stands proved from the previous

history of cruelty committed by the accused towards the deceased

which is substantiated by the complaint and proceedings held before

Delhi Commission for Women. The conduct of the accused in fleeing

from the place of incidence and avoiding his arrest is another

incriminating piece of evidence. It was further submitted that the

 disclosure statement made to the police by the accused was

inadmissible in evidence in view of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_12">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act

and since no recovery was effected in pursuance to the same, it was

inadmissible for all practical purposes. The appellant cannot take

shelter of the said disclosure statement. It was submitted that the

impugned order does not suffer from any infirmity which calls for

interference. As such, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.

3rd Floor, Jayantilal Building, Gali Paranthe Wali, Chandni Chowk,

Delhi where the appellant along with his two sons were also residing

as a tenant and doing the work of embroidery. This witness has

deposed that on 22nd December, 2009, he returned back from his duty

at about 10:00 p.m. and found both the sons of the accused Amruddin

present in his room watching TV. He started taking his meal in the

room. Both the children left and knocked at the door of their room.

They were having a small baby who was also crying.                Despite

repeated knocking at the door, accused did not open the same. On

hearing the noise, he went to the said room and called upon accused

Amruddin to open the door but he replied that he would open the

same after some time. Thereafter, he returned back to his room. In

the meantime, he heard the cries of children. He noticed that the

residents of the building were gathered there. He also went there and

found that Amruddin had already left the place. The door of the room

without any movement and the children were crying that their mother

was no more alive.

<p id="p_16">13.     PW-6 Vineet Gupta became the owner of House No. 2077,

Pagri Wali Gali/Gali Paranthe Wali, Chandni Chowk after the death

of his brother-in-law. He has deposed that a room on the second or 3rd

floor of the premises had been under tenancy of Amruddin for the last

about 3-4 years on a monthly rent of Rs.3000/-. Accused had been

doing embroidery work in the tenanted room and he had been residing

there along with his two children aged about 14-15 years. On the date

of incident at about 11:30 pm, he was present at his show room and

was informed that a murder has taken place in House No.2077. He

informed the police from the mobile of someone in the market and

thereafter went to the spot where he found a lady lying dead on the

floor of the tenanted room of the accused.

<p id="p_17">14.     PW7, Arif is the son of the deceased who has deposed that

Rehana was his mother. It was the second marriage of his mother

with accused Amruddin. He and his elder sister Shabana were born

from the first marriage and after death of his father his mother married




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                    Page 11 of 53</span>
 to the accused. Rest of his two brothers and three sisters are from the

second marriage. He along with his younger brother Raisuddin had

been learning embroidery work from their father Amruddin and had

been residing in the tenanted accommodation in Gali Paranthe Wali,

Chandni Chowk, Delhi. His mother along with other brothers and

sisters had been residing at a house in Usmanpur, Burari, Delhi. His

father used to have quarrels with his mother after consuming alcohol.

On the fateful day, his mother had come at about 1:00 p.m. from

Usmanpur to the tenanted room in Paranthe Wali Gali, Chandni

Chowk. In the morning, when they were at Usmanpur, his father had

a quarrel with the mother and at that time he threatened his mother

that he would kill her. When his mother came at about 1:00 pm, he

and his brother were doing embroidery work. Later in the evening,

his father went away and came back at about 8:00 p.m. and then

consumed liquor. Thereafter, at about 9:00 p.m., his father asked

them to go out and bring some meal after giving Rs.50/-. When he

along with his brother Raisuddin returned back at about 10:00 p.m.

and knocked at the door, his father slightly opened the door and asked

them to have meal outside and come back after some time. He saw

 his mother lying on the floor and her legs were not covered by any

cloth. After taking meal, they went to the room of neighbour Sanjay

where they started watching TV. After watching TV for about ½ an

hour, he along with his younger brother returned back to the room and

started knocking the door but nobody responded or opened the door.

One Imran came there and enquired as to what was happening and

they informed him that nobody was opening the door. Finding no

response, he and his brother besides Imran went back to the house of

Sanjay and started watching TV. Sanjay had also knocked at the door

and at that time, his father responded that he should come after some

time. Imran also knocked at the door but his father did not respond.

After ½ an hour, his father came to the room of Sanjay and took Imran

on one side and they had some discussion. Then Imran came and

asked them to accompany him for leaving them at Usmanpur but they

refused. Thereafter, Imran went away. He along with his brother

went to the room and knocked at the door. They found that it was

bolted from outside. They opened the latch and entered into the room

and found their mother lying on the floor. They called their mother

and tried to wake her up but she did not respond. They started crying.

 There was a towel/gamcha tied around the neck of the mother. His

father was not present either in the room or outside the house at that

time. Later on, somebody told them that his father has strangulated

his mother to death by using gamcha/towel. On hearing their cries,

many people from the neighbourhood gathered. Police was called.

He was interrogated by the police and his statement, Ex.PW7/A was

recorded by the police which bears his signature at point „A‟.

Photographs were taken by the police of the place of occurrence

where the dead body of his mother was lying. He identified the dead

body of his mother and also the towel type gamcha (Ex.P1) which was

around the neck of his mother, who was lying in her room on the date

<p id="p_30">26.     It is clear that even in the absence of eye-witness, if various

circumstances relied on by the prosecution relating to the guilt are

fully established beyond doubt, the Court is free to award conviction.

Further, the chain of events must be complete in order to sustain the

conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

come to meet her sons at this house at about 1:00 pm in the afternoon

along with the accused. Accused left for his work in the afternoon

and returned back at about 8:00 pm. Accused consumed liquor. At

about 9:00 pm, he gave them Rs.50/- to bring meal. They went and

returned back at about 10:00 pm and knocked at the door, however,

the door was slightly opened by the accused who asked them to have

their meal outside and come back after some time. Both the children

had their meals outside the room and they again knocked at the door

but they were again asked to come after some time. As such, they

went to the room of PW-1 Sanjay which was also on the 3rd floor and

watched TV for some time. Again they came back and knocked at the

door but nobody responded then PW1, Sanjay also came there and

knocked at the door, however, he was asked by the accused to come

later on. Thereafter, the accused went out. The door was opened by

the children who found their mother lying on the floor.

counsel for the appellant on the ground that they were child witnesses

and were at vulnerable age. Possibility of their being tutored by their

maternal family cannot be ruled out, inasmuch as, although PW7 has

denied having any talk with his maternal uncle or maternal grand-

father but PW8 admitted that he had a discussion with his grand-

parents regarding the case before coming to the court. Furthermore,

their    testimony     suffers   from   substantial   improvements        and

embellishment as PW7, Arif has deposed that in the morning a quarrel

had taken place between the accused and the deceased and at that time

accused had threatened his mother to kill that day. However, this fact

did not find mention in the initial statement made by him to the police.

Furthermore, Imran has been introduced for the first time by the

witnesses in their deposition in the Court. There is also discrepancy

regarding the place where alcohol was consumed by the accused.

                       with the trial Judge who notices his manners, his

                       clear that his conclusion was erroneous. This precaution
                       is necessary because child witnesses are amenable to

        abnormal events which take place in his life and would never

        crime without improvements or embellishments, and the same
        inspire confidence of the Court, his deposition does not require any
        corroboration whatsoever. The child at a tender age is incapable
        of having any malice or ill will against any person. Therefore, there
        must be something on record to satisfy the Court that something

         case there is evidence on record to show that a child has been
        tutored, the Court can reject his statement partly or fully. However,

        drawn from the contents of his deposition."

Judge who had the opportunity to observe their demeanour. It was

observed that when examined in the Court, both the witnesses gave a

cool and confident response to the questions/quarries which were put

to them. It was rightly observed by learned Additional Sessions Judge

that the mandate of law is that the testimony of the child witnesses

should be carefully scrutinised and examined so as to rule out any

possibility of tutoring.     The two child witnesses were the natural

witnesses who were present at the spot throughout the relevant time.

The version of the incident deposed by the witnesses appears to be

very natural, cogent and reliable. Although, both the witnesses in the

cross-examination stated that they were very much annoyed with their

father, i.e., the accused, which of course was quite natural, but that

alone does not call for any inference that they had any reason to

depose falsely against the accused.         The mere fact that the two

witnesses had come to depose in the Court accompanied with their

maternal grandmother and uncle cannot be a ground by itself to throw

 away their testimony. Both the witnesses withstood a gruelling cross-

examination at the hands of defence counsel which could not bring

out any embellishment or any fact which may reflect that the facts

came out of their figment of imagination so as to cast any doubt on

their evidence. There was nothing in the cross-examination of the two

child witnesses that would show that they were tutored or prompted to

speak against the accused.

<p id="p_41">35.     The submission of learned counsel for the appellant that

testimony of witnesses suffers from certain improvements or

exaggerations, the same is bound to occur, in as much as, ordinarily a

witness cannot be expected to recall, correlate the sequence of events

which takes place in rapid succession or in a short span of time. A

witness though wholly truthful is liable to be overawed by the Court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination by the counsel and out

of nervousness, he might mix up facts, get confused regarding

sequence of events or fills up details from imagination on the spur of

the moment. The sub-conscious mind of the witness sometimes so

operates on account of the fear of looking foolish or being

of the occurrence witnessed by him.

<p id="p_44">38.     The principle that can be culled out from the aforesaid

<p id="p_46">40.     What is to be seen next is whether the version presented in the

Court was substantially similar to what was said during investigation.

It is only when exaggeration fundamentally changes the nature of the

case, the Court has to consider whether the witness was stating truth

or not.

<p id="p_47">41.     The submission that introduction of Imran or small child for the

first time in their deposition is an improvement; moreover, PW7 has

 contradicted his brother PW8 regarding the discussion with the

grandparents before coming to the Court and there is also

contradiction in their testimony regarding consumption of liquor by

the appellant is without substance.     None of the contradiction or

improvements pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant affects

the credibility of the witnesses, inasmuch as, the role assigned to

Imran is that he also came to the spot and also knocked the door and

subsequently when his father came out of the room he took Imran on

one side and according to PW7 he had some discussion with Imran

whereas PW8 deposed that accused confessed before Imran regarding

killing of his wife, whereupon Imran asked them to accompany him so

that he may leave them to their house at Usmanpur, but they refused

and thereafter Imran went away. The prosecution is not relying upon

any extra judicial confession allegedly made by the accused to Imran,

and therefore, even if Imran was not cited as a witness, or did not find

mention in the statement made by the witnesses, same does not affect

their testimony. For the same reason, even if nothing has come in the

testimony of these witnesses regarding the small child brought by

Rehana with her as deposed by PW1, same is hardly of any




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                    Page 32 of 53</span>
 significance. There is no contradiction in the testimony of the two

witnesses regarding the place where appellant consumed liquor as

PW7 deposed that appellant consumed alcohol outside the room.

PW8 also deposed that sometime in the evening, appellant had some

drink/alcohol with someone who was residing in nearby room,

therefore, there was no question of recovery of any glass or bottle

from the place of occurrence. As regards the submission that the

statement of the witnesses were the result of tutoring by the maternal

family, inasmuch as, PW8 has admitted that they had discussion with

their grand-parents regarding the case before coming to the Court, the

same is also inconsequential, inasmuch as, the police machinery was

set in motion on the basis of statement, Ex. PW7/A made by PW7,

Arif to the Police.    The incident has taken place during the period

9:00 pm to 10:30 pm. Police was informed by PW6, Vineet who

received the information regarding the murder when he was at his

shop. DD No.39A was recorded at 10:57 pm. Without loss of time, the

police reached the spot and recorded the statement of PW7 Arif.

Rukka was sent at 1:15 am and FIR was registered at 1:30 am. At that

juncture, there was no occasion for tutoring the child as no member of

 the family of the deceased was present at the spot. Every minute

detail was given in this complaint made by the witness. As held in

<a href="/doc/1067095/" id="a_35">Kishan Singh vs. Gurpal Singh</a> (supra) prompt and early reporting of

the occurrence by the informant with all its vivid details gives an

assurance regarding truth of its version. Although PW8, Raisuddin

admitted that while coming to the Court, his grand-mother and

maternal uncle discussed the matter with him and his brother,

however, he went on stating that he had deposed everything truthfully.

Before recording their statement, learned Additional Sessions Judge

had tested their capability to understand the questions and answer

them rationally and finding that the witnesses were quite responsive to

the quarries put and answer the same in a confident manner un-fazed

by the court atmosphere, the statements were recorded. They were

subjected to a gruelling cross-examination by learned defence counsel

but nothing material could be elicited to discredit their testimonies.

Moreover, the appellant was none else but their own father with

whom their relations were quite cordial which is reflective from the

fact that they were learning embroidery work from him. It was only

after    the     incident   that   they   became   annoyed   with        him




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                     Page 34 of 53</span>
 which was quite natural but same does not give rise to any inference

that they had any reason to depose falsely against the accused.

</p><p id="p_48">42.     Moreover, the testimony of both these witnesses find

corroboration from an independent witness PW1, Sanjay, who had no

apparent reason to depose against the accused. This witness has

corroborated the testimony of both these witnesses by deposing that

when he returned back to his house from his work at about 9:00 pm,

both the children of the accused were found watching TV in his room.

Both the children went to their room and knocked at the door but the

same was not opened by the accused. On hearing their noise, he also

came to the room and called upon the accused to open the door but he

replied that he would open the same after some time, therefore, he

returned back to his room. On hearing the cries of the children, he

went to the room and found the residents of the building gathered

there and then found that a lady was lying on the floor of the room.

Although, the witness did not support the case of prosecution in its

entirety, inasmuch as, he denied that accused opened the door and

after bolting the door from outside he went away in a hurry or that he

saw the wife of the accused Amruddin namely, Rehana lying on the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                    Page 35 of 53</span>
 floor having a towel around her neck. The fact remains that so far as

the version given by Arif and Raisuddin that they had been asked by

the accused to bring meal and thereafter again and again they kept on

asking him to open the door, he avoided the same and thereafter, they

went to the room of Sanjay and watched TV over there and again

attempted to get the door open, even Sanjay asked the accused to open

the door but he was asked to come after some time corroborates the

version given by these two witnesses. As such, from the testimony of

these witnesses, it stands proved that the accused was "last seen" with

the deceased during the period 9:00 to 10:30/11:00 pm.

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">         "The last seen theory comes into play where the time-gap between
         the point of time when the accused and the deceased were seen last
         alive and when the deceased is found dead is so small that
         possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of
         the crime becomes impossible. It would be difficult in some cases to
         positively establish that the deceased was last seen with the
         accused when there is a long gap and possibility of other persons
         coming in between exists. In the absence of any other positive
         evidence to conclude that the accused and the deceased were last
         seen together, it would be hazardous to come to a conclusion of
         guilt in those cases. In this case, there is positive evidence that the
         deceased and the accused were seen together by witnesses-PW3
         and PW5, in addition to the evidence of PW2."

<p id="p_51">45.      The time gap between the deceased having last seen with the

appellant and the death of Rehana is quite proximate as is evident

from the post mortem report that time since death was about 18 hours.

Thus, we are of the considered opinion that the incriminating

circumstance of last seen stands firmly established from the above

referred evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_52">46.      It was submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that

the prosecution has failed to prove motive to commit the crime,

inasmuch as, the complaint allegedly made by the deceased before



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                           Page 38 of 53</span>
 DCW and NCW are not duly proved. The allegations as made in

Mark PW16/X1and X2 do not match with the allegations as revealed

from the order sheet. Furthermore, the complaint is signed by some

Shamim which is distinct from Rehana and Atiq Rehman and Atiq

Ahmad are different. On the other hand, it is submission of the

learned Public Prosecutor for the State that it has come in the evidence

of the child witnesses that their father used to consume liquor on daily

basis and then he used to beat their mother. PW14, Om Prakash, who

had let out the premises at Usmanpur to the appellant, has also

deposed regarding frequent quarrels between the appellant and his

wife.     Moreover, much prior to this incident, complaint, Mark

PW16/X1 and PW16/X2 was lodged by the deceased with Delhi

Commission for Women wherein she alleged that her husband used to

beat her and was having an evil eye on her daughter Shabana from the

first marriage. The minor variance pointed out by the learned counsel

for the appellant are insignificant.    Not only the children of the

deceased deposed regarding frequent quarrels between the deceased

and the appellant that after consuming liquor, appellant used to give

beatings to the deceased, Om Prakash, landlord of the house, has also




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                    Page 39 of 53</span>
 deposed about the quarrels. PW16 Mumtiaz, brother of the deceased

has also deposed regarding giving of beatings by the accused to his

wife and that he used to keep an evil eye on his niece Shabana, who

was the daughter of Rehana from her first husband. He also deposed

regarding giving of complaint by Rehana against the accused at Delhi

Commission for Women with a copy to National Commission for

Women which he handed over to the Investigating Officer of the case.

Copies of the complaint supplied by this witness were verified by SI

Parveen Kumar, PW20, who also obtained certified copy of the

proceedings, Ex.PW11/B.      A perusal of the complaint made by

Rehana goes to show that she levelled allegations against her husband

regarding ill treatment and that he used to give her beatings after

making her naked. He used to keep an evil eye on her daughter and

wanted her to indulge in immoral activities. Mumtiaz, PW16 had

accompanied his mother and his sister Rehana to the office of Delhi

Commission for Women. While his mother accompanied by Rehana

went inside the office, he was standing outside the office.           The

complaint was written in the office of the Commission. Although it

was suggested that the deceased never made any complaint to Delhi




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                  Page 40 of 53</span>
 Commission for Women and National Commission for Women but no

suggestion was given that the complaint, Mark PW16/X1 and

PW16/X2 were not given by Rehana or that the same was not against

the accused. The proceedings conducted at Delhi Commission for

Women revealed that when the deceased appeared she stated that her

husband threatened to kidnap her daughter and thereafter husband was

ordered to be summoned through DCP.         The reproduction of the

complaint was not required to be recorded in the proceeding sheet.

The gist of the complaint was recorded and thereafter, the husband

was ordered to be summoned. The further order sheet dated 24 th

November, 2009 goes to show that the deceased informed that she

was residing with her husband and accused assured to look after her

and her children and, therefore,   the matter was adjourned for 4 th

January, 2010. However, much prior to this date, the deceased was

murdered on 22nd December, 2009, therefore, since none appeared for

the parties, the matter was closed, presuming that they may be living

happily. All this reflects that the relation between the deceased and

the appellant were not cordial. There used to be frequent quarrels.

Moreover, accused was keeping an evil eye on the daughter of the

 deceased Rehana from her first husband which resulted in filing of a

complaint before Delhi Commission for Women where the accused

was also called. As such, the prosecution succeeded in establishing

the motive for commission of crime.
</p>
<p id="p_53">47.     The medical evidence also proves that it was a case of

homicidal death. As per the opinion of doctor, the cause of death was

asphyxia due to ante mortem ligature strangulation sufficient to cause

death in ordinary course of nature. It has come in evidence that one

towel/gamcha was tied around the neck of the deceased and the doctor

has opined that the ligature present over the neck was possible to be

caused by ligature material present around the neck. The horizontal

mark on the neck of the deceased clearly indicated that she was

strangulated and that it was not a case of suicidal death. The neck was

not stretched and elongated. The ligature mark was not oblique nor

non-continuous placed high up in the neck between the chin and

larynx. Further the horizontal or transverse, continuous mark round

the neck was below the thyroid on the neck and it was a clear case of

homicidal death. The mere fact that there was no sign of external

injury on the body of the deceased does not demolish the case of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                    Page 42 of 53</span>
 prosecution in any manner. In Modi‟s Medical Jurisprudence and

Toxicology, Twenty-third Edition, Lexis Nexis, Butterworths

Wadhwa, Nagpur, at page 576 in regard to symptoms of strangulation,

it is opined that if the wind pipe is pressed so suddenly as to occlude

the passage of air altogether, the individual is rendered powerless to

call for assistance, becomes insensible and may die instantly. It is not

even the case of the accused that it was a case of suicide. As such, it

was proved that Rehana met a homicidal death.
</p>
<p id="p_54">48.     It is a settled legal proposition that in a case based on

circumstantial evidence, where no eye-witness's account is available,

the principle is that when an incriminating circumstance is put to the

accused and the said accused either offers no explanation for the

same, or offers an explanation which is found to be untrue, then the

same becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstances to

make it complete. (Vide: <a href="/doc/152464/" id="a_37">State of U.P. v. Dr. Ravindra Prakash

        simply keeping quiet and offering no explanation on the supposed

        kept in mind. The principle is that when an incriminating
        circumstance is put to the accused and the said accused either
        offers no explanation or offers an explanation which is found to be
        untrue, then the same becomes an additional link in the chain of

         strong circumstance which indicates that he is responsible for
        commission of the crime. <a href="/doc/866760/" id="a_55">In Nika Ram vs. State of H.P</a>., [(1972) 2
        SCC 80 : 1972 SCC (Cri) 635 : AIR 1972 SC 2077] it was observed that
        the fact that the accused alone was with his wife in the house when
        she was murdered there with "khukhri" and the fact that the
        relations of the accused with her were strained would, in the
        absence of any cogent explanation by him, point to his guilt. <a href="/doc/410114/" id="a_56">In
        Ganeshlal vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, [(1992) 3 SCC 106 : 1993 SCC
        (Cri) 435] the appellant was prosecuted for the murder of his wife
        which took place inside his house. It was observed that when the
        death had occurred in his custody, the appellant is under an
        obligation to give a plausible explanation for the cause of her death
        in his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_57">section 313</a> Cr.P.C. The mere denial of the
        prosecution case coupled with absence of any explanation was held
        to be inconsistent with the innocence of the accused, but consistent
        with the hypothesis that the appellant is a prime accused in the
        commission of murder of his wife. <a href="/doc/152464/" id="a_58">In State of U.P. vs. Dr. Ravindra
        Prakash Mittal</a>, [(1992) 3 SCC 300 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 642 : AIR 1992 SC
        2045] the medical evidence disclosed that the wife died of
        strangulation during late night hours or early morning and her body
        was set on fire after sprinkling kerosene. The defence of the
        husband was that the wife had committed suicide by burning herself
        and that he was not at home at that time. The letters written by the
        wife to her relatives showed that the husband illtreated her and
        their relations were strained and further the evidence showed that
        both of them were in one room in the night. It was held that the
        chain of circumstances was complete and it was the husband who
        committed the murder of his wife by strangulation and accordingly
        Hon'ble Apex Court reversed the judgement of the High Court
        acquitting the accused and convicted him under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_59">section 302</a> IPC. <a href="/doc/346377/" id="a_60">In

        evidence showed that the accused and his wife were seen together
        in the hut at about 9pm and the accused came out in the morning
        through the roof when the hut had caught fire. His explanation was
        that it was a case of accidental fire which resulted in the death of
        his wife and a daughter. The medical evidence showed that the wife
        died due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation and not on account
        of burn injuries. It was held that there cannot be any hesitation to

         come to the conclusion that it was the accused (husband) who was
        the perpetrator of crime."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_58">52.     In view of the above, since the accused was last seen with the

deceased, the burden of proof rests upon him to prove what had

happened after he had sent the children to bring the meals and why

did he not open the door despite their repeated knocking. Since, those

facts were within his personal knowledge, it was incumbent upon him

to give explanation as to how Rehana died but he took a stand of

complete denial of his involvement in the crime and offered no

explanation before the Court. The mere denial of the prosecution case

coupled with absence of any explanation is totally inconsistent with

the innocence of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_59">53.     His conduct in absconding after the incident is another

incriminating piece of evidence against him. It is a matter of record

that the murder of Rehana took place on 22nd December, 2004,

however, he could be arrested only on 4th January, 2010. Although he

has taken a plea that he was not arrested by the police but he himself

has surrendered in the police station but the fact remains that during

the period 22nd December, 2009 till 4th January, 2010, he was

absconding.

division bench of this Court was of the view that the fact that the

accused absconding immediately after the incident was a strong factor

to prove his guilt. <a href="/doc/990399/" id="a_62">In Amrit Lal Someshwara Joshi vs. State of

Maharashtra</a>, AIR 1994 SC 2516, the appellant, who had also

threatened the accused, was found absconding after her death. It was

held that his having threatened the deceased and his absconding

immediately after the death of the deceased by violence, lent very

strong support to the case of the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_62">55.     We may also refer to <a href="/doc/146457083/" id="a_63">Ram @ Ram Dass vs State of Delhi</a>, 2010

VII AD (Delhi) 83, where also the accused was absconding from his

house after murder of his wife and he was not able to give any

plausible explanation for his not being found in the house before he

was arrested by the police. This was one of the circumstance which

went against the accused.

<p id="p_63">56.     Again, in <a href="/doc/789807/" id="a_64">Mangat Rai vs. State of Punjab</a>, (1997) 7 SCC 507

also it was observed that the conduct of the accused in absconding

from the scene of offence for a couple of days till he was ultimately

arrested, which conduct though by itself, might not be conclusive,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                  Page 48 of 53</span>
 becomes a clinching circumstance and point an accusing finger at the

appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_64">57.     In the instant case also, the conduct of the accused in

absconding after the incident is another piece of evidence which goes

against him. No plausible explanation is forthcoming from the side of

the accused regarding his absence from his house from the date of

incident till his arrest.
</p>
<p id="p_65">58.     In view of the above discussion, we reach the inescapable

conclusion that the appellant had adequate motive to eliminate his

wife. In spite of the fact that he had been in the same room and was

last seen by PW1 Sanjay, PW7 Arif and PW8 Raisuddin, he failed to

furnish any explanation as to under what circumstances, his wife was

found dead. Medical evidence proved that it was a homicidal death.

The conduct of the appellant in absconding from the place of incident

also suggests his guilty mind.
</p>
<p id="p_66">59.     Now we advert to the last limb of the argument of learned

counsel for the appellant that without prejudice to her submission that

no case is proved against the appellant, the disclosure statement

pertaining to exculpatory portion has to be appreciated in favour of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                    Page 49 of 53</span>
 the accused and, therefore, at the most, offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_65">Section 304</a> IPC

is made out for which reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/1467585/" id="a_66">Madaiah vs. State</a> by

Yelandur Police, 1992 Crl. LJ 502. Moreover, the appellant was not

laced with any weapon nor he came to the room with pre meditation

of eliminating his wife nor there was any external injuries as such,

offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_67">Section 302</a> IPC is not made out.
</p>
<p id="p_67">60.     This submission is again devoid of merit, inasmuch as, as per

<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_68">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, no part of the confession made by the

accused to a police officer is admissible in evidence. Under <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_69">Section

26</a> of the Evidence Act, the confession made in the presence of a

police officer becomes admissible provided it is made in the presence

of the Magistrate. <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_70">Section 27</a> acts as a proviso which provides that,

that portion of the confession made by the accused while in custody is

admissible in evidence which led to the disclosure of some material

consequent upon the information furnished by the accused. Madaiah

does not help the appellant, inasmuch as, in that case besides the

confessional statement in the shape of disclosure statement made by

the accused, there were other supporting evidence to prove that the

accused acted under grave and sudden provocation and hence




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">Crl. A. No. 832/2011                                   Page 50 of 53</span>
 committed murder, therefore, case was, at best, one of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder. Things are entirely different in

the instant case. A perusal of statement recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_71">Section 313</a>

Cr.P.C. goes to show that the accused has denied making any

disclosure statement Ex.PW18/C to the police. Having once denied

this statement to the police, he cannot take shelter of this statement for

submitting that the exculpatory part of the statement can be read in

favour of the accused. He cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold in

the same breath.
</p>
<p id="p_68">61.     Moreover, assuming for the sake of argument that as per the

case of prosecution, the accused had made the disclosure statement

Ex.PW18/C, even then the same does not help the accused. The

relevant portion of disclosure statement is reproduced as under:-

2009 and he committed her murder on 22nd December, 2009 between

9:00 pm to 10:00 pm. As such, there was sufficient time in between

 to deliberate and ponder over the matter.         As per this disclosure

statement, he had planned to finish his wife and therefore, in a

planned manner he brought her to the rented accommodation at

Chandni Chowk, sent his children out on the pretext of bringing meal

and murdered her by strangulating with a towel. As such, instead of

helping, this disclosure statement goes against the appellant to prove

that he not only intended to kill his wife but in fact killed her by

strangulation. That being so, the authorities Golla Yelugu (supra),
