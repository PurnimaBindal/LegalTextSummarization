</p><p id="p_5">                          5.    This application has been filed by the plaintiff seeking leave of the

                          mediation. It is submitted by Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned senior counsel for

                          claimed in the present suit, the recourse has not been made to pre-institution
                          mediation and so, it is prayed that the exemption may be granted.

<p id="p_6">                          6.    Mr. Rajiv Nayar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
                          defendants No.2 to 4, has relied on the order dated 8th September, 2021 of
                          this Court in CS(COMM) 415/2021 titled <a href="/doc/199539425/" id="a_1">ECL Finance Ltd. v. Tashee
                          Nirman Pct</a>. Ltd. and Ors., to submit that substantial compliance of the
                          provisions was essential and there was no verbal or documentary
                          communication to show that any effort had been made to work out a
                          settlement between the parties. Hence, the learned senior counsel submitted
                          that the suit, being premature, could not be taken up for hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                          7.    In response, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the
                          relief was claimed in respect of a Tournament to be held from 20th January,
                          2022, and nothing could be more urgent and pressing as the suit could be
                          filed only on 15th January, 2022 and therefore, the plaintiff had no occasion
                          to initiate pre-institution mediation in keeping with sub-section (1) of
                          Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Since the suit
                          contemplated extremely urgent relief, the plaintiff could not be asked to
                          approach the Mediation Centre before coming to court.

<p id="p_16">                          14.   Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff
                          had conceptualized an International Cricket League, which had novel

                          teams. The idea was to stage these tournaments in those countries which
                          were not cricket playing countries, but had a large number of Indians living
                          there and whose interest in cricket could be exploited. Learned senior

                          had taken active steps and spent more than Rs.2 crores from his pocket,

                          copyright existed in a work and relying on the judgments in <a href="/doc/5758526/" id="a_5">MRF Limited

                          plaintiff was not original, since the idea had been developed into a
                          recognizable format i.e., of engaging legendary but retired cricketers,
                          dividing them into two teams on geographical basis, and to hold the

                          diaspora, the plaintiff had produced an exclusive work. Learned counsel

                          submitted that the suit as framed was bad for combining multifarious reliefs.
                          He submitted that no contract had been signed between the plaintiff and the
                          defendant No.2 and if there was any breach of contract, it could be only
                          claimed against the defendant No.1. Learned senior counsel submitted that
                          no interim relief could be granted to the plaintiff on the short ground of
                          delay, inasmuch as the suit had been filed only five days before the matches
                          were to be played. Reliance was placed on the judgements of the Co-
                          ordinate Benches of this Court in <a href="/doc/225324/" id="a_8">Kanungo Media (P) Ltd. v. RGV Film

                          v. Eros International Media Limited</a>, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 1298. It was
                          submitted that even as per the case set out in the plaint, the plaintiff had
                          generated his idea in 2017 and the defendant No.2 was roped in as an
                          investor in February, 2018, but not a word has been spoken of what
                          happened in the interregnum. There is no document to show whether the
                          plaintiff had taken any steps. Rather, in July, 2018, three matches were to be
                          held in England (Gloucestershire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire), but
                          plaintiff has not explained whether those matches were ever held, and if
                          they were not held, why they were not held. The plea of Covid-19 pandemic
                          is not convincing as the world was affected with Covid-19 only in 2020.
                          Thus, there was no assertion of his rights by the plaintiff till December,
                          2021, when the Legal Notice was issued. It was further pointed that though
                          the plaintiff claims that he had learnt in November, 2021 through media

                          filed on behalf of the defendants No.2 to 5 at Page No.25, to point out that
                          the announcement of the Legends League Cricket was disclosed on 17 th
                          September, 2021, when defendants No.2 &amp; 3 were described/introduced as
                          its co-founders. It was submitted that the defendant No.2 being a Promoter
                          of IPL team KKR, was no stranger to cricket. It was thus not necessary for
                          him to borrow any idea of league matches in cricket from the plaintiff. Since
                          September, 2021 it had been disclosed that there would be three teams and
                          six league matches in a T-20 format; assignment of T.V. rights had also
                          started as also the appointment of Shri Ravi Shastri, as the Commissioner; a
                          physiotherapist was also brought on board on 14 th October, 2021; and, the
                          legendary actor, Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, was also engaged as the
                          Ambassador for publicity. Thus, there was enough material available in the
                          public domain which indicated that the defendants No.2 to 5 were
                          organising the tournament in January, 2022. As on date, the players who
                          have been contracted to play in the league matches to be held at Oman, had
                          already arrived at Oman; broadcasting rights had been contracted out; the
                          stadium had also been booked; and, at this juncture, the plaintiff had filed
                          the suit only to wrangle some monetary compensation from the defendants.

                          submitted that the T20 format had been first introduced by Martin Crowe in
                          New Zealand in 1997. At that time, each side was permitted two innings of
                          10 overs each. Thus, the idea of the plaintiff to have two innings of 10 overs

                           each was not an original idea. With regard to the engagement of retired
                          legendary cricketers, this was also not a new concept as, way back in 2015,
                          matches were held in the United State of America as „Exhibition Matches‟
                          between two teams; one captained by Sachin Tendulkar, known as
                          &quot;Sachin‟s Blasters&quot; and the other captained by Shane Warne, named as
                          &quot;Warne‟s Warriors&quot;. Further, a 2016-Masters Champions League was held
                          in January and February 2016 at UAE and former cricketers had played in
                          the same. There were 6 teams constituted of 15 retired cricketers each, who
                          were described as &quot;legends&quot;. A Road Safety World Series was to be held in
                          2020 and 2021, where the former cricketers were described as &quot;legends&quot;,
                          but only 4 matches could be held due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus,
                          neither the engagement of retired legendary cricketers nor the hosting of
                          these tournaments in a league format at neutral avenues was new in the
                          cricket arena. Therefore, there was no novelty in the conceptualisation of the
                          plaintiff. The plaintiff could not claim a copyright over any of these ideas
                          which have been in the public domain for years.
</p><p id="p_28">                          26.   Finally, it was submitted that the infringement of a copyright was to
                          be seen in reference to a „completed work‟. But, in the instant case, the
                          plaintiff has no „completed work‟ to show, which, on comparison, could
                          have revealed similarity between the format conceptualised by the plaintiff

                          any case, learned senior counsel for the defendants submitted that whereas
                          the plaintiff‟s idea was to have a Test Match like two innings with 10 overs
                          each, the defendants were holding the Legends League Cricket as a „T-20
                          tournament‟ with 20 overs and one innings each. Further, whereas the
                          plaintiff had intended holding of the matches in Canada, UAE and England,

                           the defendants were organising the tournaments at Oman (UAE). It was
                          submitted that in UAE, a company called Ten Sports Management had
                          issued a notice dated 16th March, 2018 to the plaintiff/defendant No.1,
                          claiming an exclusive right to hold matches in the Middle-East. According
                          to the learned senior counsel for the defendants, this document was wilfully
                          suppressed by the plaintiff as it would show that the plaintiff had no right to
                          host any cricket match in the Middle-East. It was also submitted that the
                          suppression of this material document was also sufficient to deny interim
                          relief to the plaintiff.

                          senior counsel for the plaintiff were distinguishable on facts, as in all those
                          cases, the concept notes/work had registered copyright, whereas that was
                          not the case here. It was thus submitted that the plaintiff has not disclosed a
                          prima facie case or „balance of convenience‟ or „irreparable loss and injury‟,
                          on the basis of which he could claim any relief. Relying on the judgement of

                           only pre-contractual negotiations and nothing had come out of it. The
                          company was formed but neither was any contract drawn up with the
                          players, (as it was only a proposed „Player Agreement‟ that was forwarded
                          to the defendant No.2 for his inputs) or were any agreements signed for
                          media coverage, nor had any payments been made, which was not the
                          situation qua the defendant No.5. If at all, some document had been signed
                          by Mr. Nehra, the discussions for variations of the terms happened
                          subsequent thereto. Thus, clearly there was no concluded contract even with
                          Mr. Nehra. According to the learned senior counsel, the WhatsApp
                          messages themselves reveal that everything had fallen apart before any
                          agreement could be reached. The WhatsApp messages would also show that
                          though the matches in England were to be held in the month of July, 2018
                          even in June, 2018, nothing had firmed up, while the plaintiff underscored
                          that time was of essence. Thereafter, there had been no correspondence or
                          even WhatsApp messages in this WhatsApp group of the plaintiff,
                          defendant No.1 and defendant No.2, which was formed specifically for
                          organising the „Legend Premier League‟, in relation to the matches that
                          were to be held in July, 2018. No such mention was made even on 2nd
                          August, 2018 by the plaintiff to defendant No. 2 through WhatsApp. On 6th
                          August, 2018, some video was sent by the plaintiff and there was only good-
                          humoured interaction. Thus, not even till 14th August, 2018, was any
                          business venture firmed up. Subsequently, a new WhatsApp group was
                          formed between defendants No.1, 2 and 3. The very fact that defendant
                          No.1 had shared old mails and WhatsApp messages with the plaintiff
                          discloses that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 were acting collusively. The

                          the plaintiff has „acquiesced‟ in the activities of the defendant No.5. The
                          belated action of filing the suit was malafide and no interim injunction could

                          has also cautioned that no new rights ought to be created to widen the scope
                          of protection on the ground of confidentiality. In any case, there could be no
                          confidentiality if the nature of communication was I itself not confidential in
                          nature, as was in the present case, since all aspects of the so-called idea of

                          executing the idea. Thus, the defendant No.2 had clearly sought to
                          misappropriate the property of the plaintiff, that is the right in the concept of
                          holding a cricket league with retired international cricket legends. It was

                          case, was responsible for that situation, because of his dishonest action of
                          misappropriating the property of the plaintiff to conduct the tournament,
                          such third-party interests were inconsequential.

                          and the defendants knowingly and wrongfully infringed the rights of the

                          adopted by the defendants No. 2 to 5 was materially the same, of engaging
                          retired but reputed cricketers in a limited overs match to be played at a
                          neutral venue. Since the defendants had played a fraud on the plaintiff,

</p><p id="p_36">                          33.   It is trite that while dealing with an application seeking interim
                          injunction, the plaintiff must disclose a prima facie case in his favour. The
                          „balance of convenience‟ must be in his favour, as also the fact that the
                          absence of interim injunction would cause „irreparable loss and injury‟ to
                          the plaintiff. Of course, an injunction may have to be also considered in the
                          context of „public interest‟, as held in The Chancellor, Master and
                          Scholars of the University of Oxford (supra). It is also no doubt true that

                           the conduct of the party seeking injunction is also important, including
                          whether he acted with alacrity or slept over his right.
</p>
<p id="p_37">                          34.   In the present case, the plaintiff seeks to assert a statutory right under
                          the Act in respect of what he states is his conception of a competitive cricket
                          league, where retired international cricketers were to play at neutral venues.
                          The first question is then, whether there is a „work‟ within the meaning of
                          the Act, in respect of which the plaintiff can assert copyright. A „work‟
                          within the meaning of the Act has been defined as: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                       &quot;(y) &quot;work&quot; means any of the following works, namely:--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                              (i) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                              (ii) a cinematograph film;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                              (iii) a sound recording;&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_38">                                Clearly, the concept claimed by the plaintiff, as his original idea, does
                          not fall in any of these definitions. Thoughts, without being expressed in a
                          material form, in print or writing, would not constitute a &quot;literary work&quot;.
                          The argument on behalf of the plaintiff was, no doubt, that when the concept
                          was exchanged by the plaintiff through emails to the defendants, the „work‟
                          had taken a concrete form and therefore, the defendants No.2 to 5 could not
                          have forged his idea to use it as a „spring-board‟ by them for their
                          commercial advantage.
</p>

                           introduced way back in 1997 in New Zealand. Retired cricketers have been
                          playing matches all around the world and therefore, that too, is not an
                          original idea of the plaintiff as is evident from Pages 1-19 of the
                          Defendants‟ Documents. Test matches have also been held in countries that
                          do not play cricket. The participation of the Indian diaspora in various
                          cricket venues, particularly, the Middle-East, is also common knowledge.
                          Thus, none of the features of the concept of the plaintiff reflect original
                          thought. Learned senior counsel for the defendants No.2 to 5 rightly pointed
                          out that since each of these ideas have been in „public domain‟ for long i.e.,
                          since its conceptualisation in 1997, 2015 and so on, none can claim
                          exclusive right to any of these ideas. League matches were held in 2015.
                          IPL has been in existence since 2007. The matches in which retired
                          legendary cricketers have played for various reasons, including public
                          causes, have been ongoing for long. To say that because the plaintiff
                          conceptualized a league match with retired cricketers in a „T-10 Test
                          Format‟ to be played at venues where there is Indian diaspora, and that
                          being his idea, had become his exclusive right, is to stretch it too far to
                          claim a right to seek an injunction against the „Legends League Cricket‟
                          tournament organized by the defendants. As rightly pointed out by the
                          learned senior counsel for the defendants No.2 to 5, their format is of three
                          teams being &quot;India Maharajas&quot;, &quot;Asia Lions&quot; and &quot;Rest of the World&quot;
                          unlike the two teams of the plaintiff i.e., &quot;Asia XI&quot; and &quot;World XI&quot;. The
                          plaintiff cannot have an exclusive right to naming of teams with &quot;Asia&quot; or
                          &quot;World&quot;. The cricketers cannot be injuncted from playing for the defendants
                          or for any other organizer, as the plaintiff can claim no such exclusive right.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                     2. Where the same idea is being developed in a different
                                  manner, it is manifest that the source being common,
                                  similarities are bound to occur. In such a case the courts
                                  should determine whether or not the similarities are on

                          and no one can claim a copyright to the „game of cricket‟. Several
                          permutations and combinations in the format of playing the „game of
                          cricket‟ have been evolved over a period of centuries. Therefore, it is
                          reasonable that there can also be no copyright in the evolution of cricket
                          over a period of time, from a „5-Day Test Match Series‟, to the latest of
                          „T-20 Matches/One-Dayers‟. Any such permutations and combinations
                          would involve &quot;innings&quot; and &quot;overs&quot;. It would also involve selection of
                          venue and the duration and length of the matches. Finally, the players are
                          always selected for playing in particular matches. Though it is the
                          contention of the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 that novelty was
                          not essential for copyright, when the substratum is so fundamentally fixed, it
                          would be novelty alone which can be protected. Unfortunately, the plaintiff
                          has not succeeded in showing that his concept had any novelty about it.
                          Every aspect of his idea is well known and adapted and adopted before.

                          learned senior counsel for the defendant No.5, that confidentiality would
                          also be with reference to the nature of information being shared. Perhaps,
                          when the plaintiff expressed his intention to organize a tournament, in
                          which retired, but well-known cricketers, would participate, and to
                          constitute a company in order to organize these cricket matches, the
                          information would have been confidential, so that no one would jettison his
                          efforts. But, such sharing of intent and information of action taken and
                          contemporaneous discussions cannot have the effect of prohibiting the
                          defendant No.2, for all times to come, from organizing league matches,
                          especially when he is stated to have been and continues to be involved in the
                          organization and sponsorship of KKR in IPL matches. To conclude so,
                          would be violative of the fundamental rights of the defendants, as urged by
                          learned senior counsel for defendant No.5. The claim of a right in
                          confidentiality fails also in the light of the fact that the plaintiff did not
                          choose to follow up with the defendants No.1 &amp; 2 between August, 2018
                          and the entire 2019, to move forward with his proposal. Confidentiality as
                          asserted, cannot be permitted to continue indefinitely.
</p>
<p id="p_54">                          41.   Thus, the plaintiff has failed to disclose a prima facie case either on
                          the basis of rights in copyright or confidentiality or implied contract.
</p>
<p id="p_55">                          42.   The plaintiff has approached the court with much delay. In the
                          judgments relied upon by learned senior counsel for the plaintiff, the delay
                          was not considered fatal only on account of the nature of rights claimed

                          sale of the offending goods. In the present case, that is not the situation. The
                          decisions have to be considered in the context of facts. In CCE v. Alnoori
                          Tobacco Products, (2004) 6 SCC 186, Justice Arijit Pasayat, has put it
                          succinctly in the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                         &quot;11. Courts should not place reliance on decisions
                                  without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in
                                  with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is
                                  placed. Observations of courts are neither to be read as
                                  Euclid&#x27;s theorems nor as provisions of a statute and that
                                  too taken out of their context. These observations must be
                                  read in the context in which they appear to have been
                                  stated. Judgments of courts are not to be construed as
                                  statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a
                                  statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark on
                                  lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain
                                  and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not
                                  interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their
                                  words are not to be interpreted as statutes....&quot;

<p id="p_56">                          43.   It must be seen, therefore, whether the plaintiff has explained his
                          lethargy in approaching the court. As noticed above, the plaintiff and the
                          defendant No.1 and the defendant No.2 claimed to have come together to
                          organize matches in cricket in 2018. They appear closely connected with
                          sports, and the different matches that are being organized all over the world
                          would certainly be within their ken. To state vaguely that the plaintiff had
                          learnt about the activities of the defendants No.2 to 5 only in November,
                          2021, is a difficult pill to swallow. When the defendant No.1 claims that he

                           WhatsApp group was created in April, 2021 and at the same time, he claims
                          that he was much concerned with the exclusion of the plaintiff, it stands to
                          reason that the information would have been shared with the plaintiff, not
                          just when in response to a Legal Notice, he did so in December, 2021. A
                          person truly concerned with the success of his idea would have, in the first
                          place, followed up with his &quot;stakeholders&quot; on a continual basis, but the
                          plaintiff is seen as a person who seems to have gone into deep slumber, after
                          early August, 2018. It is significant to note that there were three matches
                          that were to be organized in July, 2018 in England (Gloucestershire,
                          Derbyshire and Leicestershire), but the plaintiff has made no disclosure as
                          to what had happened to those matches. If those matches could not be held,
                          then there must have been a reason for it. The plaintiff has not disclosed the
                          reason. It would appear that the failure to conduct the matches in July, 2018,
                          may have discouraged the plaintiff from moving forward with his idea. Had
                          the plaintiff been still keen to organize the matches, he would have
                          continued to remain in touch with his &quot;stakeholders&quot; to ensure that the
                          matches could be conducted. While Covid-19 has ravaged the world in 2020
                          and 2021, 2019 was as normal as it could get, and it would not have been
                          difficult for the plaintiff to have disclosed to this court as to what efforts had
                          been made to organize matches after July, 2018, to show that his interest in
                          his own idea was alive and kicking. If he failed to follow up and woke up
                          only in 2021, after the defendants had entered into contractual obligations
                          with third parties, the intentions appear to be suspect.

                          the plaintiff, if no injunction is granted, with the injury that the defendants
                          may be subjected to, if the injunction is granted and the plaintiff was to fail

                           after the trial, it is clear that by approaching the court at the nick of the
                          moment, the plaintiff has attempted to cause greater harm to the defendants
                          No.2 to 5, than benefit to himself. The entire purpose of conducting matches
                          is to obtain monetary benefit. Thus, if the matches are not held, while the
                          defendants, the players, the sponsors, the media partners and the public at
                          large, would be subjected to loss, that cannot be compensated, in case the
                          plaintiff lost after trial, on the other hand, in case the plaintiff was to
                          succeed in the suit, if the matches were held, the interest of the plaintiff
                          could still be protected by awarding him compensation at the end of a
                          successful trial. The „balance of convenience‟, therefore, lies in favour of
                          defendants No.2 to 5.
</p>
<p id="p_58">                          45.   These very facts also reflect that in case the matches are not held,
                          „irreparable loss and injury‟ would be caused to the defendants No.2 to 5 as
                          also the public interest, whereas the loss, that may befall the plaintiff, could
                          ultimately be compensated.

<p id="p_59">                          46.   In the light of the discussion hereinabove, the applications
                          [I.A.875/2022 and I.A.876/2022] are dismissed. However, the defendants
                          No.2 to 5 are directed to maintain clear accounts of their earnings and

                          of the league matches. Accordingly, I.A.878/2022 also stands disposed of.
