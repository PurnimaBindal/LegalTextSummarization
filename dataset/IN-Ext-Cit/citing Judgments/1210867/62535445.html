                      In all these writ petitions, the petitioners have

           sought common relief and, therefore, they are being

           decided by this common order.

<p id="p_2">                      Facts of the case, necessary for disposal of all

           these writ petitions, are    being taken from       SBCWP

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>


Ajmer   issued     an    advertisement        dated   06.01.1999

(Annexure-P/1), inviting applications (from 25 Districts of

Rajasthan) from eligible candidates for the post of Patwari

under the provisions of Rajasthan Land (Land Records)

Rules, 1957 (for short 'the Rules of 1957' hereinafter).

The petitioners, being eligible, applied         for the post of

Patwari and in pursuance of the advertisement, they were

called for appearing in written test conducted on 8th and

9th May, 1999, result thereof was declared on 10th August,

1999 and the petitioners were declared successful.

</p><p id="p_3">              In   the    meantime,      on    23.07.1999,   the

Registrar, Board of Revenue wrote a letter to the Deputy

Secretary,     Revenue       Department,       Government     of

Rajasthan that the result of Patwar Examination, held in

pursuance of the advertisement dated 06.01.1999, is

expected shortly and the selected candidates are required

to send for Patwar Training but as the State Government

has informed the Board of Revenue that the training

course of selected Patwaris should not be started before

getting the permission        from the Finance Department,

thus,   the   permission     from   Finance     Department    be

accorded so that the training of the selected Patwaris be

started immediately after 15th August, 1999.           It is also

mentioned in the order that the training of the selected

candidates is necessary in the interest of the Government

as the work will suffer if the Patwaris are not posted.

</p><p id="p_4">           On 17.07.2000, the Director and Special

Secretary, Panchayati Raj Department, Government of

Rajasthan, Jaipur issued letters to the Vikas Adhikaris of

the Panchayat Samities,       informing that the State

Government took a decision to appoint all the successful

candidates of Patwar Examination, 1999 on the post of

Gram Sewak purely on temporary basis on a fixed salary

of Rs.1200/- per month after giving relaxation in the

Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Rules, 1996, (for short 'the

Rules of 1996' hereinafter) pertaining to appointment of

Gram Sewak-cum-Secretary and directions were given to

give appointments to those candidates as per the decision

of State Government. In the letter dated 17.07.2000, it is

mentioned that the sanction for appointing the successful

candidates of Patwar Examination, 1999     on the post of

Gram Sewak is in accordance with the concurrence given

by the Personnel Department as well as the Finance

Department of the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           In pursuance of the letter dated 17.07.2000,

all the petitioners were provided appointments purely on

temporary basis, on the post of Gram Sewak on a fixed

salary of Rs.1200/- in different Panchayat Samities of the

State of Rajasthan.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           On 27.03.2002, the Secretary to the Revenue

Department issued a letter to the Registrar, Board of

Revenue and gave directions to send all the successful
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span>


candidates of the Patwar Examination, 1999 for training,

who were working as Gram Sewak on consolidated salary

with the different Panchayat Samities.                The Director,

Panchayati Raj Department, Government of Rajasthan,

Jaipur issued a letter dated 17.06.2002 to all the Chief

Executive Officers of the Zila Parishads and the Vikas

Adhikaris of Panchayat Samities and directed them to

relieve all those candidates, who are working as Gram

Sewak on consolidated salary for allowing them to give

their   presence   in   the       Patwar   Training    Centres   on

01.07.2002. In pursuance of the directions given by the

Director, Panchayati Raj Department on 17.06.2002, all

the petitioners were relieved for joining the training at the

Patwar Training Centres. The petitioners, in pursuance of

that, had joined the training at the Patwar Training

Centres and after completion of their trainings, they were

allotted posting vide order dated 28.04.2003 as Patwari.

Since their postings as Patwari, the petitioners are getting

their salaries in the pay scale 3050-4590 prescribed for

the Patwari under the Rules of 1957.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            The petitioners have filed these writ petitions

while claiming that they are entitled for the salary of the

Gram Sewak prescribed in the Rules of 1996 for the

period they worked on the post of Gram Sewak-cum-

Secretary of the Gram Panchayat and their services are

also liable to be reckoned for all purposes from the date
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>


when they were initially appointed on the post of Gram

Sewaks. Alternatively, it is prayed by the petitioners that

if they are not entitled for the salary of Gram Sewak for

the period they had worked as Gram Sewak, then at least

they are entitled for the salary of the Patwari as

prescribed in the Rules of 1957 as they have been

selected   for      the   said   post   through   competitive

examination.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            A reply to the writ petition has been filed on

behalf of the State Government and the claim of the

petitioners is denied and it is contended that the

petitioners are not entitled for salary of Patwaris as

prescribed under the Rules of 1957 for the period they

have worked as Gram Sewaks purely on temporary basis

on fixed salary as the entitlement of the petitioners for

appointment on the post of Patwari could only be attained

after getting the prescribed training and after obtaining a

Patwar School Certificate as per the provisions of Rule 4

</p><p id="p_9">(b) of the Rules of 1957. It is also contended that since

the   petitioners     have   obtained   the   Patwar   School

Certificate only in the year 2003, they were appointed as

Patwari thereafter, and are getting the salaries in the pay

scale prescribed under the Rules of 1957. It has also been

contended on behalf of the respondents in the reply that

since the petitioners were never selected for the post of

Gram Sewak on regular basis and were appointed purely
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                          7</span>


on temporary basis on a fixed salary on the post of Gram

Sewak against the posts of Gram Sewaks Community

facilitates and in the Lok Jumbish project, so, they were

not entitled for salary of the Gram Sewak in the pay scale

as prescribed under the Rules concerned.       The State

Government has also contended that as the surplus

employees (Amins) from Land Records Department and

the surplus Patwaris from the Irrigation Department were

sent for training in the Patwar Training Centres, the

selected candidates of the Patwar Examination, 1999

could not be provided training during that period and in

the intermediate period, on a representation made by the

Association of selected candidates of Patwar Examination,

1999, the State Government in a high level meeting

presided over by the then Hon'ble the Chief Minister

(Annexure-R/2)    has    decided   to   give   temporary

appointments to the petitioners on the post of Gram

Sewak on consolidated salary    and the petitioners have

accepted the same without any objection. In such

circumstances, now the petitioners cannot claim the

salary in the pay scale of Gram Sewak or Patwari for the

period when they have worked as Gram Sewak because

the State Government has made the said arrangements

while taking a benevolent view on the request of the

petitioners themselves. Therefore, the learned counsel for

the State Government has prayed for dismissal of the writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8</span>


petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              Learned Senior Counsel - Mr P.P.Choudhary,

while arguing the writ petitions, has contended that the

action of the State Government of providing appointments

to the candidates selected in the Patwar Competitive

Examination, 1999, on the post of Gram Sewak was

nothing but posting the selected candidates on deputation

in other department. It has also been contended that if

the State Government had taken a decision to send the

petitioners for posting in the department other than the

parent department, then the petitioners are entitled for

the salary of the said post on which they were selected

or the salary of the post on which they have been sent on

deputation. It has been contended that the action of the

State Government of non-payment of salary to the

petitioners in a regular pay scale either of the post of

Gram Sewak or the post of the Patwari, from the date of

their initial appointments is unjust, unreasonable and

violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. It has

further been contended by the learned counsel for the

petitioners    that    the       petitioners    were   Government

employees before joining the training at the Patwar

Training Centre for the post of Patwari and they have

completed     the     training       while     remaining   in   the

Government service, therefore, they are entitled for

salary as provided either under the Rules of 1957 for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             9</span>


post of Patwari or under the Rules of 1996 for the post of

Gram Sewak. The learned counsel for the petitioners has

further    contended    that     the   action     of    the    State

Government of appointing the petitioners on the post of

Gram Sewak without paying them the regular salary in

regular pay scale was nothing but taking Begar from the

petitioners. It has further been contended that the State

being a model employer and cannot take any Begar from

its employees without paying them their due salary and,

therefore, it is a fit case where a direction should be given

to the respondents either to provide them regular salary

of the Gram Sewak or of the Patwari for the period when

they had worked on the post of Gram Sewak as per the

orders of the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             The learned counsel for the petitioners has

invited attention of this Court towards the advertisement

(Annexure-P/1) dated 06.01.1999 and argued that in the

advertisement, it has nowhere been mentioned that on

being     selected,   the   petitioners    will    be      provided

appointments      purely    on    temporary        basis      on   a

consolidated salary and, therefore,       it was not open for

the State Government to give appointment to the

petitioners purely on temporary basis on a consolidated

salary and the petitioners were entitled for salary under

the regular pay scale of the post of Patwari as mentioned

in the advertisement.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             10</span><p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">              The learned counsel for the petitioners has

further contended that the petitioners were selected for

the post of Patwari in the Patwar Examination, 1999 but

were not provided posting on the post of Patwari and

were appointed on the post of Gram Sewak in the year

2000 for an intermediate period and finally appointed on

the post of Patwari only in the month of April/May, 2003.

However, the petitioners were not provided the benefit of

service period wherein they had worked as Gram Sewak

and their services have only been reckoned from the date

when they joined on the post of Patwari but since the

petitioners were duly recruited and selected in the year

1999 itself, therefore, their services are entitled to be

reckoned with effect from the date of their initial

appointment on the post of Gram Sewak.              It is not

permissible for the respondents to reckon the services of

the petitioners only with effect from the date when the

petitioners were posted on the post of Patwari and such

an   action    of   the   State   Government   is   arbitrary,

discriminatory and illegal and is liable to be quashed and

set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              The learned counsel for the petitioners has

relied upon a decision of Division Bench of this Court in

<a href="/doc/1508075/" id="a_12">Prashant Vohra &amp; Anr. vs. State of Rajasthan &amp;

Ors</a>., reported in WLC (Raj.) 2005(1) 264, wherein this

Court has taken a view that the candidates selected on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            11</span>


the post of Gram Sewak are entitled for regular salary in

the pay scale of Gram Sewak and the action of the State

Government of providing fixed salary for initial period has

not been approved. This Court, while allowing the appeal,

has ordered for granting benefit or seniority to the Gram

Sewaks from the date of initial appointment but declined

to order for paying regular pay scale for the period, the

Gram Sewaks were paid consolidated salary.

</p><p id="p_15">            The learned counsel for the petitioners Mr P.P.

Choudhary has argued that he is relying on the principle

laid down in the above referred judgment that a person is

entitled for salary in regular pay scale of post for which he

has been selected and the action of the State Government

of providing consolidated salary cannot be approved but

asserted that in this batch of writ petitions, the petitioners

are not giving up their claim for salary in regular pay

scale for the period they have worked on the post of

Gram Sewak on a consolidated salary and prayed that

applying the same principle, the respondents may be

directed to provide the salary to the petitioners under the

regular pay scale of the post of Gram Sewak or Patwari

and a direction may be issued to reckon the services of

the petitioners from the date when they were initially

appointed on the post of Gram Sewak.
</p>
<p id="p_16">            The learned counsel for the petitioners has,

therefore, prayed that these writ petitions preferred by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               12</span>


the   petitioners    may      kindly    be      allowed    and    the

respondents may kindly be directed to give the salary to

the petitioner either in the pay scale of Gram Sewak or in

the pay scale of Patwari for the period when they had

worked on the post of Gram Sewak with the Panchayati

Raj   Department      and     their   services    should   also   be

reckoned from the date when they were appointed on the

post of Gram Sewak in pursuance of the order dated

17.02.2000 passed by the Director, Panchayati Raj

Department.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            Per     contra,    the    learned    counsel    for   the

respondent-State has argued that the writ petitions have

been preferred by the petitioners with a delay of about 5,

6 and 8 years and, therefore, the petitioners are not

entitled to get any relief on the ground of delay only. It

has further been contended on behalf of the respondent-

State that the petitioners are not entitled for the pay

scale of the Patwari for the period when they had worked

on the post of Gram Sewak purely on temporary basis

because during the said period, the petitioners did not

obtain Patwar School Certificate, which is mandatory for

the appointment on the post of Patwari as per the

provisions of Rule 4(b) of the Rules of 1957. It has also

been contended that the petitioners have obtained the

Patwar Training Certificate only in the year 2003 and from

that date, the regular salary to the petitioners is being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                             13</span>


given by the respondents in prescribed pay scale. It has

also been contended that the petitioners are also not

entitled to get the salary under the regular pay scale of

the Gram Sewak for the period when they had worked as

Gram Sewak because the petitioners have never been

selected for the post of Gram Sewak as per the procedure

prescribed under the Rules of 1996 and the appointments

of the petitioners on the post of Gram Sewak were

neither as per the procedure prescribed under the Rules

of 1996 nor the petitioners were provided appointments

on the post of Gram Sewak on regular basis.              It has

further been argued by the learned counsel for the

respondent-State that the appointments to the petitioners

on the post of Gram Sewak were accorded purely on

temporary basis on a consolidated salary on the request

of the petitioners themselves and, therefore, now it is not

open for the petitioners to claim salary for the post of

Gram Sewak or the Patwari under the concerned Pay

Scale Rules. It has further been contended that on

account of availability of surplus employees from the Land

Records Department and the Irrigation Department, it

was not possible for the State Government to send the

candidates selected in the Patwar Examination, 1999 for

training in the different        Patwar Training Centres and

during   the   said   intermediate       period,   the    State

Government had made this stopgap arrangements on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   14</span>


request of the petitioners only and the petitioners without

any objection has accepted the same and, therefore, it is

not open for the petitioners to claim the regular salary of

the Gram Sewak or Patwari for the period they had

worked on the post of Gram Sewak. The learned counsel

for the respondent-State has, therefore, prayed for

dismissal of the writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                 This Court has considered the submissions

made on behalf of the rival parties and perused the

material on record.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                 It is not in dispute that the petitioners were

selected     for    the    post        of     Patwari   in    the    Patwar

Examination, 1999. It is also not in dispute that even

after their selection, the petitioners were not sent for

training    in     the    Patwar       Training    Centres,        which   is

mandatory for providing appointment on the post of

Patwari as per the provisions of Rule 4(b) of the Rules of

1957.      Vide    order    dated           17.07.2000,      the    Director,

Panchayati Raj Department has ordered for appointing

the selected candidates of Patwar Examination, 1999 as

Gram Sewak purely on temporary basis on a consolidated

salary of Rs.1200/-.         The petitioners have joined their

duties on the post of Gram Sewak in pursuance of the

directions dated 17.07.2000 issued by the Panchayti Raj

</p><pre id="pre_2">      "Equal pay for          equal        work     is      a

      depend         upon the nature of the work

      the responsibilities make                a difference.
      Often the difference is a matter of
      degree and there is an element of value

       selection in accordance with                   rules

       the respondents'          recruitment was not

<p id="p_29">      In      view      of      the      aforesaid      authoritative

pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and in the

absence of any material regarding duties discharged and

responsibilities of the petitioners while working as Gram

Sewak, no definite finding can be given in this respect

and, therefore, no relief can be granted to the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_30">      It is very strange that the State Government has

provided appointment to the petitioners on the post of

Gram Sewak, though the petitioners have never applied

for the said post, while relaxing the procedure prescribed

under the Rules of 1996 for providing appointment on the

post of Gram Sewak but as per the State Government,

the same arrangement was made on the request of the

petitioners themselves and the said claim of the State

Government has not been disputed by the petitioners.

The appointments of the petitioners on the post of Gram

Sewak were given with a clear understanding that as and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                            20</span>


when the State Government         would be in a position to

send them for training for the post of the Patwari for

which they have been selected, their appointments on the

post of Gram Sewak would come to an end. Though, this

Court has doubts about the validity of the action of the

State Government of providing appointments to the

petitioners on the post of Gram Sewak while relaxing the

Rules of 1996 but since the petitioners have not objected

to the same and have accepted the said appointments,

the action of the State Government cannot be questioned

at this stage.

<a href="/doc/1508075/" id="a_18">Prashant Vohra &amp; Anr. vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors</a>.

(supra), also does not help to the petitioners because in

the said case, the persons had applied for the post of

Gram Sewak and were provided appointments on the post

of Gram Sewak after regular selection but were paid

consolidated salary for a fixed period, though there was

no such mention in the advertisement and there was no

provision to this effect in the rules.
</p>
<p id="p_32">            In the case in hand, the petitioners were

never applied for appointment on the post of Gram Sewak

and they have also not been selected for the post of Gram

Sewak in a regular selection but provided appointment on

the said post for intermediate period up to sending them

for training for the post of Patwari for   which they have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                    21</span>


been selected, with a clear understanding and stipulation

in the appointment order that the appointments are

purely     on    temporary          basis      and     they    will     get   a

consolidated salary.              Hence, there is no question of

paying salary to the petitioners under the regular pay

scale of Gram Sewak for the period they have worked

temporarily on the said post.                 The petitioners are either

not entitled for salary in regular pay scale of Patwari for

the period they had worked as Gram Sewak because they

acquired qualification for appointment on the said post

only after getting the training at Patwar Training Centre

as per Rule 4(b) of the Rules of 1957. Even in the case

rendered in <a href="/doc/1508075/" id="a_19">Prashant Vohra &amp; Anr. vs. State of
