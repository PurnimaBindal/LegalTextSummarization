quashment of the charge-sheet dated 4.3.2011 presented against the

petitioner in the court of Special Judge (CBI Court), Chandigarh as

also the order of the Special Judge dated 18.4.2011 taking

</p><p id="p_2">2.     The petitioner is a former Judge of this Court who was later

transferred to the High Court of Uttrakhand. An FIR No.250 of 2008

was registered at Police Station, Sector 11, Chandigarh under

<a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_3">Sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_4">12</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988

complaint of one Amrik Singh, Peon of Hon'ble Ms. Justice Nirmaljit

Kaur against      Shri Sanjeev Bansal, an Advocate practising at

Chandigarh, Shri Ravinder Singh resident of Delhi, Shri Rajiv Gupta,

resident of Panchkula, Shri Nirmal Singh, resident of Panchkula and

Justice Mrs. Nirmal Yadav, the then Judge of Punjab and Haryana

High Court, petitioner herein. Initially, the case was investigated by

the Chandigarh Police, however, the case was transferred to CBI,

pursuant to a DO letter dated 26.8.2008 from the then Governor of

Punjab and Administrator of UT, Chandigarh.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    The CBI conducted the investigation in the matter. During the

course of investigation, the CBI claims to have collected material and

evidence against the accused persons. Since the matter pertains to

allegations against a sitting High Court Judge, the then Hon'ble

Chief Justice of India, constituted a three members committee

comprising of       Hon'ble Mr.Justice H.L.Gokhale, the then Chief

Justice of Allahabad High Court, presently Judge of Hon'ble

Supreme Court, Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan, the then Chief Justice

of Gujarat High Court, presently, Judge of Hon'ble Supreme Court

and Justice Madan B.Lokur, the then Judge of Delhi High Court,

presently Chief Justice Gauhati High Court      in terms of In-House

procedure adopted by Hon'ble Supreme Court on 7.5.1997. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                3</span>

order dated 25.8.2008 constituting the Committee also contains the

terms of reference of the Committee. The Committee was asked to

enquire into the allegations     against Justice Mrs. Nirmal Yadav,

Judge of Punjab and Haryana High Court revealed, during the course

of investigation in the case registered vide FIR No.250 of 2008 dated

16.8.2008 at Police Station, Sector 11, Chandigarh and later

transferred to CBI. The Committee during the course of its enquiry

examined the witnesses and recorded the statements of as many as

19 witnesses, including Mrs.Justice Nirmal Yadav (petitioner), Ms.

Justice Nirmaljit Kaur, Sanjiv Bansal, the other accused named in

the FIR and various other witnesses. The Committee also examined

various documents, including data of phone calls exchanged

between Mrs. Justice Nirmal yadav and Mr.Ravinder Singh and his

wife Mohinder Kaur, Mr.Sanjiv Bansal and Mr.Ravinder Singh,

Mr.Rajiv Gupta and Mr. Sanjiv Bansal. On the basis of evidence and

material before it, the Committee of Hon'ble Judges has drawn an

inference that the money delivered at the residence of Hon'ble

Ms.Justice Nirmaljit Kaur was in fact meant for Ms.Justice Nirmal

Yadav.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    Report of Committee of Judges was served upon the petitioner

for her response by Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. The petitioner

submitted her response vide letters dated 27/30 January, 2009 and

June, 2009. The petitioner has also placed on record two more

enquiry reports one conducted by the Government of Himachal

Pradesh in respect of purchase of land by petitioner, alongwith

Ravinder Singh, accused and various other persons at Solen. In this

enquiry, it was concluded that no procedural irregularity was

committed at any level for according permission by the Government

of Himachal Pradesh for purchase of land by Mrs. Justice Nirmal

Yadav and others nor there was any evasion of the stamp duty and

registration fee. It was also found that the land purchased was also

within the limits prescribed under the rules. The second report dated

11.11.2008 is by Income Tax Department in respect of valuation of

the land purchased by Mrs.Justice Nirmal Yadav and others and

again no irregularity or under valuation was found.

</p><p id="p_5">5.     The CBI on completion of the investigation filed a closure

report no.4/2009 dated 17.12.2009 before the learned Special Judge

(CBI Court), Chandigarh. It may be relevant to note that the CBI

concluded that the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_10">Section 12</a> of the PC

Act is established against Ravinder Singh, Sanjiv Bansal and Rajiv

Gupta whereas offence under <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_11">Section 11</a> of the PC Act is established

against Mrs.Justice Nirmal Yadav whereas offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_12">Section 120-B</a> of the IPC read with <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_13">Sections 193</a>, <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_14">192</a>, <a href="/doc/814524/" id="a_15">196</a>, <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_16">199</a> and

<a href="/doc/943588/" id="a_17">200</a> IPC is also established against Shri Sanjiv Bansal, Rajiv Gupta

and Mrs.Justice Nirmal yadav. The only reason for filing the closure

report by the CBI was declining of sanction for prosecution. The

relevant averments made in the closure report in this regard are

reproduced here under:-

<p id="p_7">7.     On the basis of the aforesaid communication, CBI concluded

that the sanction for prosecution has been declined.

</p><p id="p_8">8.      Closure report was examined by the Special Judge (CBI

Court), Chandigarh. On examination, the Special Judge refused to

accept the closure report vide his detail order dated 26.3.2010 and

directed the CBI to conduct further investigation. CBI carried out

further investigation in due deference to the order of the Special

Judge and approached the competent authority for grant of sanction

for prosecution. The competent authority i.e. the President of India

vide order dated 1.3.2011 granted sanction for prosecution of

Mrs.Justice Nirmal yadav under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_26">Section 19</a> of PC Act                   for

commission of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_27">Section 11</a> of the PC Act

and other offences. As a consequence of the sanction for

prosecution, a charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_28">Section 120-B</a> of the IPC,

<a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_29">Sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_30">12</a> of PC Act read with <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_31">Sections 192</a>, <a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_32">193</a>, <a href="/doc/814524/" id="a_33">196</a>, <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_34">199</a>

and <a href="/doc/943588/" id="a_35">200</a> of the IPC has been presented in the court of Special Judge

(CBI Court), Chandigarh.                The learned Special Judge took

cognizance of the charge-sheet by passing order dated 18.4.2011

and summoned the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.    The petitioner accordingly filed this petition challenging the

sanction order, charge-sheet and the proceedings initiated against

her, including the order of taking cognizance        by the Special Judge

(CBI Court), Chandigarh before this Court. Though there are some
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                    7</span>

averments in the petition alleging       extraneous reasons against

unnamed Judges, however, the principal ground for challenging the

sanction order and the consequential proceedings is on the question

of review of sanction by the competent authority. It is contended by

Shri KTS Tulsi, learned Sr. Advocate appearing on behalf of the

petitioner    that earlier sanction was declined by the then          Chief

Justice of India, Justice Bala Krishnan and the present incumbent in

office has     reviewed the earlier decision of the CJI which is

impermissible in law. Since the only question which is primarily

debated is the reviewability of sanction letter,      vide order dated

20.5.2011, information was sought from Secretary to Government of

India, Department of Law and Justice with the following directions:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">             "Secretary to Govt. of India, Department of Law &amp; Justice
             will file an affidavit whether any opinion was formulated
             and any recommendation was made by Recommending
             Authority (the then Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India) to
             the Govt. refusing sanction in case of the petitioner and
             whether such opinion was placed before the Sanctioning
             Authority (President of India) and whether the
             Sanctioning Authority at any stage declined sanction for
             prosecution in respect to the present petitioner, if so, the
             necessary       documents      (copies)   containing     the
             opinion/consultation accorded by the the Hon'ble the
             Chief Justice of India to the sanctioning authority and
             order of Sanctioning Authority be filed before this Court in
             a sealed cover alongwith the affidavit of the Secretary
             concerned.

             side by 31.5.2011."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">10.     Pursuant to the aforesaid directions, Secretary to government

of India Ministry of Law and Justice, Department of Justice filed her

affidavit dated 11.7.2011. Reference to this affidavit shall be made at

the appropriate stage. While requiring affidavit, a further direction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   8</span>

was issued to produce necessary documents containing the

opinion/consideration accorded by Hon'ble Chief Justice of India, the

sanctioning authority and the order of sanctioning authority.

</p><p id="p_11">11.     Mr.Kaushik, learned counsel appearing on behalf of UOI and

Mr.Anupam Gupta, learned counsel appearing for CBI produced the

record from the Departments of Ministry of Law and Justice

Department of Justice and Ministry of Law Justice Department of

Legal Affairs and Department of Personnel and Training New Delhi

as also the CBI.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.     Mr.Tulsi, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the petitioner,

besides making oral submissions in detail also filed written

submissions. Four points on which arguments have been addressed

in detail have been summarized by Mr.Tulsi in his written

submissions. The same are noticed here under:-
</p>
<p id="p_13">1.Keeping in view the object of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_36">Section 19</a> of the PC Act, review or
reconsideration of the decision to grant or decline sanction, is
impermissible.
</p><p id="p_14">2.In the instant case, closure report itself recites (at page 284 of the
paper-book) that the prosecution sanction was denied and hence the
closure report was being filed. This is supported by the letter of the
Law Secretary (at page 247) that the CJI had observed that no
action was required for the present. The letter dated 15.1.2009
further leaves no manner of doubt that what was forwarded to the
CJI was the S.P.'s report containing details of facts, circumstances
and evidence brought on record during investigation on basis of
which prosecution sanction u/s 19 of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_37">PC Act</a> was requested.
</p><p id="p_15">3.It is not only the CBI which interpreted the order as declining
sanction but the collegium itself, including the present CJI, which
accorded approval for transfer of petitioner from Punjab &amp; Haryana
High Court to Uttarakhand High Court in Nov./Dec.2009. Thus, the
collegium can be presumed to have been made aware of the CJI's
order declining sanction.
</p><p id="p_16">4.The none of the documents and the files produced before this
Hon'ble Court are entitled to any immunity from disclosure. Keeping
in view the nature of proceeding (Criminal Trial) in which these
documents are capable of establishing the illegality of the criminal
proceeding initiated against the petitioner, the public interest of
disclosure far outweighs immunity. There is no valid ground or basis
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                  9</span>

on which disclosure of documents inspected by this Court can be
denied to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">13.   The legal question relating to review or re- consideration of the

grant or decline of sanction shall be dealt with after the points no.2

and 3 raised by Mr.Tulsi, which inter alia includes the factual aspect

are considered.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.   The allegations against the petitioner as contained in the

charge-sheet presented under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_38">Section 173</a> of the Cr.P.C. are

summarized hereinafter.
</p>
<p id="p_20">15.   On 13th August, 2008 at 20.30 hours, Shri Parkash Ram came

to the house of Ms. Justice Nirmaljit Kaur with one plastic bag in his

hand and informed Shri Amrik Singh, peon of Justice Nirmaljit Kaur

that papers have come from Delhi to be delivered to Justice Kaur.

Shri Amrik Singh took the plastic bag inside. On being directed by

Justice Kaur, Shri Amrik Singh opened the bag which was found

containing currency notes. On being directed by Justice Kaur, the

peon Amrikh Singh caught hold Parkash Ram with the help of guard,

Shri Gurvinder Singh and thereafter local police was called who

detained Parkash Ram. A formal FIR was, however, registered on

16th August, 2008 on the complaint of Shri Amrik Singh, Peon.

Initially, the case was investigated by the local police, however,

subsequently, the matter was referred to CBI.

Panchkula, subject matter of the RSA. Sanjiv Bansal had issued

cheque for Rs.2.00 crores from his own account in the name of Rajiv

Gupta, out of which Rs.1.50 crores was paid to one Shri Vinod

Tayal on account of property jointly purchased by Shri Sanjiv Bansal

and Rajiv Gupta at Hissar. Another amount of Rs.20 lacs was paid

on 16.5.2007 and Rs.15 lacs on 6.6.2007 to Shri Anand Jain, the

owner of the plot. It has also been alleged that Shri Rajiv Gupta

purchased this plot no.601, Sector 16, Panchkula from Shri Anand

Jain for a consideration of Rs.60 lacs for which money was

transferred by Shri Sanjiv Bansal from his account. Thus he had

personal interest in the property, subject matter of RSA. Sanjiv

Bansal, Advocate also appeared as a counsel after superseding a

senior counsel Sh.Arun Jain engaged in the case. The CBI in its

detailed report also concluded that even though when Rs.15.00 lacs

was delivered at the residence of Hon'ble Ms.Justice Nirmaljit Kaur

on the evening of 13th August, 2008, Ms. Nirmal Yadav again

demanded Rs.15.00 lacs from Ravinder Singh. On the morning of

14th of August, 2008, an amount of Rs.15.00 lacs was delivered to

Mrs. Yadav by Rajiv Gupta, a close associate of Sanjiv Bansal, one

of the accused in the case. It is also part of investigation that this

amount of Rs.15.00 lacs was received by Ms. Yadav as a

consideration for deciding RSA No.550 of 2007 pertaining to plot

no.601, Sector 16, Panchkula for which Sanjiv Bansal had acquired

interest. It is stated that during investigation, it is also revealed that

Sanjiv Bansal paid the fare of air tickets of Mrs. Yadav and Mrs.

Yadav used matrix mobile phone card           provided to her by Shri

Ravinder Singh on her foreign visit. To establish the close proximity

between Mrs. Yadav, Ravinder Singh, Sanjiv Bansal and Rajiv

Gupta, CBI has given details of phone calls amongst these accused

persons during the period when money changed hands and the

incidence of delivery of money at the residence of Ms. Nirmaljit Kaur

and even during the period of initial investigation.

</p><p id="p_22">17.     On the basis of these allegations, CBI after investigation

approached the competent authority vide letter dated 15.1.2009 for

grant of sanction for prosecution against Mrs. Justice Yadav.         It

seems that there was difference of opinion between the Director CBI

and Director (Prosecution). The matter was accordingly referred to

Attorney General of India for his opinion. Attorney General of India

recorded his opinion on 20th April, 2009 saying that there is no shred

of evidence to prosecute Mrs. Yadav. Based upon the opinion of the

Attorney General of India and some discussion between Hon' ble

Law Minister of India and Hon'ble CJI, D.R.Meena, Secretary, Govt.

of India, Ministry of Law and Justice, Department of Legal Affairs,

vide his letter dated 17.12.2009 communicated to the Director, CBI

that upon further reference from the DOPT, the DOPT was informed

that the matter had been discussed by the Hon'ble Minister for Law

and Justice with      the CJI who had observed that no action was

required for the present. The case papers related to Justice Nirmal

Yadav and others were returned back to DOPT on 19.10.2009.

Treating this letter as refusal, CBI filed the closure report before the

Special Judge(CBI Court), Chandigarh. Learned Special Judge vide

his order dated 26.3.2010 refused to accept the closure report and

issued directions for further investigation.

Court in case of <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_39">K.Veeraswami vs.Union of India and others</a>,

1991 (3) SCC 655. This judgment relates to the prosecution of a

sitting Judge of the superior Court and details the safeguards before

any criminal action is initiated against the Judge of the High Court

and Supreme Court. Relevant observations/directions contained in

the judgment are noticed here under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             "60.The Chief Justice of India is a participatory
             functionary in the matter of appointment of Judges of the
             Supreme Court and the High Courts. (Articles 124(2) and
             2 17(1).) Even for transfer of a Judge          from     one
             High Court to another the Chief Justice should             be
             consulted by the        President of India (<a href="/doc/819787/" id="a_40">Article 222</a>). If
             any question arises as to the age of a Judge of a High
             Court,the question shall be decided by the President after
             consultation with the Chief Justice of India (<a href="/doc/604649/" id="a_41">Article 217
             (3)).</a> Secondly, the Chief Justice being the head of the
             judiciary is primarily concerned with the integrity and
             impartiality of the judiciary. Hence it is necessary that
             the Chief Justice of India is not kept out of the picture
             of any criminal case contemplated against a Judge. He
             would be in a better position to give his opinion in      the
             case and consultation with the Chief Justice of India
             would be of immense assistance to the Government in
             coming to the right conclusion. We therefore, direct that
             no criminal case shall be registered under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_42">Section 154</a>,
             Cr. P.C. against Judge of the High Court, Chief Justice
             of High Court or Judge of the Supreme Court unless
             the Chief Justice of India is consulted in the matter. Due
             regard must be given by the Government to the opinion
             expressed by the Chief Justice. If the Chief Justice is of
             opinion that it is not a fit case for proceeding under the
             Act, the case shall not be registered. If the Chief Justice
             of India himself is the person against       whom         the
             allegations of criminal misconduct         are received the
             Government shall consult any other Judge or Judges of
             the Supreme Court. There shall be similar consultation at
             the stage of examining the question       of         granting
             sanction for prosecution and it shall be necessary
             and appropriate that the question of sanction be guided
             by and in accordance with the advice of the Chief Justice
             of India. Accordingly the directions shall go to the
             Government. These directions, in our opinion, would allay
             the apprehension of all concerned that the Act is likely
             to be misused by the Executive for collateral purpose."

</blockquote><p id="p_25">19.   These directions still hold the field in respect of the criminal

prosecution of a judge of High Court/Supreme Court. The directions

contained in the aforesaid judgment contemplate consultation with

Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India at two stages, firstly at the stage

of registration of a criminal case and secondly, at the stage of

examining the question of          granting sanction for prosecution.

Compliance of         the aforesaid directions is sine qua non for

proceeding against         a sitting Judge of the High Court/Supreme

Court. Although the petitioner has not disputed the factum of

consultation with Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India, both at the stage

of registration of FIR against her and subsequent grant of sanction

for prosecution, however, it is deemed appropriate to notice the

circumstances, as are evident from the record produced before me.

and the matter being referred to the CBI for investigation, the CBI

intended to examine the role of two sitting Judges of this Court, Ms.

conducted by the CBI. Director, CBI vide his D.O. letter dated

convenience. This letter was responded to on the same date allowing

the CBI to investigate the role of both the sitting Judges of Punjab

and Haryana High Court in connection with the criminal case FIR

No.250 with a caveat to give due regard to the dignity of the office

held by the Hon'ble Judges. It was further observed that they should

be examined by an Officer not below the rank of DIG of CBI.

Pursuant to the permission accorded by Hon'ble the CJI to

investigate the conduct and role of the two Hon'ble Judges of this

Court, the CBI proceeded to investigate the matter. It seems that the

thrust of the investigation of the CBI at the relevant time was in

respect of the land deal conducted by Mrs. Nirmal Yadav (petitioner)

at Solan in Himachal Pradesh. The Investigating Officer, CBI S.P.

concluded the investigation and opined that offences under <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_47">Section

i.e. mobile phone, air tickets and matrix cards from Ravinder Singh.

Prosecution, CBI and Director, CBI, the SP CBI vide his

communication        dated       15.1.2009        requested        the     Secretary

(Personnel), Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions,

North Block, New Delhi to seek opinion of the Attorney General in

terms of paragraph 23.21 of CBI Manual, 2005. He further requested

for consideration of the documents and statements of the witnesses

by the sanctioning authority. A draft order for grant of sanction for

prosecution was also enclosed. Aforesaid communication with the

report of the Director of Prosecution, CBI and the Joint Director, AC

to the aforesaid letter, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and

Pensions, Department of Personnel and Training, Government of

India vide Office Memorandum dated 19.1.2009 requested the

Ministry of Law and Justice Department of Legal Affairs to seek

opinion of the learned Attorney General of India. Resultantly, the

then Attorney General of India, Milan K. Banerji accorded his opinion

dated 20.4.2009. The first Law Officer of the country noticed the gist

of allegations in paragraph 6 of the opinion which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">             "6.I have carefully perused the report of the SP along with the gist of
             witnesses and documents and also the notes of Shri Manohar Lal and
             Director of Prosectuion. The CBI's allegations are two-fold, namely,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">             (i)Mrs.Justice Nirmal yadav had made a demand of Rs.15 lakhs from Shri
             Ravinder Singh in the evening of 13th August, 2008, who in turn
             requested Shri Sanjiv Bansal to deliver the said amount to Justice Yadav.
             Sanjiv Bansal in turn asked his wife to deliver the amount, which his
             munshi, Parkash Ram sought to deliver at the residence of Justice
             Nirmaljit Kaur and was apprehended.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">             (ii)The second allegation was that Justice Nirmal yadav asked accused
             Ravinder Singh to deliver Rs.15 lakhs on 14th Augst, 2008 which was
             actually delivered at her residence by Sanjiv Bansal in the morning of 14th
             August, 2008.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">                     On the basis of the aforesaid, it is contended that an offence
             under <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_56">Section 11</a> and <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_57">12</a> of the PC Act were committed by Justice
             Yadav."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                                   16</span>




<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      He thereafter formulated his following opinion:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">             "9.therefore, even assuming for the sake of argument that Justice Nirmal
             Yadav had demanded Rs.15 lakhs, there is absolutely no evidence to
             prove that Shri Ravinder Singh was in any manner or was likely to be in
             any manner concerned in any proceedings or business transacted or
             about to be transacted by Justice Yadav or that accused Ravinder Singh
             was having any connection with the official function of Justice Yadav. The
             amount had admittedly originated from Shri Ravinder Singh and was
             being merely delivered by Sanjiv Bansal. Therefore, the prosecution is
             required to establish that there was some connection between Ravinder
             Singh and Justice Yadav because of which this amount was demanded
             or delivered. Even if the entire evidence is to be believed, such a
             connection is not even remotely established. There may have been, as
             alleged by the CBI or may not have been some connection between
             Justice Yadav and Sanjiv Bansal in the past. This is a matter which
             cannot be a subject matter of investigation in the present FIR. In any
             event, that is absolutely no evidence to indicate, far less to prove that this
             amount was demanded or delivered for any official connection relating to
             the work of Justice Yadav or to confer a benefit on Ravinder Singh or
             Sanjiv Bansal or any other person. Therefore, on the material on record
             no offence under <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_58">Sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_59">12</a> is made out against Justice Nirmal
             Yadav. Consequently, the charge under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_60">Section 120-B</a> read with
             <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_61">Sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_62">12</a> of the PC Act would be baseless.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">             10.At this stage I may indicate that from the notes it appears that the
             Deputy Legal Adviser was of the view that an offence under <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_63">Section 11</a> is
             made out against Justice Yadav because she had received mobile
             phone, air ticket etc. from Ravinder Singh and Sanjiv Bansal. In my view,
             since there is no evidence of any official relations between Justice Yadav
             and Ravinder Singh, <a href="/doc/1973776/" id="a_64">Section 11</a> is not attracted in the present case.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">             11.In so far as the alleged offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_65"> the Indian Penal Code</a> are
             concerned, there is not even an iota of allegation that Justice Yadav was
             involved in any manner in the statements made by accused S/Shri Sanjiv
             Bansal, Nirmal Singh, Rajiv Gupta or the documents which were
             tendered by them to the local Chandigarh Police. It appears that once
             Rs.15 lakhs were seized, the said accused persons allegedly made up a
             story of delivery of Rs.15 lakhs to accused Nirmal Singh. As rightly
             pointed out by the Additional Legal Adviser such statements or
             documents were given to the local police prior to the registration of FIR
             and therefore, the ingredients of <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_66">Sections 192</a>/<a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_67">193</a> IPC are not attracted.
             The Additional Legal Adviser has rightly pointed out that since the
             statements made to the police are not evidence in the eyes of law,
             <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_68">Section 199</a> IPC also is not attracted. Therefore, there is grave doubt as
             to any offence under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_69">Sections 192</a> read with 193, 199 or 200 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_70">IPC</a> was
             committed by accused S/Shri Sanjiv Bansal, Rajiv Gupta and Nirmal
             Singh. In any event of the matter in so far as accused Justice Yadav is
             concerned, there is not a shred of evidence that the said alleged offences
             were committed by Sanjiv Bansal, Ravinder Singh and Nirmal Singh in
             conspiracy with accused Justice Yadav. There is definitely no material to
             prosecute Justice Yadav for a charge under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_71">Section 120-B</a> far less for
             substantive offences under <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_72">Sections 192</a>/<a href="/doc/308396/" id="a_73">193</a> of IPC."

General of India       was acceded to as is evident from the Note dated

7.1.2010 duly approved by Hon'ble the Minister for Law and Justice,

Sh. Veerappa Moily. On the same date, the matter was referred to

Shri Goolam E. Vahanvati, Attorney General of India who recorded

his opinion on 30.1.2010. Learned Attorney General                    noticed the

comments of the CBI on the opinion of Shri Milan K. Banerji which is

as under:-

             examined only those findings of the investigation which pertained to
             delivery of cash at the residence of Hon'ble Ms. Justice Nirmal Jit Kaur,
             for the reason that no permission was sought by the CBI for conducting
             investigation in the matters pertaining to purchase of land at Solan,
             Himachal Pradesh by Hon'ble Justice Nirmal Yadav and certain
             judgments delivered by Hon'ble Justice Nirmal Yadav. The CBI has
             further observed that this conclusion by the then Ld. Law Officer, in all
             probability, is due to the fact that he was not aware of the concurrence of
             CJI for such an investigation."

<blockquote id="blockquote_29">After noticing the aforesaid observations, Shri Goolam E. Vahanvati,

recorded as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">             "3.This requires consideration of the letter which was sent to the Ld.
             Chief Justice of India for permission to investigate the case. A letter had
             been written to the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India by the Director, CBI on
             4.9.2008. This letter sought permission to investigate the role of the two
             judges of the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in relation to the delivery of a
             packet containing Rs.15 lakhs in cash to the residence of Justice Nirmaljit
             Kaur. Paras 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 of that letter expressly deal with the cash amount
             of Rs.15 lakhs. In para 6 the letter the purchase of land at Solan is
             incidentally mentioned. It is stated that one Ravinder Singh had
             purchased the plots of land at Solan jointly with Justice Nirmal Yadav,
             and this is linked to para 5 of that letter, where it is mentioned that
             according to Shri Sanjiv Bansal, an amount of Rs.15 lakhs was to be
             delivered to Justice Nirmal Yadav at the instance of his close friend Shri
             Ravinder Singh. It therefore appears that         the reference to Ravinder
             singh and the purchase of land in para 6 of the letter is to show the
             connection between Ravinder Singh, and the cash of Rs.15 lakhs with
             Justice Nirmal Yadav. I do not find any reference in the letter dated
             4.09.2008 to any irregularities in relation to purchase of land at Solan.

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">             4.The letter received from the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India in relation to
             grant of permission for investigation is not on the file. I assume that it was
             written with reference to the letter dated 04.09.2008. As mentioned
             above, there is nothing in the letter dated 04.09.2008 which seeks to
             investigate the alleged irregularities in relation to the purchase of land at
             Solan. It therefore cannot be said that the learned Chief Justice had
             granted permission to investigate into alleged irregularities in the
             purchase of land at Solan.

Attorney General of India who has agreed with the opinion of Shri

Milan K. Banerji on the question that permission of Hon'ble CJI was

not obtained by the CBI for investigation into the Solan Land deal for

which separate permission is required. It is pertinent to note that

from the opinion of Shri Goolam E. Vahanvati, it also appears that

no comment has been made with regard to the allegations of the CBI

against Smt. Nirmal Yadav regarding abuse of her official position

and alleged delivery of Rs.15.00 lacs on 13.8.2008 at the residence

of Ms.Justice Nirmaljit Kaur which was in fact meant for Mrs. Yadav

<p id="p_28">26.   Mr.Tulsi, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the petitioner has

<p id="p_30">28.   The Vigilance Department, however, again took up the matter

with the competent authority insisting for grant of sanction on the

plea of sufficient evidence for prosecution. The competent authority

on re-consideration of the matter granted sanction vide its order

dated 15.3.2008 with the following observations:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">             "I agree with the contention of the Vigilance Department
             that in evaluating the evidence of criminal misconduct,
             his general conduct and behaviour as perceived by his
             superiors cannot secure precedence. I have been
             through the case file and facts of the case in detail. I find
             that the said Drug Inspector. Sh. Nishant Sareen has
             been caught red handed, with a bribe of Rs. 5000/-.
             There is nothing on record to show that this incident did
             not occur. The facts do not support the contention that
             Sh. Nishant Sareen was falsely implicated. In the
             circumstances, I am of the opinion that the prosecution
             sanction be granted in the instant case and accordingly
             do so."

<p id="p_31">29.   Action of the competent authority was challenged before the

High Court of Himachal Pradesh in the writ petition. The High Court

allowed the writ petition and quashed the order granting sanction.

the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">             "12. It is true that the Government in the matter of grant
             orrefusal to grant sanction exercises statutory power and
             that would not mean that power once exercised cannot
             be exercised again or at a subsequent stage in the
             absence of express power of review in no circumstance
             whatsoever.          The power of review, however, is not

             unbridled or unrestricted. It seems to us sound principle
             to follow that once the statutory power under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_83">Section 19</a>
             of the 1988 Act or <a href="/doc/1731569/" id="a_84">Section 197</a> of the Code has been
             exercised by the Government or the competent authority,
             as the case may be, it is not permissible for the
             sanctioning authority to review or reconsider the matter
             on the same materials again. It is so because
             unrestricted power of review may not bring finality to such
             exercise and on change of the Government or change of
             the person authorised to exercise power of sanction, the
             matter concerning sanction may be reopened by such
             authority for the reasons best known to it and a different
             order may be passed. The opinion on the same
             materials, thus, may keep on changing and there may not
             be any end to such statutory exercise. In our opinion, a
             change of opinion per se on the same materials cannot
             be a ground for reviewing or reconsidering the earlier
             order refusing to grant sanction. However, in a case
             where fresh materials have been collected by the
             investigating agency subsequent to the earlier order and
             placed before the sanctioning authority and on that basis,
             the matter is reconsidered by the sanctioning authority
             and in light of the fresh materials an opinion is formed
             that sanction to prosecute the public servant may be
             granted, there may not be any impediment to adopt such
             course."

<p id="p_33">31.   In the case of State of Punjab and Anr. Vs. Mohammed Iqbal

Bhatti, JT 2009 (13) SC 180, the question of review of sanction

again came up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

In this case, Vigilance Department, Punjab sought sanction for

prosecution     for offences under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_85">Sections 7</a>, <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_86">13(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_87">19</a> and <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_88">88</a> of PC

Act, 1988 upon completion of investigation. By an order dated

15.12.2002, grant of sanction was refused. The matter was again

placed before the competent authority on 14th September, 2004

whereupon sanction to prosecute was granted. Considering the

legality and validity of the subsequent order granting sanction,

Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">             "22. It was, therefore, not a case where fresh materials
             were placed before the sanctioning authority.  No case,

             therefore, was made out that the sanctioning authority
             had failed to take into consideration a relevant fact or
             took into consideration an irrelevant fact. If the
             clarification sought for by the Hon'ble Minister had been
             supplied, as has been contended before us, the same
             should have formed a ground for reconsideration of the
             order. It is stated before us that the Government sent
             nine letters for obtaining the clarifications which were not
             replied to.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">             23. The High Court in its judgment has clearly held,
             upon perusing theentire records, that no fresh material
             was produced. There is also nothing to show as to why
             reconsideration became necessary. On what premise
             such a procedure was adopted is not known. Application
             of mind is also absent to show the necessity for
             reconsideration or review of the earlier order on the basis
             of the materials placed before the sanctioning authority or
             otherwise."

<p id="p_34">32.   In the case of <a href="/doc/283303/" id="a_89">Gopikant Choudhary vs. State of Bihar and

others</a>, (2000) 9 SCC 53, while considering a similar issue, Hon'ble

Supreme Court observed as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">             "5.In the case in hand, the matter was initially placed
             before the Minister of Law who refused to accord
             sanction after applying his mind to the entire materials
             and an order to that effect was passed. Subsequent to
             the same, the appellant retired in the year 1994 and it is
             only in 1997, the Chief Minister appears to have passed
             the impugned order. The appellant assailed the legality of
             the aforesaid order in the High Court, but the High Court
             having not interfered, he has approached this Court. It is
             contended on behalf of the appellant that no fresh
             materials were collected subsequent to the earlier order
             refusing to sanction prosecution and the appropriate
             authority having applied its mind and having passed the
             said order, the subsequent order was wholly uncalled for
             and unjustified. In the counter-affidavit filed by the State,
             it has been indicated that before passing the earlier
             order, the matter had not been referred to the Chief
             Minister who was the competent authority and, therefore,
             when the matter was referred to the Chief Minister, the
             Chief Minister having passed the order there is no
             infirmity with the order of sanction in question. He also
             produced the relevant file before us to indicate as to how
             the file has been processed after the earlier order
             refusing to sanction prosecution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">             6.We find from the file that was produced that there has
             been no application of mind when the subsequent order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   24</span>

             was passed in the year 1997. It further appears that
             between the order refusing to sanction and the order that
             was passed in 1997, the investigating agency had not
             collected any fresh materials requiring a fresh look at the
             earlier order. It is also apparent that the alleged excess
             amount said to have been paid on account of non-
             performance of the duty by the appellant is to the tune of
             Rs.2750/- and, therefore, under the Rules of Business,
             the file pertaining to sanction would have been finally
             dealt with by the Law Minister and, in fact, he had done
             so. In this view of the matter, neither was there any
             necessity for the authorities concerned to place the file
             before the Chief Minister nor had the Chief Minister any
             occasion to reconsider the matter and pass fresh order
             sanctioning prosecution particularly when taking into
             account the loss sustained to the exchequer to the tune
             of Rs.2750. That apart, the person concerned has
             already retired in the year 1994 and it is unthinkable that
             for a loss of Rs.2750, the State would pursue the
             proceedings against such person. In this view of the
             matter, we set aside the impugned order of sanction
             dated 10.12.1997 passed by the Chief Minister for
             prosecuting the appellant."

<p id="p_35">33.   From the careful perusal of the aforesaid judgments relied upon

by Shri Tulsi, following propositions emerge:-
</p>
<p id="p_36">(i)Grant or refusal of sanction for prosecution is a statutory function

of the competent authority.
</p>
<p id="p_37">(ii)Grant or refusal of the sanction for prosecution of a public servant

is the prerogative of the appointing authority/authority competent to

remove from service.
</p>
<p id="p_38">(iii)Once the competent authority on the basis of material before it

decides to decline sanction, it is impermissible in law to review the

question of grant of sanction without fresh material and              valid

reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_39">(iv)Due application of mind by the competent authority at every stage

of consideration is sine qua non for a legal and valid order for grant

or refusal of sanction.

</p><p id="p_41">34.   The plea of the petitioner is to be examined and considered

within the compass of ratio of above mentioned judgments, extracted

above.
</p>
<p id="p_42">35. It has been strenuously argued by Shri Tulsi that then Hon' ble

CJI whose consultation was imperative for referring the matter to the

Hon'ble President of India for final sanction, formulated his opinion

to decline sanction on the basis of the material and the opinion of the

Attorney General. The question of grant of sanction thus attained

finality and the successor CJI had no authority or jurisdiction to

reconsider the same with fresh inputs and to arrive at a different

conclusion or formulate an opinion contrary to the earlier opinion of

the then CJI (Justice K.G.Balakrishnan)

</p><p id="p_43">36.   Mr.Tulsi has also debated at length the       binding nature of

opinion of Attorney General upon the CBI in terms of paragraph

23.21 of the Central Bureau of Investigation (Crime) Manual-2005

which is reproduced here under:-

<p id="p_44">

             Director, CBI, keeping in view the opinion of the Attorney
             General, would be deemed final."

             the opinion of the Attorney General of India for the
             purpose of the investigation and filing of the charge-sheet
             against any such individal. In that event, the opinion
             would be sought from the Attorney General after making
             available to him all the opinions expressed on the
             subject by the persons associated with the investigation
             as a part of the materials."

<p id="p_48">38.   It is accordingly          submitted that learned Attorney General

formulated his opinion on the basis of the report of the CBI which

included entire evidence/material against the petitioner. It is

accordingly submitted that having regard to the opinion of the first

Law Officer of the country that there is not even a shred of evidence,

Hon'ble CJI rightly declined the sanction for prosecution.

</p><p id="p_49">39.   Mr.Anupam Gupta, learned counsel appearing for CBI,

however, seriously and vehemently countered the proposition sought

to be projected by Mr.Tulsi. According to him judgment in Sushil

Kumar Modi's case (supra) has been reconsidered by Hon'ble

Supreme Court in subsequent judgment of the Supreme Court. His

further contention is that it is the opinion of the Investigating Agency

which acquires supremacy over the opinion of the Law Officer in the

matter of investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_50">40.   In Sushil Kumar Modi's case (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court

has discussed the responsibility and role of the CBI in the matter of

investigation. Relevant observations are contained in paragraphs 7

and 9 as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">             "7. At the hearing of the matter we had expressed our
             plain view that the CBI with its Director at. the helm of

             affairs is duty bound to make a              fair, honest and
             complete investigation into the accusations and to
             identify all the culprits involved in the scam and to take
             the necessary steps in accordance with law for the trial
             of all accused. The ultimate responsibility to ensure a
             fair, honest        and complete investigation into           the
             accusations is that of the Director, CBI and he is
             expected to discharge his duty and functions faithfully
             towards this end. It is also necessary that Director is not
             merely to perform his own duty in this manner but he is
             also to ensure that every officer of the CBI works
             honestly to achieve this end. This is imperative under the
             'rule of law'. The Learned Attorney General
             unhesitatingly accepted           this and assured us of the
             same. It is not necessary for us to elaborate this
             obvious point any further.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">              9.The first question on merits relates to the exclusion of
             the Director CBI from participation in the investigation
             being conducted by the CBI. In our opinion, it is not only
             appropriate but necessary that             the     Director,CBI
             should continue to remain the             person       ultimately
             responsible         for proper conduct              of        the
             investigation and          its early completion. The
             Director, being the Head of            the agency, should be
             the person accountable for the entire functioning
             of the        CBI and       in that capacity answerable and
             accountable to theCourt for e proper investigation into
             the alleged crimes."

<p id="p_51">41.   In the case of Union of India and Sushil Kumar Modi and

others, 1997(4) SCC 770 (Sushil Kumar Modi-II), considering the

role of the Investigating Agency, Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">             "5.According to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_91"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973
             the formation of the opinion as to whether or not there is
             a case to place the accused for trial is that of the police
             officer making the investigating and the final step in the
             investigation is to be taken only by the police and by no
             other authority, see <a href="/doc/49832/" id="a_92">Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mishra</a>...."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_52">42.   In the case of <a href="/doc/1203995/" id="a_93">Vineet Narain and others vs. Union of India

and another</a>, (1998) 1 SCC 226 popularly known as Hawala Case, it

has been observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 28 that

Minister's general power to review the work of the agency is subject
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   28</span>

to the contention that it would not extend to permit the Minister to

interfere with the course of investigation and prosecution in any

individual case and in that respect, the officers concerned are to be

governed entirely by the mandate of law and statutory duty cast upon

them. In the case of M.C.Mehta (Taj Corridor Scam) vs. Union of

India and others, (2007) 1 Supreme Court Cases 110, a case FIR

was directed to be registered by the court pursuant to writ petition

filed before it.      There was difference of opinion between the

Investigating Officer of CBI and the Director (Prosecution) and the

matter was referred to learned Attorney General of India to resolve

the controversy who opined that evidence is not sufficient to launch

prosecution. The Investigating Agency, however, persisted with its

opinion that a case for criminal prosecution is made out. On the

basis of the Attorney General's opinion, Director CBI also declined to

proceed ahead for prosecution. Hon'ble Supreme Court formulated

following question:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">             "19.The key issue which arises for determination in this
             case is: whether on the facts and the circumstance of
             this case, the Director, CBI, who has not given his own
             independent opinion, was right in referring the matter for
             opinion to the Attorney General of India, particularly when
             the entire investigation and law officers' team was ad
             idem in its opinion on filing of the charge-sheet and only
             on the dissenting opinion of the Director of Prosecution,
             whose opinion is also based on the interpretation of the
             legal evidence, which stage has not even arrived. The
             opinion of the Director, CBI is based solely on the
             opinion of the Attorney General after the reference."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_53">Referring to various provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_94">Cr.P.C</a>. and the judgments of

Hon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble Supreme Court noticed as under:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">             "20.....This Court had categorically stated in the above
             judgment that, the final step in the investigation, namely,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                    29</span>

             the formation of the opinion as to whether or not there is
             a case to place the accused on trial is to be of the officer
             in charge of the police station and this function cannot be
             delegated. This Court unequivocally observed that, there
             is no provision for delegation of the above function
             regarding formation of the opinion but only a provision
             entitling the superior officers to supervise or participate
             under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_95">Section 551</a> (corresponding to <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_96">Section 36</a> of the
             present Code). This Court further held that, a police
             report which results from an investigation as provided for
             in <a href="/doc/276703/" id="a_97">Section 190</a> of the Code is the material on which
             cognizance is taken. But from that it cannot be said that
             a valid and legal police report is the foundation of the
             jurisdiction of the court to take cognizance."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_54">43.   Hon'ble Supreme Court also took note of the judgments in

Sushil Kumar Modi's case (supra) and             Vineet Narain's case

(supra). Hon'ble Supreme Court made following observations in

respect of the reference of matter for the opinion of the Attorney

General:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">             "32.......As stated by this Court in the case of R. Sarla10
             (supra), the formation of opinion, whether or not there is
             a case to place the accused on trial has to be of the
             officer in charge of the police station. One fails to
             understand why an opinion of Sr. P.P. had been taken in
             the present case. He is not a member of the hierarchy.
             The S.P. is not legally obliged to take his opinion. In the
             circumstances, when there was no difference of opinion
             in the concerned team, the question of seeking opinion
             of the Attorney General did not arise......"
</blockquote>


<p id="p_55">44.   Hon'ble Supreme Court accordingly while rejecting the status

report based upon the opinion of the Attorney general issued

following directions:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">             "34. We, accordingly, direct the CBI to place the
             evidence/ material
             collected by the investigating team along with the report
             of the S.P. as required under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_98">Section 173(2)</a> Cr.PC

             to add that, in this case, we were concerned with
             ensuring proper and honest performance of duty by the
             CBI and our above observations and reasons are
             confined only to that aspect of the case and they should
             not be understood as our opinion on the merits of
             accusation being investigated. We do not wish to
             express any opinion on the recommendations of the S.P..
             It is made clear that none of the other opinions/
             recommendations including that of the Attorney General
             of India, CVC shall be forwarded to the court/ Special
             Judge concerned."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_56">45.   Again considering the Taj Corridor matter in subsequent

judgment in case of <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_99">M.C.Mehta vs. Union of India and others</a>

(2008) 1 SCC 407 (Taj Corridor-II) Hon'ble Supreme Court ruled as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">             "12. It is one thing to say that this Court will not refrain
             from exercising its jurisdiction from issuing any direction
             for protection of cultural heritage and the ecology and
             environment; but then in discharge of the said duty, this
             Court should not take upon itself the task of determining
             the guilt or otherwise of an individual involved in the
             criminal proceeding. It should not embark upon an
             enquiry in regard to the allegations of criminal misconduct
             so as to form an opinion one way or the other so as to
             prima facie determine guilt of a person or otherwise.......
             "
</blockquote>


<p id="p_57">46.   No doubt in Sushil Kumar Modi's case (supra),                Hon'ble

Supreme Court observed that the Attorney General's opinion in the

event of difference of opinion between the Officers of the CBI binds

the Investigating Agency, however, while discussing          the    entire

spectrum of law in subsequent judgment in Taj Corridor-II case

(supra), it has been clearly and categorically ruled that primacy has

to be accorded to the opinion of the Investigating Agency/Officer and

no other opinion including that of the Attorney General or the CVC

can prevent the criminal proceedings against a delinquent, if in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                              31</span>

opinion of the Investigating Agency, a prima facie case is made out.

Hon'ble Supreme Court has even emphasized that superior court

should refrain itself in formulating an opinion on the basis of the

evidence collected by the Investigating Agency one way or the other.

</p><p id="p_58">47.   In view of the legal position based upon interpretation of

provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_100">Cr.P.C</a>., it was impermissible for any authority to

formulate an opinion that no case is made out for prosecution when

the Investigating Agency was of the consistent opinion that the case

for prosecution is made out.          Even Mr.Tulsi has refrained himself

from arguing that no case is made out for prosecution on the basis of

the evidence collected by the CBI. It is not a case of no evidence

where this Court could exercise the inherent jurisdiction for

quashment of the criminal proceedings under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_101">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.

nor is this view          projected      by the petitioner in the present

proceedings. It is in this context that Mr. Meena's letter is to be

construed and examined.
</p>
<p id="p_59">48.   From File No.228/3/2009-AVD-II from the                         Ministry of

Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, it appears that

reference to discussion between Hon'ble Ministry for Law and Justice

and Hon'ble CJI finds mention in Note dated 12.10.2009.                          The

relevant note is extracted as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">       "As a further development, the Hindustan Times in its edition dated 6th June,

</blockquote>



<p id="p_60">49.   Except the above note, no other material is available on record

to indicate that Hon'ble CJI at any point of time recorded his opinion

for closure of the matter. In view of Mr. Meena's letter which is the

sole document relied upon by the petitioner on the question of refusal

of sanction, this      vide inter locutory order dated 20.5.2011 asked

Secretary to Government of India, Department of Law and Justice

to file affidavit      whether any opinion was formulated or any

recommendation         made by Hon'ble CJI to the                  Government for

refusing sanction. In response to the aforesaid order, Ms. Neela

Gangadharan, Secretary to Government of India, Ministry of Law and

Justice, Department of Justice filed affidavit dated 11.7.2011

responding to the queries of this Court which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">      "(b)That with regard to the directions that whether such opinion was placed
      before the Sectioning Authority, it is submitted that the competent authority to
      issue the sanction for prosecution is the President of India and the proposal for
      sanction of prosecution of Smt. Justice Nirmal Yadav was placed before the
      competent authority only once in February, 2011, after obtaining the concurrence
      of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India in July, 2010. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of
      India directed that the revised report dated 16.6.2010 could be considered for
      the purposes of according sanction by President of India.
      (c )That with regard to the matter that the Sanctioning Authority had at any stage
      declined the sanction for prosecution, it is submitted that proposal for
      prosecution sanction was sent to President of India only in February, 2011 as
      mentioned in above para and accordingly, having due regard to the provision of
      <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_102">Section 19</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Sanction Order dated
      1.3.2011 has been issued. Thus, there is no question of declining the
      prosecution sanction on any earlier occasion. The letter dated 7.12.2009
      (Annexure P-7); expresses that the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India had only
      observed that no action was required for the present and he had not commented
      on the issue of sanction of prosecution."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   33</span>



<p id="p_61">50.   From the perusal of para (b) above, it is evident that proposal

for sanction of prosecution of the petitioner was placed before the

competent authority only once in February, 2011 after obtaining the

concurrence of Hon'ble CJI in July, 2010 who had opined that the

revised report dated 16.6.2010 could be considered for the purpose

of according sanction. Para (c ) further reveals that proposal for

sanction    for prosecution was sent to the Hon'ble President of India

only once in Feburary, 2011 where upon sanction order dated

1.3.2011 was issued and sanction was never declined at any earlier

occasion. This affidavit is corroborated by the record produced.

</p><p id="p_62">51.   Special Judge (CBI), Chandigarh vide his order dated

26.3.2010 had directed for further investigation, in view of the various

observations made in the above mentioned detailed order. It is

pertinent to     note that even the Special Judge had noticed the

opinion of the Attorney General in para 32 and Mr.Meena's letter

while directing the further investigation. Thus, both the contentions

raised by the petitioner in the present petition were not acceded to

as can be conveniently and safely inferred from the order of the

learned Special Judge. This order was never appealed against or

assailed in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_63">52.   Pursuant to the directions for further investigation, CBI has

carried out further investigation. This fact is revealed from two reports

of the CBI, one filed at the time of filing the closure report and the

second with the charge-sheet. From the two final reports of the CBI,

copies whereof have also been placed on record before this Court, it

appears that the first report is dated 5.1.2010 whereas the second
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   34</span>

report is dated 7.7.2010. First report contains list of as many as 65

witnesses and 106 documents which were relied upon in support of

the prosecution case whereas in the second final report, as many as

80 witnesses and 116 documents were relied upon. Mr. Anupam

Gupta has referred to para (xxiii) of the fresh charge-sheet to indicate

that fresh facts have come on record during further investigation. He

also pointed out that witness no.48- Raj Kumar Jain was examined

again during further investigation. Similarly, witness nos.57 to 70 are

the additional witnesses whose statements were recorded on further

investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_64">53.   To the contrary, Mr. Tulsi in his written submissions has

referred to chart to indicate that there is no material difference

between the statements of the witnesses. His contention is that

further investigation has not improved the case of the prosecution.

Suffice it to say that this is not within the purview of this Court to

appraise the evidence and find out the adequacy or deficiency of the

material collected by the Investigating Agency. Otherwise also, it is

not the case of the petitioner before this court that no offence is

made out, on the basis of the evidence on record. It is thus

impermissible in law to examine the evidence in the context of the

issue before me. The fact remains that there has been further

investigation. On the basis of the further investigation, a fresh

proposal dated 16.6.2010 was forwarded by the CBI to the Ministry of

Law and Justice, Department of Justice, seeking sanction for

prosecution. This proposal was examined by the Joint Secretary on

30.6.2010 and the Secretary (Justice) Ms. Neela Gangadharan, on

9.7.2010 and recommended to Hon'ble CJI for his consultation, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                       35</span>

view of the judgment in the case of K.Veeraswami (supra). Hon'ble

CJI recorded his opinion on the basis of the revised report pursuant

to fresh investigation on 28.7.2010 recommending grant of sanction.

On the opinion of Hon'ble CJI, the Hon'ble Minister for Law and

Justice ordered for the process of the matter on the same date. The

entire record was accordingly sent to Prime Minister's Office. Prime

Minister's Office, however, made certain queries.              On seeking

response from the        CBI, the matter was again placed before the

competent authority in the Prime Minister's Office. On receipt of the

approval of the proposal from Hon'ble Prime Minister, the proposal

for grant of sanction was forwarded to Her Excellency, the President

of India, the competent authority who granted sanction vide order

dated 1.3.2011 for prosecution of the           petitioner   which is under

challenge before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_65">54.      One of the issues that needs a thoughtful consideration by this

Court is the sanctity, validity, legality and propriety of the Mr. Meena's

sanction by the President of India, the competent authority.

Public Grievances and Pensions, Govt. of India, New Delhi and a

copy of the same was also sent to the Secretary General, Supreme

Court of India, however, no material is available on record which may

even remotely suggest            that    DOPT or the Ministry of Law and

Justice     ever   forwarded       any    proposal   to   Hon'ble   CJI   for

consideration/consultation.        No consultation    seems to have been

reference in the note dated 12.10.2009 and the letter of Mr.Meena.

This letter in fact throws up many questions rather shedding any

light. Even no opinion of Hon'ble Law Minister is available on record.

During the course of hearing, Mr. Anupam Gupta has placed on

record copy of a letter dated 10.2.2010 said to be issued from the

office of Shri M.P.Bhadran, Secretary General, Supreme Court of

India addressed to the Editor-in-chief, the Pioneer newspaper

denying the factum of refusal of sanction at the level of Hon'ble CJI.

      published in the Pioneer, New Delhi on 10th February, 2010.
      Sir,
             In respect of today's news item in your newspaper under the caption
      "Cash-at-door Scame: Bar association slams CJI", this is to clarify that no such
      request for sanction to prosecute a Judge of the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court,
      has been made by the CBI to Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India regarding the
      alleged delivery of cash.Even the final report in this regard has not been shown
      to Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India by CBI. So it is incorrect to say that Hon'ble
      the Chief Justice of India has denied sanction to prosecute the Judge. Hence I
      request you to publish a clarification in your newspaper at a prominent place.
      Thanking you,
                                                          Yours faithfully
                                                          Sd/-M.P.Bhadran"

<p id="p_68">

</p><p id="p_69">56.   It is stated that on the basis of the news item published in

various newspapers, Office of Hon'ble CJI clarified that the matter

was    never     placed     before      the    then     Hon'ble         CJI,    Justice

K.G.Balakrishnan and thus              question of refusal does not arise.

Admittedly, this letter is not part of the investigation or record of the

trial court. Hence no reliance can be placed upon the same. Thus,

the question whether the proposal of CBI dated 15.1.2009 was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                    37</span>

examined at the level of Hon'ble the then CJI is to be looked

independent of the aforesaid letter. In the record produced, as

noticed above, there is          absolutely no reference to the proposal

having been forwarded by the competent                 authority i.e. the

DOPT/Ministry of Law and Justice to the Hon'ble CJI for

consultation/opinion for grant of sanction. The note of Hon'ble

Minister that the matter has been discussed with the Hon'ble CJI

seems to be based upon some oral discussion with the Hon'ble CJI.

Even if the note is taken at its face value, it does not indicate that

Hon'ble CJI has considered the issue           of   grant of sanction for

prosecution, it could be any other question which may, inter alia,

include the question of initiating administrative action on the basis of

the allegations. The note ""the matter had been discussed with the

CJI, who had observed that no action was required for the present"

cannot be read to support the case of the petitioner that this note

pertains to the question of grant of sanction. Even if it is presumed

that Hon'ble the CJI was apprised of the issue regarding grant of

sanction, the note simply says that "no action was required for the

present". It is neither an affirmative nor an active/ positive opinion in

any respect whatsoever. It cannot be read to mean that Hon'ble

CJI declined the sanction for prosecution in any manner.               In

K.Veeraswami's case (supra), expression "consultation" has been

used by Hon'ble Supreme Court. The word "consultation" finds

mention in Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution of India in regard

to appointment of        Judges of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High

Courts, respectively. The true purport, import and meaning of the

"consultation" used in the Constitution has invited debate in various

judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court. Reference can be made to (1)

S.P.Gupta versus Union of India and another, 1981 Suppl. SCC

<p id="p_71">57.   Mr. Meena's letter simply refers to noting by Hon'ble Minister

for Law and Justice. No such noting under the signature of Hon'ble

the Minister is available on record produced from the Ministry of Law

and Justice/DOPT. Thus the letter of Mr. Meena which has been

construed to be refusal of sanction by the petitioner and the CBI at

the initial stage, raises another question, whether it         can be

construed to be an order of Government of India much less an order

passed by the competent authority viz. Hon'ble CJI or the President

of India declining sanction. It has been forcefully         argued by

Mr.Anupam Gupta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the CBI

that the letter cannot be construed to be an order contemplated

under <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_106">Article 77</a> of the Constitution of India and the         Rules of

Business framed by the President of India. To buttress                his

and others</a>, AIR 1959 SC 65, a liquor licence was not granted to the

writ petitioner. To the contrary, a communication was issued by the

Government stating therein that the Chief Commissioner is pleased

to approve the grant of licence of L-II to the respondents in the writ

petition. The question which came up for consideration before the

Court is whether the letter can be construed to be grant of licence

under the rules. Hon'ble Supreme Court, while considering the

communication held that inter-departmental communication was only

in reference to a letter of the addressee and cannot be termed as

an order granting sanction of licence. It was also observed that the

matter was never placed before the competent authority. The

relevant observations are as under:-

categorically held that a noting or recorded decision on the file

cannot be construed to be an order of the Government which is

always subject to reconsideration and review by the competent

authority and no cognizance can be taken on the basis of such

noting in exercise of power of judicial review. Relevant observations

are contained in following para:-

      By no stretch of imagination, such noting can be treated as a

<p id="p_75">61.   In the case of MRF Limited           Vs. Manohar Parrikar and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   41</span>

law.
</p>
<p id="p_76">62.    Reference to      so-called opinion of Hon'ble the CJI in Mr.

Meena's letter is to be judged on the anvil and       the bench-mark of

the law laid down by the Supreme court in the above mentioned

judgments.
</p>
<p id="p_77">63.    <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_119">Section 19</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988

prescribes that sanction for prosecution by competent authority is

necessary to prosecute a public servant accused of commission of

offences under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_120">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988.

</p><p id="p_78">64.    Power to grant of sanction includes power to refuse. It being a

statutory function, law envisages due application of mind on the

material placed before the competent authority entrusted with the

responsibility of granting sanction. The sanctioning authority has to

arrive at the conclusion for refusal or grant of sanction by taking into

consideration the material placed before it. There may be doubts in

the mind of the sanctioning authority and to clear such doubts, the

sanctioning authority may formulate even a tentative opinion.

However, any such noting on the record or even a tentative opinion

cannot be a substitute for an order of the competent authority, unless

such opinion is translated into a final, well-thought of decision and

the decision is communicated to the concerned in the prescribed

mode and      form, if so prescribed under law. Articles 77 and 166

empowers the President or the Governor, as the case may be, to

frame the rules of business for authentication of the orders of the

Government. It also         specifically provides that all orders of the

Government have to be issued in the name of the "President" or the

"Government of India" in case of Central Government and in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                 42</span>

name of "Governor" or the "Government of        State" in the matters

relating to State. In view of Section 19 of the P C Act, the competent

authority to grant sanction for prosecution in case of a judge of the

High Court is his/her appointing authority i.e. the President of India

under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_121">Article 217(b)</a> of the Constitution of India and thus, the

President of India alone is the sanctioning authority.   However, in

case of K.Veeraswami (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court has only

prescribed a mode and placed a caveat for exercise of power by the

President and consultation with the CJI has been made compulsory

being head of      the Judicial Family. Thus unless it is proved and

established that the President of India in consultation with Hon'ble

the CJI ever declined the grant of sanction, the petitioner cannot

succeed in her attempt to seek quashment of the sanction order.

Even it is admitted case of the petitioner that the matter was never

considered by Hon'ble President of India, prior to the grant of

impugned sanction dated 1.3.2011. The entire case of Mr. Tulsi is

that since the consultation with the CJI is a             compulsory

phenomenon, the decision of the CJI must be construed to be the

final word on the question of grant of sanction.    It is argued that

where the CJI refuses to agree for the grant of sanction for

prosecution of a High Court Judge, the matter need not be placed

before the competent authority i.e. Hon'ble President of India.

Strength in this regard is drawn from the judgment of K.Veeraswami

(supra).    Referring to     K. Veeraswami's judgment, Mr. Tulsi has

attempted to argue that once the CJI decides not to accord sanction

for prosecution, the matter ends then and there and need not be

pursued further.     His contention is that the view of the CJI being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                    43</span>

binding in the consultative process so far as the criminal prosecution

against a High Court Judge is concerned, it was not required or

even desired to refer the matter to         the President of India for

consideration. I have carefully gone through the judgment in

K.Veeraswami's case. At the cost of repetition, the relevant extract in

this regard is quoted as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">             "There shall be similar consultation at the stage of
             examining    the question of granting sanction for
             prosecution and it shall be necessary and appropriate
             that the question of sanction be guided by and in
             accordance with the advice of Chief Justice of India."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_79">65.     It is thus wrong to suggest that the question of sanction in

case of refusal by the Hon'ble CJI was not required to be considered

by the President of India.
</p>
<p id="p_80">66.     Indubitably, Hon'ble Supreme Court has made the consultation

with the CJI imperative for the President of India, the competent

authority for the purpose of grant of sanction for prosecution in case

of a Judge of the superior judiciary. However, the final dictum to

grant or refuse the sanction vests with the President of India, though

the view of Hon'ble the Chief Justice must carry weight. It cannot be

ruled out that even if Hon'ble CJI has any reservation in regard to

grant      of sanction, but the competent sanctioning           authority

(President      of    India)     has   a   right    to   seek     further

consultation/clarification on the basis of the material, if placed before

her/him and in such an eventuality, the Hon'ble CJI could possibly

agree with the opinion of the competent authority and accord

affirmative consultation accordingly. Thus, to say that where the CJI

declines to grant sanction or has any reservation, the matter should
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   44</span>

not be placed before the competent authority may not be a safe

proposition. In the process of consultation, there is possibility of

difference of opinion amongst the       constitutional authorities,   but

finally, the authorities may arrive at a common conclusion/decision.

This situation, in my humble opinion cannot be ruled out.

</p><p id="p_81">67.   Be that as it may. In the present case, neither the petitioner

has placed on record any material except the letter of Mr. Meena nor

the record produced by all the concerned departments reveal that the

proposal dated 15.1.2009 was placed before the Hon'ble CJI by the

competent authority viz. Ministry of Law and Justice for consultation

in respect of the sanction for prosecution of the petitioner.    Record

also does not disclose any consideration by the Hon'ble CJI prior to

July 28, 2010. Suffice it to say that the consideration inheres in itself

due application of mind. Reference to a note of Hon'ble Minister for

Law and Justice in Mr. Meena's letter thus, by no para meter of law,

can    assume the status of a consultation in law. It may also be

noticed that since the competent authority i.e. the Hon'ble President

of India and Hon'ble CJI are required to perform statutory function

while granting sanction under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_122">Section 19</a> of the PC Act, it cannot be

imagined that such consultation can be oral and without adopting a

proper procedure. Under Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution of

India, consultation for appointment of a Judge of Supreme Court or a

High Court must be in writing as ruled by Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the cases of Supreme Court Advocate-on-Record Association

Versus Union of India, 1993 (4) SCC 441 and In the Supreme

Court of India (In Re:<a href="/doc/829952/" id="a_123">Appointment and Transfer of Judges) vs.

Civil Advisory Jurisdiction</a>, 1998 (7) SCC 739. It is beyond pale of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                    45</span>

any imagination that where the consultation for appointment of

Judges which is only a privilege to be conferred is needed in writing

and the sanction for prosecution which is far more a serious matter

relating to the liberty of a public servant can be oral.     It is in this

context that the affidavit of Ms. Neela Gangadharan assumes

significance.
</p>
<p id="p_82">68.   It is also argued by Mr.Tulsi that not only the Hon'ble CJI, but

even the Collegium understood that the sanction has been declined.

To formulate his argument, it is argued that judicial work was

withdrawn from the petitioner by the then Chief Justice of Punjab and

Haryana High Court, however, later she was transferred by the

President of India on the recommendation of Collegium of Hon'ble

Supreme Court from Punjab and Haryana High Court to Uttrakhand

High Court by restoring her judicial    functioning. It is accordingly

contended that this establishes that no prima facie case for criminal

prosecution of the petitioner was made out. This argument is

farfetched and it will not be wrong if, I may say fallacious as no

material has come on record in this regard. The transfer of a High

Court Judge is purely an administrative decision. What weighs with

the competent authority (Collegium) (on the administrative side) while

considering the transfer of a Judge of the High Court cannot be

imported into statutory function to be discharged by the competent

authority. This argument thus deserves outright rejection.

</p><p id="p_83">69.   It has been argued by Mr.Anupam Gupta that grant or refusal

of sanction is an affirmative action. Whether refusal or grant it must

be     by a valid order. He has relied upon the case of

<a href="/doc/811423/" id="a_124">S.A.Venkataraman v. The State</a>, 1958 AIR S.C. 107. In this case, a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   46</span>

report    under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_125">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. was presented before the

competent court wherein it was submitted that although prosecution

was recommended, the Government decided to deal with the

accused departmentally. The Magistrate accordingly ordered closing

of the investigating and discharged the accused. Later on

prosecution of the accused was recommended on the same material

and same allegation by filing a fresh complaint. It was pleaded on

behalf of the accused that once sanction has been declined, it cannot

be reconsidered and it amounts to abuse of the process of the court

to allow prosecution to be recommended after              it has been

withdrawn. On examination of the issue, Hon'ble Supreme court held

as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_64">             "(19). We have examined the correspondence which
             has been referred to in the petition for special leave
             and which is to be found on the record of this case.
             There is nothing in them to establish the allegation that
             a sanction for    the prosecution of the appellant was
             positively refused.      All that is indicated is that the
             Government chose        to proceed against the appellant
             departmentally. It can hardly be said that in doing so the
             Government had positively refused to grant sanction
             for the prosecution of the           appellant. Indeed,
             it may be legitimately said that the Government
             preferred to &amp;wait the result of a departmental enquiry. If
             that enquiry exonerated the appellant the occasion
             for granting a sanction may not arise. If, on the other
             band, the departmental enquiry established the allegation
             against the appellant, the Government might find
             itself in possession of       more     material than that
             disclosed by       the police investigation on which to
             decide whether a sanction should         or should not be
             granted. We cannot read into         the correspondence,
             as was suggested on behalf of the appellant, that there
             was a promise on the part of the Government          not to
             prosecute the appellant.

</blockquote>

<p id="p_84">70.   From the ratio of the aforesaid judgment, it emerges that even if

a formal order of refusal of sanction may not be necessary, however,

a positive order of refusal must exist to attract the bar of review. In

the present case, there is absolutely no material        on record to

indicate that there is a positive refusal even at the level of Hon'ble

CJI with due application of mind what to say of the final sanctioning

authority i.e. the President of India.
</p>
<p id="p_85">71.   Mr. Tulsi has also challenged the order of sanction on various

other grounds and reasoning. It is argued that the impugned sanction

order does not refer to an earlier order or   opinion of CJI to decline

sanction. It does not refer to any fresh material while granting the

sanction. To examine the veracity of this argument, reference needs

to be made to the record. It is even admitted case of the petitioner

that Special Judge vide his order dated 26.3.2010 directed further

investigation. The present charge-sheet has been filed on the basis

of second investigation report of the CBI dated 7.7.2010. On the

result of the further investigation, a fresh proposal dated 16.6.2010

was made by the CBI to the Ministry of Law and Justice. Revised

S.P's report has been considered by the Ministry of Law and Justice

and forwarded to Hon'ble CJI where upon Hon'ble CJI recorded his

opinion/consideration and recommended grant of sanction for

prosecution on 28.7.2010 as is evident from File No.K11017/9/2009-

VS-II produced before me. Copy of the revised investigation report

was also placed before Hon'ble CJI for consideration. Thus the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                       48</span>

argument that no reference is made to the fresh material is contrary

to record and without any substance which deserves rejection. The

next argument of Mr. Tulsi          that no reference is made to earlier

opinion of the CJI declining sanction, also deserves to be rejected in

view of the detailed discussion made here in above as no such

opinion/consultation of the Hon'ble CJI declining the sanction is

available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_86">72.   Now coming to the principal question argued by Mr. Tulsi

regarding reviewability of the sanction order, in the case of Nishant

Sareen (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that review on the

basis of the same material is         impermissible. In the same judgment

in para 12, it has been          said that   it is not an absolute rule that

sanction once      refused in exercise of       statutory power cannot be

reconsidered at a subsequent stage. While               acknowledging the

power of review, it has been held that power is not unbridled or

unrestricted. The embargo for review is on the same material and

without any fresh inputs. Similarly, in case of Mohammed Iqbal

Bhatti (supra),      it has been noticed that no fresh material was

produced at the time of reconsideration and no reason has been

recorded for such reconsideration. Similar is the ratio in the case of

Gopikant Choudhary (supra). However, in the present case, at the

first place, there was no refusal at any stage or at least a positive

view or    order for refusal to grant sanction and thus, the question of

review or reconsideration does not arise. Even if it is assumed that

the note recorded in the letter of Mr. Meena, is to be construed as a

refusal, indubitably further investigation was carried out which

persuaded the Hon'ble CJI and the sanctioning authority to grant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   49</span>

sanction. As per the affidavit of Ms. Neela Gangadharan, file was

placed before the competent authority only once in February, 2011,

after obtaining the concurrence of Hon'ble CJI in July, 2010.     At no

earlier stage, the file seems to have been produced before Hon'ble

CJI or before the sanctioning authority (President of India). Since

there was no earlier refusal, there was no occasion for review or

reconsideration. In view of the dictum of various judgments referred

to above, review is permissible on the      basis of fresh inputs and

even for other valid reasons. Assuming in a given case, the

sanctioning authority makes an order of declining sanction, even

without looking to any material and without due application of mind

and subsequently,         such authority reviews its own opinion on

consideration of      material produced and application of mind, this

definitely falls within the purview of other valid reasons providing an

occasion to the sanctioning authority to review its earlier decision and

grant sanction. Such an order would be legally valid and has the

sanction of law.
</p>
<p id="p_87">73.   A long debate has been made by Mr. Tulsi seeking disclosure

of the documents pleading that this would enable the petitioner to

effectively argue the case before this Court. He claimed disclosure

of all documents relied upon by the CBI, which, inter alia, include

statements of witnesses, opinion of CBI, opinion of Attorney

Generals, opinion of Hon'ble CJI.     It is submitted that no document

is immune from disclosure as no privilege is claimed by the CBI or

Government of India. It is further argued that the petitioner has a

fundamental right to access to all documents which have been relied

upon by the investigating agency against her otherwise it amounts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   50</span>

to denial of justice. According to Mr. Tulsi, the public interest of

disclosure far outweighs immunity. He has referred to the

Constitution Bench judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_126">S.P.Gupta vs. Union of

India</a>, (1981) Supp. SCC 87 in particular reference to paragraphs 63

to 66, 69, 70, 72, 75 to 85. Issue debated before Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the above judgment was transfer and non-confirmation of

High Court Judges. It is in this context that Hon'ble Supreme Court

desired to examine the correspondence between the Law Minister,

Chief Justice of     High Court and Chief Justice of India for which

privilege was claimed by the State. After referring to and reading the

above mentioned paragraphs, the sum and substance of Mr. Tulsi's

argument is that none of the documents and files produced before

this Court are entitled to any immunity from disclosure. It is submitted

that keeping in view the nature of proceedings being criminal, any

document capable of establishing the illegality of the criminal

proceedings initiated against the petitioner, public interest of

disclosure outweighs immunity. According to Mr. Tulsi, any document

which may be       inspected by this Court from the record produced

necessarily requires disclosure to the petitioner who is facing a

criminal charge. Non-disclosure offends <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_127">Article 21</a> of the Constitution

of India which guarantees right to liberty to a citizen of this country

and particularly, to a person accused of criminal offence which

ultimately leads to curbing liberty, if finally convicted. He has also

debated that openness of the Government is the foundation of

democracy. Referring to observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,

it is stated that secrecy encourages oppression, corruption and

misuse. It is further contended that documents relating to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                    51</span>

question of sanction by the competent authority are not documents

belonging to noxious class.
</p>
<p id="p_88">74.   There is no dispute in the contentions raised by Mr. Tulsi in

regard to the right of the accused to disclosure of any incriminating

document which may be basis for his/her prosecution for a criminal

offence. It is unfettered constitutional and fundamental right of an

accused to ask for any document relied upon by the investigating

agency     and which is the basis of a criminal charge/trial of an

accused. However, the moot question arises as to at what stage, in

what manner and the forum where the accused can exercise such a

right. Another allied question is can the accused ask for inspection

and    disclosure    of   unspecified   documents   and   files   of   the

investigation/government. All documents and evidence relied upon by

the prosecution is part of the charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_128">Section 173</a> of the

Cr.P.C., a copy whereof has been furnished to the petitioner which,

inter alia, includes the copy of the sanction order, statement of

witnesses and the record collected by the Investigating Agency

during the course of investigation. If the Investigating Agency or the

prosecution relies upon any other further material, they are bound to

produce the same in the trial court with its leave or if the trial court

may so direct for the purpose of trial in terms of <a href="/doc/788840/" id="a_129">Section 91</a> of the

Cr.P.C. Disclosure of      unspecified document has been asked for by

the petitioner. In fact it is a sweeping statement that all documents

and the notings of the record of the government be disclosed to the

petitioner in the present quashing petition. While acknowledging the

right of the accused for disclosure of the material sought to be used

against his/her, the accused cannot claim a right for disclosure of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                   52</span>

unspecified     material, irrespective of the fact whether it has any

bearing on the case or not. Such a disclosure is not envisaged under

any law. The accused has a right to specify any document to be

summoned by the court whether in defence or even may be

otherwise and the trial court in such an eventuality is bound to

consider the request of the accused, if the material/document is

relevant and has nexus with the trial of the case, be it in the nature

of a defence of the accused or to demolish the prosecution case.

However, no such right can be exercised by the accused while

seeking quashment invoking jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_130">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.

The accused        cannot adopt any short-circuit method to ask for

documents and materials which may be part of the defence of the

accused and plead for its production/disclosure in quashing petition.

The inherent powers of this Court are to be exercised to scrutinize

the material relied upon by the prosecution/investigating agency for

the criminal prosecution of an accused to arrive at a conclusion

whether the criminal prosecution is to be allowed to continue or

scuttled at the budding stage. In my humble view, recourse sought

to be adopted by the petitioner is unwarranted in law.

</p><p id="p_89">75.    The plea of the petitioner is also to be weighed in the light of

the observations made here-in-above. On the basis of the record

examined by this Court. It has been found that there exists no

opinion of the then Hon'ble CJI on the proposal of the CBI dated

15.1.2009 declining prosecution. Thus, the question of disclosing

such     non-existent material does not arise. Otherwise whatever

material is available on record is even relied upon by the petitioner

herself in this petition and is part of the trial court record. What has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                  53</span>

been in fact examined by this Court is the sequence of          events

leading to the final consideration by the competent authorities for

grant of sanction or if the prosecution has withheld any relevant

material having bearing on the innocence or legality of criminal

proceedings against her. I have no doubt in my mind that this Court

has not relied upon any incriminating material not disclosed to the

petitioner during the trial which constitutes the basis for charge

against the petitioner. In so far as the opinion of the       Attorney

General is concerned         on which heavy reliance is placed by the

petitioner, in view of the ratio of the judgment in Taj Corridor case

(supra), such opinion is irrelevant and is not to be forwarded to the

trial court with the charge-sheet and thus      possibly the petitioner

cannot claim its disclosure. Opinion depicts only thought process of

an expert on any issue and does not constitute          a substantive

evidence or material. In any case, relevant part of       the opinions

formulated by the two learned Attorney Generals of India have also

been extracted        here-in-above just to test the veracity of the

petitioner's contention made before this Court and cannot be relied

upon either by the prosecution or        the defence as a substantive

piece of evidence during the trial. In the case of <a href="/doc/7496/" id="a_131">State of Orissa vs.

Debendra Nath Padhi</a>, (2005) 1 SCC 568,             the question arose

whether the accused has a right to seek production of documents to

prove his innocence at the time of framing of charge, in addition to

the material/documents submitted by the Investigating Agency. The

accused claimed right for production of such documents invoking

Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. On consideration of

the right of the accused in the light of the provisions of Section 227
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                     54</span><a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_132">

of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, Hon'ble Supreme Court held as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">             "18.We are unable to accept the aforesaid contention.
             The reliance on Articles 14 and 21 is misplaced. The
             scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_133"> of the Code</a> and object with which <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_134">Section 227</a>
             was incorporated and Sections 207 and 207 (A) omitted
             have already been noticed. Further, at the stage of
             framing of charge        roving and fishing inquiry is
             impermissible. If the contention of the accused is
             accepted, there would be a mini trial at the stage of
             framing of charge. That would defeat the object<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_135"> of the
             Code</a>. It is well-settled that at the stage of framing of
             charge the defence of the accused cannot be put forth.
             The acceptance of the contention of the learned counsel
             for the accused would mean permitting the accused to
             adduce his defence at the stage of framing
             of charge and for examination thereof at that stage which
             is against the        criminal jurisprudence.    By way of
             illustration, it may be noted that the plea of alibi taken by
             the accused may have to be examined at the stage of
             framing of charge if the contention of the accused is
             accepted despite the well settled proposition that it is for
             the accused to lead evidence at the trial to sustain such
             a plea. The accused would be entitled to produce
             materials and documents in proof of such a plea at the
             stage of framing of the charge, in case we accept the
             contention put forth on behalf of the accused. That has
             never been the intention of the law well settled for over
             one hundred years now. It is in this light that the provision
             about hearing        the submssions of the accused as
             postulated by <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_136">Section 227</a> is to be understood. It only
             means hearing the submissions of the accused on the
             record of the case as filed by the prosecution and
             documents submitted therewith and nothing more. The
             expression 'hearing the submissions of the accused'
             cannot mean opportunity to file material to be granted to
             the accused and thereby changing the settled law. At
             the state of framing of charge hearing the submissions of
             the accused has to be confined to the material produced
             by the police."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_90">76.   The petitioner thus has          undisputed right to ask for any

documents not disclosed in the charge-sheet, if she desires so and

ask for the same, subject to its relevance to the trial. However, at the

pre trial stage before this Court, the petitioner cannot ask for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54"> Crl.Misc. No. M- 14289 of 2011                                    55</span>

disclosure of unspecified and wholesome of documents. It is settled

law that jurisdiction of civil and criminal courts is unlimited whereas

the jurisdiction of the High Court in exercise of inherent power is only

confined to the scrutiny of the existing material and legal infirmity, if

any, to sustain the criminal charge. Thus powers of this Court are

circumscribed      by law.       In view of the law laid down by Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the case of Debendra Nath Padhi (supra) and

other related factors discussed here-in-above, in my humble opinion,

the plea of the petitioner is not only unwarranted, but unreasonable

and irrational too.     The contention of the petitioner is accordingly

rejected.

<p id="p_92">78.   Merely because the petitioner has enjoyed one of the highest

constitutional offices, she cannot claim any special right or privilege

as an accused than prescribed under law. Rule of law has to prevail

and must prevail equally and uniformly, irrespective of the status of

an individual. Taking a panoptic view of all the factual and legal

issues, I find no valid ground for judicial intervention in exercise of

petition is dismissed.
