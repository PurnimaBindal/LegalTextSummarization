                           a similar order was necessary to be passed in the present case. Learned
                          senior counsel for the parties were requested to confine their submissions
                          only to the above proposition. This request was made as it was not felt
                          appropriate, at this stage to go into the merits of the contentions of the
                          defendant in the absence of their reply on record. Further, in any case the
                          Coordinate Bench had given a detailed reasoned order while passing interim
                          injunction in favour of the plaintiffs herein. I may note that the injunction
                          applications were not disposed of vide the said orders by the Coordinate

                          passed by this court. Firstly, reliance was placed on the observations of the
                          Division Bench in FAO(OS)(COMM) 139/2020 titled as <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_7">AstraZeneca AB
                          &amp; ANR. vs. Intas Pharmaceutical          Ltd</a>., dated 20.07.2021 where the
                          Division Bench observed that the suits arising from the same patent should
                          be clubbed and heard by the same bench to save judicial time. It is urged
                          that the first case in the present lot filed by the plaintiffs was CS(COMM)
                          342/<a href="/doc/190315997/" id="a_8">2019 Bristol-Myers Squibb Holdings Ireland Unlimited Company &amp;

</p><p id="p_23">                          14.   It is urged that pursuant to the directions of the Division Bench, the
                          said matter is still pending adjudication before a Coordinate Bench. Hence,
                          it is urged that as that was the first suit filed by the plaintiffs, this court may
                          transfer the present suit to be heard by the said Coordinate Bench in
                          accordance with the directions of the Division Bench in FAO(OS)(COMM)
                          139/2020 alongwith CS(COMM) 342/2019. In the meantime, it is urged that
                          an opportunity should be given to the defendant to file its reply/written
                          statement and documents to demonstrate as to why on merits, no interim
                          order should be passed in favour of the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_24">                          15.   Secondly, it was urged by the learned senior counsel for the defendant
                          that the orders of the Coordinate Bench, relied upon by the plaintiffs, were
                          per incuriam and not binding on this court. Reliance was placed on the
                          judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/102030495/" id="a_9">Sandeep Kumar Bafna v.
                          State of Maharashtra &amp; Anr</a>., 2014 (16) SCC 623. It was strongly urged
                          that plaintiff No.1 has admitted that it was granted Indian Patent No.243917
                          on 11.11.2010 which expired on 17.12.2019. It is stated that the plaintiffs
                          wrongly claimed that IN 243917 generically covers millions of compounds
                          including Apixaban by virtue of the Markush claim which does not
                          specifically disclose Apixaban. Hence, it is urged that the plaintiffs are
                          seeking to claim that the product Apixaban is covered by two registered
                          Patents, namely, IN 243917 which has expired and the present Patent IN
                          247381. It is pointed out that such a view was rejected by this court in

                           interim orders in favour of the plaintiffs ignored all the above noted
                          judgments which were the earlier view of this court.
</p><p id="p_25">                          16.    It is further stated that the said view has also been rejected now
                          categorically by the Division Bench in the aforenoted judgment of
                          <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_12">AstraZeneca AB &amp; Anr. v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.,(supra). It is urged
                          that the earlier orders passed by the Coordinate Bench are not binding on
                          this court and this court should not pass interim orders based on the above.
</p><p id="p_26">                          17.    It is also strongly urged that in CS(COMM) 342/2019, i.e. the first
                          suit filed by the plaintiffs titled as <a href="/doc/190315997/" id="a_13">Bristol-Myers Squibb Holdings Ireland
                          Unlimited Company &amp; Ors. v. Natco Pharma Limited</a>, no interim order has
                          been passed so for. It is pleaded that on a parity of facts, as the factual
                          position in the present suit and the said suit being CS(COMM) 342/2019 are
                          identical, this court should follow the said order which is the earlier order
                          and not pass interim orders.
</p><p id="p_27">                          18.    The third plea that was strongly urged before this court was that in
                          any case, the facts of this case are virtually identical to the facts of the case
                          that   was   decided     by    the   Division   Bench     on    20.07.2021        in
                          FAO(OS)(COMM) 139/2020, titled <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_14">AstraZeneca AB &amp; Anr. v. Intas
                          Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.,(supra). Hence, it is urged that this court would be
                          bound by the said Division Bench judgment.
</p><p id="p_28">                          19.    Learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs has, however, strongly urged
                          that the earlier orders pointed out by the plaintiffs as noted above are all
                          interim orders. The concept of the law of per incuriam has no application to
                          such interim orders. Reliance is placed on the judgments of the Supreme
                          Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1488034/" id="a_15">State of U.P. &amp; Anr. v. Synthetics And Chemicals Ltd.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                &quot;5. From the proximity of the dates of the impugned
                                orders/judgments, it appears that the hearing on the applications
                                for interim injunction, before both the Hon&#x27;ble Judges, took
                                place simultaneously. It is inexplicable, why the
                                appellants/plaintiffs, who have argued all these nine appeals as
                                one and not separately, did not have the two sets of suits
                                clubbed before the same Commercial Division and which would
                                have saved the judicial time spent in the adjudication
                                undertaken by one of the Judges. It appears that the
                                appellants/plaintiffs were taking a chance, of arguing on the
                                same subject and controversy, before two Courts. However the
                                appellants/plaintiffs failed before both.

<p id="p_33">                          24.   Clearly, a perusal of the above para shows that the facts were entirely
                          different in the aforenoted appeal being <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_19">AstraZeneca AB &amp; Anr. v. Intas

                          arguments on the interim injunction applications. In the present case, none
                          of the benches, namely, the present bench where the above noted six suits

                          is pending has commenced hearing arguments on the injunction application.

                               priority date from 23rd December, 1998. Finally the plaintiff was

<p id="p_35">                               On the previous proceedings held before the Division Bench in

                               quo as on 5th July, 2019 before passing of the impugned order to

                               that the Division Bench was of the view that the learned Single
                               Judge in the order dated 5th July, 2019 did not advert itself to the
                               triple test essential for grant of an interim injunction, that is, (i) a
                               prima facie case, (ii) irreparable loss, and (iii) balance of
                               convenience. The Division Bench despite having set aside the
                               interim order dated 5th July, 2019 directed the defendant therein,
                               that is, NATCO Pharma Ltd. to maintain status quo as on 5 th

</p><p id="p_37">                              &quot;18. Case of the defendant is that in case the admission of the
                              defendant is being looked into that the defendant is selling the
                              drug ZAPIXA which is a generic version of APIXABAN, the
                              admission of the plaintiff that the drug APIXABAN is covered
                              by the patent IN-917 validity whereof expires on 17th December,
                              2019 is also to be considered. This Court has already noted the
                              pleadings of the plaintiffs both in the present plaint as also in the
                              complaint filed before the United States District Court, District

                              which is heavily relied upon by the defendant however, the
                              consistent claim of the plaintiff is IN-917 is the genus patent for
                              the markush formula covering millions of compounds however,
                              the specific disclosure of APIXABAN is in IN-381.

                                certainly do not wish the law of patent in this country to
                                develop on lines where there may be o vast gap between the
                                coverage and the disclosure under the patent; where the
                                scope of the patent is determined not on the intrinsic worth
                                of the invention but by the artful drafting of its claims by
                                skillful lawyers, and where patents are traded as a
                                commodity not for production and marketing of the patented
                                products but to search for someone who may be sued for

</p><p id="p_42">                              20. Thus the decision in Novartis AG (supra) does not rule out
                              that when a genus patent has been granted no species patent can
                              be granted, however the caution raised by the Supreme Court is
                              that the Courts should determine the scope of the patent from the
                              intrinsic worth of the invention and not on the artful drafting of
                              the claims.

                              it is clear that the validity of the suit patent IN-381 is till 17th

                              APIXABAN, the plaintiffs have made out a strong prima facie
                              case in their favour. In case the plaintiffs are not granted an
                              adinterim injunction, the plaintiffs would suffer an irreparable
                              loss as per the own showing of the defendant as noted in para 17
                              above which notes that the Oral Anticoagulant market is worth of
                              399 Cr. and growing at the rate of 17%. It also notes that
                              Apixaban is having highest CAGR of 56% among all Oral
                              Anticoagulants available in market. The balance of convenience
                              also lies in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendant for
                              the reason admittedly the defendant is yet to launch its product in
                              the market.

                          court/Coordinate bench in six different matters has passed interim orders in
                          the six suits filed by the plaintiffs herein against different defendants who
                          had sought to infringe the suit patent in question „Apixaban‟/IN 247381.
                          Against these interim orders, appeals were filed by the respective defendants
                          in the said suits before the Division Bench, first of which appeal, it is stated,
                          had come up for hearing on 19.12.2019. These are FAO(OS)(COMM)
                          371/2019, 372/2019, 377/2019, 3/2020 and 29/2020. These matters are
                          pending before the Division Bench. At some stage, these matters were part-
                          heard. However, no order has been passed staying the said interim orders
                          passed by the Coordinate Bench. I am informed that the matters have now
                          been listed by the Division Bench for arguments on 31.08.2021.

                          The Division Bench did not stay the said orders and the appeals are pending.

                          submissions raised by the different defendant. Such a step would not be in

                          dated 12.12.2019 the court has specifically noted the plea of the defendants

                           243917 which expired on 17.12.2019. This court noted that the consistent
                          claim of the plaintiff is that IN 243917 is the genius Patent for the Markush
                          formula covering millions of compounds. However, the specific disclosure
                          of Apixaban is IN 247381. The court further held that the judgment of the
                          Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_28">Novartis AG v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., (2013) 6 SCC 1
                          does not rule out that when a genius patent has been granted, no species
                          patent can be granted. The court accordingly passed the interim order.
</p><p id="p_56">                          34.    It was further urged that the aforesaid view of the Coordinate Bench
                          in the aforesaid six interim orders passed was contrary to the view taken by
                          the other Coordinate Benches of this court in <a href="/doc/112512943/" id="a_29">AstraZeneca AB &amp; Anr. v.
                          P.Kumar &amp; Anr</a>.(supra) and <a href="/doc/18425473/" id="a_30">EISAI Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Satish Reddy &amp;
                          Anr</a>.(surpa). It was also strongly urged that the legal position has been
                          elaborated now by the Division Bench of this court in this case of
                          <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_31">AstraZeneca AB &amp; Anr. v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.,(supra) in its
                          judgment dated 20.07.2021. The Division Bench in the said judgment noted
                          as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                &quot;46. In our opinion, a single formulation as DAPA, is incapable
                                of protection under two separate patents having separate validity
                                period. The appellants/plaintiffs, in their pleadings, are not found
                                to have pleaded the difference, save for pleading that DAPA was
                                discovered by further research. From the field of the invention
                                subject matter of the two patents being verbatim same, at this
                                stage, it also appears that there is no enhancement of the known
                                efficacy, within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_32">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act, between
                                the product subject matter of IN 147 and the product subject
                                matter of IN 625.</blockquote>

<p id="p_57">                                47. To hold, that an inventor, merely on the basis of his work,
                                research, discovery and prior art, but which has not yielded any
                                product capable of commercial exploitation, is entitled, by

                                 obtaining patent thereof, to restrain others from researching in the
                                same field, would in our view, not be conducive to research and
                                development and would also be violative of the fundamental
                                duties of the citizens of this country, enshrined in <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_33">Article 51A</a> of
                                the Constitution of India, to develop the scientific temper and a
                                spirit of inquiry. The same will enable busy bodies to, by walking

<p id="p_58">                          35.    Having noted the observations of the Division Bench, in my opinion,
                          for purpose of passing of an interim order, the facts and the circumstances of
                          each case would be different. There would not be complete parity in the
                          facts that were subject matter of the order of the Division Bench in
                          <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_34">AstraZeneca AB &amp; Anr. v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.,(supra) or in the
                          earlier orders of the Coordinate Bench in <a href="/doc/112512943/" id="a_35">AstraZeneca AB &amp; Anr. v.
                          P.Kumar &amp; Anr</a>., (supra) or in <a href="/doc/18425473/" id="a_36">EISAI Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Satish Reddy &amp;
                          Anr</a>., (supra). In any case, as noted above, appeals against the interim
                          orders of the Predecessor Bench are pending before the Division Bench and
                          are coming up for hearing on 31.08.2021. The pleas which are raised by the
                          defendant have to be considered either at the time of arguments before the
                          Division Bench or at the time of disposal of the interim injunction
                          applications that are pending adjudication now before this court. It would be
                          improper for this court to ignore the aforesaid injunctions orders passed by
                          the Predecessor Bench for the stated infringement of the same patent filed
                          by the same plaintiffs.
