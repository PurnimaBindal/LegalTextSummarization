PLAINTIFF'S SUBMISSIONS :
</p>
<p id="p_22">
INTENTION TO MALIGN


</p><p id="p_23">3.      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendantfs video is a

        targeted attack directed against the Plaintiffs product made with an attempt to

        attract more viewers towards his video. He submitted that the Impugned Video

        provides incorrect information and deceives the viewer into believing that the tests

        conducted therein substantiate the claim of the Defendant that the Plaintiffs product

        is of inferior quality and / or is inferior to other oils.
</p>
<p id="p_24">3.1 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the impugned video as a

        whole is disparaging and denigrating in nature. He submitted that the Impugned

        Video maliciously published by the Defendant comprises of words and visuals, in

        respect of the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL, which are false in nature

        and which have not only denigrated the Plaintiffs product but also caused and likely

        to further cause special damage to the Plaintif. He submitted that since the

        Defendant claims that creation and publication of such videos is his occupation /

        calling and source of livelihood, the Defendantfs review cannot be equated or treated

        at par with any other review provided by an ordinary consumer since the intention of

        an ordinary consumer is not to generate viewership or hits and consequently earn

        revenues from the impact created by the Impugned Video. He further submitted that

        the Defendant promotes a competing product PURE &amp; SURE organic cold pressed

        coconut oil in his Impugned Video in substitution for the product of the Plaintif and

        urges the viewers to stop using the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL. He

        submitted that the Defendant seeks to promote two other competing products by

        providing links for purchasing these products from online retailers such as

        www.amazon.com. He submitted that the acts of the Defendant fall under the

        category of 'commercial activitiesf and not a general review of the product by an

        ordinary consumer.
</p>
<p id="p_25">3.2 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendant in his video

        is spreading a false message with respect to the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE

        COCONUT OIL insinuating inter alia that:
</p>
<p id="p_26">        a)    The packaging of the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is inferior

              and that the cap of the bottle of the PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is fimsy;

</p><p id="p_27">        b)    The fragrance of the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is very strong

              and it smells similar to a rotten coconut;
</p>
<p id="p_28">        c)    The packaging of the product does not mention the grade of the coconut used,

              where they have been extracted from and which coconut it has been extracted

              from;
</p>
<p id="p_29">        d)    From the tests conducted by the Defendant, the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE

              COCONUT OIL is inferior to organic cold pressed oils;
</p>
<p id="p_30">        e)    The favour of PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL suggests that the oil is made

              from poor quality coconuts or is heated to a high temperature;

</p><p id="p_31">        f)    The Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL has impurities and that the

              same are seen once the oil is frozen;

        h)    The antibacterial properties or antifungal properties and nutrients in

</pre><p id="p_34">              PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL are less due to the processing it undergoes;

3.3 With reference to these statements / insinuations made by the Defendant in the

        video, the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted:

</p><p id="p_35">        a)    That it is inconceivable that the Defendant who claims that he promotes PURE

              &amp; SURE coconut oil since 'he consumes it himselff, presumably on a regular

              basis and has used only one bottle of the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE

              COCONUT OIL is in a position to make a bald statement that the cap often

              breaks. He submitted that on the contrary, the Plaintif has stated that it has

              received the INDIA STAR Packaging Award 2017 across 12 categories;

</p><p id="p_36">        b)    That the Defendantfs insinuation that the Plaintiffs product is made of rotten

              coconuts is not an honest or fair opinion and cannot be equated in any manner

              or form with a hyperbole or an exaggerated statement not to be taken literally.

              He submitted that the truth is that the aroma of the Parachute Coconut oil is

              natural and characteristic of Copra;
</p>
<p id="p_37">        c)    That since the packaging of the Plaintiffs product does not mention the grade

              of the coconut used, where they have been extracted from and which coconut it

              has been extracted from, the Defendant is attempting to imply that there is

              some information sought to be concealed by the Plaintif since the coconuts

              used are of inferior quality, which is factually incorrect;

</p><p id="p_38">        d)    That the Defendant fails to mention the nature of the impurities in the

              Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL. Sedimentation and particulate

              matter is in fact characteristics of any coconut oil;

              unrefned and therefore has not undergone any processing but makes a

              contradictory claim that the antibacterial properties or anti fungal properties

              and nutrients in PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL are less due to the

              processing it undergoes.
</p>
<p id="p_42">3.4 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendant ought to

        have conducted proper research or relied on lab reports before coming to the

        conclusion and making the video. He submitted that the least that the Defendant

        could have done was to have conducted enquiries with the Plaintif to ascertain the

        truth/facts before making the false, reckless and disparaging statements in the Video

        since the impression given by the use of forceful, decisive and assertive

        statements/phrases in the Impugned Video is that the Defendant is an expert and has

        undertaken extensive research on the topic and / or is drawing conclusions on the

        basis of sound and thorough groundwork, research etc.

3.5     The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif further submitted that the Defendantfs

        malice is evinced by the denigrating replies posted by the Defendant on the

        conducted either by the Defendant or through an independent testing centre to

        submitted that the alleged test conducted by the Defendant is a wrong test and the

        conducted any tests whatsoever to evaluate the nutritional value of the

        able to see his video, read both the positive and negative comments, and decide for

        themselves whether to believe the Defendant or not. He submitted that this

        establishes that the Defendantfs objective was to educate his viewers. He submitted

5.2 The Ld. Advocate for the Defendant also submitted that the Defendantfs ofer to

        delete some portions of his video, in his reply to the Plaintiffs cease and desist

        notice, was a concession / good faith attempt made to fnally settle the matter, not an

        admission of wrongdoing. Relying upon this Courtfs judgment in <a href="/doc/85721592/" id="a_5">Dilip Kumar vs.

        Plaintif from a false / defamatory statement cannot be presumed in cases involving

        the tort of disparagement of goods. He submitted that the Plaintif has not adduced

        any evidence whatsoever to show that the Plaintif has sufered any damage arising

        out of the Impugned Video. He submitted that the Plaintif has shown no proof that

        its revenues have gone down since the Impugned Video was uploaded and the same

        was a result of the Impugned Video. He submitted that the mere fact that somebody

        has viewed the Impugned Video does not mean that they have been infuenced into

        refusing to buy the Plaintiffs product. He submitted that the Defendantfs video has

        been "liked" only by 2,500 viewers, which is only 2.31% of those who viewed the

        video; that the Plaintif has not been able to show that 2,500 of its customers have not

        bought the Plaintiffs product. He submitted that the Defendantfs video has been

        "disliked" by 397 viewers which shows that the Defendantfs viewers are intelligent

        and discerning, and they exercise their independent judgment when they view the

        Defendantfs video. He submitted that the Defendantfs viewers are intelligent and

        college-educated and several comments which have been posted by viewers on the

        page of the Impugned Video show that the Defendantfs viewers have viewed the

        Defendantfs video with healthy skepticism.

7.3 The Ld. Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the Defendant is neither a trader

        / manufacturer nor a rival of the Plaintiffs goods and as such, the tort of

        disparagement of goods / slander of goods does not apply to him. Relying upon the

        judgments in <a href="/doc/55113949/" id="a_9">Hindustan Unilever vs. Gujarat Cooperative</a> (supra), <a href="/doc/98659454/" id="a_10">Gujarat

        <a href="/doc/156668197/" id="a_11">Hindustan Unilever Ltd. vs. Cavincare Pvt. Ltd</a>. 8 he submitted that courts in India

        have held that the tort of disparagement of goods / slander of goods applies only to

        rival manufacturers / traders / competitors of the Plaintif.

7.4 He submitted that the tort of disparagement of goods / slander of goods is a specie of

        libel / defamation and the plea of justifcation is available to the Defendant. He

        submitted that the Defendant has appeared before this Court and stated that he seeks

        to take the plea of justifcation; that the Defendant has also mentioned evidence by

        which he will substantiate his case. He submitted that this is sufcient in order to

        refuse an interlocutory injunction in favor of the Plaintif. He submitted that the

        Defendant has also established, prima facie, that he is likely to succeed at the trial. He

        relied on the decision of this Court in the case of Dr. Yashwant Trivedi vs. Indian

        Express Newspapers9, more particularly the second paragraph of the judgment, and

        submitted that the law in India is that where a Defendant merely takes the plea of

        justifcation and "mentions" evidence on which he is going to rely upon, an interim

        injunction must be refused.

                    commenting on the efcacy of goods manufactured by large multinational
                    companies, are sought to be shut out through medium of courts. While an

                    interest of the consumers to know must be guarded - even if the
                    dissemination of information is by way of an advertisement which
                    exaggerates the virtues of the traders goods. Public debate is good. The
                    only caution that the defendant-trader has to bear in mind is that his
                    advertisement does fall within the four corners of what constitutes in law
                    malicious falsehood. Consequently, the courts are slow to grant interim
                    relief if the defendant has set up an arguable case that the impugned

<p id="p_81">8.1 Relying upon the Supreme Courtfs decision in R. Rajagopal vs. State of Tamil

         Nadu10 the Ld. Advocate for the Defendant submitted that though prior restraints

         are legal in India, they can only be imposed if the statute itself clearly prescribes a

         prior restraint. He submitted that <a href="/doc/1845834/" id="a_13">Section 40</a> of the Food Safety and <a href="/doc/79442359/" id="a_14">Standards Act</a>,

         2006, does not impose any prior restraints, i.e., it does not require that a person must

         Sons (supra) it has been held that hyperboles do not constitute defamation.

8.3 The Ld. Advocate for the Defendant submitted that the Plaintif is not likely to sufer

         any irreparable harm if the Impugned Video is retained on YouTube. He submitted

         that the number of views on the said video has now stagnated; that it is not as though

         the video is going viral or that millions of viewers are viewing the video everyday. He

         submitted that there is no imminent likelihood of any damage to the Plaintif. He

         submitted that it would be preferable for the Plaintif to prepare its own video

         countering the video of the Defendant, rather than seeking to impose a prior restraint

         on the Defendant through an interim injunction. In support of his submission, he

PLAINTIFF'S REJOINDER:


</pre><p id="p_83">9.      The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif stated that the Defendantfs intention is not

        merely to educate his audience or to inform them about the diferent types of coconut

        oils or its manufacturing processes or advantages as falsely claimed by the Defendant.

        He submitted that the Defendant through this Impugned Video seeks to malign the

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL which is apparent from the landing

        screen of the video which states, "IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THINK!! I'LL

        PROVE IT!!!!".
</p>
<p id="p_84">9.1 He submitted that if the Defendant intended to create an educative video with the

        consumerfs interest in mind and to bust the tricks used by companies to fool

        consumers, the Defendant should have approached any independent laboratory to

        conduct tests and to give verifed results to the consumers. He submitted that the

        <a href="/doc/1766145/" id="a_18">Food Safety Standards Act</a>, 2006 in <a href="/doc/1845834/" id="a_19">Section 40</a> provides for a remedy whereby a

        Purchaser can have a food analysed by a Food Analyst on payment of a fee and can

        receive a report in respect of the product from the Food Analyst. He submitted that

        the false reason given during the course of the hearing for not taking this recourse

        was high costs, whereas, the fee prescribed for the procedure under the said Act is

        only Rs.5000/-.

<p id="p_85">9.2 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendantfs argument

        that he could not be forced to take action before making a comment since it would

        restraint but to test the bonafdes of the Defendant in the context that bald, false,

Comparison is of CO vs. VCO


</p><p id="p_87">10. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that as per the depiction in the

        Impugned Video, the impression which is created by the Defendant is that the oil

        used by the Defendant for the purposes of comparison with the PARACHUTE

        COCONUT OIL and for performing the tests is a cold pressed organic coconut oil

        which is also made from Copra. However, the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif

        pointed out that the Defendant in its Afdavit in Reply has stated that the he used

        "...pure, unrefned, unprocessed, virgin, cold pressed coconut oil" in the video. He

        submitted that the Defendant has in fact passed of virgin coconut oil as cold pressed

        organic oil in the Impugned Video and poured the same in the glass marked

        "ORGANIC" to falsely depict and create an impression that organic cold pressed oil

        made from copra was clear and to thereafter draw an incorrect conclusion that the

        PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL which is also made from copra was yellowish and

        hence of inferior quality. He submitted that the material produced by the Defendant

        is not for cold pressed organic oil, but for virgin coconut oils which is another

        category altogether.
</p>
<p id="p_88">10.1 He submitted that the Defendantfs argument that he believed the Plaintiffs product

        was virgin coconut oil made from wet coconuts is fallacious. He submitted that until

        13th October 2017, Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food

        Additives) Regulations only had one entry with respect to "Coconut oils (nariyal

        tel)" which defned the oil as "the oil expressed from copra obtained from the kernel

        of cocos nucifera nuts". He submitted that till such time there was no entry in the

        regulations with respect to Virgin Coconut Oils and all coconut oils whether cold

        pressed or expeller pressed and whether refned or not, meant coconut oil made from

        dried coconut i.e. copra. He submitted that on 13 th October 2017 by the Food Safety

        and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Fourteenth

        Amendment Regulations, 2017 ("Food Regulations 2017") an entry (1A) was

        introduced for "Virgin Coconut Oil" and defned as "means the oil expressed from

        the kernel of Cocos nucifera nuts by mechanical or natural means with or without the

        application of heat, which does not lead to alteration of the oil and virgin coconut oil

        is suitable for human consumption in its natural state without refning." He

        submitted that hence, after 13 th October 2017, also all references to Coconut Oil

        would mean oil made from Copra and a separate category of Virgin Coconut Oil was

        created which was not made from copra. He submitted that Virgin Coconut Oil

        products specifcally mention that they are Virgin Coconut Oils because they are a

        separate category under the statute and cannot be mistaken for products which are

        sold as "Coconut Oils" which are made from dried coconut - copra. He submitted

        that this ought to have been known to the Defendant if he was an expert as he claims

        to be.
</p>
<p id="p_89">10.2 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the device of two coconuts

        splashing on the packaging of PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is not misleading or

        meant to mislead. He submitted that the said device is not a depiction of a wet

        coconut with water splashing but is a depiction of oil between the coconuts. He

        submitted that the said device it is a registered trademark of the Plaintif and the

        Plaintif is entitled to use the same.

Response to Articles relied upon by the Defendant


</p><p id="p_92">11.     The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that in the Impugned Video the

        Defendant purported to demonstrate the freeze test between organic cold pressed

        coconut oil and PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL both of which are made from

        Copra. He submitted that the link in the description of the Impugned Video and all

        other material that has been produced over the course of hearing relates to virgin

        coconut oil and is irrelevant. He submitted that not a single article produced by the

        Defendant mentions that pure unrefned organic cold pressed coconut oil or the

        unrefned organic expeller pressed oil or normal unrefned expeller pressed coconut

        oil should be colourless or that a coloration suggests impurity or inferior quality.

11.1 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the only document that has

        been produced which makes a reference to the only test conducted by the Defendant

        viz. "freeze test" is an internet news article titled "Coconut Oil Ban in Kerala:

        Herefs a simple do at home test to check if your coconut oil is adulterated". He

        submitted that it being a newspaper article the document in not admissible; that the

        said freeze test is prescribed only with a view to ascertain if there are any adulterants

        in the oil; that the oil is to be considered adulterated only if it does not freeze,

        whereas in the impugned video the PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL of the Plaintif

        admittedly froze completely and there were no other liquid layers; and that the article

        makes no mention of the colour of the oil once it is frozen.

11.2 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the article at Exhibit J of the

        Defendantfs Reply "Healing Naturally By Bee" is the only article that has been

        relied upon in the description of the Impugned Video by the Defendant and has been

        heavily relied upon by the Defendant during the course of the hearing. He submitted

        that no other article or material whatsoever has been relied upon in the Impugned

        Video or in the description thereof. He submitted that no article or material

        whatsoever was referred by the Defendant when he issued a response to the cease

        and desist notice issued by the Plaintif. He submitted that all the articles now sought

        to be produced are an afterthought and yet such articles / material do not provide any

        assistance to the Defendant. He submitted that the said article is completely hearsay

        in nature and is in turn allegedly based on a source "Coconut Reasearch Center by Dr.

        Bruce Fife, an internationally recognised expert on the health and nutritional aspects of

        coconut and related products". He submitted that the said underlying research of Dr.

        Bruce Fife is neither produced nor relied upon. He submitted that it is not the case of

        the Defendant that Dr. Bruce Fife has tested the PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL so

        as to be in a position to comment on whether it is inferior to either virgin coconut oil

        or cold pressed organic coconut (copra) oil. He further submitted that just as the

        Defendant has sought to suggest that the view of Dr. Bruce Fife is unimpeachable,

        the Plaintif has produced an article titled " Coconut Oil: Not a cure for anything"

        dated 9th July 2015 from an internet blog titled "The Worst Things for Sale" which

        refers to the said Dr. Bruce Fife as a "SCAMLORD" and states that the uses of

        coconut oil prescribed by him in the book "The Coconut Oil Miracle" (which is the

        same book shown in the credential documents produced by the Defendant) are

        incorrect. He submitted that whilst he is not arguing that Dr. Fife is in fact a

        "scamlord", this makes it evident that not all material available on the internet is

        reliable and hence cannot constitute research or due diligence to justify the

        denigrating statements in the Impugned Video.

11.3 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the veracity of documents

        over the internet is the same as newspaper reports which are hearsay in nature and

        are inadmissible in law even at an ad-interim stage - at least as the sole basis for

        refusal of interim reliefs. He submitted that the material produced along with the suit

        is mostly primary evidence in the form of one on one correspondence or direct

        evidence. However, the reports and articles of the nature referred to above which

        place reliance on further other material are always hearsay in nature. Reliance was

        placed upon the Supreme Courtfs decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1846664/" id="a_20">Laxmi Raj Shetty &amp; Ors.

        vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a> 14. He submitted that even though the Courtfs fndings were

        in the context of a criminal proceeding after the trial was conducted, the proposition

        of law would apply irrespective of whether it is the ad-interim stage or after trial.

        Similarly, he relied upon the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in the case

        of <a href="/doc/125813099/" id="a_21">Star (India) Limited vs. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limted &amp; Ors</a>. 15 He

        submitted that in this case the Court did not permit a newspaper report to be relied

        upon at an interim stage as the sole evidence to attach liability.



Disparagement

        that the reliance on the judgement in Tata Sons Limited vs. Green Peace

        International &amp; Anr. (supra) is incorrect. He submitted that the Bonnard principle

        is no longer applicable and was relevant only in the context of the jury system

         has been discarded in the United Kingdom. Reliance was placed on a very recent

         English judgment in Taveta Investments Ltd vs. The Financial Reporting Council &amp;

         Ors.16 He submitted that in the present case, statements made by the Defendant are

         not hyperbolic or rhetoric or in the nature of exaggeration but are assertive

         statements made as a matter of fact, albeit falsely so. He submitted that an injunction

         was not granted in the Tata Sons matter because in the facts of the case the

         defendant had justifed its statements on several counts as set out in various paras in

         the judgement. He submitted that neither the facts nor the principles of the Tata

         Sons case apply in the present case.

<p id="p_96">12.1 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the ability of the Impugned

         Video to create an impact has been misinterpreted by the Defendant. He submitted

         that not all viewers of a video react to the video; that the impact of the video has to be

         judged on the basis of the likes and dislikes that have in fact been generated and the

         ratio thereof. He submitted that over 85% of the viewers who have reacted have been

         impacted by the video and have been infuenced by the false, misleading and

         malicious statements made by the Defendant. He submitted that no further evidence

         is required at an ad-interim / interim stage of special damage.

12.2 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendantfs argument

         that the comments on the Impugned Video seem to suggest that the consumers are

         educated consumers and shall make their own decision is incorrect. In this context he

         relied upon this Courtfs decision in <a href="/doc/792062/" id="a_22">Gorbatschow Wodka KG vs. John Distilleries

         Ltd</a>.17 which, he submitted, deals with a similar argument and negates it in the

</pre><p id="p_97">12.3 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendant has

         incorrectly relied upon the judgment in Yashwant Trivedi (supra). He submitted

         that the said judgment is related to personal defamation and not slander of goods /

         disparagement. He submitted that the Court therein held that before accepting a

         plea of justifcation, the Courtfs must be prima facie satisfed that the defendant may

         be in a position to substantiate his case on the basis of material produced.

12.4 He submitted that in the present case the material produced is demonstrably an after-

         are made with regard to the PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL.

         interpreted by this Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1456448/" id="a_23">Shree Maheshwar Hydel Power

         Corporation Ltd vs. Chitroopa Palit &amp; Anr</a>.18 The relevant excerpt of the judgment

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">               "... it is clear that in any event, the principles of law in England and in India
               with regard to grant of interlocutory reliefs in a civil action, for libel are
               diferent. In England, the principle of law is that in case of an action for
               defamation, once the defendants raise the plea of justifcation at the interim
               stage, the Plaintif will not be entitled to an interlocutory injunction. To put in
               in other words, in England, a mere plea of justifcation by the defendant would
               be sufcient to deny the plaintif any interim relief. As far as India is
               concerned, as has been clearly held by this court in the judgments referred to
               hereinabove, specially the judgement of this court in the case of Yeshwant
               Trivedi.... And the judgement of Appellate Bench dated 29 June 1989 with
               regard to the same matter in appeal, the judgement of this court in ....... It is
               cler that in india a mere plea of justifcation would not be sufcient for denial of
               interim relief. The defendants, apart from taking the plea of justifcation wil
               have to show that the statements were made bonafde and were in public interest
               and that the defendants had taken the reasonable precaution to ascertain the
               truth, and that the statements were based on sufcient material which could be
               tested for its veracity. Therefore, in India the Court is very much entitled to
               scrutinse the material tendered by the defendants so as to test its veracity and to
               fnd out whether the said statements were made bonafde and that whether they

<p id="p_100">12.6 Relying upon the judgment in <a href="/doc/146267/" id="a_24">Ashwani Kumar Singh vs. UP Public Service

         Commission &amp; Ors</a>.19, the Ld. Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Supreme

         Court has in the said judgment set out the principles on the basis of which reliance on

         judgements may be placed in court proceedings. It is held therein that reliance cannot

         be placed on a judgement or a fnding contained therein without reference to the

         context of such fnding in the facts of the case relied upon. He submitted that reliance

         upon a judgement otherwise than as above would be misplaced.

12.7 The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the balance of convenience

         is entirely in favour of the Plaintif. He submitted that the number of hits / views on

         the Impugned Video increase on a daily basis and the hits have not stagnated as

         sought to be suggested by the Defendant. He submitted that every visit to the links

         and / or broadcast of the same and each day of continuance of the Impugned Video

         has a grossly damaging efect on the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL

         product of the Plaintif and the reputation of the Plaintif and its product. He

         submitted that Defendant is unauthorizedly using the Plaintiffs registered mark

         PARACHUTE in the course of trade in the manner set out above. He submitted that

         such unauthorized use of the Plaintiffs registered mark PARACHUTE in the

         Impugned Video takes unfair advantage of and is contrary to honest practices in

         industrial or commercial matters. He further submitted that such unauthorized use of

         the mark PARACHUTE is detrimental to its distinctive character and is against the

         reputation of the mark. He submitted that the continuation of the Impugned Video

Commercial Speech / Freedom of Speech


</p><p id="p_102">13. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that the Defendant promotes

        other products and also invites ofers from his viewers for paid consultation services

        through the Impugned Videos given by him and therefore, the creation and

        publication of the Impugned Video by the Defendant is in the nature of commercial

        speech and is not merely an expression of the Defendantfs personal views, opinion or

        comment. Relying upon the judgment in Maheshwar Hydel (supra), he submitted

        that when there is a dispute between two private parties, <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_25">Article 19</a> would have no

        application.
</p>
<p id="p_103">13.1 He submitted that it is incorrect on the part of the Defendant to argue that the law of

        disparagement is not applicable to him or that this is not a case of trade libel since he

        is not a rival trader or competitor. He submitted that the Defendant has admitted

        that making and posting videos on the internet i.e. on his YouTube channel, Bearded

        Chokra, is his only source of revenue and that the Impugned Video was also therefore

        a part of his occupation / calling and created in the course of his trade. He submitted

        that the Defendant made the Impugned Video with a solely commercial purpose of

        generating revenue, which is also the reason why the Defendant has created all his

        other videos. He submitted that the Impugned Video was being monetised even until

        12th February 2019 for about two weeks after the Plaintif had issued the Defendant a

        cease and desist notice. He also submitted that once the video was created and used

        for a commercial purpose, the amount of revenue in fact generated is not relevant.

        The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif submitted that in identical circumstances

        this Court in the case of Marico Limited vs. Vivek Mittal 20 has granted an ad-interim

        injunction against a "YouTuber" in respect of three videos published by him.

13.2 He submitted that the judgment in <a href="/doc/55113949/" id="a_26">Hindustan Unilever vs. Gujarat Co-operative</a>

        (supra) was upheld by a Division bench of this Court by its order dated 13 th

        December 2018. He relied upon the following excerpt of <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_27">Dabur vs. Colortek</a> (supra)

        which, he submitted, was referred by the Division bench in the said case:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              "30. The Delhi High Court further held that protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_28">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is
                   available to the advertisement. However, if an advertisement extends
                   beyond grey areas and becomes a false, misleading, unfair or deceptive
                   advertisement, it would certainly not have the beneft of any protection. It
                   has further been held by Delhi High Court that while comparing its
                   product with other products, the advertiser may only highlight its positive
                   points, but this cannot be negatively construed to mean that there is a
                   disparagement of a rival product. It has been further held that while
                   hypedup advertising may be permissible, it cannot transgress the grey
                   areas of permissible assertion, and if it does so, the advertiser must have
                   some reasonable factual basis for the assertion so made."

        to hold that newspaper reports cannot be relied upon at the interim stage because

         proven. He submitted that to determine whether or not there is "malice" in a case it

         must be ascertained whether the Defendant made the statement knowing that it is

         false or with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or false. He submitted that the

         Defendant was not actuated by malice since he referred inter alia to the test

         prescribed by the reputed Dr. Bruce Fife in evaluating the product of the Plaintif.

14.1 He submitted that Maheshwar Hydel (supra) was decided contrary to Yashwant

         Trivedi (supra), and relying upon the judgments in <a href="/doc/1009476/" id="a_29">Lala Shri Bhagwan vs. Shri

FINDINGS AND REASONING:
</p>
<p id="p_108">
</p><p id="p_109">15. This is not a case where the Defendant is a competitor of the Plaintif. However, the

         Defendant is also not acting as a member of the general public who is expressing his

         unbiased opinion / view on the Plaintiffs product. Evidently, the Defendant is falling

         under a nascent category of individuals, popularly known as "social media

         infuencers". Social media infuencers are individuals who have acquired a

         considerable follower base on social media alongwith a degree of credibility in their

         respective space. Depending on the popularity of their feld of expertise, their

         following can range from thousands to even millions of persons. These infuencers

         often employ the goodwill they enjoy amongst their followers / viewers to promote a

         brand, support a cause or persuade them to do or omit doing an act. Much like the

         present case, they may even dissuade their followers from purchasing a certain

        product. In my view, social media infuencers are aware of the infuence they wield

        over other audience and that their statements have a magnifed and profound impact

        on their audience. It would not go far to say that their followers place certain trust in

        the social media infuencers and accept their statements as facts without much

        scrutiny. It is apparent, that a social media infuencer, such as the present Defendant,

        wields the power to infuence the public mind. With power also comes responsibility.

        I do not believe that a social media infuencer can deliver statements with the same

        impunity available to an ordinary person. Such person bears a higher burden to

        ensure there is a degree of truthfulness in his statements. A social media infuencer is

        not only aware of the impact of his statement but also makes a purposeful attempt to

        spread his opinion to society / the public. In view of the same, the Defendant had a

        higher responsibility to ensure that his statements do not mislead the public and that

        he is disseminating correct information. The Defendantfs recklessness has a much

        greater impact on the Plaintiffs / its productfs reputation as compared to a reckless

        statement by an ordinary individual.

LAW ON DISPARAGEMENT VIS-A-VIS DEFAMATION:


</pre><p id="p_111">17.     The Defendant has relied upon several publications and other similar literature with

        a view to justify the statements made by the Defendant and to express that the

        Defendant did not disparage the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL. Before

        I proceed, it is necessary to consider the law governing disparagement of goods and

        the reliability of the literature produced by the Defendant at the interlocutory stage.

        <a href="/doc/55113949/" id="a_31">In Hindustan Unilever vs. Gujarat Co-operative</a> (supra) the defendant therein,

        albeit to support a diferent argument than that raised by the Defendant herein, had

        sought to rely on the law of defamation in a suit for slander of goods and malicious

        prosecution. This Court observed that the legal requirements of a personal

        defamation case and that of malicious falsehood and slander of goods are distinct and

        diferent. The plaintif therein had also relied upon the paragraphs from Halsbury's

        Laws of England (supra). The relevant paragraphs from the judgment are

        reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_112">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              "43. It has rightly been pointed out by the Plaintif that the legal requirements
                   of a personal defamation case and that of malicious falsehood and
                   slander of goods are distinct and diferent. An action for slander of goods
                   will lie where the defendant falsely and maliciously publishes words
                   concerning the plaintifss goods and where the publication causes the
                   plaintif to sufer special damages. Paragraphs 274, 275, 277 at pages
                   137, 138 and 140 respectively of Halsburyss Laws of England (Fourth

<p id="p_113">         44.   The entire contention of Defendant No. 1 that the present action is in the
               nature of defamation and as such it is mandatory for the Plaintif to
               plead and prove that on viewing the Impugned TVCs the public would
               relate the same to the Plaintif, is based on a complete misunderstanding
               of the nature of proceedings fled by the Plaintif. The Judgments relied
               upon by Defendant No. 1 are those relating to personal defamation of an
               individual or entity and not relating to slander of goods or malicious
               falsehood. The above extract from Halsburyss Law of England cited
               hereinabove clearly brings out this distinction. This has in fact been
               emphasised in another Judgment relied upon by Defendant No. 1 that is

<p id="p_115">17.1 Having clarifed that a suit for defamation stands on a slightly diferent footing than a

        suit for slander of goods and malicious falsehood such as the present one, the scope

        of the law applicable to the present dispute may be ascertained. It can be observed

        that the criteria that the Plaintif must establish to make out a case for slander of

        goods and malicious falsehood, and the defenses that are available to a defendant in

        such a suit are distinct from a suit for defamation. The judgments relied upon by the

        parties shall be viewed in this context. In order to make out a case for

        disparagement / slander of goods the Plaintif must show the following:


</p><pre id="pre_11">        a)    That the Defendantfs statements are false;

        b)    That the said statements were made and published maliciously / recklessly,

        c)    That the said statements caused special damages to the Plaintif.




</pre><p id="p_116">WHETHER THE DEFENDANT MADE FALSE, MALICIOUS OR RECKLESS

STATEMENTS?
</p>
<p id="p_117">
</p><p id="p_118">18. The issue which needs to be examined is whether the Defendant is prima facie guilty

        of making false or malicious or reckless representations to his viewers qua the

        PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL of the Plaintif. In order to succeed, the Plaintif

        must establish that the statements made in the impugned video were false to the

        knowledge of the Defendant or made with reckless disregard of the truth. There

        cannot be any doubt that the test of falsity or recklessness would be reliant upon the

        knowledge of the Defendant at the time of making the Impugned Video.

INSTANCES OF APPARENT FALSEHOOD


</pre><p id="p_119">19. In the description of the Impugned Video, the Defendant states that "Parachute

        coconut oil is one of the most sold and most consumed coconut oils in the country and

        has been in the market for a very long time. In this video, I break down all the tiny

        details about this product and bring the truth to you as it is". However, a perusal of

        the Impugned Video shows that save and except the colour of the Plaintiffs oil in the

        liquid and frozen forms, the Defendant has not mentioned or analysed any other

        details of the Plaintiffs product. Conversely, the Defendant has omitted details of

        the products used by him to compare with the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE

        COCONUT OIL.
</p>
<p id="p_120">19.1 During his submissions, the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif produced a

        tabulation of the nutritional values of the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL

        and the products recommended by the Defendant in his video including the Virgin

        Coconut Oils which he stated to be superior to the Plaintiffs product. A perusal of

        this tabulation shows that the nutritional values therein are almost identical. The

        Defendant has not conducted any independent tests to prove that there is a

        signifcant variance in the nutritional values of the products. However, as has been

        pointed out by the Plaintif, the Defendant did have the option of having the

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL analysed under <a href="/doc/1845834/" id="a_33">Section 40</a> of the Food

        Safety Standards Act, 2006. The notifcation issued under the said Act provides that

        if the report of the Food Analyser shows that the food product is not in compliance

        with law, the purchaser shall be entitled to a complete refund of the fees paid by

        him.23 In such cases, the manufacturer also gets a fair opportunity to be heard. Had

        the Defendant really believed that the product of the Plaintif was inferior and

        unworthy and wished to beneft other consumers, he could have utilized this

        statutory mechanism. Though it is not compulsory for the Defendant to always

        utilize this statutory mechanism before giving a review about any product, however,

        in the absence of any proper scientifc or empirical test done by the Defendant, the

        use of such statutory mechanism would have defnitely showed the bonafdes of the

        Defendant in giving the correct and true information about the product.

19.2 The falsehood on the part of the Defendant is also evident from the only test i.e.

        'Freeze Testf conducted by the Defendant to come to the conclusion that the

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is of an inferior quality. Before I

        proceed, it is necessary to understand the types of coconut oil and their diferent

        qualities. Coconut oil is broadly divided into following two types:

</p><p id="p_121">        a)    Coconut Oil - ("CO") - this oil is made from Copra - dried coconuts.

</p><p id="p_122">                   Organic Coconut Oil - Copra is derived from coconut grown without

                    fertilizers and chemicals.
</p>
<p id="p_123">                   Cold pressed - heat more than 60 degrees Celsius is not applied during

                    the extraction.
</p>
<p id="p_124">                   Expeller pressed - heat upto 90 degrees Celsius may be applied during

                    the extraction.
</p>
<p id="p_125">                   Refned Coconut Oil - The oil is processed, deodorized, bleached etc.

</p><p id="p_126">        b)    Virgin Coconut Oil ("VCO") - this oil is made from Wet Coconuts (kernels)

              and is cold pressed i.e. heat more than 60 degrees Celsius is not applied during

              the extraction.

        Coconut Oil and not Virgin Coconut Oil.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_130">19.5 In the Impugned Video, the Defendant has conducted a single test of freezing two

        oils in diferent transparent glasses of which one was the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE

        COCONUT OIL. The second glass is only labelled as "organic" and contains

        coconut oil which is "with the Defendant" - "organic coconut oil joh mere pass hai".

        Moving further, the Defendant then makes observations and points out the

        diference in the colour of the two oils in the liquid state wherein he states and shows

        that the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL has a 'yellowish tingef whereas

        the other organic coconut oil is completely 'clearf. The colour of these oils in the

        liquid state is the 'frst thingf that viewers have to check according to the Defendant.

        The Defendant next makes observations about these two oils when frozen. He states

        that 'pure organic coconut oilf should be 'completely snow whitef in colour and that

        it should not have any kind of 'impuritiesf or 'stainsf whatsoever. The Defendant

        then states and shows that while the other organic coconut oil when frozen is 'pure

        snow whitef in colour, the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL has 'darker

        greyer shadef than the other organic coconut oil and has some 'impuritiesf in it.

19.6 It is pertinent to note that throughout the initial part of the video, viewers are neither

        shown nor told which or what kind of 'organic coconut oilf is being used by the

        Defendant for comparing it with the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL.

        Throughout the video where the freeze test is conducted by the Defendant, he

        consistently uses and shows the words "organic coconut oil" for the other oil used

        by the Defendant for comparing the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL.

        Hence, orally and visually, the clear and unambiguous impression given by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">             ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020                         ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:41 :::</span>

        Defendant while showing the freeze test is that the Defendant is comparing

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL with some other 'organic coconut oilf.

        Now, we have already seen the clear distinction between an 'organic coconut oil'

        and 'virgin organic coconut oil'. At the cost of repetition, 'organic coconut oilf

        necessarily means the oil derived from Copra which is derived from a coconut grown

        without fertilizers and chemicals whereas 'virgin organic coconut oil" means the oil

        derived from wet coconut-kernels grown without fertilizers and chemicals. Hence,

        the viewers are made to believe that the comparison done by the Defendant is

        between two oils which belong to the same category i.e. 'organic coconut oilf and

        hence at the end of the test, if one oil shows diferent result than that of the other,

        necessary conclusions would follow. Naturally, if the two oils used by the Defendant

        for conducting the freeze test did not belong to the same category i.e. 'organic

        coconut oilf, the parameters of colour and particulate matter used by the Defendant

        and the result based thereon would not only be inaccurate but also erroneous.

19.7 At this point, I must immediately refer to the Afdavit in Reply fled by the

        Defendant wherein the Defendant has stated the following:

19.8 The above statement made in the Reply was also confrmed during the hearing by the

        Ld. Advocate appearing for the Defendant. It is therefore evident that the other

        'organic coconut oilf at all. What the Defendant had used for the freeze test and to

        compare the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL was in fact 'virgin coconut

        oilf. It therefore becomes evident that the clear and unambiguous impression given

        by the Defendant in the Impugned Video while showing the freeze test that he was

        comparing the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL with 'organic coconut

        oilf was false.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_131">19.9 The question which is of paramount importance is whether the said impression was

        given by the Defendant knowing it to be completely false or whether it was a mistake

        on the part of the Defendant. The Defendant has neither pleaded nor argued that it

        was a mistake. Interestingly, when this anomaly was pointed out, the Ld. Advocate

        for the Defendant has, in fact, tried to justify the comparison done by the Defendant

        between the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL and 'virgin coconut oilf

        during the freeze test by stating that the Defendant was justifed in comparing the

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL to virgin coconut oil since the Plaintiffs

        PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is not branded or marketed as "Copra Oil" and

        that its packaging shows wet coconuts and uses the term 'coconut oilf. I fnd this

        explanation to be rather astounding. I will turn to the merits of the said justifcation in

        a bit, but before that, assuming that the Defendantfs justifcation for comparing the

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL with virgin coconut oil is correct, how

        does that explain or justify the evident false representation made by the Defendant to

        its viewers in the initial parts of the Impugned Video where the Defendant has

        consistently stated both orally and visually that the oil used for comparison in the

        freeze test is 'organic coconut oilf. On the contrary, the very justifcation given by

        the Defendant proves that the impression given by the Defendant in the Impugned

        Video while showing the freeze test that he was comparing the Plaintiffs

        PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL with 'organic coconut oilf was false to his own

        knowledge.
</p>
<p id="p_132">19.10 It is not and cannot be the case of the Defendant that he did not know the diference

        between 'virgin organic coconut oilf and 'organic coconut oilf. In the Impugned

        Video, after making some observations about organic cold pressed coconut oils, the

        Defendant specifcally mentions the following in the latter part of the Impugned

        Video:
</p>
<p id="p_133">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">              "But if you want an even higher grade of coconut oil, then you must go for

        It is therefore evident that the Defendant has purposely and knowingly

        misrepresented to the viewers that he was comparing the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE

        COCONUT OIL with 'organic coconut oilf when in reality he was comparing it with

        'virgin coconut oilf.

<p id="p_134">19.11 Now, turning to the merits of the justifcation given by the Defendant, after 13 th

        October 2017, the Food Regulations 2017 introduced a separate category of coconut

        oil being - Virgin Coconut Oil. After the said amendment, it is specifcally mentioned

        on the packaging of every Virgin Coconut Oil that the same is Virgin Coconut Oil and

        in the absence of such labelling, the product is assumed to be Coconut Oil. In short,

        ordinary coconut oil (which is not virgin coconut oil) is not required to mention that

        the same is made out of copra but it is sufcient for them to only mention 'coconut

        oilf on their product. The Defendant who claims to be an expert or is assumed to

        have more knowledge in the feld than an ordinary customer in view of him being a

        social media infuencer, could have easily checked for this diference and would have

        concluded that the Plaintiffs product is in fact coconut oil and not virgin coconut oil.

        Further, a simple search on the internet would elicit that the Plaintiffs product is

        made from copra. The information is freely available in the public domain. The

        Plaintif has not contravented FSSAI packaging regulations or any other regulation

        which impose any liability upon the Plaintif to state that it is using copra to

        manufacture its oil. The device of coconuts with water splashing is a trademark of the

        Plaintif which the Plaintif is entitled to use in its advertisements and packaging. The

        registration certifcate in respect of this trade mark is at Exhibit B-8 to the Plaint.

        Hence, even on merits, the justifcation given by the Defendant is erroneous.

20.1 Further, In the Impugned Video, the Defendant has made use of forceful, decisive

        and assertive statements / phrases such as follows:
</p>
<pre id="pre_17">             "I will prove it";

             "bring the truth to you";

             "verdict"

</pre><p id="p_147">        By use of such forceful, decisive and assertive statements / phrases the Defendant

        has portrayed himself to his viewers as an expert who has undertaken extensive

        research on the topic and / or is drawing conclusions on the basis of sound

        groundwork, study and research. However, in the extensive list of links in the video

        description, the Defendant has cited only one article to support his video viz. "How

        Do You Identify a Good Quality Coconut Oil?" published on the blog

        www.healingnaturallybybee.com. The Defendant has heavily relied upon the work of

        one Dr. Bruce Fife who is apparently an eminent certifed nutritionist, naturopathic

        physician and director of the Coconut Research Center in Colorado, USA. The Ld.

        Advocate for the Defendant has relied upon an excerpt from pg.100 of the

        Defendantfs Afdavit in Reply which he claims to be Dr. Fifefs advice for detecting

        good quality oil. However, it seems that the excerpt is in fact from the aforesaid

        article "How Do You Identify a Good Quality Coconut Oil?" published on the blog

        www.healingnaturallybybee.com. The article only cites Dr. Bruce Fife as a source for

        the article. The Defendant in his flings or during the oral arguments has not

        produced any actual work of Dr. Fife to show that any research or tests were in fact

        conducted by Dr. Fife to arrive at his conclusions. The said article is in fact the

        article posted in the description of the Defendantfs video. A perusal of the articles

        reveals that it doesnft discuss a freeze test for 'Coconut Oilf or that discolouration /




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">             ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020                          ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:41 :::</span>

        yellowish tint in 'Coconut Oilf or a strong smell in 'Coconut Oilf is a sign of

        inferiority. The article almost exclusively provides parameters for gauging the quality

        of 'Virgin Coconut Oil' and thus I do not see how the same can be applied to the

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT Oil which is not Virgin Coconut Oil. The

        reference to the yellow colour and the inference that it is inferior, in the article,

        applies only to Virgin Coconut Oil as it states "High quality virgin coconut oil should be

        snow white in color when it is solid and water clear when liquid. If you see any shade of

        yellow or gray it is of inferior quality". No reference is made to the colour of unrefned

        oils made from copra i.e. 'Coconut Oilf or that any inference is to be drawn in

        respect of colors of unrefned 'Coconut Oilf. In the context of oils made from copra

        i.e. 'Coconut Oilf the article only mentions that the same may contain mold (fungus)

        but the same is not harmful in any nature or form. Thus, the article in no manner or

        form lends credence to the fndings made by the Defendant. More particularly the

        article also makes no reference to the quality of PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL in

        particular that can assist the Defendant in any manner or form.

20.2 In the course of the submission made before this Court, the Defendant has produced

        various other material to support the statements made in the Impugned Video that

        the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is inferior to Virgin Coconut Oil.

        This includes the papers titled "Benefcial Efects of Virgin Coconut Oil on Lipid

        Parameters and In Vitro LDL Oxidation", "Virgin Coconut Oil Supplemented Diet

        Increases the Antioxidant Status in Rats", "Virgin Coconut Oil: Emerging

        Functional Food Oil" and "Supplementation of Virgin Coconut Oil Compared with

        Copra Oil, Olive Oil and Sunfower Oil on the Thrombotic Factors in Rats and In

        Vitro Platelet Aggregation". He has also relied upon the articles "Is Coconut Oil a

        Superfood?" and "Is Coconut Oil Good or Bad for You?" on this subject. The

        Defendant has in fact insinuated the cause for the diferences between the Plaintiffs

        PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL and the Virgin Coconut Oil such as the odour and

        colour to the possibility that the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL is made

        from poor quality and / or rotten coconuts. From a bare perusal of the relevant

        excerpts relied upon by the Defendant from this material it appears that the content

        therein is inconsistent with the statements made by the Defendant in the Impugned

        Video.
</p>
<p id="p_148">20.3 The Defendant has reproduced the aforesaid literature in an attempt to justify his

        statements as the truth. I donft see how the publications / papers and articles

        produced by the Defendant assist his case. The question before this Court is whether

        the Defendant has used the correct tests to draw a comparison between the rival

        coconut oils. The papers relied upon by the Defendant (most of which are studies

        done on rats and not humans) and articles are all on the subject of comparisons

        between Virgin Coconut Oils and Coconut Oils. Could the tests applied by the

        Defendant still be relied upon? In my opinion, acceding to the relevance of the said

        literature would be to promote the Defendant in passing of his Virgin Coconut Oil as

        Coconut Oil to demonstrate a false distinction between oils. The literature does not

        state or even suggest anywhere that the same tests to compare a Virgin Coconut Oil

        and a Coconut Oil may be used to compare two Coconut Oils.
</p>
<p id="p_149">20.4 In his email dated 29th January 2019 in reply to the Plaintiffs cease and desist notice,

        the Defendant stated that the statements made by him in his Impugned Video

        constituted his personal opinion; however, he did not refer to any research or any




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">            ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020                        ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:41 :::</span>
 Nitin                                         65   / 83

        other material even in this email. The literature does not support the test purported

        by the Defendant and thus would be of no assistance to the Defendant.

20.5 Interestingly, the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintif has produced an article titled

        "Coconut Oil: Not a cure for anything" dated 9 th July 2015 from an internet blog

        titled "The Worst Things for Sale" which refers to the said Dr. Bruce Fife as a

        "SCAMLORD" and states that the uses of coconut oil prescribed by him in the book

        "The Coconut Oil Miracle" (which is the same book shown in the credential

        documents produced by the Defendant) are incorrect. I am in agreement with the

        submission that not all material available on the internet is reliable and hence such

        material cannot by itself constitute research or due diligence to justify the denigrating

        statements in the Impugned Video.
</p>
<p id="p_150">
20.6 While there is no quarrel with the principles set out by the Supreme Court in Laxmi

        Raj Shetty (supra) since I have already observed that the said papers and articles are

        not relevant to the tests shown in the video by the Defendant, I do not presently

        deem it necessary to delve into the question whether the same is hearsay evidence or

        not.
</p>
<p id="p_151">
</p><p id="p_152">21. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the Defendant had no reason to believe

        that the statements he was making were the truth since there is no material produced

        in respect of the PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL to demonstrate that such a belief

        was even possible; that the statements have been made with recklessness and without

        caring whether they were true or false. Neither the test conducted by the Defendant

        in his Impugned Video, nor the articles sought to be relied upon by the Defendant

        indicate that the statements made and published by the Defendant are true or that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">               ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020                         ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:41 :::</span>
 Nitin                                       66    / 83

        any reasonable person could on the basis of such test or articles have believed that the

        statements constitute the truth or that there is a reasonable possibility of the

        statements being believed to be true. The Impugned Video made by the Defendant

        therefore reeks of malice and I have no difculty in holding that the frst two

        requirements to make out a case for disparagement / slander of goods as stated in

        paragraph 17.1 hereinabove have been made out.
</p>
<p id="p_153">
WHETHER SPECIAL DAMAGES ARE SUFFERED BY THE PLAINTIFF?
</p>
<p id="p_154">
</p><p id="p_155">22. The fnal criteria for the Plaintif to fulfl is that it sufered special damage. The Delhi

        High Court has held in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_37">Dabur vs. Colortek</a> (supra) that to calculate special damage

        the Court must step into the shoes of a reasonable and prudent man and assess the

        injury caused by the impugned material. In an IP suit for infringement of trade mark

        or passing of, the injury sufered by the plaintif therein may be gauged from the

        profts accrued by the infringer from the sale of the infringing products. However,

        the same principles do not apply to a case for disparagement / slander of goods. In

        such cases the reputation of the plaintiffs product is impacted whereby its customers

        are induced to not purchase the product of the plaintif. It is impossible to precisely

        ascertain how many customers, as a result of the disparaging action / slander of

        goods, have refrained from purchasing the product of the Plaintif. However, one

        need not go far from the Defendantfs channel to see the impact of the Impugned

        Video. The comments on the page of the Impugned Video show a number of the

        Plaintiffs customers who have expressed their decision to stop purchasing the

        Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL after watching the impugned video.

        Following are some of the comments posted on the Impugned video:

</p>
<p id="p_158">22.1 It would be erroneous to say that the Impugned Video had no impact and / or special

        damage since it generated a mere 2500 "likes" from 1,08,000 views. I agree with

        the submission made on behalf of the plaintif that not all viewers necessarily express

        "likes" or "dislikes". Furthermore, only those persons who have a YouTube

        account can like or dislike a video, including the Impugned Video. Thirdly, of the

        2897 persons who have reacted to the Impugned Video, 2500 persons have liked it.

        This shows that over 85% of the voting segment was convinced by the Defendant and

         consequently was impacted by it. Further, the number of persons watching

         the Impugned Video during one "view" may be in the plural and hence the

         number of views may not be a refection of the actual number of persons that have

        viewed the video and the impact that it has on them.
</p>
<p id="p_159">22.2 Further, the Defendant himself has stated the following towards the end of the

        Impugned Video:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">              "Agar aapko yeh video pasand aaya, agar aap iss video se kuch seekh ke ja
              rahe hai then please neeche woh like button, woh share button aur woh
              subscribe button dabana na bhule..."

         It would therefore be safe to assume that the 2500 persons who have liked the video

         have learnt something from the video and hence the impact of the Impugned Video

         upon the reputation of the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL and the

         damage caused to the Plaintif cannot be underestimated. The issue of whether

         special damages are sufered by the Plaintif is also answered in the afrmative.

              It could thus be seen that for deciding the question of disparagement,
              Court will have to take into consideration intent of the commercial,
              manner of the commercial and storyline of the commercial and the
              message sought to be conveyed by the commercial. We will also be required
              to consider as to whether manner of the commercial is ridiculing or
              condemning product of the competitor, to come to the conclusion that it
              amounts to disparagement. However, if manner of the commercial only
              shows advertiser's product better or best without derogating the other's
              product then the same would not amount to disparagement."

23.1 While the above judgment has been relied upon by the Plaintif and the Defendant, it

        is pertinent to observe that the judgment was in respect of a commercial

        advertisement as against the present suit wherein the Impugned Video is a

        commercial review of the Plaintiffs product. The Impugned Video is not an

        educative video in respect of coconut oils, but a video targeted at the Plaintiffs

        PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL. Since I have already concluded that the statements

        in the Impugned Video were false and made maliciously by the Defendant with an

        intention to show the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL in a negative light,

        I need not delve into a further inquiry of the Defendantfs intent and manner in which

        the Impugned Video has been made or the message which is sought to be conveyed.

        However, one more important aspect which according to me shows the real intention

        of the Defendant behind publishing the Impugned Video is his reply to the comment

        posted by one "I am Jero" on his Impugned Video, wherein the Defendant has

        categorically stated that:
</p>
<p id="p_164">              "This video was only to bring awareness to the general public of the

              only to show the impurities. I know there are many tricks which companies
              use to make a fool of the public and that's what I'm busting. Refned oils
              are clearly labeled as refned, no refned oil will get a fssai certifcation as a
              pure organic cold pressed oil. If lab testing all products was so easy, trust me i
              would do it and make sure the consumer segment in cosmetics and consumables
              changed for good."
</p><p id="p_165">                                                                        (Emphasis Supplied)
23.2 The Defendant in his impugned video pointed out that the Plaintiffs packaging does

        not state the grade of the coconut used, where they have been extracted from or from

        which coconuts has the oil been extracted from which seems to imply that the

        Plaintif is concealing the information since the coconuts used are inferior. The

        FSSAI packaging regulations do not require the Plaintif to state the grade of the

        coconuts or the manner in which the oil was extracted on the packaging of coconut

        oils. Further, a perusal of the products which were produced before this Court during

        the hearing and which were also recommended by the Defendant in his Impugned

        Video, show that none of the products mention the grade of coconuts used, where

        they have been extracted from or from which coconuts they have been extracted.

        This is an additional factor which shows that the Defendant was making every efort

        to show the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL in a negative light. From all

        that is stated hereinabove, the Defendantfs agenda seems to be clear that the

        Impugned Video is a deliberate attack on not only PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL,

        but also the Plaintiffs company.
</p>
<p id="p_166">
23.3 In my opinion, the Impugned Video is hit by all three factors of "intent, manner and

        message sought to be conveyed" as laid down by the Division Bench in <a href="/doc/98659454/" id="a_41">Gujarat Co-

ANCILLARY DEFENCES RAISED BY THE DEFENDANT


</p><p id="p_169">24. I shall now deal with the ancillary defences raised by the Defendant to avert an

        injunction order.
</p>
<p id="p_170">
The Defendant is not a trader or competitor


24.1 I have already observed that the legal principles governing defamation and

        disparagement / malicious falsehood / slander of goods are distinct. I do not agree

        with the Defendantfs argument that an action for disparagement / malicious

        falsehood / slander of goods can only be against a trader or a competitor. The

        judgments in the facts of the case involved competitors who had issued comparative

        advertisements which were alleged to be disparaging and did not in any manner hold

        that an action cannot lie against an individual or an entity which is not a competitor.

        In an action for disparagement / malicious falsehood / slander of goods it is irrelevant

        whether the Defendant is a trader or not so long as the necessary ingredients are

        satisfed. There is no judgment holding that there would be no disparagement /

        slander of goods in case the defendant is not a trader or a rival or a competitor of the

        plaintif. If the argument of the Defendant that the law of disparagement is not

        applicable to him and is applicable only to the manufacturers or traders is accepted, it

        would create havoc since all the manufacturers or traders would then hire people like

        the present Defendant to make disparaging statements about their competitorfs

        products under the garb of making a "review" and thereby cause serious damage to

        its competitors who would be left remediless.

Defendant's use of strong language is hyperbole / exaggeration


24.2 The Defendant has made use of strong language in his video to positively assert that

        the Plaintiffs product is of inferior quality. He has stated that the Plaintiffs product

        smells like "dried or rotten coconuts". The Defendant has argued that the use of the

        term rotten coconuts was meant to be a hyperbole / an exaggeration and should not

        be taken literally. In Tata Sons (supra) the Court took the view that the use of the

        word "Demons" and "Ratty" must be taken as an attempt at exaggeration since it

        would be impossible that anyone would truly believe that the Tatas were in fact

        demons. In the present case it is not impossible to believe that the Plaintiffs

        PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL could be made from or has a smell of rotten

        coconuts. Further, in that case, the defendant therein had justifed the use of demons

        by inter alia pointing out the use of the term demons is to vilify the Tatafs act of

        damaging the environment. The present Defendant has aforded no explanation for

        using the term "rotten coconuts" in the context of the Plaintiffs product.

        Furthermore, later in his video the Defendant has once again insinuated that the

        Plaintiffs product might be made from poor quality coconuts. In view of the above,

        the principles relied upon by the Defendant in Tata Sons Limited (supra) shall be of

        no assistance to him.
</p>
<p id="p_173">
Defendant's claim of honest conduct


24.3 Once the Impugned Video is ascertained to be disparaging the Plaintiffs product, the

        fact that the Defendant has given positive reviews on other products of the Plaintif

        or that he has given a link for the purchase of the Plaintiffs other products does not

        alter the nature of the disparaging nature of the Impugned Video. Likewise, merely




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">             ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020                          ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:41 :::</span>
 Nitin                                         73    / 83

        because the Defendant has made similar videos for products of other manufacturers

        who have not taken action against the Defendant does not preclude the Plaintif from

        acting against the Impugned Video. In the presence of glaring evidence of providing

        incorrect information in the Impugned Video and the obviously derogatory

        statements against the Plaintiffs product, the Defendantfs past "honest" conduct in

        previous videos would be of little consequence.
</p>
<p id="p_174">24.4 The Defendant has argued that not deleting the comments defending the Plaintiffs

        product shows his bona fdes. However, he has replied to nearly all comments

        reiterating that the Plaintiffs product is inferior.
</p>
<p id="p_175">24.5 The video being sponsored or the Defendant receiving payment from a competitor of

        the Plaintif would be an additive factor to substantiate the Defendantfs malice.

        However, once the Impugned Video is ascertained to be disparaging the Plaintiffs

        product, the absence of these factors would be of no pertinence.

24.6 In the Impugned Video, the Defendant has concluded that the Pure &amp; Sure organic

        Coconut Oil is of better quality than the Plaintiffs PARACHUTE COCONUT OIL.

        It is not a matter of co-incidence that the Defendant has provided links below his

        video to the oil of Pure &amp; Sure brand, where upon clicking the links, the viewers are

        taken to a site where Pure &amp; Sure oil can be purchased by the viewers. Admittedly,

        every time a product is purchased by the viewers by clicking these links, the

        Defendant gains monetarily.
</p>
<p id="p_176">24.7 The Defendant has sought to prove his ethics by stating an instance where he was

        ofered money by a company (QRAA Men) to give positive reviews on their product.

        The Defendant claims that he declined to make any video that was not on his true

        opinion and refunded the money he received from the company. I have in fact read



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">             ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020                        ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:41 :::</span>
 Nitin                                          74     / 83

        through the correspondence with QRAA and in my view the Defendant did not

        simpliciter refuse to create a video. The Defendant in fact suggested delaying the

        creation of the Video and also held back the refund for a considerable period of time

        under the pretext that he had not heard from QRAA. In any event even if the

        Defendant showed some integrity in his dealings with QRAA, it does not change the

        facts of the present case. The Defendantfs Impugned Video in my view smacks of

        malice.
</p>
<p id="p_177">


Viewers Special Ability to Discern


24.8 Merely because some viewers in the comment section to the Impugned Video have

        demonstrated their astuteness and parried the false allegations made by the

        Defendant against the Plaintiffs product, does not prove that the Defendantfs

        viewers are educated or unlikely to be deceived. The Defendant has not substantiated

        a case that his viewers have a special ability to discern the truth from the Defendantfs

        video. I am reminded of the quote made by Lord Justice Lindley, "...Why should we

        be astute to say that he cannot succeed in doing that which he is straining every nerve to do".

        Therefore, where the Defendant is obviously misleading his viewers and applying

        false tests, and customers who were using the Plaintiffs products have decided to

        stop using them after watching the Impugned Video, there is no impetus for me to

        assume that a viewer would not be misled by the Impugned Video.


Plea of Justifcation / Bonnard Principle


24.9 The Ld. Single judge of this Court in Shree Maheshwar Hydel Power (supra), after

        considering the decision in Yeshwant Trivedi (supra) has held that in India, at the

        interim stage, merely raising a plea for justifcation is not sufcient and the

        Defendant must show that he made the statements bona fde and in public interest,

        and that he took reasonable precaution to ascertain the truth, and that his statements

        were based on sufcient material which could be tested for its veracity. The

        Defendant herein is unable to establish his bona fdes and provide any material to

        support the statements made by him in the Impugned Video. All material produced

        by him is for comparison between Virgin Coconut Oil and Coconut Oil which do not

        state that the same tests apply to a comparison between two Coconut Oils.

        Furthermore, the Defendant has admitted that the oil used by him in the freeze test

        was in fact Virgin Coconut Oil and not Organic Coconut oil as wrongly depicted in

        the Impugned Video. In view of the same, the principle of justifcation is not available

        to the Defendant.

<p id="p_178">
24.10 In my view, the judgment in Shree Maheshwar Hydel Power (supra) is sound and is

Freedom of Speech and Expression / <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_42">Art. 19</a> of the Constitution of India


24.12 Admittedly, the Defendant is regularly creating and publishing content on his

        YouTube channel "Bearded Chokra" which is his fulltime occupation and only

        source of livelihood. Unlike a normal consumer, the Defendant strives to generate

        viewership and regular subscribers to his channel to generate revenue from the

        content published by him. The Defendant intended to generate revenue from the

        Impugned Video and it was not until two weeks after he was served with the

        Plaintiffs legal notice that he demonetized the Impugned Video. It was a commercial

        purpose of earning revenue which is also the reason why the Defendant has created

        all his other videos. The publication of the Impugned Video is thus a commercial

        activity and the Defendantfs "opinion" in this view amounts to commercial speech.

24.13 In the Shree Maheshwar Hydel case (supra) this Court has observed that in a

        dispute between two private parties, one cannot claim an unfettered right of freedom

        of speech and expression against the other. The Defendant for his monetary gain is

        attacking the Plaintif / its product in an attempt to attract more viewers to his

        YouTube channel / video and thereafter divert such viewer trafc to various other

        related and unrelated products by means of links to purchase such products from

        various shopping portals and also towards requesting / inviting monetary donations /

<p id="p_183">        In the case of <a href="/doc/55113949/" id="a_49">Hindustan Unilever vs. Gujarat Co-operative</a> (supra), it was held as

              "49. It cannot be disputed that advertisements and/or commercial speech is a
                    part of the fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_50">Article 19 (1) (a)</a> of the
                    Constitution of India. However, it cannot be that the fundamental right

                    and/or manufacturer of a product by maligning, discrediting and/or

24.15 Lastly, with respect to the Defendantfs reliance upon the judgments in Whitney

        (supra) and Shreya Singhal (supra) to argue that the Plaintif should release a

        counter statement or counter video, the same does not impress me. The judgment in

        Whitney (supra) is of a foreign Court and not binding upon this Court. Further,

        principles set out in the aforesaid judgments were not in respect of an action for

        disparagement of goods and therefore the same do not assist the Defendant. The

        fndings in that judgment were given in an entirely diferent context i.e. the case

        related to a prosecution and challenge to a conviction for violation of a specifc

        statute being the Criminal Syndicalism Act of California. In my view, the discretion

        whether or not to counter with another video is that of the Plaintif and that does not

        preclude the Plaintif from seeking legal recourse as sought in the present case.

        provide misleading information to disparage the Plaintiffs product. Any campaign to

        may be welcomed. However, under the garb of educating and / or bringing the

        infuences the consumer not to buy the said product. Additionally, the unauthorized

        use of the Plaintiffs registered trademarks by the Defendant in a manner which is

        detrimental to its distinctive character or reputation cannot ever be in accordance

        with the honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.



        BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE

</p><p id="p_188">26. In so far as the aspect of the balance of convenience is concerned, the Ld. Advocate

        for Defendant has argued that the balance of convenience is in favour of the

        Defendant and that no irreparable harm or injury would be caused to the Plaintif if

        the injunction is not granted. He submitted that it is not as though the Impugned

        Video is going viral or that millions of viewers are viewing the video everyday and

        hence there is no imminent likelihood of any damage to the Plaintif. I do not think

        that this is a correct standard for ascertaining whether the balance of convenience is

        in favour of the Plaintif or whether no irreparable harm or injury would be caused to

        the Plaintif. I agree with the submissions made by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the

        Plaintif that with the advent of internet and social media platforms like YouTube,

        there has been increasing trend whereby several videos like the Impugned Video are

        being created in the garb of providing a review of products available in the market

        where product images are being used without authorization, reckless statements are

        made in respect of such products under the garb of freedom of speech and expression

        without due regard to the reasonable restrictions thereon with a view to target

        maximum views for the videos so posted on such social media sites and to make

        unfair gains on the basis of the views generated. I have already come to a conclusion

        that the Impugned Video is disparaging in nature. With every passing day, the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">             ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020                         ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:41 :::</span>
 Nitin                                       80   / 83

        number of views on the Impugned Video are increasing. Today, internet has a vast

        audience and an immediate and much greater impact than some other forms of

        communication. The harm or damage that would be caused to the Plaintif is

        irreparable and cannot be ascertained in terms of money. The Defendant has already

        demonetized the Impugned Video. The balance of convenience is therefore in favour

        of the Plaintif and against the Defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_189">

</p><p id="p_190">27. In view of the above fnding that the Defendantfs Impugned Video is disparaging in

        nature, another issue which requires deliberation is to what extent should the

        Impugned Video be censored to cease further injury to the Plaintiffs goodwill and

        reputation. In the case of <a href="/doc/98659454/" id="a_51">Gujarat Co-operative vs. Hindustan Unilever</a> (supra), the

        Division Bench of this Court held that certain slides of the subject commercial

        advertisement that depicted "Vanaspati" / "Vanaspati Tel" being poured into a cup

        of frozen dessert were disparaging the plaintiffs product (frozen desserts). Hence,

        while the plaintif therein had impugned the entire video in its suit, the Division

        Bench of this Court ordered the removal of only those slides that were disparaging

        the plaintiffs product. Much like the said case, the present Plaintif has also

        impugned the entire video of the Defendant. However, the facts and circumstances

        of the present case demand a diferent verdict. The intent of the Defendant to

        disparage the product of the Plaintif pervades throughout the Impugned Video. The

        Impugned Video is consistently riddled with disparaging references to the Plaintiffs

        product, including inter alia its title, its landing page, the description and the

        comments posted by the Defendant. In my opinion, it is not possible to dissect the

        innocuous parts of the video to create a coherent and acceptable version of it. Had it

 Nitin                                        81    / 83

        been a case where the disparaging content of the Impugned Video was limited to

        certain portions of the video, my conclusion may have been diferent. However, in

        the present case, the entire video must go. Having said that, I do not agree with the

        Plaintif that a blanket injunction should operate against the Defendant in respect of

        any of his future works. Whether any content created by the Defendant in the future

        is disparaging or not is a matter to be decided in the facts and circumstances of the

        case. In my view, albeit the Plaintif has made out a case to show that the Impugned

        Video is objectionable, it would be unfair that the present injunction would apply to a

        work of the Defendant that has not even been created yet as sought for by the

        Plaintif. I am therefore not granting the prayer clause (b) to the Plaintif. I am also

        restricting the injunction in prayer clause (a) as mentioned below.

</p><p id="p_191">28. Before I part with the judgment, a word of caution which I believe is required in the

        context of the present case. Today, social media infuencing is one of the most

        impactful and efective ways of marketing and advertising. A social media infuencer

        who has or claims to have a sound knowledge on what they claim their niche is and

        uses that knowledge to infuence people in believing and subscribing to the same set

        of ideas or thoughts they are trying to propagate on social media, have the power to

        infuence people, to change attitudes and mindset. This mindset can be changed for

        the better, and scarily, even for the worse. This is a responsibility that should be

        assumed carefully. But frst of all, there needs to be a deep awareness about the basic

        fact that this indeed is a responsibility. In todayfs time, when people from all over the

        world are harnessing the potential of social media infuencing, there is a need to

        understand what these responsibilities are and why they matter so much. Social

        Media Infuencers, whether their audience is signifcant or small, impact the lives of

<p id="p_192">29. In view of the above, I am satisfed that the Plaintif has made out a prima facie case

        for grant of interim reliefs. The balance of convenience is in favour of the Plaintif. If

        the injunction as prayed for by the Plaintif is not granted, the Plaintif is likely to

        sufer irreparable harm and injury. Accordingly, the above Notice of Motion is made
