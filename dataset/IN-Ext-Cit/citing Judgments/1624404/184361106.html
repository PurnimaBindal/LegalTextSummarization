          not       entitled          for        the   relief,        as    sought      for.     It   is

          submitted that the fair trial, guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_54">Article

          21</a> of the Constitution of India, is meant to protect the

          interest of accused and the witnesses and it is not open

          for       the           State    to     allege        that       fair   trial       requires

          said        that        a    crime     against          an    individual       is    to     be

          considered as a crime against a State and public, at

          large. In the criminal administration system, State is

          the prosecuting agency, working for and on behalf of the

          people of the State. It is to be noticed that “party

          interested”             has      not    been       defined         under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_77">    the     Code</a>   of

          Criminal Procedure, 1973. The words “party interested”

          are       of       a    wide     import       and,       therefore,         have     to    be

          interpreted by giving a wider meaning. The words such as

          “aggrieved party”, “party to the proceedings” and “party

          interested” are used in various Statutes. If the words

          used are to the effect “party to the proceedings” or

          “party to a case”, it can be given a restricted meaning.

          In such cases, the intention of the legislature is clear

          to give restricted meaning. But, at the same time, the

          words used as “party interested”, which are not defined

          under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_78"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, have to be given a

          wider meaning. As a prosecuting agency in the Criminal

          Administration, the State can be said to be a party

          interested within the meaning of <a href="/doc/337651/" id="a_79">Section 406(2)</a> of the

          Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is a well settled

          principle of law that the Statute must be interpreted to

          advance the cause of the Statute and not to defeat the

          same. The petitioner-State, being a prosecuting agency

          in the Criminal Administration, is vitally interested in

          such administration, as such, we are of the view that

          the State is considered as a “party interested” within

          the meaning of Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/664789/" id="a_80">Section 406</a> of the

          Code. The judgment of this Court in the case of                           <a href="/doc/926636/" id="a_81">K.

          Anbazhagan              v.   Superintendent    of   Police     &amp;   Ors</a>.2 also

          supports the case of the petitioner-State to accept the

          said plea that they are party interested within the

          meaning            of   <a href="/doc/337651/" id="a_82">Section   406(2)</a>     of   the   Code   of   Criminal

          Procedure. Thus, we hold that this petition, as filed

          under <a href="/doc/664789/" id="a_83">section 406</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is

          maintainable.

          Petition under Para-26(A) of the same, the petitioner is

          seeking directions, commanding the respondent-State and

          transfer the criminal proceedings and trial in the case

          Respondent from Roopnagar Jail, District Ropar, State of

          of      India           gives     wider     power       to    this    Court      and   not

          Solicitor General, appearing for the petitioner-State,

          as well as learned senior counsels, appearing for the

          to invoke power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_110">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of

          India           or      not,   we    have           carefully     considered       the

          submissions and the material placed on record and we are

          of the considered view that it is evidently a fit case

          to       invoke          our   power      under         <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_111">Article        142</a>    of   the

          of      the       chart    which    is    furnished        by   the     petitioner,

          indicates that the 3rd Respondent is involved in various

          cases            of     attempt      to        murder,      murder,          cheating,

          Act. The said cases, as mentioned by the petitioner,

          number in Ten, are various stages of trial. Further, the

          petitioner has furnished the cases, where warrants were

          issued by the Courts in various crimes, registered in

          the Districts of Mau, etc., and when the police went to

          seek custody, the 1st respondent had refused to handover

          the custody on medical grounds. The reasons for non-

          production are                   mentioned in a tabular form. During the

          period from 14.02.2019 to 14.02.2020, custody is denied

          to the police of Uttar Pradesh by the 1st Respondent on

          twenty six occasions. A perusal of the reasons for not

          giving custody shows that it is mainly on the medical

          grounds referring to diabetes mellitus, skin allergy,

          hypertension, backache, throat infection, etc. Though,

          it      is       the      case     of   the   petitioner,      that   the   very

          registration of crime in Crime no.05 of 2019 on the file

          of Police Station Mathaur, District Mohali, Punjab is a

          part of conspiracy at the instance of the 3rd Respondent

          so as to continue in the jail at Punjab, by protracting

          the trials, which are pending in the Special Court and

          to deny his presence in various other crimes, registered

          against him for completing the investigation. We do not

          wish         to         record    any   finding    on   such    allegation    of

          conspiracy at this stage, but, at the same time, we are

          satisfied that the custody is denied to the Police of

          Uttar Pradesh at every time on trivial grounds under

          guise of medical grounds by mentioning ordinary diseases

          like         diabetes            mellitus,     skin       allergy,    hypertension,

          backache,               throat     infection,       etc.    In    addition       to    the

          same, it gives any amount of suspicion on the conduct of

          the 3rd Respondent in not even applying for grant of

          default bail, for not filing Final Report (Charge-sheet)

          by the Police, Police Station Mathaur, District Mohali,

          Punjab within the statutory period. Though, it is the

          case of the 3rd Respondent, opposing the relief sought

          for, on the ground that he is permitted in majority of

          the cases to appear by video conferencing, but the same,

          by itself, is no ground to oppose the relief sought for.

          Though,            the      earlier     cases       were    pending       in    various

          Sessions                Courts    and   only    to    fast       track    the    cases,

          Special            Court     is     constituted       for    trial       of    cases   of

          MPs/MLAs in the year 2018 by the State of Uttar Pradesh.

          On      such            constitution,     all       the    cases     where      the    3 rd

          Respondent is involved for serious offences under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_112">IPC</a>

          and Gangsters Act, were transferred to the Special Court

          and all are pending trial at various stages. Pursuant to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                         46</span>

          the orders of the Special Court, only the 3rd Respondent

          was kept in jail at Banda in the State of Uttar Pradesh,

          so as to order his presence, as and when required.

          Therefore, in our opinion, a convict or an undertrial

          prisoner,               who   disobeys    the    law    of    the    land,   cannot

          oppose his transfer from one prison to another, be a

          convict or an undertrial prisoner, Courts are not to be

          a helpless bystander, when the rule of law is being

          challenged with impunity. In such situations, this Court

          can exercise power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_113">Article 142</a> of the Constitution

          of India to order transfer of prisoner from one prison

          to another. Though, there is a separate enactment called

          <a href="/doc/1264536/" id="a_114">The       Transfer            of    Prisoners    Act</a>,    1950,      which    permits

          transfer of a prisoner from one State to another by the

          Government, but, the same is circumscribed under <a href="/doc/1092263/" id="a_115">Section

          3</a> of the Act, as such, the claim of the petitioner will

          not fit into the same. Even then this Court, in exercise

          of power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_116">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India,

          can       consider            for    transfer    of     the   prisoner       in   the

          circumstances, as pleaded by the petitioner. The arms of

          law are long enough to remedy the situation. If there

          are any medical ailments to the petitioner, every care

          shall be taken by the Jail Authorities but, at the same

          time, on the spacious plea of ill health by referring to

          minor         ailments,           the   accused   /   3rd   Respondent    cannot

          oppose the relief, as sought for in the writ petition.

          It is true that in the case of <a href="/doc/1624404/" id="a_117">A.B. Bhaskara Rao v. CBI8</a>

          and in the case of <a href="/doc/564007/" id="a_118">State of Haryana v. Sumitra Devi9</a>,

          this Court has held that in exercise of power under

          <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_119">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India, no order can

          be passed, which shall run contrary to the statute or

          statutory rules. The transfer of a prisoner from one

          prison to another prison in different States is covered

          by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1264536/" id="a_120">The Transfer of Prisoners Act</a>,

          1950. <a href="/doc/1912315/" id="a_121">Section 3</a> of the Act reads as “the Government of

          that State with the consent of the Government of any

          other         State,         by   order,    provide    for   removal     of   the

          prisoner from that prison to any prison in the other

          State.” It is clear that there does not appear to be any

          provision for transfer of an under trial prisoner. There

          being no statutory provision, covering the transfer of

          prisoner from one State to another, having regard to the

          facts of the case on hand, this Court, certainly in

          exercise                of   jurisdiction    under     <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_122">Article   142</a>     of   the

          Constitution of India, may issue necessary directions in

          the given circumstances. The judgments relied on by the

          learned counsels for the respondents, as referred above,

          would not render any support to their plea in this case.

          In the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1793114/" id="a_123">Saihba Ali v. State of

          Maharashtra10</a>, it                    is       held    that       this    Court     can    pass

          appropriate on the facts to do complete justice, even if

          the writ petition filed is not maintainable. Transfer of

          a prisoner from one State to another State also fell for

          consideration                  by    this      Court,       in    the    case    of   <a href="/doc/1521407/" id="a_124">Kalyan

          Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan</a> alias Pappu Yadav &amp;

          a     prisoner            or     detenu,        either       on    his    own    motion     or

          otherwise, can be ordered by this Court, in exercise of

                              the rule of law is being challenged with
                              impunity. The arms of law are long enough

                              to another, that is by assuming that the
                              Jail Manual concerned does not provide
                              such    a     transfer.             In    our     opinion,           the

                              majesty        of      law.         The      facts         narrated

                              sometimes even when he was on bail. We
                              must    note        herein          with     all      seriousness
                              that the authorities manning Beur Jail

                              have enabled the respondent to flout the
