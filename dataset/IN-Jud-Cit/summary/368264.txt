Satya Deo Gupta, the respondent, filed an application under Section 14 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 for the registration of the trade name of a biochemical medicinal preparation, commonly known as "Lakshmandhara", in Class 5 of the Fourth Schedule to the Trade Marks Rules, 1942.
The Amritdhara Pharmacy, the appellant, filed an application in opposition to the registration.
The appellant contended that as "Amritdhara" was already registered and ' Lakshmandhara' being a similar name was likely to deceive the public, registration should be refused.
The Registrar of Trade Marks allowed the registration of "Lakshmandhara" for sale in the State of Uttar Pradesh only.
The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.
Whether the name "Lakshmandhara" was likely to deceive the public or cause confusion to trade within the meaning of Section 8 and Section 10(I) of the Act.
Whether the appellant was claiming a monopoly in the common Hindi word "dhara".
Whether there was any fraudulent user by the respondent of his trade name "Lakshmandhara".
The Supreme Court held that the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two names "Amritdhara" and "Lakshmandhara" is likely to deceive or cause confusion to the public.
The Court also held that the appellant was not claiming a monopoly in the common Hindi word "dhara", but rather its right under Section 21 of the Act, the exclusive right to the use of its trade mark, and to oppose the registration of a trade mark which so nearly resembles its trade mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion.
The Court found that there was no fraudulent user by the respondent of his trade name "Lakshmandhara", but the appellant had acquiesced in the use of the name.
The Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court, and restored those of the Registrar of Trade Marks, Bombay, dated September 10, 1953.
In the circumstances of this case, there will be no order for costs.
