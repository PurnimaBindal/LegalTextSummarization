              (PER : HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE J.B.PARDIWALA)


1        This appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent is at the instance
of an unsuccessful original respondent No.1 of a writ application filed by
the respondents Nos.4 to 9 herein (original writ applicants) and is
directed against the judgement and order passed by a learned Single
Judge of this Court dated 10th February 2021 in the Special Civil
Application No.15478 of 2020, whereby the learned Single Judge
allowed the writ application holding that the Lavad Suit instituted by the
appellant herein before the Board of Nominees is not maintainable as
the Board of Nominees has no jurisdiction to try such a suit in view of
the specific bar of Section 145U of the Gujarat Cooperative Societies Act,
1961 (for short, &quot;the Act, 1961&quot;).

     has any objection against the said Notification, he may submit objection
     in writing within 15 days from the date of its publication. I humbly say
     that even though I had submitted objections in writing against the
     Notification published on 14-3-2020,        defendant No. 2 has published
     the agenda of electorate without taking the said objections into
     consideration, which is ab-initio wrong, illegal and void.

<p id="p_33"> C/LPA/311/2021                                    CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022




</p><p id="p_34">     4.      I humbly say that I, the plaintiff, had given written objection on
     6-7-2020 against the Notification of electorate published by defendant
     No. 2 on on 14-3-2020; and it was clearly stated therein that I am
     included at Serial No. 3 in the electorate of the members elected from
     other societies and individual members as per By-law 35(1)(b) of the
     Milk Union. In all 168 members are included in the agenda of
     electorate published by you, in which I am included at Serial No. 163.
     In the said electorate, right to vote is given to one representative out of
     10 members of the other societies as per Bye-law 6(A)(2) of the Milk
     Union and one representative out of 25 individual members as per Bye-
     law 6(A)(3). In my electorate, there are about 70 other societies; and
     accordingly, voting right is available to 7 representatives as per Bye-
     law 6(A)(2);      and there are about 98 individual members; and
     accordingly voting right is available 4 representatives as per Bye-law
     5(A)(3). But, the age of the individual members who had become
     members in the year 1960 when the Milk Union was established was
     more than 21 years. Therefore, after 60 years, as on to-day more than
     90 percent of those members have died. Hence, if the electorate agenda
     is published after getting the existence of individual members verified,
     only 1 member will get right of vote instead of 4 members out of
     individual members in my electorate as per Bye-law 6(A)(3) of the Milk
     Union on account of removal of the deceased members. Therefore, it is
     stated that I have objection against my electorate agenda published
     without getting the existence of individual members verified; and
     objection was also given against enrolling individual members by
     violating Bye-laws 6(A)(3), 12(A) and 19 of the Milk Union. Despite
     that, the Notification of the final electorate has been published on 8-7-
     2020 without considering the said objections, against which I have
     given objections to defendant No. 2 on 16-7-2020.
</p>

<p id="p_35">     5.      It is my say that I had given written objection to defendant No.

 C/LPA/311/2021                                     CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022




     2 against the Notification dated 14-3-2020. But, since he had refused to
     accept the objections, I had sent the objections through E-mail to him;
     and I had also given intimation about it to the District Registrar,
     Mehsana and registered my objection; and had made representation to
     take necessary action. A copy of the said objection is enclosed herewith.
</p>

<p id="p_36">     6.      It is my humble say that I had addressed a letter to defendant
     No. 2 on 6-7-2020; and stated therein that I am included at Serial No. 3
     of the electorate of the members elected from other societies and
     individual members as per Bye-law 35(1)(b) of the Milk Union, in the
     Notification of election of defendant No. 1 Union published on 14-3-
     2020.       Looking to the list, there are 168 members and my name
     appears at Serial No 163. The other societies and individual members
     included in the said electorate do not come in direct or routine contact
     with the Milk Union. Therefore, my request is to publish an
     advertisement in a daily news paper for vide publicity of the detailed
     program for the election of the representatives of this electorate under
     the supervision of the representative of the Government. Apart from
     this, it was also stated that I have strong objection against holding of
     election of the representatives. Thus, even though I had taken the said
     objections, the final agenda of electorate is published on            8-7-2020
     without      considering any of the objections of the plaintiff and without
     giving any opportunity of making a representation in that behalf, in
     which 38 societies are admitted; and 109 societies are shown as voter
     societies. Thus, the objections taken by me are not considered; nor any
     verification is undertaken. Thus, the said Notification is void-ab-initio,
     illegal and bad in law.
</p>

<p id="p_37">     7.      It is my humble say that despite the objections taken by me
     against the Notification published by defendant No. 2 on 14-3-2020,
     final Notification of the electorate was published on 8-7-2020 without

     considering the said objections, about which I have written letter to
     defendant No. 2 on 16-7-2020; and since the Notification published
     on          8-7-2020 was wrong and illegal   and was prejudicial to the
     member societies, I had requested him to immediately cancel the said
     process and to initiate entire process afresh for the election of
     defendant No. 1 Union. A copy thereof is enclosed herewith.
</p>

<p id="p_38">     8.      It is my humble say that Rule 19 of the Bye-laws of the Union is
     as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                    &quot;It will be open to any member to transfer his share or
             shares to another member after one year with the permission of
             the Board of Directors. But, the amount of the individual
             member towards share will be refunded to the heir of the
             deceased member. The share will not be deemed to have been
             transferred unless and until the name of the transferee is
             entered in the share transfer register and fee of one rupee for
             each share for transfer is paid.&quot;</blockquote>

<p id="p_39">             Thus, as per the said provision, even though there is a provision
     that the amount of share of the person will be refunded to his heir in
     case of death of any individual member, after the death of deceased
     Motibhai Chaudhari, Vipulbhai Chaudhari, Gitaben Vipulbai Chaudhari
     and his wife Monghiben Motibhai Chaudhari are enrolled as member,
     which is contrary to the provisions of the Bye-laws; and, therefore also,
     the Notification published by defendant No. 2 on 8-7-2020 is required
     to be cancelled.
</p>

<p id="p_40">     9.      It is my humble say that out of total 98 individual members of
     defendant No. 1 Union, 49 individual members have died, copy of the
     list of which is produced by me. Despite that, 98 individual members
     are shown in the Notification published on 8-7-2020. Thus, before
     publishing the said Notification, verification of the deceased individual
     members is not done; and the final Notification produced by defendant

     No. 2 on 8-7-2020 is ab-intio wrong and illegal; and, therefore also, no
     election process can be undertaken as per the said Notification; and the
     Notification published on 8-7-2020 requires to be cancelled.
</p>

<p id="p_41">     10.     It is my humble say that as per Bye-law 6(a)(3), at the time of
     the establishment of the Union, before its registration, sympathizer
     individual members are enrolled. Even though there is a clear provision
     that henceforth no sympathizer individual members will be enrolled,
     Shri Vipulbhai M. Chaudhari at serial No. 14 and                 Shri Gitaben
     Vipulbhai Chaudhar at serial No. 15 of the election agenda published
     on 8-7-2020 are wrongly enrolled as individual members, which is
     illegal and liable to be cancelled. Moreover, since majority members
     out of the individual members from the present list l of individual
     members of the Board of Directors of the Union dated            8-7-2020 have
     died, the Notification by which the list of the individual members and
     other societies of the electorate published on 8-7-2020 is ab-initio
     wrong and illegal; and is in violation of the law and Bye-laws.
     Therefore, it is contrary to law and it requires to be cancelled.
</p>

<p id="p_42">     11.     I humbly say that even though as per Bye-law 48(1)(a), there is
     a provision to the effect that if any society is not affiliated with the
     Union on 31st of March, prior to the election, its name will not be
     included in the voters list, 38 societies have been admitted by the Union
     subsequent to 31-3-2019; and those societies have also been included
     in the Notification. Therefore, the Notification published by defendant
     No. 2 on 8-7-2020 is liable to be cancelled.
</p>

<p id="p_43">     12.     Thus, if the election is held by the voter societies as per the
     Notification published by defendant No. 2 herein, the election can not
     be held lawfully; and provisions of the Bye-laws are likely to be clearly
     violated; and, therefore also it is absolutely necessary in the interest of

 C/LPA/311/2021                                     CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022




     justice to cancel the final Notification published by defendant No. 2 on
     8-7-2020.
</p>

<p id="p_44">     13.     Thus, if the election is held by the voter societies as per the
     Notification published by defendant No. 2 herein, the election can not
     be held lawfully; and provisions of the Bye-laws are likely to be clearly
     violated.
</p>

<p id="p_45">     14.     I have a strong prima facie case; balance of convenience is in
     favour of the plaintiff. If the injunction order as prayed for by me is
     passed, the defendants are not likely to suffer any loss. Nevertheless,
     purpose of justice will be served. If the orders prayed for by me are not
     passed, I am likely to suffer irreparable loss which cannot be
     compensated in terms of money; and I am likely to be deprived of my
     lawful rights; and several complications and multiplicity of proceedings
     are likely to take place; and, therefore and also for the reasons of
     urgency, it is absolutely necessary to pass orders as prayed for by me
     immediately.
</p>

<p id="p_46">     15.     The cause of action for filing this suit has arisen as stated above
     and specially when the final Notification of the electorate was published
     on          8-7-2020 without considering the written objections submitted
     by me on 6-7-2020 and without affording any opportunity to me of
     being heard or making a representation against the Notification of the
     electorate published on 14-3-2020 and when an advertisement was
     published in daily news paper Dainik Bhaskar on 10-7-2020 calling for
     the Resolution of the representatives of the concerned societies; and
     the same is within time.
</p>

<p id="p_47">     16.     It is, therefore, prayed that:

<p id="p_54">5        The plain reading of the averments made in the plaint referred to
above would indicate that the appellant - plaintiff herein raised issues
relating to the election of delegates and violation of the bye-laws in that
regard. According to the appellant herein, the delegates came to be
elected and included in the provisional voters list contrary to the bye-
laws of the Mehsana District Cooperative Milk Producers&#x27; Union Limited

forwarded by the Managing Director of the Union to the office of the
Collector, and thereafter, are included in the provisional voters list in
accordance with the Gujarat Specified Cooperative Societies Elections to
Committees Rules, 1982 (for short, &quot;the Rules 1982&quot;). It also appears
from the averments made in the plaint that the District Collector, in his
capacity, as the Election Officer, does not hold the election of delegates.
The District Collector is an Election Officer for holding the election of the
members of the committee of the specified Cooperative Societies. In such
circumstances, the Chapter XIA of the Act would not be applicable to the
election of delegates. As the issues relating to the breach or violation of
the bye-laws of the society came to be raised by the appellant - plaintiff
and those could be adjudicated only by the Board of Nominees, a dispute
came to be raised under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_2">Section 96</a> of the Act, 1961 in the form of a
Lavad case.
</p>

<p id="p_56">6        It appears that the original writ applicants were not even parties
in the suit proceedings. However, on the ground that the Lavad Suit
itself was not maintainable before the Board of Nominees in view of the
bar of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_3">Section 145U</a> of the Act and the interim order passed by the Board
of Nominees was causing serious prejudice to the original writ
applicants, they thought fit to directly come to this High Court by filing
the Special Civil Application No.15478 of 2020 invoking the supervisory
jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Article 227</a> of the Constitution. In the
writ application, the writ applicants prayed for the following reliefs:

         of 2020 preferred by the respondent no.1 before the Board of

     under Rule 3(A)(1) and the voters of one seat were shown. The
     appellant-plaintiff had raised the objection about the eligibility of those
     members to elect the delegates. The dispute raised by the appellant-
     plaintiff was, thus, outside the scope and ambit of Chapter XI of the
     Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961 which is in relation to the
     election of specified co-operative societies. The appellant-plaintiff
     further contends that the disputes raised by the appellant-plaintiff did
     not fall under the jurisdiction of the Collector who is the election officer
     under the scheme of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961.

     <a href="/doc/91544928/" id="a_12">section 28(8)</a> and Rule 15 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Rules,
     1965, it is the Managing Director of a co-operative society who will
     hold the election of delegates. These delegates would find their names
     into the provisional voters list which will be submitted by the Managing
     Director to the Collector under Rule 4 and Rule 5 of the Gujarat Co-
     operative Societies Elections to Committees Rules, 1982.

<p id="p_64">     That, it is submitted that bare reading of the above rule clearly shows
     that Collector while preparing final list of voters is required to invite
     claims and objections to provisional list of voters. However, the scope of
     inviting claims and objections by Collector is very limited. It is
     submitted that Collector will have scope of finding out any omission in
     the name or error in respect of names or addresses. Collector has no
     power to look into correctness, legality of the election of delegates
     whose names are shown in the provisional voters list. Thus, it is outside
     the powers of the Collector to go into such claim of objections.
</p>
<p id="p_65">     17. That, it is submitted that having regard to scheme of Rule 6(1) of
     the Gujarat Specified Co-operative Societies Elections to Committee
     Rules, 1982, it is not within the competence of the Collector to go into
     the legality and correctness of the names sent by Managing Director
     who are to be shown in the provisional voters list.
</p>
<p id="p_66">     18. That, it is submitted that there is no role of the Collector as the
     election officer under provisions of the Gujarat Specified Co-operative
     Societies Elections to Committees Rules, 1982 in holding the election of
     the delegates or in determining the legality and correctness of the
     delegates so elected under the supervision of the Managing Director of
     a co-operative society. In that view of the matter, so far as election of
     delegates is concerned, the correctness and legality of the voters list in
     electing the delegates can only be gone into by the Registrar, Nominees&#x27;
     Court under section 96 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961.
</p>
<p id="p_67">     19. That, it is submitted that in the facts of the present case, the
     appellant-plaintiff has shown by placing death certificates of as many as
     49 individual members that these individual members have died and
     therefore, a detailed survey about the existence of living individual
     members be made. Similarly, the appellant-plaintiff has averred in the
     plaint that other agricultural co-operative societies who have become
     members after 31st March, 2019 are not eligible to be included into the
     list of voters of the election which was due in the year 2020. That, it is
     submitted that those societies who had become members after 31st
     March, 2019 were not required to be shown as voters for the purpose of
     electing delegates.

<p id="p_68">     20. That, the Registrar, Nominees Court has passed ex-parte ad-interim

     nos. 1 and 2 to move the application stating that suit is not
     maintainable. That, it was open to respondent nos. 4 to 9 to move an
     application for impleadment and seek vacation of ex-parte ad-interim
     order by impleading themselves as parties to the suit. That, it is
     submitted that instead of undertaking the procedure as indicated
     hereinabove, the original petitioners straightaway filed writ petition
     before this Hon&#x27;ble High Court, which in the submission of the
     appellant, was not maintainable. That, the writ petitioners have sought
     the relief of writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings of the Registrar,
     Nominees Court. That, it is submitted that writ of certiorari, in the facts
     of the present case, was not maintainable and therefore, learned Single
     Judge has erred in granting writ of certiorari by quashing the ex-parte
     ad-interim order. That, the original petitioners have not prayed for writ
     of prohibition. That, in the absence of any relief claimed by the
     petitioners seeking writ of prohibition, the judgment of learned Single
     Judge quashing the proceedings of Lavad Suit is erroneous. For the
     foregoing reasons, the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge
     is erroneous and it deserves to be quashed and set-aside by this Hon&#x27;ble
     Court.
</p>
<p id="p_69">     21. That, learned Single Judge has further erred in not appreciating
     that the dispute raised by the appellant-plaintiff was between member
     and Mehsana District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Ltd.-a co-
     operative society and therefore, it would squarely fall within the
     parameters of section 96 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act,
     1961.
</p>
<p id="p_70">     22. That, learned Single Judge failed to consider that the controversy
     raised by the appellant-plaintiff and the question of facts and law raised
     in the memo of plaint were only capable of adjudication by Registrar,
     Nominees Court under section 96 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies
     Act, 1961.
</p>
<p id="p_71">     23. That, it is submitted that question of facts and question of law
     raised in Lavad Suit were incapable of being adjudicated by the Gujarat
     State Co-operative Tribunal before the result of the election or even
     after the results of the elections.
</p>
<p id="p_72">     24. That, none of the forum except Registrar, Nominees Court under
     <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_13">section 96</a> was competent to grant the relief to the appellant-plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_73">     25. That, while determining the jurisdiction of Registrar, Nominees
     Court under section 96 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961,
     it was required to be viewed purely from the point of view of
     jurisdiction and not by reference to conduct of any of the parties to the
     suit or other similarly placed parties.&quot;

<blockquote id="blockquote_76">     6. The said contention of the appellant-plaintiff is completely flawed.

     voters list to be published by the election officer under Rule 4 of the
     Gujarat Specified Co-operative Societies Election to Committee Rules,
     1982. Therefore, any dispute in relation to the election of delegates
     would clearly be a dispute which is in relation to a dispute of one seat
     of Director of the said constituency.
</p>
<p id="p_78">     9. At this juncture, attention of the Hon&#x27;ble Court is drawn to
     Annexure-J Page 205, a Notification dated 01.12.2020 issued by the
     Election Officer, whereby as far as the election for one seat of the
     constituency of miscellaneous societies and individual members is
     concerned, because of the stay granted by the Board of Nominees in
     the suit preferred by the appellant-plaintiff, election for the said seat
     has not been declared. Therefore, because of the order passed in the
     suit preferred by the petitioner-plaintiff, the election of the said seat of
     one Director has not been declared. Hence, the election of the said
     constituency has been directly affected and till date no Director from
     the said constituency has been elected and there is no representation
     from the said constituency in the Board of Director. Hence, there is a
     direct impact on the election because of the suit preferred by the
     appellant-plaintiff and the interim order passed therein. Hence, it
     cannot be said that the suit is not in relation to election.
</p>
<p id="p_79">     10. It is submitted that as stated above, the provisional voters list
     published under Rule 4 of the Rules would include the names of
     delegates who are elected/selected from amongst the individual
     members and miscellaneous society. Therefore, if any dispute or issue
     arises with respect to election of such delegates, the same can very well
     be raised by way of an objection under Rule 6 before the election
     officer.
</p>
<p id="p_80">     11. The appellant-plaintiff can very well raise objection under Rule 6
     against a delegate by stating that the delegate could not have been so
     included in the voters list and actually a lesser number of delegates
     should be in the voters list or that the process of selecting/electing is
     flawed. Therefore, the appellant-plaintiff is not without any remedy and
     can raise such objection before the election officer under Rule 6.
</p>
<p id="p_81">     12. It is submitted that Rule 6 encompasses an objection with regards to
     voter in the list i.e. present case with regards to delegate can be raised.
     It is submitted that harmonious and purposive interpretation will be
     required to be given to Rule 6 so as to include within its scope such
     kind of objection to be raised before the election officer.
</p>
<p id="p_82">     13. If the election officer does not entertain such objections, in
     appropriate matter jurisdiction of this Hon&#x27;ble Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a>
     of the Constitution of India can be invoked against the order of the
     election officer. Therefore, the appellant-plaintiff is not without any
     remedy even prior to the holding of election and declaration of result.

<p id="p_88">     18. As the heading of the Rule 3A clearly suggest, the provision is with
     regards to delimitation of constituencies for the purpose of election of
     specified society. The notifications dated 14.03.2020 and 08.07.2020
     which are subject matter of challenge before the Board of Nominees are
     in exercise of Rule 3A(1) to 3A(7) of the 1982 Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_89">     19. Hence, the exercise of power of delimitation of constituencies is for
     the purpose of election of the specified society and hence any dispute
     about the said notification would be clearly a dispute relating to the
     election of the specified society as contemplated in <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_22">section 145U</a> of the
     Act. Therefore, such a dispute can only be raised before the Tribunal

     such a dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_90">     20. The plaintiff-appellant contends that it is only the Collector or his
     delegate who is to undertake the election of a specified society and only
     the actions undertaken by the Collector or his delegate would be
     election related and any dispute prior thereto would not be considered
     as a dispute relating to elections. The said submission has inherent
     fallacy in it. The said submission ignores the important aspect that only
     after the specified society delimits the constituencies as per rule 3A(1)
     to (7), the Collector comes in picture and the powers under Rule 3A(8)
     and 3A(9) are exercised by the Collector only after the specified society
     sends the list of constituencies. Hence, the power of the specified
     society to prepare the list of constituencies under Rule 3A(1) to 3A(7)
     cannot be segregated and separated from the election process. It is a
     part and parcel of entire election process and it is an intrinsic part of
     the election process.
</p>
<p id="p_91">     21. If what the plaintiff contends is accepted that it would mean that
     exercise of powers by the society under Rule 3A (1) to (7) are not
     related to election whereas exercise of powers by the Collector under
     Rule 3A(8) and 3A(9) would be related to election. Such dissection of
     Rule 3A into different parts would not be permissible.
</p>
<p id="p_92">     22. Therefore, the dispute raised by the appellant is clearly a dispute
     relating to election of the specified society and hence, cannot be
     entertained by the Board of Nominees.
</p>
<p id="p_93">     23. Further, the reliefs claimed in the suit viz. not to declare the
     elections of the constituency of individual members and other societies
     would directly come within the purview of dispute relating to election
     of the specified society. Further, the order dated 17.11.2020 passed by
     the Board of Nominees directly restrains holding of election of the said
     constituency which shows that the dispute is directly about the election
     of one constituency of specified society.
</p>
<p id="p_94">     24. As stated above, Rule 3(A) provides for delimitation of
     constituencies for the purpose of election. Rule 3A(5) onwards provides
     for preparation of voters list at the stage of the society. Rule 3A(9)
     provides delimitation to be made by the Collector. Rule 4 provides for
     constituency wise voters list to be prepared. For the present
     constituency of individual members and other societies, the voters
     would be the names of the delegates that are elected/selected from
     amongst the individual members and other societies in the ratio
     prescribed. Therefore, any objection against names of delegates can be
     raised under Rule 6. From the above, it becomes clear that the entire
     process right from Rule 3A to Rule 6 and onwards is intrinsically and
     closely connected to the election of one seat of Director. The same
     cannot be divided into two parts as is sought to be done by the

     appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_95">     25. Therefore, the present issue is clearly in relation to election and
     hence, <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_23">Section 145U</a> is attracted and <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_24">Section 96</a> is barred.
</p>
<p id="p_96">     26. Further, attention of the Hon&#x27;ble Court is drawn to grounds for
     declaring election to be void provided in Rule 82 of the Election to
     Committee Rules, 1982. One of the grounds on which election can be
     declared to be void is as provided under Rule 82(d)(iii) i.e. improper
     reception, refusal or rejection of any vote or reception of any vote
     which is void. Therefore, any dispute that a delegate could not have
     voted was wrongly included in the voters list can be considered in an
     election petition under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_25">Section 145U</a> and election can be declared to be
     void on that ground. Therefore, once the election petition under 145U
     is maintainable on this ground, the jurisdiction of the Board of
     Nominees under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_26">Section 96</a> is clearly ousted.
</p>
<p id="p_97">     27. It is submitted that suit of the appellant in substance is a suit raising
     a dispute regarding who shall in the provisional voters list prepared
     under Rule 4 for the purpose of electing one Director of the
     constituency of other societies and individual members. Hence, it is
     clearly a dispute in relation to election.
</p>
<p id="p_98">     28. The respondent-original petitioner relies upon on the judgment of
     the learned Single Judge produced at page 226 reported in 1996(1)
     GLH 212. Relevant paragraphs Nos.14 to 16, wherein the learned
     Single Judge holds that a dispute in relation to election of a primary
     society can be raised before the Board of Nominees and the dispute
     with regards to specified society is prohibited to be brought before the
     Board of Nominees as per <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_27">Section 145U</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_99">     29. The respondent further relies upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble
     Supreme Court in the case of N.P.Ponnuswami v/s. Returning Officer,
     reported in Air 1952 SC 64, relevant paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 which has
     interpreted and given meaning to the word &quot;election&quot;. The Hon&#x27;ble
     Supreme Court has held that the word &quot;election&quot; has to be given wider
     sense which would include the entire procedure to return a candidate
     and the election would also include a stage even prior to the
     declaration of election and would include entire process. It is further
     provided that if the election is reasonably imminent and if the process is
     reasonably connected with the election, the said dispute is in
     connection with election. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in paragraph
     No.9 has held that there cannot be two attacks in matters connected
     with election, one during the process of election and after the election
     is held. Therefore, the provision of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_28">Section 96</a> and <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_29">145U</a> may be
     interpreted in consonance with the aforesaid judicial pronouncement.

 C/LPA/311/2021                                   CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022



     respondent relies upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court
     reported in (1985) 4 SCC 590. Paragraph Nos.22 and 23.
</p>
<p id="p_101">     31. With regards to the phrase of &quot;in relation to&quot;, the respondent relies
     upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court reported in 2004(5)
     SCC 632, paragraph Nos.47 and 48 which holds that the said phrase is
     of widest amplitude and therefore, considering the aforesaid judgment
     the same would include any dispute in relation to election.
</p>
<p id="p_102">     32. The respondent relies upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme
     Court reported in 1983 GLH, paragraph Nos.1,4 and 8, wherein though
     dispute was with regards to election of delegate, the Hon&#x27;ble Court has
     held that the remedy is to prefer election petition under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_31">Section 145U</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_103">     33. From the above, it becomes clear that the learned Single Judge was
     perfectly justified in allowing the petition and no interference may be
     made.
</p>
<p id="p_104">     34. Further, the conduct of the plaintiff-appellant also needs to be
     considered. It is submitted that in the last elections which were held in
     the year 2015, a similar suit was preferred before the Board of
     Nominees, Mehsana being Lavad Suit No. 182 of 2015 (pages 171 to
</p><p id="p_105">     179) raising similar issues and contentions that are raised in the present
     suit in question filed by the appellant viz. death of various individual
     members etc. The said suit also came to be entertained and interim
     injunction was given staying the elections of the specified society. The
     said order of the Board of Nominees was challenged before this Hon&#x27;ble
     Court by way of Special Civil Application No. 18357 of 2015. In the said
     petition, vide order dated 30.10.2015 (pages 161-163), this Hon&#x27;ble
     Court has admitted the petition and has granted stay by specifically
     observing that the Board of Nominees has no jurisdiction to entertain
     the suit in view of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_32">Section 145U</a> of the Act. Hence, similar kind of suit
     preferred in the year 2015 and the order passed thereon came to be
     stayed by this Hon&#x27;ble Court vide above referred order by specifically
     observing that the Board of Nominees has no jurisdiction to entertain
     the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_106">     35. It is submitted that the said suit came to be preferred by
     Lakshmipura (Khara) Seva Sahakari Mandli Ltd. It is submitted that
     even this time also when the elections of the union were due in the year
     2020, the very plaintiff i.e. Lakshmipura (Khara) Seva Sahakari Mandli
     Ltd. has preferred Lavad Suit No. 156 of 2020 (pages 186 to 194) again
     raising similar contentions regarding death of various individual
     members and also raising contentions regarding eligibility to vote of
     certain itar societies. The said suit was preferred by suppressing the
     order of this Hon&#x27;ble Court passed on 30.10.2015 . In the said suit, the
     Board of Nominees had initially granted interim injuction, however,
     various societies had applied for joining as party and pointed out the

     C/LPA/311/2021                                    CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022



         order of this Hon&#x27;ble Court dated 30.10.2015 prima facie observing that
         the Board of Nominees has no jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_107">         36. The said suit therefore, came to be withdrawn by the said plaintiff
         Lakshmipura (Khara) Seva Sahakari Mandli Ltd. on 10.11.2020 (pages
         203 and 204). Thereafter, the appellant on 13.11.2020 (within 3 days)
         has preferred the suit in question being Lavad Suit No. 183 of 2020,
         raising verbatim same contentions and averments that were raised in
         Lavad Suit No. 156 of 2020 preferred by Lakshmipura (Khara) Seva
         Sahakari Mandli Ltd. Interestingly the lawyer for both the plaintiffs of
         both the above referred suit is the same.
</p>
<p id="p_108">         37. If both the said suits are compared, the Hon&#x27;ble Court would be
         satisfied that both the suits are identical and verbatim same. Therefore,
         to avoid the contention of suppression of material fact, the suit
         preferred by Lakshmipura (Khara) came to be withdrawn and
         immediately the suit in question is preferred by the appellant but in the
         said suit also no mention is made about the order passed by this
         Hon&#x27;ble Court in Special Civil Application No. 18357 of 2015. The same
         shows the conduct of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_109">         38. Therefore, the suit was nothing but abuse of process of law and
         therefore, also righty set aside by the learned Single Judge. From the
         above, it is clear that the Hon&#x27;ble Court is satisfied that the order of the
         learned Single Judge is perfectly legal and proper and does not deserve
         to be interfered. The present appeal therefore, be dismissed.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_110">12       In such circumstances referred to above, Mr. Joshi prayed that
there being no merit in the present appeal, the same may be dismissed.
</p>

<pre id="pre_6">        ANALYSIS:
13       Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
</pre><p id="p_111">having gone through the materials on record, the only question that falls
for our consideration is whether the learned Single Judge committed any
error in passing the impugned judgement and order.
</p>

<p id="p_112">14       Before we advert to the rival submissions canvassed on either side,
we must look into the line of reasoning adopted by the learned Single
Judge in its impugned judgement. We quote as under:

<p id="p_113"> C/LPA/311/2021                                    CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022




     &quot;6.1 Reading the provisions of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_33">Section 145U</a> would indicate that the
     heading would suggest that disputes relating to elections are submitted
     to the Tribunal. The section begins with the word &quot;Notwithstanding&quot;
     saying that &quot;Notwithstanding anything contained in <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_34">Section 96</a> or any
     other provisions of this Act, any dispute relating to an election shall be
     referred to the Tribunal&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_114">     6.2     Reading the averments in the plaint together with the prayer,
     what is under challenge before the Board of Nominees in the Lavad Suit
     are the notifications dated 14.03.2020 and 08.07.2020 for delimitation
     of constituencies. The power to de-limit the constituencies is
     available to the Society under the provisions of Rule 3A of the Specified
     Societies Rules. The heading of the rule itself suggests that the de -
     limitation of constituencies is for the purposes of election. Apparently
     when therefore the provisions of Rule 3A are read in context of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_35">Section
     145U</a>, the language would indicate that there is a similarity of the
     intention inasmuch as, the dispute relating to an election under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_36">Section
     145U</a> of the Act would take within its fold the purpose of election i.e
     the de-limitation of constituencies for the purposes of election. It is
     under Chapter 11A that <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_37">Section 145Y</a> which provides for power to
     make rules for the purposes of this Chapter finds its place. <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_38">Section 145Y</a>
     also would suggest that the power to make rules is given to
     the State Government to provide for and to regulate all or any of the
     matters relating to the various stages of election, including the
     preparation of the list of voters. Therefore, Shri Jani&#x27;s
     submission that the purpose of filing the Lavad Suit is an indirect
     way of challenging the medium of election of voters who would be
     delegates for the Managing Committee is misconceived. Essentially
     what is under challenge in the Lavad Suit is not only a dispute relating
     to an election or for the purposes of election, but is a challenge to stage
     of election. Admittedly therefore, it would not fall within
     the purview of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_39">Section 96</a> of the Co-operative Societies Act.
     This conclusion is evident on reading the provisions of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_40">Section 145U</a>,
     <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_41">145Y</a> r/w. Rule 3A of the Specified Societies Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_115">     6.3    Even from the conduct of respondent No.1 as demonstrated by
     Shri Joshi, learned Senior Advocate, it is evident that once a lavad suit
     was filed in the year 2015 raising similar issues and contentions and
     subject matter of that suit is at large before this Court in Special Civil
     Application No. 18357 of 2015 wherein the Court has stayed the
     proceedings of the lavad suit, and in addition thereto by comparing the
     pleadings of Lavad Suit No. 156 of 2020 which was withdrawn with
     that of the present suit, namely, Lavad Suit No. 183 of 2020, it is
     apparent that similar submissions and contentions are raised in the
     present suit as compared to lavad suit No. 156 of 2020 which was
     withdrawn by the Laxmipura Seva Sahakari Mandali Limited. This

     C/LPA/311/2021                                   CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022



         was particularly done to avoid suppression and bringing to the
         notice of the Court, which ought to have been done that the suit
         was not maintainable when the exercise of jurisdiction at the
         hands of the Board of Nominees in the earlier suit of 2015 was stayed
         by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_116">         7      The fact that the elections to the other societies proceeded forth
         except for the constituencies in which the lavad suit is a subject matter
         of challenge at the hands of the Deputy Collector itself also would
         suggest that the dispute relates to an election dispute.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_117">15       Thus, according to the learned Single Judge, as the appellant
herein raised issues relating to election (may be that of the delegates)
before the Board of Nominees in the form of a dispute under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_42">Section 96</a>
of the Act, 1961, the provisions of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_43">Section 145U</a> of the Act would
immediately come into play and the same would make such a suit not
maintainable in law before the Board of Nominees. According to the
learned Single Judge, the challenge can only be by way of an election
petition to be filed before the election Tribunal in accordance with Rule
74 of the Rules, 1982.

20     Normally the use of the phrase by the Legislature in a statutory
provision like &#x27;notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Act&#x27; is equivalent to saying that the Act shall be no impediment to the
measure [See Law Lexicon words &#x27;notwithstanding anything in this Act
to the contrary&#x27;]. Use of such expression is another way of saying that
the provision in which the non-obstante clause occurs usually would
prevail over the other provisions in the Act. Thus, the non-obstante
clauses are not always to be regarded as repealing clauses nor as clauses
which expressly or completely supersede any other provision of the law,

Tribunals of inferior or limited jurisdiction within their bounds. The writ
of prohibition lies not only for excess of jurisdiction or for absence of
jurisdiction but also in a case of departure from the rules of natural
justice. But the Writ does not lie to correct the course, practice or
procedure of an inferior Tribunal or a wrong decision on the merits of
the proceedings. The writ cannot be issued to a court or an inferior
Tribunal for an error of law unless the error makes it go outside its
jurisdiction. A clear distinction has therefore, to be maintained between
want of jurisdiction and the manner in which it is exercised. If there is
want of jurisdiction than the matter is coarum non judice and a writ of
prohibition will lie to the Court or inferior Tribunal forbidding it to

       of the existence of an adequate alternative remedy were by no means
       exhaustive., and (2) that even beyond them a discretion vested in the

       need only add that the broad lines of the general principles on which
       the Court should act having been clearly laid down, their application to
       the facts of each particular case must necessarily be dependent on a
       variety of individual facts which must govern the proper exercise of the
       discretion of the Court, and that in a matter which is thus pre-eminently
       one of discretion, it is not possible or even if it were, it would not be

          rarest of rare cases. Judicial disciplines of the highest order has to be
          exercised whilst issuing such writs. It must be remembered that the writ
          jurisdiction is original jurisdiction distinct from appellate jurisdiction.</blockquote>
<p id="p_172">          An appeal cannot be allowed to be disguised in the form of a writ. In
          other words, this power cannot be allowed to be used &#x27;&#x27;as a cloak of an
          appeal disguise&#x27;&#x27;. Lax use of such a power would impair the dignity and
          integrity of the subordinate Court and could also lead to chaotic
          consequence. It would undermine the confidence of the subordinate
          Court. It was not even argued that there was total lack of jurisdiction in
          the civil Court. It could not be denied that the civil Court, before which
          the suit was pending, had powers to decide on the maintainability of
          the suit and to decide on question of its jurisdiction. The civil Court had

          said Act or on principles of res judicata/estoppel. Thus unless there was
          some very cogent or strong reason the High Court should not have

       jurisdiction of the civil Court to decide these questions. In the impugned
       Judgment no reason, much less a cogent or strong reason, has been
       given as to why civil Court could not be allowed to decide these
       questions. The impugned judgment does not state that the civil Court
       had either proceeded to act without or in excess of jurisdiction or that it
       had acted in violation of rules of natural justice or that it had proceeded
       to act under law which was ultra vires or unconstitutional or proceeded
       to act in contravention of fundamental rights. The impugned judgment
       does not indicate as to why the High Court did not consider it expedient
       to allow the civil Court to decide on questions of maintainability of the
       suit or its own jurisdiction. The impugned judgment does not indicate
       why the civil Court be not allowed to decide whether the suit was
       barred by virtue of <a href="/doc/80768286/" id="a_77">Section 14</a> of the said Act or on principal of res
       judicata/estoppel. To be remembered that no fundamental right is
       being violated when a Court of competent jurisdiction is deciding
       rightly or wrongly matters before it.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_173">30     Thus, the Supreme Court sounded a note of caution that unless
there are some very cogent or strong reasons, the High Court should not
prevent the competent Forum from deciding the various questions raised
before it including the question of &quot;want of jurisdiction&quot;. It is also stated
that allowing a Court of competent jurisdiction to proceed with the case
and decide the same rightly or wrongly, would not result in violation of
any Fundamental Rights.

<p id="p_174">31     In our opinion, the net result of the authorities discussed above is

<blockquote id="blockquote_107">       (a) The writs of mandamus, certiorari and&#x27; prohibition, and for the
       matter of that, all high prerogative writs, are ordinarily not issued

       adequate.

<blockquote id="blockquote_108">       (b) But there is no inflexible rule that such writs cannot be issued

       jurisdiction but of expediency.

the Act? The term &quot;election&quot; has been defined under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_78">Section 145B(b)</a> of
the Act and it means election of a member or members of the committee
of a specified society. &quot;A specified society&quot; means a society belonging to
any of the categories specified in <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_79">Section 74C</a> of the Act. Rule 15 of the
Rules, 1965 referred to above lays down the procedure for electing the
delegates equal to one tenth of the number of societies admitted to
membership upto the relevant date or one delegate for every twenty five
individual members (fraction being neglected), whichever is less. The
delegates so elected shall continue in office till their successors are
elected after the next date of drawing up of the accounts. The proviso to
Rule 15(a) further provides that in the event the total number of
individual members is less than twenty five, they shall elect one
delegate. Rule 15(b) makes it clear that the election of delegates shall be
held in accordance with the provisions of the bye-laws of the society. In
the case of a federal society having its individual members, the voting
right of such individual members is regulated by Rule 15 of the Rules,
1965 referred to above. One pertinent feature very much apparent on
plain reading of Rule 15 is to give a representation to the individual
members, but, such representation is through the delegates of the
individual members, who may be elected from amongst the individual
members. It is only at the stage when the election of a member of the
Managing Committee takes place constituency - wise which, inter alia,
may include the constituency of individual members, such delegates are
to act as the voters when the election is to be held of the members of the
Managing Committee as per the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_80">Section 74C</a> of the Act read with
Chapter XI-A of the Act with the relevant rules. It is only at the stage of
the election of the members of the Managing Committee in accordance
with the bye-laws that Rule 4 of the 1982 Rules would come into play
along with the other procedure of the election as provided under
Chapter XI-A of the Act.

<p id="p_175">34     Even in accordance with the Rule 4 of the Rules, 1982, the
provisional list is to be prepared not only constituency - wise as
provided in the bye-laws, but, the names of the voters are also to be
arranged constituency - wise as laid down in the bye-laws. Therefore,
the applicability of Rule 15 of the Rules 1965, more particularly, so far
as it relates to holding of the election of delegates is concerned, would
operate at a stage prior to the holding of the election of the members of
the Managing Committee in accordance with Chapter XI.

<p id="p_176">35     So far as the case on hand is concerned, the election of the
delegates takes place in accordance with the bye-law No.46 referred to
above. Such election takes place from amongst the members of
individual groups and other cooperative societies group. This election is
held by the Managing Director of the society by virtue of the powers
conferred to him under the bye-laws and the resolutions. It is not in
dispute that it is the Managing Director, who, issues notice to all the
individual members and to all the cooperative societies falling within the
category of the other cooperative societies. The Managing Director holds
the election of delegates from the individual members in the ratio of 25 :

Collector and also to the District Registrar. The District Collector, in his
capacity as the Election Officer, would publish their names as voters and
would finalize their names in the final list of voters, and thereafter,
proceed to hold the election for one seat.
</p>

<p id="p_178">36     In view of what has been observed above, one thing is clear that if
there is any dispute as regards the election of delegates, the same would
be outside the purview of the District Collector in his capacity as the
Election Officer. Any dispute relating to the election of delegates has
nothing to do with any dispute relating to the election of the members of
the Committee. It is true that the delegates have a role to play in the
conduct of the election of the members of a specified society but that by
itself will not bring the dispute relating to election of the delegates
within the chapter XI-A of the Act so as to attract <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_81">Section 145-U</a> of the
Act.
</p>

<p id="p_179">37     What did the appellant - plaintiff pointed out to the Board of
Nominees by instituting the suit? The appellant pointed out that out of
total 98 individual members, 49 were dead and gone. Despite the same,
all 98 were shown in the Notification dated 8th July 2020. The death
certificates of all those individual members were placed on record in the
form of documentary evidence with the plaint. The appellant - plaintiff
pointed out that it had lodged written objections against the notification
of Constituencies published by the Managing Director of the Union. It
was further pointed out that in all 168 members were included in the
notification declaring the Constituencies in which the appellant -
plaintiff figured at Serial Number No.163. In the voters list, the right to
vote is given to one representative out of 10 members of the other
societies in accordance with the bye-law 6(A)(2) referred to above of the
Milk Union and one representative out of 25 individual members in

   C/LPA/311/2021                                CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2022



accordance with the bye-law 6(A)(3). The appellant - plaintiff pointed
out that that in its Constituency, there are about 70 other societies and
accordingly, the voting right is available to 7 representatives in
accordance with the bye-law 6(A)(2); and there are about 98 individual
members; and accordingly, the voting right is available to 4
representatives in accordance with the bye-law 5(A)(3). Thus, the most
vital thing that came to be highlighted by the appellant - plaintiff in the
plaint was that the individual members were enrolled in the year 1960
i.e. at the time when the Milk Union was established. Almost 90% of
those members had passed away. If the notification declaring the
constituency and the voters list would have been published after
appropriate inquiry as regards the existence of the individual members,
then only 1 member would be entitled to vote instead of 4 members out
of the individual members in the electorate of the appellant - society in
accordance with the bye law 6(A)(3) of the Milk Union on account of
removal of the names of the deceased members.
</p>

<p id="p_180">38     The second thing that was highlighted before the Board of
Nominees by way of the Lavad Suit was that although the bye-law
No.48(1)(a) provides that if any society is not affiliated with the Union
on 31st March i.e. prior to the election, its name would not be included
in the voters list, yet 38 societies were admitted by the Union upto 31 st
March 2019, and all such societies were also included in the Notification
issued by the Managing Director of the Union dated 8th July 2020.
</p>

<p id="p_181">39     Thus, the suit came to be instituted before the Board of Nominees
pointing out that the delegates had not been elected in accordance with
the bye-laws of the society duly approved by the District Registrar. In
other words, the relevant bye-laws could be said to have been violated.
Despite the same, the notification of the final voters list to elect the

delegates came to be published on 8 th July 2020 without considering the
objections lodged by the appellant - society herein.
</p>

<p id="p_182">40     In view of the aforesaid, could it be said that the dispute is one
relating to an election of the member or members of the Committee of a
specified society? The learned Single Judge says that the heading of the
Rule 3A would itself suggest that the delimitation of constituencies is for
the purposes of election of members of the Committee of a specified
society. The learned Single Judge says that Rule 3A of the Rules should
be read in conjunction with <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_82">Section 145-U</a> of the Act. Ultimately, the
learned Single Judge said that the dispute relating to an election under
<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_83">Section 145-U</a> of the Act would take within its fold the purpose of
election i.e the delimitation of constituencies for the purposes of
election. To put it in other words, according to the learned Single Judge,
the subject matter of challenge in the Lavad Suit before the Board of
Nominees could be said to be only a dispute relating to an election or a
challenge to an intermediate stage in the process of election, and,
therefore, would not fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_84">Section 96</a> of the Act. With
all humility at our command, we are not in a position to agree with such
a line of reasoning adopted by the learned Single Judge.

<p id="p_183">41     The election of a specified society is specifically governed by the
Chapter XI-A of the Act and the Rules framed therein for such purpose.
Once the revenue Taluka-wise constituencies are provided in the bye-
laws subject to any change in such constituency, that may be approved
by the Registrar, only the constituency, as provided in the existing bye-
laws, are to be recognized for the purpose of holding election of the
specified society. The constituency for the purpose of election of a
specified society is an electoral division as specified in its bye-laws. The
election has, therefore, to be held for the constituencies specified in the

bye-laws. It is well settled that the bye-laws framed by a cooperative
society are binding on the society and its members and neither the
society nor its members can be permitted to act contrary to the bye-laws
adopted by the society. Rule 3A is just for the purpose of making the
voters in the constituencies aware about the prescription of limits of
each of the constituencies and about any change in the limits of the
constituencies. The plain reading of Rule 3A of the Rules would indicate
that it is only for describing the limit of each constituency by publishing
the provisional list of constituency and inviting suggestions from the
voters against any error in such provisional list of constituency so that
the limits of each constituency described in the provisional list could be
corrected before any further step is taken for publishing the provisional
list of the voters.
</p>

<p id="p_184">42     Rule 3A(8) of the Rules is aimed at geographical i.e. territory or
zone wise bifurcation or division. Once the area of operation of any
society is more than one village, sub-Rule (8) would come into play and
the requirement of the number of constituencies would be equal to the
total number of seats, excluding the two seats reserved for the categories
as provided under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_85">Section 74B</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_185">43     Further, the language of sub-Rule (9) of Rule 3A makes it clear
that the Rule Making Authority has conferred the Collector with the
power to delimit the constituency/constituencies prior to the publication
of the voters list. The delimitation of the constituency/constituencies
should be prior to the preparation of the voters list and/or in any case
simultaneous with the preparation of voters list, but the voters list has to
be as per the delimitation of the constituencies.

<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_86">Section 74C</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_87">Section 145(Y)</a> provides that the various stages
of election shall also include preparation of the list of voters. Once the
statute provides that the preparation of the voters list shall be part of the
election process, it could be said that the preparation of the electoral roll
is an intermediate stage in the process of the election of a specified
society. The perusal of the rules would indicate that the preparation of
provisional list of voters, filing of objection against the provisional list of
voters, consideration of the objection by the Collector and finalizing the
list of voters all occurred in the rules which covers entire process of the
election. The rules framed for election of the specified society are a
complete code in its proceedings for the entire process of election
beginning from the stage of preparation of the provisional voters list,
decision on the objection by the Collector, finalization of electoral roll
holding of election and declaration of result of the election. The question
is whether the election of delegates, in accordance with Rule 15 of the
Rules, 1965 read with <a href="/doc/91544928/" id="a_88">Section 28(8)</a> of the Act, on the basis of which the
delimitation of the constituency takes place under Rule 3A of the Rules,
1982 should also be held to be a part of the election process for
constituting the Managing Committee of a specified society? It is this
issue with which we are not in agreement with the view taken by the
learned Single Judge. At the cost of repetition, the election of delegates
does not fall within chapter XI-A of the Act. It is a dispute relating to the
bye-laws of the society and only the Board of Nominees under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_89">Section
96</a> of the Act has the jurisdiction to go into such issues of the legality
and validity of the election of delegates.

would be too much to say that no individual or any society can go to the
Board of Nominees in the event of any dispute touching the constitution,
management or business of a society even if such dispute is distantly or
remotely related to the final election that may take place for electing the
member or members of the Committee of a specified society. Once the
dispute relates to breach or violation of the bye-laws of the society, the
dispute would fall within the ambit of one touching the constitution,
management or business of the society as expressed under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_92">Section 96</a> of
the Act, 1961 and not relating to an election of the members of a
specified society.
</p>

<p id="p_188">46     What was challenged by the appellant - plaintiff before the Board
of Nominees by way of the Lavad Suit was the order passed by the
Managing Director of the Union by which the constituency was
determined under Rule 3(A)(1) and the voters of one seat were shown.
The appellant - plaintiff raised objections about the eligibility of all
those members to elect the delegates. In the scheme of the Rules, 1982
read with <a href="/doc/91544928/" id="a_93">Section 28(8)</a> of the Act and Rule 15 of the 1965 Rules, it is
the Managing Director of a cooperative society who will hold the
election of delegates. These delegates would find their names into the
provisional voters list that may be submitted by the Managing Director
to the Collector under Rules 4 and 5 respectively of the Rules, 1982.
Upon receipt of such list, the Collector, thereafter, has a very limited role
to play, except finding out any omission in the name or an error in
respect of the names or addresses. The Collector has no jurisdiction to
look into the correctness, legality of the election of delegates whose
names are shown in the provisional voters list.

Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_94">Section 145-U</a> and the
Rules. The proviso to Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_95">Section 145-U</a> further provides
that no election petition can be filed till the final result of the election is
declared. <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_96">Section 145-U</a> read with <a href="/doc/129504749/" id="a_97">Section 74</a> of the Rules, 1982 far from
being having served some object has only led over a period of time to
travesty of justice. When the legislature has thought fit to provide that
any dispute relating to an election shall be referred to the Tribunal and
an election petition can be filed only after the final result of the election
is declared, it has turned a blind eye to a hard reality that by the time,
the election petitions are adjudicated and decided the entire term of the
member of the Committee whose election is challenged or the entire
election if challenged would come to an end, and, thereafter, nothing
would survive. It is high time the State legislature gives a thought to
what we have observed. The State legislature may consider to provide a
reasonable mandatory time period for the Tribunal to adjudicate the
election petition and dispose of the same finally.
</p>

<p id="p_190">48     If we accept the submission canvassed on behalf of the original
writ applicants and also subscribe to the view taken by the learned
Single Judge, then it comes to saying that no individual or any society
can question any illegality or irregularity alleged to have been
committed even before any intermediate stage in the process of the
election of a specified society. In other words, even the illegalities
committed by the Managing Director of the Union so far as the election
of delegates is concerned cannot be looked into till the final result of the
election of a member or members of the Committee of a specified society
attains finality. We do not subscribe to such a view.

which strong reliance has been placed by the learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the original writ applicants for the purpose of
understanding the true purport and meaning of the expressions like

48 and 49 as under:

       not is a matter of interpretation of the statute and for adjudication
       under the provisions of the statute and does not affect the vires of the
       legislation and/or the legislative competence of Parliament. In fact, a
       wide range of services are included in the definition of taxable services
       as far as Mandap-Keepers are concerned. The said definition includes
       services provided &quot;in relation to use of Mandap in any manner&quot; and
       includes &quot;the facilities provided to the client in relation to such use&quot; and
       also the services &quot;rendered as a caterer&quot;. The phrase &quot;in relation to&quot; has

               sense. The expression &#x27;arising out of&#x27; has been used in the sense
               that it comprises purchase of shares and lands from income
               arising out of the Kanpur Undertaking. The words &quot;pertaining to&quot;

               used interchangeably for among other reasons, which may
               include avoidance of repetition of the same phrase in the same
               clause or sentence, a method followed in good drafting. The
               word &#x27;pertain&#x27; is synonymous with the word &#x27;relate&#x27;. The term
               &#x27;relate&#x27; is also defined as meaning to bring into association or

               a narrow meaning to mean only pendency of the arbitration
               proceedings before the arbitrator. It would cover not only
               proceedings pending before the arbitrator but would also cover
               the proceedings before the court and any proceedings which are
               required to be taken under the old Act for the award becoming a
               decree under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_103">Section 17</a> thereof and also appeal arising

               proceedings for the enforcement of the award as well, the second
               limb of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_104">Section 85(2)(a)</a> would become superfluous and cannot
               be accepted.&quot;&quot;

<blockquote id="blockquote_123">50     Thus, the Supreme Court laid down as a proposition of law that
the expressions referred to above should be construed as those of the
widest amplitude and content. When we say that such expressions are of
the widest amplitude and content, the same should be considered in the
context of the object a particular enactment or a particular provision of
law. In para 47 of the judgement of the Supreme Court referred to

services could be said to have been rendered or not would be a matter of
interpretation of the statute and for adjudication under the provisions of
the statute and the same would not affect the vires of the legislation. The
Supreme Court proceeded to observe that a wide range of services may
be included in the definition of taxable services as far as the
Mandapmam - Keepers were concerned. In such circumstances, the
Supreme Court said that the expression &quot;in relation to&quot; is a very broad

in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (supra), the Supreme Court said about such
expressions in context with an arbitration agreement. The Supreme
Court said that the various expressions in the contract could be said to
be of the widest amplitude and context and would include even the
questions as to the existence, validity and effect of the arbitration
agreement.

<p id="p_192">51     We are of the view that it would be too much to say that the
expression &quot;in relation to an election&quot; in <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_107">Section 145-U</a> of the Act would
also include any dispute relating to breach / violation of the bye-laws of
the society vis-a-vis the election of the delegates conducted by the
Managing Director of the Milk Union to which neither Rule 4 or Rule 6
of the Rules, 1982 applies nor the entire chapter XI-A of the Act applies.
It comes to saying that even if 90% of the individual members are
reported to be dead and despite various illegalities and irregularities
being highlighted with respect to the election of delegates, if, ultimately,
a vote is cast for one seat of Director and the same affects the ultimate
result of the election of any member or members of Committee of a

the Tribunal within a period of two months from the date of the decision
of the election.

<p id="p_194">53     Having regard to the view taken by us, as discussed above, we are
not in agreement with the ratio of the decision rendered by the learned
Single Judge in the case of Hasmukhbhai Jugatram Raval (supra). In the
said case, the Court declined to entertain a writ application on the
ground that not only the election was imminent but it was practically
completed upto the voting stage and 124 delegates were already
declared as uncontested. The only thing left was counting and
thereafter, electing the Directors. We are not in agreement with the view
taken therein that the process of election of delegates would be covered
within the ambit of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_110">Section 145A</a> of the Act. In other words, the view
taken by the learned Single Judge is that even if something is wrong
with the election of delegates, the same can be set right by filing an
election petition before the Cooperative Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_195">54     The principal contention canvassed by Mr. Jani, the learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant that merits consideration is
that the conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/91544928/" id="a_111">Section 28(8)</a> of the Act, 1961 read with
Rule 15(1) of the Rules, 1965 would indicate that the election of
delegates in a cooperative society is regulated by the Rules and bye-laws
of society and further, such election of delegates is not covered under
Chapter XI-A of the Act, 1961, which is in relation to holding of election
of members of the Committee of specified cooperative societies. What
was challenged before the Board of Nominees by instituting a Lavad Suit
was the order of the Managing Director of the Milk Union with respect to
delimitation of the constituencies under Rule 3(A)(1) of the Rules, 1982
and eligibility of the voters of one seat. In other words, the eligibility of

       amongst the individual members is not an election, as defined
       under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_112">Section 145B(b)</a> of the Act and the same is required to be
       conducted by the Managing Director of the society in accordance
       with the bye-laws and not by the Collector. If any dispute arises
       out of election of delegates, the same would not be covered under
       <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_113">Section 145U</a> of the Act and it can be referred to under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_114">Section 96</a>

       against the dispute relating to the election of Managing
       Committee. The role of the Collector, in the election process of a
       specified federal society, would start only after the election of the
       delegates from the individual members and passing of the
       resolutions by the affiliated society nominating their members. In
       the event of any dispute relating to this process, the same can be
       referred to the Board of Nominees under <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_115">Section 96</a> and not to the

<p id="p_197">56     For all the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the learned
Single Judge should not have issued a writ of certiorarified prohibition.

<p id="p_198">57     In the result, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The
impugned judgement and order passed by the learned Single Judge is set
aside. We hold that the Lavad Suit before the Board of Nominees
instituted by the appellant herein is maintainable in law.

58     We clarify that we have otherwise not expressed any opinion on
</pre><p id="p_199">the merits of the case put up by the appellant - plaintiff in the plaint. It
is for the Board of Nominees to look into and consider all the relevant
aspects of the matter as highlighted in the plaint. We also do not express
any opinion on the interim order that was passed by the Board of
Nominees in the Lavad Suit. It is always open for the original writ
applicants to get themselves impleaded as party defendants in the Lavad
Suit and contest the same on its own merits. If any such application for
impleadment is filed, the Board of Nominees shall look into the same
expeditiously and decide the same in accordance with law.

<p id="p_200">59     A lot has been said about the alleged dubious conduct of the
appellant herein (plaintiff) in instituting a frivolous suit. We do not
propose to go into this controversy also and leave it to the better
discretion of the Board of Nominees to consider the same when it comes
to grant of any discretionary or equitable relief.
