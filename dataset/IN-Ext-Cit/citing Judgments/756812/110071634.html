</p>
<p id="p_3">3.       The case of prosecution in brief is that on 26.04.2001 Sh.Vijay
Khanna, SDM, Rajouri Garden recorded the statement of Shri Jitender
Singh Daani father of victim Sarika(deceased) wherein Shri Jitender
Singh Daani stated that his daughter Sarika(deceased) was married to
Nitin Sharma /appellant No.2 on 02.10.2000. On the very next day of
marriage,Smt.Vinita/appellant No.1 mother-in-law of Sarika(deceased)
demanded ` 5 Lacs from her for the construction of top floor of their
house.     Smt.    Vinita/appellant   No.   1   has     also         threatened
Sarika(deceased) that if she would keep her son Nitin/appellant No.2
happy only then she would keep her happy. The newly wedded couple
even did not go for honey-moon. He has met with the small demands
of in-laws of his daughter as per his financial conditions but mother-in-
law, father-in-law, brother-in-law (Devar) and mother of mother-in-law
of Sarika(deceased) kept on torturing her. On 30-31/3/01 his wife fell
sick due to cervical attack but he did not inform it to Sarika(deceased)
as her in-laws were already bothering her. However, one day Sarika
(deceased) and Nitin/appellant No.2 suddenly visited their house and
on looking at ill health of her mother, Sarika (deceased) became upset
and with the permission of Nitin/ appellant No.2 she stayed back at his
house for overnight.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    On the next day while leaving for his office, he asked his wife
that since mother-in-law of Sarika(deceased) usually remain annoyed
with them, it would be appropriate if her permission is obtained for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">      Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                          Page 2 of 48</span>
 keeping Sarika (deceased) for some more time. But on asking, mother-
in-law of Sarika (deceased) replied in very unusual manner that why
our younger daughter would not take care of her mother. On this
account Sarika (deceased) tried to contact Nitin/appellant No. 2
seven/eight times on his mobile phone but he did not receive the calls
because the calls were made from telephone number of their residence.
Then Sarika(deceased) contacted Nitin/appellant No. 2 from the
telephone number of neighbouring house No.15-A. Nitin/appellant
No.2 shouted at her on phone and asked her to mind her own business.
In the evening when he returned, found Sarika (deceased) was crying
at that time. His father also came to his house to meet him. His father
also became very upset with such conduct of Nitin/appellant No. 2.
Then he alongwith his father, wife and daughter went to house of Mrs.
Bela and Anil Aunty &amp; Uncle (Mausi &amp; Mausa) of Nitin/appellant No.
2 to discuss in this regard. There Smt. Bela requested them that since
she was residing in the joint family, we should wait for him at the
house of Smt. Manju, accordingly they went there. Anil returned at
11.00 PM. After hearing them, he assured that he would talk to
Nitin/appellant No.2 and further asked to send Sarika (deceased) to his
house at 10.00 AM in the morning and he would advice Nitin/appellant
No. 2 to take her alongwith him. On next day, he made phone call to
Anil to inform him that he was sending Sarika(deceased) to his house
to which Anil replied that Vinita/appellant No. 1 &amp; Laxmi Narain
(mother-in-law &amp; father-in-law of deceased) had asked him that they
would take Sarika(deceased) to their house only after sorting out some
points including the demand of ` 5 Lacs. It badly hurted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">      Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                       Page 3 of 48</span>
 Sarika(deceased) and them. After few days, after collecting some
courage, he himself made request to Smt. Vinita/appellant No. 1 that
he was not in position to fulfill their demands and they should keep
Sarika(deceased) in their house as their own daughter. On his
insistence Vinita/appellant No. 1 allowed him to visit her house. Then
he alongwith his father, his wife and sister-in-law went to the
matrimonial house of Sarika(deceased).
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.      However, there the conduct of in-laws of Sarika (deceased)
made them very upset as Vinita/appellant No. 1 time and again was
stating that earlier she was behaving like mother and now onward she
would      behave      like      mother-in-law.   She   further    said   that
Sarika(deceased) would have to pay for the period she had stayed at
her parental house and also insisted that Sarika(deceased) should join
some job. Sarika remained twenty nine days with them when her
„Chura‟ was not yet removed. She used to wear „Mangalsutra‟ only
and used to wear the clothes of her sister despite newly wedded bride.
Under the fear of society, he sent his daughter to house of his father at
F-176, Mansarover Garden. There she used to remain alone on the
upper floor of the house. At about 12.00 midnight, when his father and
his sister Pushpa were sleeping, Sarika(deceased) took out some tablet
from her purse and went to bathroom. There she started vomiting and
at this his father woke up. On suspicion, his father asked Pushpa to
look into the matter and, accordingly, Pushpa knocked at the door of
bathroom and asked Sarika(deceased) that if door would not be opened
then she would break it. Sarika(deceased) opened the door but her

 condition was very serious. She immediately became unconscious. On
hearing noise, wife of his nephew also came to the spot and thereafter,
she went to call doctor from Nursing Home. His father informed him in
this regard on phone and when he went to the spot he found
Sarika(deceased) was in unconscious condition. With the help of
doctor they took Sarika(deceased) to Nursing Home, where the doctor
on duty after examining her stated the condition of Sarika (deceased)
was serious. Then they took Sarika (deceased) to Ganga Ram Hospital,
however, there the doctor on duty declared her clinically brought dead.
His   daughter      Sarika(deceased)   had   committed      suicide   as
Vinita/appellant No.1 (mother-in-law), Laxmi Narain (father-in-law),
Nitin/appellant No.2 (husband), Neeraj Sharma (Devar) had mentally
tortured her.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    On basis of statement of Shri Jitender Singh Daani, FIR U/s 304-

PW-4 J S Daani father of the deceased, PW-7 Parvesh Daani mother of
the deceased, PW-3 Ranjit Singh grandfather of the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_39">37.    He has pointed out that all these three witnesses has
categorically stated that on the next day of marriage the accused
Nitin/appellant No.2 along with family member started demanding ì.5
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">      Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                      Page 16 of 48</span>
 lakhs from the deceased for the purpose of construction of their house.
This demand by the accused persons continued till the death of Sarika.
</p>
<p id="p_40">38.   The Trial Judge has recorded that the prosecution has proved
beyond reasonable doubts that demand of ì 5.0 lakhs by accused
Nitin/appellant No.2 was actual demand of dowry under the garb of
construction of another floor of their house. The accused had repeated
this demand time and again. As per the deposition of PW-7 Parvesh
Daani, accused had demanded ì 5.0 lakhs from her on 24.04.2001,
thereafter, deceased had committed suicide.      As per statement of
witness/PW7 accused had demanded said amount from the deceased.
She had brought it to the notice of PW7 Parvesh Daani who also
deposed on similar line.
</p>
<p id="p_41">39.   It is further recorded that the deceased had undergone mental
cruelty as discussed above. As per <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_14">Section 113A</a> and B of Indian
Evidence Act, if the wife commits suicide within 07 years of marriage
it would be presumed that she was subjected to cruelty by her husband
or by his relatives. As a matter of fact, the marriage between the
accused and Sarika took place on 02.10.2000, whereas Sarika had
committed suicide on 26.04.2001 within span of 08 months only.
</p>
<p id="p_42">40.   Therefore, ld. trial judge has opined that in the light of entire
evidence she had committed suicide due to demand of dowry
immediately before her death i.e. the meeting of the deceased with the
accused Nitin on 24.04.2001 and 25.04.2001 as has come in the
evidence of PW3 Ranjit Singh. This witness has also proved that on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">      Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                       Page 17 of 48</span>
 24.04.2001 when Sarika after meeting accused Nitin was crying and
saying that she neither belongs to her „Maika‟ nor „Sasural‟. PW7
Parvesh Daani has also deposed that Sarika went to meet Nitin on
24.04.2001, thereafter she told her that Nitin was demanding ì 05
lakhs, therefore,    she could not join her matrimonial home.        The
meeting between Nitin and deceased could not succeed as the demand
of dowry was not fulfilled and on the very next day of the meeting she
committed suicide.
</p>
<p id="p_43">41.   Sh. K.K. Sud, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
appellants has submitted that the marriage between the appellant No.2
and the deceased took place on 02.10.2000. She used to take "Centrum
Medicine" which constitutes Sulpha. It is admitted that she died after
consuming the aforesaid medicine, while staying with her grandfather.
</p>
<p id="p_44">42.   It is further submitted that as deposed by the witness, firstly, the
deceased was taken to Sarovar Nursing Home, however, there is no
proof, rather, PW 5/Dr. Virender Singh had denied the fact that on
25.04.2001, no such person visited his hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_45">43.   He further submitted that from the date of marriage till the death
took place, no complaint was ever made against the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_46">44.   On 25.03.2001, on the occasion of opening of showroom of
factory, the appellants attended the functions. In between the time from
marriage to death, at least on 12 occasions, both the families attended

each other. On these occasions, both the appellants, father of the

 appellant No. 2 and Nani of the appellant No. 2 also attended the
occasions apart from the other relatives. It is also the admitted fact that
from 26.03.2001 till the date of incident i.e. on 25.04.2001, the
deceased never lived with the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_47">45.   Even, the cause of death was not recorded by Doctor of post
mortem. Viscera report as received from FSL was never shown to
Autopsy Doctor.
</p>
<p id="p_48">46.   On 26.04.2001, the statement of the complainant was recorded
on 02.05.2001, Supplementary statement was recorded, wherein, lot of
improvements were made by the complainant which are as under:-
</p><p id="p_49">      The first statement of Sh. Jitender, father of the deceased was
recorded on 26.04.2001, wherein, he stated that she had gone to the
house of his father at F176, Man Sarovar Garden and her father asked
Sarika as to what she was doing and she told his father that she was
taking medicine and on that pretext, she consumed intoxicating and
poisonous tablets and fainted at about 12‟o‟clock mid night. He got
intimation of this incidence and reached at the spot. Firstly, he took her
to Sarovar Nursing Home, thereafter, on the advice of the Doctor, she
was taken to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Her daughter was fed up with
her    in- laws behaviour.
</p>
<p id="p_50">47.   On 26.04.2011, the statement of Mr. Ranjeet Singh, Grand-
father of the deceased was recorded, wherein, he stated that so far as
his opinion is concerned, Sarika had deliberately consumed „Sulphose‟
or some other tablets because was she was under dures due to her in-
laws‟ behavious.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">      Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                          Page 19 of 48</span>
<p id="p_51"> 48.   On 26.04.2011, SDM recorded the statement of Sh. Jitender
Singh, the father of the deceased, wherein, he stated that on the very
next date, the appellant No. 1 demanded Rs.5 lacs so that she could
construct the upper floor and also question the girl that if she pleases
the boy (appellant No.2) only then, she would keep the girl happy. He
kept fulfilling their petty demands off and on as per his position. In-
laws of his daughter i.e. her brother-in-law, mother-in-law, kept on
torturing regularly in different ways finally with his wife Sh. Parvesh
Daani while cleaning the house during Navratra, developed the
survical problem on 30-31.03.2001, but in spite of that, he considered
it not proper to inform his daughter because her in-laws family were
already harassing her a lot.
</p>
<p id="p_52">49.   The said witness further deposed, his daughter and son-in-law
came to her house and seeing her mother ill got perturbed and stayed at
his house for a night to look after her mother with the permission of his
son-in-law. While going for office, he told his wife behaviour of the
daughter‟s mother-in-law remained so bad, hence, her mother-in-law
should be informed and asked if she would allowed Sarika to stay in
her parent‟s house for a few days. But mother-in-law/appellant No.1
rebuked saying why younger daughter would not look after and for
these reasons, deceased daughter tried 7/8 times to contact his son-in-
law on mobile phone, but he did not attend the phone call as
residence‟s phone number came on the screen of his mobile. For this
reason, Sarika tried to contact her husband by making call from
neighbourer‟s house. This time he attended the call being a new

 number. He shouted on her daughter, she to his house and started
weaping in the Evening. His father came to his house as he was very
worried, and daughter went to Janakpuri to meet Mausi and Mausa of
boy (Smt. Bela and Anil) and discussed his behaviour.
</p>
<p id="p_53">50.   It is further stated that the appellant No.1 &amp; Sh. Laxmi Narian
Sharma got very angry and before bringing the girl to their home,
wanted to clarify some matters which also included the demand of
` 5 lacs.
</p>
<p id="p_54">51.   After some days, he gathered some courage requested the
appellant No.1 that it was beyond his capacity to give this much of
amount and requested to treat her daughter as her daughter. But she
refused to meet him. He along with his family members including his
father, his wife, and sister-in-law(saali) reached at the matrimonial
house of his daughter but he was shocked and surprised to see the
strange behaviour of his daughter‟s mother-in-law. She repeatedly said
that so far she was treating her (Sarika) as her own daughter but now
onwards she would show that she would show her as mother-in-law.
The deceased will have to bear penalty for the period she lived in her
parents‟ home. The girl was in shock and her behaviour was confirmed
from the fact that she lived in her parents‟ home for the last 29 days,
whereas the „Chura‟ was intact and used to wear the clothes of younger
sister, whereas, she was a newly wedded girl, but had to wear the
clothes of her younger sister.

<p id="p_55"> 52.      Learned Senior Advocate has submitted that there are
unanswered arguments/questions by the prosecution which completely
renders the prosecution‟s allegations in their entirety as false and a
farce.
</p><p id="p_56">         Belated allegations:-
</p><p id="p_57">         Mother of the deceased PW7 Smt.Parvesh Daani stated in the
Court only that Sarika lost weight and she advised appellant to take
care and on their return to home Nitin slapped Sarika on 14.03.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_58">53.      PW9 Ms.Shika Daani, younger sister of the deceased Sarika has
admitted that she made no reference to Sarika having lost any weight
or to being unhappy.
</p>
<p id="p_59">54.      PW4 Shri J. S. Daani (father of deceased) stated that one day
prior to Holi he and his wife visited the appellants. Everything was
normal at the matrimonial house of Sarika. His younger daughter had
to appear for her board exams in the year 2001. This witness had also
admitted that Sarika used to help Sikha in her studies. Sarika had been
coming to see her ailing mother - whenever she had fallen sick.
</p>
<p id="p_60">55.      Learned Senior Advocate further submitted that on farce
regarding „Crorepati‟ / explanation of car and cash in the marriage of
granddaughter was baseless, imaginative and insinuatory allegation as
to appellant Vinita having said that the grandfather PW3 Sh.Ranjit
Singh was a „crorepati‟, to bolster the case only in deposition before
the Court; whereas the same was not set up in the earlier statements of
PW3, PW4, &amp; PW7 Smt.Parvesh Daani (who made a statement before
the SDM on 02.05.2001, seven days after the occurrence i.e.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">         Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                    Page 22 of 48</span>
 25/26.04.2001.) Therefore, neither he is in fact „Crorepati‟ nor was any
expectations from him. Thus, the allegations of demanding dowry is
baseless and concocted one.
</p>
<p id="p_61">56.   It is submitted, PW3 Shri Ranjit Singh (grandfather) was a
retired divisional manager from Oriental Insurance Company. His last
drawn monthly salary was ` 5,000/- and was having a pensioner only
getting ` 1,300/- per month and had no other source of income. He
was aged 88 years and was living in DDA flat bearing No.176, Second
Floor, Mansarover Garden, New Delhi. He had several liabilities to
marry his other daughters i.e. Pushpa, (who was present in the house
at the time of occurrence and was never examined by the police, SDM
or even by the Court).
</p>
<p id="p_62">57.   He further submitted that in addition, PW4 Shri J. S. Daani
(father of the deceased) has admitted in his deposition that he was
living in flat bearing No.16-A, Pocket - B, Keshavpuram, Delhi (a
refugee rehabilitation colony).   He was also working as divisional
manager in Oriental Insurance Company and his wife was a pensioner
of ` 1,300/- per month and, therefore, there was no other earning
member in the family. He further submits that no demand was made
by the accused. It is admitted in deposition that it was a simple
marriage. On his birthday i.e. 09.10.2000, Nitin - appellant No.2 had
gifted him a shirt. Sarika had stayed at their house on many occasions
for 3-4 days after her marriage. Further he admitted that articles, gift
etc with respect to „Karvachauth‟ were purchased by Sarika during her
stay in their house and were taken to her matrimonial house. He did

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">      Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                        Page 23 of 48</span>
 not know if Sarika had told her mother about the demand of diamond
set, whether on phone or personally. He did not remember when his
wife told him about it. She was not in the habit of telling him such
things as he was an asthmatic patient. He further admitted that Sarika
did not tell him directly about the demands of her in-laws and their
behaviour towards her.
</p>
<p id="p_63">58.   This witness has been confronted with the statement made
before the police Ex.PW4/D-1 regarding cash and Ex.PW4/A
regarding demand of diamond set. This witness has also admitted all
visits and participation of two families till 26.03.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_64">59.   Learned Senior counsel for the appellants has also commented
upon the falsity of story of visit to Bela on 04.04.2001. The said Bela
is not a witness examined by the police of by the Court, there was no
occasion to meet Bela or discuss with her about any demands of
appellants in view of what is on the record.
</p>
<p id="p_65">60.   PW3 Shri Ranjit Singh (grandfather of the deceased Sarika)
stated that he had not personally attended any meeting regarding
marriage proposal. His son Jitender Singh (PW4) had informed him
about the marriage. He further admits that he cannot tell the date when
Sarika informed him that appellants were demanding money or car
from her parents. He has further admitted that despite Vinita‟s
objection to Sarika‟s stay at her mother‟s place when her mother was
not well, she stayed at her mother‟s house.         He did not visit the
matrimonial house of Sarika alone after 26.03.2001 till her death.
They have two telephone connections at their house. Further admitted

 that he did not know whether Sarika had called Nitin on 03.04.2001
either from his house or her father‟s house on mobile phone of Nitin
and Nitin had responded/attended those calls. He did not know as to
whether Sarika had called Nitin on 03.04.2001 in the afternoon from
her father‟s house and in the evening from his house and Nitin on his
mobile phone for 03:30 minutes and 01:40 minutes respectively.     He
also did not know as to whether Nitin had called up from his mobile
phone No.9810201529 twice in the evening at his residence on phone
No.5911678 for duration of 0.23 and 2.29 minutes respectively and the
said calls were attended by Sarika. Neither he nor any of the family
members talked to Nitin on his mobile phone number on 03.04.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_66">61.    He submitted that this witness   PW3 Shri Ranjit Singh had
further deposed that Jitender had informed him that Sarika had called
Nitin on his mobile phone on 04.04.2001 and Nitin disconnected the
phone after seeing her number. He could not tell the phone number or
the number of the neighbour from where Sarika had called on
04.04.2001. He also could not tell about the conversation between
deceased Sarika and Nitin from the said phone number. He also did not
remember as to what was discussed in that meeting.      Neither Sarika
nor any family member told him that Sarika and her husband were not
having physical relations. He also did not remember the name of the
place where they had stayed during their visit to Mussourie between
06.04.2001 to 11.04.2001. They had returned to Delhi on 11.04.2001.
He had never visited the house of appellants on the occasions of
festivals etc.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">       Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                     Page 25 of 48</span>
</p><p id="p_67"> 62.   He further deposed, the atmosphere was healthy and happy.
There was no dispute or any other discussion. His birthday falls on 16 th
March. He admitted that Vinita and her husband had come to his
house on 16.03.2001 to wish his birth day. They had dinner on that
day. They did not discuss with him anything else on that day.
</p>
<p id="p_68">63.   Learned Senior Advocate for the appellants further submits that
PW-3 did not know as to what had transpired in the meeting between
Jitender and Nitin on 12.04.2001 and 24.04.2001. He did not know as
to how Sarika had fixed her meeting with Nitin for 23.04.2001 and
from where she had spoken to him on 22.04.2001. He also could not
tell as to what Sarika had told Nitin on 22.04.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_69">64.   Learned Senior Advocate, on medicine further submitted that
this witness admitted that he was also taking Centrum, which was sent
by his daughter from America for him. His daughter Pushpa had
thought that Sarika was also taking „Centrum‟ on the date of incident.
It is further admitted in his statement that Ex.PW3/B he had not stated
that appellants had demanded cash or car or any other dowry. He did
not know as to whether he had told anything in Ex.PW3/B that Sarika
had taken medicine at 12:03/01:00 AM in the night.               He did not
remember as whether he had told the Investigating Officer regarding
the meeting dated 23.04.2001 and 25.04.2001. Even the attention of the
witness was also drawn to the statement Ex.PW3/B and he admitted to
having not stated the above facts therein.
</p>
<p id="p_70">65.   This witness had no knowledge of meeting of Sarika and Nitin
fixed on 23.04.2001 and 25.04.2001. It is only introduced as „hear-

<p id="p_71"> say‟ as an improvement in the line with PW7 who falsely deposed so in
the Court only. If any such thing had happened on 03.04.2001, the
family would not go to Mussurie on 05.04.2001 to 11.04.2001. Talks
of phone calls of Sarika on 03.04.2001 build false story of Bela‟s
meeting and yet does not react and coolly goes with Sarika and family
for holiday to Mussourie after alleged meeting Bela on 04.04.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_72">66.   Even PW4 Shri J. S. Daani, in his examination-in-chief admits
that all demands were told by Sarika to her mother alone. No demand
was made by appellants when the marriage was finalised. He further
deposed that on 06.04.2001, he alongwith his wife had gone to
Mussoruie and Sarika had also accompanied them.     They went by two
cars i.e. one his own and another was of his father. Before leaving for
Mussourie they had not personally contacted either Nitin or his mother
or any other member of the family. They stayed in a guest house of
Oriental Insurance Company. He did not make any phone calls to
Nitin or his family members from Mussourie. This witness also
admitted that they had returned to Delhi on 11.04.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_73">67.   Learned Senior Advocate has further submitted regarding the
allegations from 26.03.2001 to 21.04.2001. He had once gone to
matrimonial house of Sarika, the date of such visit was not
remembered by the witness. On that occasion, the house was locked,
as was told later on that mother of Vinita was sick and nobody was at
the house. During that particular period, he had never personally or
otherwise talked to Nitin, Vinita or Laxmi Narain, which exclude


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">      Crl.Appeal No.249/2009                       Page 27 of 48</span>
 falsely alleged meeting with Nitin on 04.04.2001, 12.04.2001 or
15.04.2001.
</p>
<p id="p_74">68.   It is further submitted, this witness further deposed that he could
not say whether Sarika had been staying with them for about a week

long leave after the marriage of Shikha till her death. His post was
such in the office that he could not take leave from office as he was
incharge. He did not remember any particular date when he had taken
leave from his office. He further deposed that there been occasions
when Sarika had called him up on telephone and he had talked her. He
could not tell the day of the week when the telephone calls were
received from Sarika. Sarika had told him that while she used to talk
over telephone, her in-laws used to hear the conversation from the
other line.

<p id="p_75">69.   Learned Senior Advocate further submitted that there was no
parallel telephone in the house of appellants. None was seized by the
police nor any evidence of telephone department.

KM away that of witness. Sarika was otherwise keeping well and
generally happy.

 decision in no way takes a different view than what has been held in
enormity of decisions on the subject which are highlighted and
appended hereinabove.

<p id="p_78">72.   Learned counsel further submitted that the ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_16">Section
304B</a> Indian Penal Code, 1860 as also the expression that „woman
should be subjected to cruelty in relation to meeting of demands made
soon before death, which must be in connection with the marriage.
The presumption by way of deeming fiction under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_17">Section 113B</a> of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 could be raised and that for the same the
pre-condition is that the ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_18">Section 304B</a> Indian Penal
Code, 1860 must be satisfied and proved. It holds that the presumption
does not aim merely on account of death being unnatural and within
seven years of marriage.
</p>
<p id="p_79">73.   Learned counsel for the appellants vehemently urges that such a
presumption is rebuttable one. The enormity of the material on record
shows that Nitin, the husband and his mother Vinita have successfully
demonstrated on the basis of the facts appearing in the evidence of the
relation witnesses that no presumption is liable to be raised. Among
various other earlier decisions, the Court also relied upon <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_19">Appasaheb
&amp; Anr v. State of Maharashtra</a> 2007 (1) JCC 147.
</p>
<p id="p_80">74.   Learned Senior Advocate, alternatively has argued on the point
of sentence and submitted that RI for ten years to husband Nitin is
unwarranted. The Courts have always reduced sentence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_20">Section

Court unchallenged. Having already undergone nearly seven years out
of the ten years sentence awarded; two daughters after re-marriage.
Business of printing press already closed down and investment of

reduction of sentence to minimum of seven years.

             did not call the wife to the matrimonial home, it
             cannot amount to harassment. Driving her out

appellants attended the functions. In between the time from marriage to
death, at least on 12 occasions, both the families attended the festivals
or get together happily and there is no complaint against each other. It

 Shri J. S. Daani, father of the deceased has admitted in his deposition
that he was living in flat bearing No.16-A, Pocket - B, Keshavpuram,
Delhi (a refugee rehabilitation colony).     He was also working as
divisional manager in Oriental Insurance Company and his wife was a
pensioner of ` 1,300/- per month and, therefore, there was no other
earning member in the family. He has further admitted that no demand
was made by the appellants. It was also that it was a simple marriage.
He admits that on his birthday i.e. 09.10.2000, Nitin - appellant No.2
had gifted him a shirt. Sarika had stayed at their house on many
occasions for 3-4 days after her marriage. Further he has admitted that
articles, gift etc with respect to „Karvachauth‟ were purchased by
Sarika during her stay in their house and were taken to her matrimonial
house. He did not know if Sarika had told her mother about the
demand of diamond set, whether on phone or personally. This witness
had been confronted with the statement made before the police
Ex.PW4/D-1 regarding cash and Ex.PW4/A regarding demand of
diamond set. This witness has also admitted all visits and participation
of two families till 26.03.2001.

not know as to whether Sarika had called Nitin on 03.04.2001 in the
afternoon from her father‟s house and in the evening from his house
and Nitin on his mobile phone for 03:30 minutes and 01:40 minutes

from his mobile phone No.9810201529 twice in the evening at his
residence on phone No.5911678 for duration of 0.23 and 2.29 minutes
respectively and the said calls were attended by Sarika. Neither he nor
any of the family members talked to Nitin on his mobile phone number
on 03.04.2001. This witness had also admitted that neither Sarika nor
any family member told him that Sarika and her husband were not
having physical relations. He has further admitted that on his birthday
i.e. 16.03.2001, atmosphere was healthy and happy. There was no
dispute or any other discussion on that day. He has also admitted that
Vinita, appellant No.1 and her husband had come to his house on
16.03.2001 to wish his birth day. They had dinner on that day. They
did not discuss with him anything else on that day. Regarding the
phone calls made by appellant No.2, Nitin to deceased Sarika, a day
before in Connaught Place, New Delhi has also not been proved
because these calls have not been proved by the service provider. In
the absence of that merely deposing by other witnesses, has no weight.

with the marriage. The presumption by way of a deeming fiction
under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_69">Section 113B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 could be raised and
that for the same, the pre-condition is that the ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_70">Section

presumption does not aim merely on account of death being unnatural

 and within seven years of marriage. Until and unless, it is established
that soon before the death, the deceased was subjected to cruelty by
her husband or in of his relative for or in connection with any demand
of „dowry‟, such death shall be called „dowry death‟ and such husband
or relative of the husband shall be deemed to have caused her death.
The Parliament has also inserted <a href="/doc/462524/" id="a_71">Section 113</a> of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872 by Act 43 of 1986 with effect from 01.05.1986, as discussed

appellants for the construction of one portion on the terrace of the
house, then that demand for money on account of some financial
stringencies or meeting some urgent domestic manure cannot be
termed as demand of dowry, as is decided in Appasaheb &amp; Anr
(supra).

<p id="p_100">94.   The Trial Court has not considered the facts which were in
favour of the appellants and has convicted the appellants only on the
evidence led by prosecution against   them. Any evidence which is in
favour of the accused has equal weight and Court has to weigh
evidences from both sides before reaching to any particular conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_101">95.   In the present case, both the families had attended, as discussed
above, as many as 12 festivals. Had there been any harassment or
cruelty being committed by the appellants, there would have no such
type of cordial relations between both the families. The appellants

 would not have even attended the birth day of the grandfather of the
deceased. It is also evidence on record that the deceased Sarika was
staying with her parents to help her younger sister Shika in preparation
of board exams and attending her ailing mother. It is also on record
that appellant No.2, Nitin used to visit his mother-in-law, as and when
she fell ill and Sarika was staying with her parents with wish and
consent of the appellant No.2.

<p id="p_102">96.    In addition, accused persons namely, Neeraj and Tara Rani were

Daani, father of the deceased has admitted all visits and participation
of both the families.
</p>
<p id="p_111">105. The demand of diamond set on „Karvachauth‟ seems to be
unbelievable, when the parents of deceased were not in position even
to fulfill the demand of alleged ` 5 Lacs.
</p>
<p id="p_112">106. Keeping the above discussion into view, I am of the considered
opinion, no cruelty was committed by the appellant. Demands of
dowry has not been proved.        Therefore, question of proximity of
cruelty for demand of dowry does not arise. Cause of death has not
been established. Admittedly, she died within 7 years of marriage,
however, the appellants cannot be held guilty for the same.
