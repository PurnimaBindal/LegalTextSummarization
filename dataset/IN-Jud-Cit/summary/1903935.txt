The petitioner challenged the amendments made in the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RP Act, 1951) through the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act 40 of 2003.
The amendments deleted the requirement of "domicile" in the State concerned for getting elected to the Council of States, which according to the petitioner violated the principle of federalism.
The petitioner further challenged the amendments in Sections 59, 94 and 128 of the RP Act, 1951, which introduced the open ballot system.
The petitioner argued that the open ballot system violated the principle of "secrecy," which is the essence of free and fair elections and the voter's freedom of expression, a basic feature of the Constitution and the subject-matter of the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.
