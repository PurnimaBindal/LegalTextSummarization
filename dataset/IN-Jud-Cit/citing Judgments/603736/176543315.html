                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                 Dated this the 8th day of September, 2020

Manikumar, CJ

      Instant writ appeals are filed against judgment dated 22.07.2020 in

W.P.(C) No.12935 &amp; 14222 of 2020, by which, a learned single Judge of

this Court dismissed the writ petitions, observing thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "28. In view of the objectives sought to be achieved by
       the Act, 2005, the provisions of the Act shall be read
       harmoniously and a purposive interpretation has to be given to
       the provisions. During disasters, situations may arise which
       make it infeasible, unviable and impracticable for the
       Authorities under the Act to make an order of requisition in
       writing for procuring resources, premises or vehicles. Such
       situations may arise due to time constraints, due to immediate
       non-availability   of   persons       or   information   as   to   the
       whereabouts of persons and a host of other reasons which are
       special to disasters and which cannot be foreseen during
       normal times. Therefore, it will be open to the District Authority
       to invoke <a href="/doc/153127/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> and procure use of amenities including
       buildings from any authority or person even without formal
       requisition and take such other steps as may be required
       or warranted to be taken in such situations. Ext.P3
       proceedings of the respondents are therefore not liable to be
       interfered with.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             29. The argument of the petitioners that the source of
       power for taking over the building is Ext.P5, cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                     6</span>



       accepted. Ext.P5 is only guidelines laid down by the Local Self
       Government Department of the Government of Kerala. Such
       guidelines cannot be construed in the manner statutory
       provisions are construed. In the present case, Ext.P3 has
       been issued invoking the powers under the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_2">Disaster
       Management Act</a>. An order validly made in accordance with
       the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_3">Disaster Management Act</a>, 2005, cannot be interfered with
       even if there has been any transgression of any guidelines laid
       down by the Government. This is especially so when the
       action of the respondents cannot be treated as arbitrary,
       malafide or violating any statutory provision.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            30. The take-over is made by the DDMA in exercise of
       the powers under the Act, 2005. As regards taking over of
       residential buildings, such course is permissible under the Act.
       In view of the purpose for which the take-over is resorted to,
       proximity of CFTC to Hospital being the prime consideration,
       the action of the respondents in selecting the building in
       question which is proximate to Kannur District Hospital,
       ignoring other types of buildings which are farther, cannot be
       found fault with. Even if the take-over is as part of capacity
       building measure, the seriousness of the pandemic and
       imminence of the requirement also justify the action of the
       respondents. Non-issuance of a formal requisition, selection of
       a residential building and urgency with which the District
       Authority acted, do not singularly or together, constitute
       malafides, as alleged by the petitioners.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            In the circumstances, this Court does not find any
       arbitrariness, illegality or malafide on the part of the
       respondents in issuing Ext.P3 proceedings or in the action
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                      7</span>



       pursuant     thereto.   The   writ   petitions   are   accordingly
       dismissed."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      2. Facts leading to the filing of instant writ appeals are that,-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">challenging Order No. DCKNR/3383/2020/DMI dated 28.06.2020 passed

by the District Collector, Kannur, under the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_4">Disaster Management Act</a>,

2005, W.P.(C) Nos.12935 &amp; 14222 of 2020 have been filed.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. First petitioner in W.P.(C) No.12935 of 2020 is one of the

co-owners of land in which a flat complex has been constructed and he is

the owner of one of the flats. Second petitioner is the builder and since No

Objection Certificate has not been received so far and construction of

Sewage Treatment Plant was not in order, the completion certification has

not been issued by the Municipal Corporation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. Almost all the flats have been transferred to different persons by

executing sale deeds. About eleven flats have already been finished

completely and owners of the flats, who are residing elsewhere, on

account of their employment, have planned to come and occupy the

buildings.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. Appellants/petitioners in W.P.(C) No.14222 of 2020 are two of the

residents of a residential apartment, viz., Z Plus Apartments, situated in

Kannur City. The first petitioner has been residing in Flat No. 6 B in the 6th

floor of the above said apartments and the second petitioner has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                     8</span>



residing in Flat No. 9 C in 9 th Floor, along with his wife and 3 daughters for

the last 2 years. Exhibits-P1 and P2 are the sale deeds executed by the

builder on behalf of petitioners 1 and 2, transferring their rights over the

respective flats, including the undivided right in the land.

</p><p id="p_6">      6. While so, the District Collector, Kannur, first respondent in both

Writ Appeals, issued order dated 28.06.2020 taking over the flat complex,

for converting it as a Covid First Line Treatment Centre (CFLTC). Exhibit-

P4 in W.P.(C) No.12935 of 2020 is the Government order dated

25.05.2020, by which, CFLTC have been introduced under the <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_5">Disaster

Management Act</a>, 2005, and the type of buildings, which could be taken

over, has been stated therein. According to the appellants, in the type of

buildings, enumerated in Clause 3 of Government order dated 25.05.2020,

residential flats are not included. In Spite of that, the first respondent,

without issuing any notice and even without verifying the feasibility and

suitability of the building, for converting as CFLTC, has issued order dated

28.06.2020, which is on a Sunday, and on the very same day, by evening,

the officers came with a huge Police force, evicted the inmates therein,

and taken over the building.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7. Despite the fact that when more than 350 beds were vacant in

Government hospitals located nearby, three Covid patients were

immediately brought into the building, which is not completed, and not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                    9</span>



been made hygienic. Though there was no sewage treatment plant in the

building, fire NOC was issued. Action of the first respondent in issuing

Exhibit-P3 order dated 28.06.2020 is absolutely arbitrary and illegal.

</p><p id="p_8">      8. According to the appellants, the project for introducing CFLTC is

a part of capacity building for accommodating Covid patients, in the event

of an increase in the number of patients in the district. In Spite of the fact

that there is no imminent danger or disaster like overnight flood or

landslide, first respondent has taken over the residential building by

issuing Exhibit-P3 order dated 28.06.2020, without prior notice.

</p><p id="p_9">      9. Before the writ court, the Law Officer attached to the office of the

first respondent, has filed a counter affidavit. The first respondent in both

the appeals, who is the District Collector, Kannur, is an eo-nominee party

and filing of the counter affidavit on his behalf by another person is

absolutely impermissible and, therefore, the counter affidavit itself is not

liable to be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     10. In the counter affidavit, it was contended that a meeting was

convened on 27.06.2020 in the Chambers of Additional District Magistrate,

Kannur and Mr. Mashoob, 2nd appellant in W.A. No.959 of 2020, as well as

the Manager of the Apartment Mr. P.V.Sandeep, participated in the

meeting. It was further stated there are four Covid hospitals in which, the

bed strength is 1159, and the vacant bed space as on the date was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                     10</span>



</p><p id="p_11">351.Though admitted so, the counter affidavit further proceeded to say

that three patients were brought to the           centre admittedly near to the

District Hospital, where number of beds were vacant. It was also stated

that, in the meeting the 2nd appellant has stated that the flats are

transferred to different owners and intimation has to be given to them.

However stating that the 2nd respondent did not furnish the address of the

flat owners on the same day, on 28.06.2020 (Sunday), Exhibit-P4 order

has been issued.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      11. In the reply affidavit, appellants have stated that there was no

such meeting on 27.06.2020 for the purpose of handing over and the 2 nd

respondent has gone to the Collectorate, requesting to make payment for

the hotel already acquired by the first respondent.

</p><p id="p_13">      12. When the discussion was going, in the matter of compensation,

a question was asked about the flats to be taken over, and a specific reply

was given that the flats are already transferred to the owners. The above

fact is admitted in the counter affidavit also.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      13. Along with the reply affidavit, appellants in W.A. No.959/2020,

have produced Exhibits-P6 to P10, to show that the number of buildings in

the category enumerated in Government order dated 25.05.2020 [Ext.P4

in W.P.(C):12935/2020] were already available in the city.

</p><p id="p_15">      14. There is a hotel of the 2nd appellant's family, within a reach of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                   11</span>



500 metres, and another hotel, within another 300 metres. These hotels

were once taken over by the District Collector and are the type of buildings

enumerated in Exhibit-P4 Government order.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      15. Appellants have further contended that out of 102 buildings, 50

of them taken over, were released. Exhibit-P11 in W.P.(C) No.12935 of

2020 is the news item published in Mathrubhumi daily dated 12.07.2020,

which would show that subsequently, in collaboration with the Aster MIMS

Hospital, a project has been evolved to convert different hotels as Covid

First Line Treatment Centre's and, therefore, taking over of the residential

complex ought to have been avoided.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      16. Appellants have further stated that their right to live as owners

of flats, is taken away and they are practically thrown to streets. <a href="/doc/181028/" id="a_6">Section

65</a> of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates issuance of request,

in writing, before taking over, and the said provision has been flagrantly

violated by the first respondent, while taking over the building. Hence,

W.A. No.959 of 2020 has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      17. Appellants in W.A. No.975 of 2020 have stated that out of 47

flats, interior works of 11 have been completed, and in other flats, interior

works are going on. According to them, almost all the flats are handed

over to the respective owners.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      18. Appellants further stated that the Municipal Corporation has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                   12</span>



issued occupancy certificate to the building, on account of non-issuance of

fire NOC, and the sewage treatment plant is not constructed as per the

specifications. The waste from the toilet goes to a single pit and the work

of the sewage treatment plant is nearing completion. Since the appellants

have no other place to reside, they have occupied the flats, after

completing the interior works, as well as the household equipment. They

are permanently residing in the above said flats.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      19. While so, in the evening of 28.06.2020 (Sunday), a set of

officers along with about 200 policemen came to the premises and

directed the appellants to vacate their flats. Electricity connection was

disconnected and the functioning of the lift was stopped. The

appellants/petitioners in W.P.(C).No. 14222 of 2020 were directed to

vacate the flats immediately. Though the appellants have requested the

officers to permit them to stay there, as they have no other place to go, the

officers have not heeded to their request and the appellants were directed

to leave the place immediately.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      20. The first appellant in W.A. No.975 of 2020, by late night,

reached the house of a relative at Thalassery and in view of the present

pandemic situation, the relative was initially reluctant to accommodate

him, but having regard to the plight of the first appellant, provided

accommodation. The first appellant is aged 68 years and there is no one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                    13</span>



to look after him. There is no place to go also.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      21. Appellants have further contended that their eviction was based

on an order dated 28.06.2020 (Exhibit-P4), which states that for the

purpose of converting it as a Covid First Line Treatment Centre, the

building is taken over.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      22. Treatment Centres are introduced and the guidelines appended

to the order dated 25.05.2020, enumerate the type of buildings which

could be taken over as Covid First Line Treatment Centres. As per the

guidelines, the buildings are "Hostels, Hotels, Closed Hospitals, Lodges,

Resorts, Ayurvedic Hospitals, Training Centres, Schools, Colleges,

Auditoriums, Community Halls, buildings of the religious and community

organisations." Residential flats are not included in the buildings which

could be taken over for the Covid First Line Treatment Centres.

</p><p id="p_24">      23. Appellants have further stated that perusal of Exhibits-P5 to P10

in W.P.(C) No.14222 of 2020 would show that there are number of

buildings in the city, categorised in the Government order dated

25.05.2020, produced as Exhibit-P3 in the said writ petition, for taking

over. They have also stated that about 102 buildings, earlier taken over by

the first respondent for being converted as Covid First Line Treatment

Centres,   were     released   and   taking   over   of   residential   flats   is

impermissible, after releasing those buildings. Exhibit-P11 news item
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                     14</span>



published in Mathrubhumi daily would also show that on 12.07.2020, the

authorities concerned have decided to collaborate with Aster MIMS

Hospital and to convert different hotels as CFLTC.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      24. Appellants have further contended that Government order dated

28.06.2020 (Exhibit-P4 herein) is arbitrary, since it has been issued

without prior notice, depriving the right of the appellants to live in the flats

owned by them. Even in the case of disaster, <a href="/doc/181028/" id="a_7">Section 65</a> of the Disaster

Management Act, 2005 mandates a request before proceeding to issue

orders, for taking over a building. The District Collector is bound by

Exhibit-P4 Government order dated 28.06.2020, more so when there are

buildings available, as enumerated in Exhibit-P3, and issuance of Exhibit-

P4 order, for taking over a residential building, without assigning any

reason, is absolutely illegal. Hence, the appellants filed W.P.(C) No.14222

of 2020.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      25. Before the writ court, the District Law Officer, Kannur, on behalf

of respondent No.1, has filed a counter affidavit, contending as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      (a) It is not correct to say that all the purchasers have occupied the
      building. Only two families were there in the apartment complex that
      too, temporarily. The District Collector, Kannur, in exercise of powers,
      conferred under <a href="/doc/153127/" id="a_8">Sections 34</a> and <a href="/doc/181028/" id="a_9">65</a> of the Disaster Management Act,
      2005, had taken possession of the residential apartment building for
      the purpose of functioning as CFLTC. The unnumbered apartment
      building is located in Ward Number 3, Block 22 in RS No.1042/5 in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                            15</span>



     Kannur 1 Amsom, in Kannur Karar Desom, Kannur Taluk, Kannur
     District. The building with 47 flat rooms, including a common area, has
     been taken over by the District Magistrate and Chairman of District
     Disaster Management Authority, Kannur, on 28.06.2020 as per Ext.P3
     order. The Tahsildar, Kannur, has taken over the building on the same
     day itself, as directed by the 1 st respondent and handed over the

     district was in dire need of facilities to accommodate patients, the
     District    Medical      Officer,      Kannur,     took     possession         of     the

     Moreover, patients declared positive after the Rapid Anti body Test,
     being conducted in the Kannur Airport for all passengers, who are
     coming from abroad, also need to be accommodated in appropriate
     care centres. At present, four hospitals in Kannur district are handling
     Covid positive cases. It has to be noted that these hospitals should
     also cater to those in need of medical help due to non-Covid ailments.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      (c) First respondent has further contended that to manage the rising
     number of Covid positive cases, District Administration, Kannur has
     already proposed setting up facilities named as Covid First Line
     Treatment Centres (CFTCs). These buildings are situated near to
     designated Covid Treatment Centre, Anjarakandy, Government
     Medical College, Pariyaram, and Government Hospital, Kannur. The
     First Line Treatment Centres identified so far include Government
     buildings like DIET Building, Kannur, PWD Rest House, Kannur,
     Sports Hostel, Kannur, and Ayurveda Medical College, Pariyaram. Due
     to   non-availability   of   more    such   Government   buildings,   the
     administration has also taken over the following private buildings -
     Malabar Institute of Technology Anjarakandy, Kannur, and IRC,
     Pariyaram. The District Administration has also identified many
     buildings in the Taluk Headquarters to be converted as Covid
     Treatment Centres. In Kannur District, Government owned Hostel
     buildings are old and are in dilapidated condition. So, those buildings
     are not fit to be converted as Covid Treatment Centres. The "Z Plus
     Apartment'' is, therefore, an ideal building to be converted as Covid-19
     Line Treatment Centre. If the health condition of any patient
     deteriorates, she/ he can be moved immediately to District Hospital, as
     the building is situated very near to Government Headquarters Hospital
     (50 meters away from Government Hospital). Moreover, we are also
     facing an acute shortage of Health Staff. If this building is made
     available for us, it can be managed with the available staff in the
     District Headquarters Hospital.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (d) First respondent has further contended that District Headquarters
     Hospital is one of the Covid Treatment Centre in Kannur, with available
     46 bed space. All these were filled with Covid positive cases and later,
     some of the beds became vacant on discharge of patients. Moreover,
     total persons under surveillance (both institution and house) will come
     to 22861 as on 01.07.2020. Kannur Airport is receiving around 1000
     passengers daily and since Antibody Test is done at Airport, around
     20% of people have to be shifted to Covid Treatment Centre till their
     confirmatory test results come. Per day the respondents are getting 25
     positive cases. This will definitely increase the load on all the hospitals.
     So CFTC started to be attached to each Hospital and should be very
     near to it.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (e) In order to immediately address pressing medical issues and to
     meet any shortage of medical facilities in the near future, the District
     Administration went in search of suitable buildings to be converted as

     Hospitals and the Govt. Hospitals managing the Covid patients and
     has identified 'Z Plus Apartments' as suitable space nearly 50 metres
     away from the District Headquarters Hospital to admit Covid positive
     case as a 1st Line Treatment Centre. This Centre itself can admit
     nearly 275 Covid suspected patients.

     after their inspection, it was decided to conduct a meeting in the
     Chamber of Additional District Magistrate to discuss the further action.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      (g) It was further contended that the averments of the petitioners that
     they did not have any notice of taking over before issuance of order
     dated 28.06.2020 is absolutely incorrect. The contention that the
     owners of the apartments were not given sufficient time to remove their
     valuables in the buildings is not correct and denied. It is further
     contended that following the visit of the District Administration and the
     inspection, a meeting was convened in the Chamber of the Additional
     District Magistrate, Kannur, on 27.06.2020, to discuss the taking over
     of this building. Second petitioner Mr. Mashood, the builder and P.V.
     Sandeep, the Manager of the Apartment were present in the meeting
     and they had agreed to take over this apartment immediately, to be
     used as a Covid First Line Treatment Centre. The Builder, the 2 nd

     meeting regarding the taking over of the apartment. However, he
     stated that many of the flats were already registered in favour of
     individual owners and some of them are residing abroad. He also
     promised in the meeting to make available the details of individual
     owners of the flats. But, he has not furnished any details as promised.

     returned to the owners of the buildings consequent to the decision of
     the Government to have Home Quarantine for expatriates returning to
     the State. Many of those buildings are now functioning as paid
     quarantine centres. Hence, taking over these buildings after evicting
     quarantine persons is a difficult task. The non-availability of other
     spacious buildings near the Covid Hospitals that can be made
     functional as First Line Treatment Centres is a matter of grave concern
     which led the District administration to take over the present building.

      specifically prescribe issuance of a requisition in writing before

      bound to follow the procedure. Such a procedure is prescribed for
      the reason that by taking over the building, if it is residential, it is
      taking away the fundamental right of the citizen. The failure on the

the context of Land Acquisition and Requisition laws. It is well known that

if a Statute has not defined an expression or word, external aid from

similar laws can be taken, if there is a pari materia provision in other laws.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_93">The guiding principles as regards, what is pari materia, have been

considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in some decisions, which we

deem fit to consider as hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_346">          (I) In Sutherland, in 'Statutory Construction', 3rd Edition, Vol. 2,
          at p. 535, states as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_347">             "Statutes are considered to be in pari materia - to
             pertain to the same subject matter-when they relate to
             the same person or thing, or to the same class of
             persons or things, or have the same purpose or object."
         The learned author, further states, at p. 537 :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_348">             "To be in pari materia, statutes need not have been
             enacted simultaneously or refer to one another."
       Again, at p. 544, it is stated :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_349">             "When the legislature enacts a provision, it has before it
             all the other provisions relating to the same subject
             matter which it enacts at that time, whether in the same
             statute or in a separate act. It is evident that it has in
             mind the provisions of a prior act to which it refers,
             whether it phrases the later act as an amendment or an
             independent act. Experience indicates that a legislature
             does not deliberately enact inconsistent provisions
             when it is cognizant of them both, without expressly
             recognizing the inconsistency."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_350">         The canon of construction, under these circumstances, is
         stated by the author, at p. 531 :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_351">             "Prior statutes relating to the same subject matter are
             to be compared with the new provision; and if possible
             by reasonable construction, both are to be so construed
             that effect is given to every provision of each. Statutes
             in pari materia although in apparent conflict, are so far
             as reasonably possible construed to be in harmony with
             each other."

         The entire bundle of rights which was vested in the original
         holder passes on acquisition to the acquirer leaving nothing
         to the former Vide : Observations of Mukherjee,. J. in
         Chiranjitlal's case. The concept of acquisition has an air of
         permanence and finality in that there is transference of the
         title of the original holder to the acquiring authority. But the
         concept of requisition involves merely taking of "domain or
         control over property without acquiring rights of ownership"
         and must by its very nature be of temporary duration.

<blockquote id="blockquote_366">         If requisitioning of property could legitimately continue for an
         indefinite period of time, the distinction between requisition
         and acquisition would tend to become blurred, because in
         that event for all practical purposes the right, to possession
         and enjoyment of the property which constitutes a major
         constituent element of the right of ownership would be
         vested indefinitely without any limitation of time in the
         requisitioning authority and it would be possible for the
         authority to substantially take over the property without
         acquiring it and paying full market value as compensation
         under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_103">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894. We do not think that
         the government can under the guise of requisition continued
         for an indefinite period of time, in substance acquire the
         property, because that would be a fraud on the power
         conferred on the government. If the government wants to
         take over the property for an indefinite period of time, the
         government must acquire the property but it cannot use the
         power of requisition for achieving that object. The power of
         requisition is exercisable by the government only for a
         public purpose which is of a transitory character. If the
         public purpose for which the premises are required is of a
         perennial or permanent character from the very inception,
         no order can be passed requisitioning the premises and in
         such a case the order of requisition, if passed, would be a
         fraud upon the statute, for the government would be
         requisitioning the premises when really speaking they want
         the premises for acquisition, the object of taking the
         premises being not transitory but permanent in character.
         Where the purpose for which the premises are required is of
         such a character that from the very inception it can never be
         served by requisitioning the premises but can be achieved
         only by acquiring the property which would be the case

         extended meaning could be attributed to the words
         so as to bring all matters fairly within the scope of
         such a statute even though outside the letter, if within
         its spirit or reason. But both Maxwell and Crawford
         administered a caution in resorting to such a
         construction. Maxwell says at p.68 of his book:
             "The construction must not, of course, be strained

         meaning of the words."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_401">         Crawford says that a liberal construction does not

         the language is plain and unambiguous and admits of
         only one meaning, no question of construction of a
         statute arises, for the Act speaks for itself. It is a well

          that which, upon the whole, is the true meaning shall
          prevail, in spite of the grammatical construction of a
          particular part of it." And substantially the same
          opinion is expressed by Lord Selborne in Caledonian
          Ry, v. North British Ry. (1881) 6 AC 114 (222):-- "The
          mere literal construction of a statute ought not to
          prevail if it is opposed to the intentions of the
          legislature as apparent by the statute, and if the words
          are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other
          construction by which, that intention can be better
          effectuated." Again Lord Fitzgerald in Bradlaugh v.
          Clarke, (1883) 8 AC 354 at p. 384 observed as
          follows:-- "I apprehend it is a rule in the construction
          of statutes that in the first instance the grammatical
          sense of the words is to be adhered to. If that is
          contrary to, or inconsistent with, any expressed
          intention or declared purpose of the statutes, or if it
          would involve any absurdity, repugnance, or
          inconsistency, the grammatical sense must then be
          modified, extended, or abridged, so far as to avoid
          such an inconvenience, but no further." 11. Maxwell in
          his book on Interpretation of Statutes (11 th Edition) at
          page 226 observes thus:--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_405">            "The rule of strict construction, however, whenever
          invoked, comes attended with qualifications and other
          rules no less important, and it is by the light which
          each contributes that the meaning must be
          determined. Among them is the rule that that sense of
          the words is to be adopted which best harmonises
          with the context and promotes in the fullest manner
          the policy and object of the legislature. The
          paramount object, in construing penal as well us other
          statutes, is to ascertain the legislative intent and the
          rule of strict construction is not violated by permitting
          the words to have their full meaning, or the more
          extensive of two meanings, when best effectuating the
          intention. They are indeed frequently taken in the
          widest sense, sometimes even in a sense more wide
          than etymologically belongs or is popularly attached
          to them, in order to carry out effectually the legislative
          intent, or, to use Sir Edward Cole's words, to suppress

      (1975) 3 All. ER 1050, it has been held that normally a statutory
      provision consists of a general description of some factual
      situation and the legal consequences ensuing from it.
      Whether the general description is wide or narrow, it will have
      some limits. The question before a court of law in dealing
      with a statute is whether the factual situation proved before it
      falls within the general description given in the statute. A real
      difficulty in determining the right answer can be said to arise
      from an "ambiguity" in the statute. It is in this sense that
      the words, "ambiguity" and "ambiguous" are widely used
      in judgments.

          primary rule of construction is that the intention of the
          legislature must be found in the words used by the
          legislature itself. If the words used are capable of one
          construction, only then it would not be open to the courts
          to adopt any other hypothetical construction on the
          ground that such hypothetical construction is more
          consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act.
          The words used in the material provisions of the statute
          must be interpreted in their plain grammatical meaning
          and it is only when such words are capable of two
          constructions that the question of giving effect to the

          words to a statute or read words which are not there in it.

        ambiguity, vagueness, uncertainty, or absurdity which were not

        should open its interpretation tool kit containing the settled
        rules of construction and interpretation, to arrive at the true
        meaning of the provision. While using the tools of
        interpretation, the court should remember that it is not the
        author of the Statute who is empowered to amend, substitute
        or delete, so as to change the structure and contents. A court
        as an interpreter cannot alter or amend the law. It can only
        interpret the provision, to make it meaningful and workable so
        as to achieve the legislative object, when there is vagueness,

          preamble, the existing state of the law, other statutes in
          pari materia, and the mischief which I can, by those and

             construing a statute, it is necessary, to seek the
             intention of its maker. A statute has to be
             construed according to the intent of them that
             make it hand the duty of the court is to act upon
             the true intention of the legislature. If a statutory
             provision is open to more than one interpretation,
             the court has to choose that interpretation which
             represents the true intention of the legislature.
             This task very often raises difficulties because of
             various reasons, inasmuch as the words used
             may not be scientific symbols having any precise
             or definite meaning and the language may be an
             imperfect medium to convey one's thought or that
             the assembly of legislatures consisting of
             persons of various shades of opinion purport to
             convey a meaning which may be obscure. It is
             impossible even for the most imaginative
             legislature to forestall exhaustively situations and
             circumstances that may emerge after enacting a
             statute where its application may be called for.
             Nonetheless, the function of the courts is only to
             expound and not to legislate. Legislation in a
             modern State is actuated with some policy to
             curb some public evil or to effectuate some public
             benefit. The legislation is primarily directed to the
             problems before the legislature based on
             information derived from past and present
             experience. It may also be designed by use of
             general words to cover similar problems arising
             in future. But, from the very nature of things, it is
             impossible to anticipate fully in the varied
             situations arising in future in which the
             application of the legislation in hand may be
             called for and words chosen to communicate
             such indefinite referents are bound to be in many
             cases, lacking in clarity and precision and thus
             giving rise to controversial questions of
             construction. The process of construction
             combines both literal and purposive approaches.
             In other words, the legislative intention i.e. the
             true or legal meaning of an enactment is derived
             by considering the meaning of the words used in
             the enactment in the light of any discernible
             purpose or object which comprehends the

             unreasonableness, which can more appropriately
             be called irrationality, (ii) illegality and (iii)
             procedural impropriety (See Council of civil
             <a href="/doc/109461158/" id="a_169">Services Union v. Minister</a> for the civil Services
             1985 AC 374, which decision has been accepted
             by this Court as well). The applicability of
             doctrine of proportionality even in administrative
             law sphere is yet a debatable issue. (See the
             opinions of Lords Lowry and Ackner in <a href="/doc/861688/" id="a_170">R. v.
             Secretary of State</a> for the Home Department Ex-
             parte Bring, 1991 AC 696. It would be rather odd
             if an enactment were to be struck down by
             applying the said principle when its applicability
             even in the administrative law sphere is not fully
             and finally settled."

              Both are important. That interpretation is best
              which makes the textual interpretation match the
              contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we

              section by section, clause by clause, phrase by
              phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at,
              in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of
              the statute maker, provided by such context, its
              scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases, and

              the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute

<blockquote id="blockquote_480">             42. In Jones v. Wrotham Park Settled Estates

             terms:-

                results which would clearly defeat the
                purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task
                on which a court of justice is engaged remains
                one of construction, even where this involves
                reading into the Act words which are not
                expressly included in it. <a href="/doc/1913517/" id="a_174">Kammins Ballrooms

                in that case the three conditions that must be
                fulfilled in order to justify this course were
                satisfied. First, it was possible to determine
                from a consideration of the provisions of the
                Act read as a whole precisely what the
                mischief was that it was the purpose of the Act
                to remedy; secondly, it was apparent that the
                draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                   98</span>



                overlooked, and so omitted to deal with an
                eventuality that required to be dealt with if the
                purpose of the Act was to be achieved; and
                thirdly, it was possible to state with certainty
                what were the additional words that would
                have been inserted by the draftsman and
                approved by Parliament had their attention
                been drawn to the omission before the Bill
                passed into law. Unless this third condition is
                fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to
                repair the omission in the Act cannot be
                justified as an exercise of its jurisdiction to
                determine what is the meaning of a written law
                which Parliament has passed."

                Supply v. A. Rajappa</a> (1978)ILLJ349SC

                DENNING, L.J. while dealing with the
                definition of 'Industry in the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_176">Industrial
                Disputes Act</a>, 1947. The definition is so
                general and ambiguous that BEG, C.J. said
                that the situation called for "some judicial
                heroics to cope with the difficulties raised".
                K. IYER, J., who delivered the leading
                majority judgment in that case referred with
                approbation the passage extracted above
                from the judgment of DENNING, L.J. in
                Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher. But in
                the same continuation he also cited a
                passage from the speech of LORD
                SIMONDS in the case of Magor &amp; St.
                Mellon's <a href="/doc/65259249/" id="a_177">R.D.C. v. Newport Corporation</a>,
                1951(2) All ER 839 as if it also found a part
                of the judgment of DENNING, L.J. This
                passage reads: "The duty of the court is to
                interpret the words that the legislature has
                used. Those words may be ambiguous, but,
                even if they are, the power and duty of the
                Court to travel outside them on a voyage of
                discovery are strictly limited." As earlier
                noticed LORD SIMONDS and other Law
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                   99</span>



                Lords in Magor and St. Mellon's case were
                highly critical of the views of DENNING, L.J.
                However, as submitted above, the criticism
                is more because of the unconventional
                manner in which the rule of construction was
                stated by him. In this connection it is
                pertinent to remember that although a court
                cannot supply a real casus omissus it is
                equally clear that it should not so interpret a
                statute as to create a casus omissus when
                there is really none."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_484">                 "The court has to interpret a statute and
                 apply it to the facts. Hans Kelsen in his Pure
                 Theory of Law. (p. 355) makes a distinction
                 between interpretation by the science of law

                 interpretation by a law-applying organ
                 (especially the court) on the other. According
                 to him "jurisprudential interpretation is purely
                 cognitive ascertainment of the meaning of
                 legal norms. In contradistinction to the

                 jurisprudence           interpreting        law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_486">                 Jurisprudential interpretation can do no more
                 than exhibit all possible meanings of a legal
                 norm. Jurisprudence as cognition of law
                 cannot decide between the possibilities
                 exhibited by it, but must leave the decision
                 to the legal organ who, according to the
                 legal order, is authorised to apply the law".
                 According to the author if law is to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                  100</span>



                applied by a legal organ, he must determine
                the meaning of the norms to be applied : He
                must 'interpret' those norms (p. 348).
                Interpretation therefore is an intellectual
                activity which accompanies the process of
                law application in its advance from a higher
                level to a lower level. According to him, the
                law to be applied is a frame. "There are
                cases      of    intended      or   unintended
                indefiniteness at the lower level and several
                possibilities are open to the application of
                law." the traditional theory believes that the
                statute, applied to a concrete case, can
                always supply only one correct decision and
                that the positive-legal 'correctness' of this
                decision is based on the statute itself. This
                theory describes the interpretative procedure
                as if it consisted merely in an intellectual act
                of clarifying or understanding; as if the law-
                applying organ had to use only his reason
                but not his will, and as if by a purely
                intellectual activity, among the various
                existing possibilities only one correct choice
                could be made in accordance with positive
                law. According to the author : "The Legal act
                applying a legal norm may be performed in
                such a way that it conforms (a) with the one
                or the other of the different meanings of the
                legal norms, (b) with the will of the norm-
                creating authority that is to be determined
                somehow, (c) with the expression which the
                norm-creating authority has chosen, (d) with
                the one or the other of the contradictory
                norms; or (e) the concrete case to which the
                two contradictory norms refer may be
                decided under the assumption that the two
                contradictory norms annul each other. In all
                these cases, the law to be applied
                constitutes only a frame within which several
                applications are possible, whereby every act
                is legal that stays within the frame."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_506">           "20. The principles of statutory interpretation are well
           settled. Where the words of the statute are clear and
           unambiguous, the provision should be given its plain
           and normal meaning, without adding or rejecting any
           words. Departure from the literal rule, by making
           structural changes or substituting words in a clear
           statutory provision, under the guise of interpretation
           will pose a great risk as the changes may not be what
           the Legislature intended or desired. Legislative wisdom
           cannot be replaced by the Judge's views. As observed
           by this Court in somewhat different context:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_507">                 "6........"When a procedure is prescribed by
                 the Legislature, it is not for the court to
                 substitute a different one according to its
                 notion of justice. When the Legislature has
                 spoken, the Judges cannot afford to be
                 wiser." (See: <a href="/doc/500723/" id="a_186">Shri Mandir Sita Ramji v. Lt.
                 Governor of Delhi</a> (1975) 4 SCC 298.)"
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_508">           21. There is however an exception to this general rule.
           Where the words used in the statutory provision are
           vague and ambiguous or where the plain and normal
           meaning of its words or grammatical construction
           thereof would lead to confusion, absurdity, repugnancy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                  104</span>



           with other provisions, the courts may, instead of
           adopting the plain and grammatical construction, use
           the interpretative tools to set right the situation, by
           adding or omitting or substituting the words in the
           Statute. When faced with an apparently defective
           provision in a statute, courts prefer to assume that the
           draftsman had committed a mistake rather than
           concluding that the Legislature has deliberately
           introduced an absurd or irrational statutory provision.
           Departure from the literal rule of plain and straight
           reading can however be only in exceptional cases,
           where the anomalies make the literal compliance of a
           provision impossible, or absurd or so impractical as to
           defeat the very object of the provision. We may also
           mention purposive interpretation to avoid absurdity and
           irrationality is more readily and easily employed in
           relation to procedural provisions than with reference to
           substantive provisions.

              within the permissible bounds of interpretation, is
              to give effect to Parliament's purpose. So the
              controversial provisions should be read in the
              context of the statute as a whole, and the statute
              as a whole should be read in the historical

               legislator, concerned to implement some wholly
               normal concept of social justice, would be
               constrained to admit that if the existing law

           Ordinarily, if a statute is well-drafted and debated in
           Parliament there is little or no need to adopt any
           interpretation other than a literal interpretation of the
           statute. However, in a welfare State like ours, what is
           intended for the benefit of the people is not fully
           reflected in the text of a statute. In such legislations, a
           pragmatic view is required to be taken and the law
           interpreted purposefully and realistically so that the
           benefit reaches the masses.

               general intendment of the provisions. They are

genuine tenants from evicting from the premises, under the control of

public sector undertakings/financial institutions, the High Court allowed the

revision and directed the bank to review. Correctness of the same was

</p>
<p id="p_121">      106. On the aspect of discretion, let us consider a few decisions.

</p><p id="p_122">      (i) <a href="/doc/390786/" id="a_225">In Suman Gupta and others v. State of Jammu and Kashmir and
others</a> reported in (1983) 4 SCC 339, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while
explaining as to how administrative discretion should be exercised, at paragraph
No.6, held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_590">         "The exercise of all administrative power vested in public
         authority must be structured within a system of controls informed
         by both relevance and reason - relevance in relation to the
         object which it seeks to serve, and reason in regard to the
         manner in which it attempts to do so. Wherever the exercise of
         such power affects individual rights, there can be no greater
         assurance that protecting is a valid exercise than its governance
         by these twin tests. A stream of case law radiating from the now
         well known decision in this Court in <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_226">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of
         India</a> reported in (1978) 1 SCC 248 has laid down in clear terms
         that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_227">Article 14</a> of the Constitution is violated by powers and
         procedures which in themselves result in unfairness and
         arbitrariness. It must be remembered that our entire
         constitutional system is founded in the rule of law, and in any
         system so designed it is impossible to conceive of legitimate
         power which is arbitrary in character and travels beyond the
         bounds of reason."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_591">      In the above reported judgement, the Hon'ble Apex Court further
      held as under:
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_120"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                      125</span>



<blockquote id="blockquote_592">         "We do not doubt that in the realm of administrative power the
         element of discretion may properly find a place, where the
         statute or the nature of the power intends so. But there is a well
         recognised distinction between an administrative power to be
         exercised within defined limits in the reasonable discretion of
         designated authority and the vesting of an absolute and
         uncontrolled power in such authority. One is power controlled by
         law countenanced by the Constitution, the other falls outside the
         Constitution altogether."</blockquote><p id="p_123">
</p><p id="p_124">       (ii) Reiterating as to how the discretionary power has to be exercised, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/476799/" id="a_228">Sant Raj and another v. O.P.Singla and others</a>
reported in (1985) 2 SCC 349, held as under:

          private opinion, according to law and not humour. It is to be not
          arbitrary, vague and fanciful but legal and regular and it must be
          exercised within the limit to which an honest man to the
          discharge of his office ought to find himself. Discretion means
          sound discretion guided by law. It must be governed by rule, not
          by humour, it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful."</blockquote><p id="p_125">

reported in 1989 1 SCC 89, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that exercise of
discretion should be legitimate, fair and without any aversion, malice or affection.
Nothing should be done which may give the impression of favouritism or
nepotism. While fair play in action in such matters is an essential requirement,
"free play in the joints" is also a necessary concomitant for an administrative
body functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi-administrative sphere as
the present one.

<p id="p_127">       (iv) While considering, a litigation arising out of Bangalore Development
Authority Act, 1976, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1460318/" id="a_230">Bangalore Medical Trust v.
B.S.Muddappa and others</a> reported in (1991) 4 SCC 54, held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_594">         "Discretion is an effective tool in administration. It provides an
         option to the authority concerned to adopt one or the other
         alternative. But a better, proper and legal exercise of discretion
         is one where the authority examines the fact, is aware of law
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                     126</span>



         and then decides objectively and rationally what serves the
         interest better. When a statute either provides guidance or rules
         or regulations are framed for exercise of discretion then the
         action should be in accordance with it. Even where statutes are
         silent and only power is conferred to act in one or the other
         manner, the Authority cannot act whimsically or arbitrarily. It
         should be guided by reasonableness and fairness. The
         legislature never intends its authority to abuse the law or use it
         unfairly. Where the law requires an authority to act or decide, 'if
         it appears to be necessary' or if he is 'of opinion that a particular
         act should be done' then it is implicit that it should be done
         objectively, fairly and reasonably. In a democratic set up the
         people or community being sovereign the exercise of discretion
         must be guided by the inherent philosophy that the exercise of
         discretion is accountable for his action. It is to be tested on an
         anvil of rule of law and fairness or justice particularly if
         competing interests of members of society is involved.
         Decisions affecting public interest or the necessity of doing it in
         the light of guidance provided by the Act and rules may not
         require intimation to the person affected yet the exercise of
         discretion is vitiated if the action is bereft of rationality, lacks
         objective and purposive approach. Public interest or general
         good or social betterment have no doubt priority over private or
         individual interest but it must not be a pretext to justify the
         arbitrary or illegal exercise of power. It must withstand scrutiny
         of the legislative standard provided by the statute itself. The
         authority exercising discretion must not appear to be impervious
         to legislative directions. The action or decision must not only be
         reached reasonably and intelligibly but it must be related to the
         purpose for which power is exercised. No one however high can
         arrogate to himself or assume without any authorization express
         or implied in law a discretion to ignore the rules and deviate
         from rationality by adopting a strained or distorted interpretation
         as it renders the action ultra virus and bad in law."</blockquote><p id="p_128">

the Hon'ble Supreme Court explaining the scope of judicial review of executive
action has held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_596">            "15. One of the points that falls for determination is the scope
            for judicial interference in matters of administrative decisions.
            Administrative action is stated to be referable to a broad area
            of governmental activities in which the repositories of power
            may exercise every class of statutory function of executive,
            quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial nature. It is trite law that
            exercise of power, whether legislative or administrative, will
            be set aside, if there is manifest error in the exercise of such
            power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary (see
            <a href="/doc/1901448/" id="a_235">State of U.P. v. Renusagar Power Co</a>.). At one time, the
            traditional view in England was that the executive was not
            answerable where its action was attributable to the exercise of
            prerogative power. Professor de Smith in his classical work
            Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 4 th Edn. at pp.285-87
            states the legal position in his own terse language that the
            relevant principles formulated by the courts may be broadly
            summarised as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_597">                      "The authority in which discretion is vested can be
               compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it
               in any particular manner. In general, discretion must be
               exercised only by the authority to which it is committed.
               That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter
               before it; it must not act under the dictates of another
               body or disable itself from exercising discretion in each
               individual case. In the purported exercise of its discretion,
               it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                      128</span>



               it do what it has not been authorised to do. It must act in
               good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations
               and must not be influenced by irrelevant considerations,
               must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to
               the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and
               must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. These several
               principles can conveniently be grouped in two main
               categories: (i) failure to exercise discretion, and (ii)
               excess or abuse of discretionary power. The two classes
               are not, however, mutually exclusive. Thus, discretion
               may be improperly fettered because irrelevant
               considerations have been taken into account, and where
               an authority hands over its discretion to another body it
               acts ultra vires."</blockquote><p id="p_134">

</p><p id="p_135">       (ix) <a href="/doc/777136/" id="a_236">In Indian Railway Construction Co. Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar</a> reported in
(2003) 4 SCC 579, at paragraphs Nos.14 &amp; 15, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
explained the manner in which discretionary power has to be exercised, while
discharging an administrative function and held that in matters relating to
administrative functions, if a decision is tainted by any vulnerability as such
illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety, Courts should not hesitate to
interfere, if the action falls within any of the categories stated supra. The relevant
portion reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_598">            "14. The present trend of judicial opinion is to restrict the
            doctrine of immunity from judicial review to those class of
            cases which relate to deployment of troops, entering into
            international treaties etc. The distinctive features of some of
            these recent cases signify the willingness of the courts to
            assert their power to scrutinize the factual basis upon which
            discretionary powers have been exercised. One can
            conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on
            which administrative action is subject to control by judicial
            review. The first ground is "illegality", the second
            "irrationality", and the third "procedural impropriety". These
            principles were highlighted by Lord Diplock in Council of
            Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service
            (commonly known as CCSU case). If the power has been
            exercised on a non-consideration or non-application of mind
            to relevant factors, the exercise of power will be regarded
            as manifestly erroneous. If a power (whether legislative or

          administrative) is exercised on the basis of facts which do
          not exist and which are patently erroneous, such exercise
          of power will stand vitiated. (<a href="/doc/1462614/" id="a_237">See CIT v. Mahindra and
          Mahindra Ltd</a>.) The effect of several decisions on the
          question of jurisdiction has been summed up by Grahame
          Aldous and John Alder in their book Applications for Judicial
          Review, Law and Practice thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_599">                    "There is a general presumption against ousting
            the jurisdiction of the courts so that statutory provisions
            which purport to exclude judicial review are construed
            restrictively. There are, however, certain areas of
            governmental activity, national security being the
            paradigm, which the courts regard themselves as
            incompetent to investigate, beyond an initial decision as
            to whether the Government's claim is bona fide. In this
            kind of non-justiciable area judicial review is not entirely
            excluded, but very limited. It has also been said that
            powers conferred by the Royal Prerogative are
            inherently unreviewable but since the speeches of the
            House of Lords in Council of Civil Service Unions v.
            Minister for the Civil Service this is doubtful. Lords
            Diplock, Scarman and Roskill appeared to agree that
            there is no general distinction between powers, based
            upon whether their source is statutory or prerogative but
            that judicial review can be limited by the subject-matter
            of a particular power, in that case national security.
            Many prerogative powers are in fact concerned with
            sensitive, non-justiciable areas, for example, foreign
            affairs, but some are reviewable in principle, including
            the prerogatives relating to the civil service where
            national security is not involved. Another non-justiciable
            power is the Attorney-General's prerogative to decide
            whether to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the
            public interest." (Also see Padfield v. Minister of
            Agriculture, Fisheries and Food)

         vulnerability enumerated above: like illegality, irrationality and

Supreme Court, while testing the correctness of the judgment rendered under
the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_239">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985, and the discretion to
be exercised by the High Court, explained the principles governing the mode of
exercise of the discretionary power for public functionaries as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_601">         "20. When anything is left to any person, judge or Magistrate to
         be done according to his discretion, the law intends it must be
         done with sound discretion, and according to law. In its ordinary
         meaning, the word "discretion" signifies unrestrained exercise of
         choice or will; freedom to act according to one's own judgment;
         unrestrained exercise of will; the liberty or power of acting
         without control other than one's own judgment. But, when
         applied to public functionaries, it means a power or right
         conferred upon them by law, of acting officially in certain
         circumstances according to the dictates of their own judgment
         and conscience, uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of
         others. Discretion is to discern between right and wrong; and
         therefore, whoever hath power to act at discretion, is bound by
         the rule of reason and law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_602">             21. Discretion, in general, is the discernment of what is right
         and proper. It denotes knowledge and prudence, that
         discernment which enables a person to judge critically of what is
         correct and proper united with caution; nice discernment, and
         judgment directed by circumspection; deliberate judgment;
         soundness of judgment; a science or understanding to discern
         between falsity and truth, between wrong and right, between
         shadow and substance, between equity and colourable glosses
         and pretences, and not to do according to the will and private
         affections of persons.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_603">              22. The word "discretion" standing single and unsupported
         by circumstances signifies exercise of judgment, skill or wisdom
         as distinguished from folly, unthinking or haste;evidently
         therefore a discretion cannot be arbitrary but must be a result of
         judicial thinking. The word in itself implies vigilant circumspection
         and care; therefore, where the legislature concedes discretion it
         also imposes a heavy responsibility. "The discretion of a judge is
         the law of tyrants; it is always unknown. It is different in different
         men. It is casual, and depends upon constitution, temper and
         passion. In the best it is often times caprice; in the worst it is
         every vice, folly, and passion to which human nature is liable,"

         rules to a judge as distinguished from a ministerial or
         administrative official, in adjudicating on matters brought before
         him, it is judicial discretion. It limits and regulates the exercise of
         discretion, and prevents it from being wholly absolute,

         deprived of his property save by authority of law,
         meaning thereby that a person cannot be deprived of
         his property merely by an executive fiat, without any
         specific legal authority or without the support of law
         made by a competent legislature. The expression
         'Property' in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_253">Article 300A</a> confined not to land alone,

         public purpose or public interest. The concept of
         eminent domain which applies when a person is
         deprived of his property postulates that the purpose
         must be primarily public and not primarily of private
         interest and merely incidentally beneficial to the
         public. Any law, which deprives a person of his
         private property for private interest, will be unlawful
         and unfair and undermines the rule of law and can
         be subjected to judicial review. But the question as
         to whether the purpose is primarily public or private,

           judicial function as well as an administrative function is to
           arrive at a just decision. <a href="/doc/639803/" id="a_272">In A.K. Kraipak and Ors. v.

           administrative power and a quasi-judicial power is quite
           thin and is being gradually obliterated. For determining

           the power conferred; (ii) the person or persons on whom

           capable of a precise definition. The underlying principle
           of natural justice, evolved under the common law, is to
           check arbitrary exercise of power by the State or its
           functionaries. therefore, the principle implies a duty to
           act fairly i.e. fair play in action. In A.K. Kraipak (supra), it
           was observed that the aim of rules of natural justice is to
           secure justice or to put it negatively to prevent
           miscarriage of justice.

           excludes the application of principles of natural justice,
           because in that event the Court would not ignore the
           legislative mandate, the requirement of giving
           reasonable opportunity of being heard before an order is
           made, is generally read into the provisions of a statute,
           particularly when the order has adverse civil
           consequences which obviously cover infraction of
           property, personal rights and material deprivations for
           the party affected. The principle holds good irrespective
           of whether the power conferred on a statutory body or
           Tribunal is administrative or quasi-judicial. It is equally
           trite that the concept of natural justice can neither be put

contemplated under <a href="/doc/181028/" id="a_284">Section 65</a> is that, if it appears to the authority that

requisitioning such resources or premises" contained in <a href="/doc/181028/" id="a_285">Section 65</a> of the

General, there is a basic and fundamental distinction recognized by law

between requisition and acquisition. A distinction has been made between

acquisition and requisitioning of property in Entry 42 of List Ill in the

Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. The original <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_286">Article 31</a>

Clause (2) of the Constitution of India has also recognized this distinction

between compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of property. The

concept of requisition involves merely taking of "domain or control over

property without acquiring rights of ownership" and must by its very nature

be of temporary duration. Therefore, in view of Entry 42 List III of the

Constitution and the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1667580/" id="a_287">H.D. Vora v. State

of Maharashtra and Others</a> [(1984) 2 SCC 337], requisition of

resources/premises can only be interpreted to mean that taking over of the

temporary control/possession and management of the building by an order

in writing.

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_653">             "Looking at the definition of 'disaster' in paragraph 2(d) of
         the DM Act, 'disaster' means a catastrophe, mishap,
         calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from
         natural or man made causes, or by accident or negligence
         which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or
         damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or
         degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature or
         magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the
         community of the affected area. 'Disaster management'
         means a continuous and integrated process of planning,
         organising, coordinating and implementing measures which
         are necessary or expedient for (i) prevention of danger or
         threat of any disaster; (ii) mitigation or reduction of risk of
         any disaster or its severity or consequences; (iii) capacity -
         building; (iv) preparedness to deal with any disaster; (v)
         prompt response to any threatening disaster situation or
         disaster; (vi) assessing the severity or magnitude of effects
         of any disaster; (vii) evacuation, rescue and relief; and (viii)
         rehabilitation and reconstruction. The first and foremost
         element of disaster management is prevention of danger or
         threat of any disaster. The Disaster Management Authority is
         envisaged to be a body which can perceive the danger
         which could, in all probability, be in the offing. Anticipation of
         a disaster or a threat of a disaster are matters which have to
         be perceived by those involved in the process which means
         that persons of competence, capability, responsibility and
         commitment who have a flair for identifying the possibilities
         of danger and threats of danger, will have to man such
         authorities and such authorities should have a team which
         would be able to smell a problem in anticipation. Otherwise,

          DM Act will necessarily fail. Disaster management will only
          be mitigation or reduction or severity or consequences and
          other matters which may arise for management only after
          the mishap occurs or commences its activity. The laudable
          object of DM Act has been demonstrated to have totally

           matters within the province of either. The Court does

           terse language that the relevant principles formulated
           by the Courts may be broadly summarized as follows.
           The authority in which discretion is vested can be
           compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to
           exercise it in any particular manner. In general,
           discretion must be exercised only by the authority to
           which it is committed. That authority must genuinely
           address itself to the matter before it; it must not act
           under the dictates of another body or disable itself from
           exercising discretion in each individual case. In the
           purported exercise of its discretion, it must not do what
           it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149"> W.As.959&amp;975/2020                     154</span>



           not been authorized to do. It must act in good faith,
           must have regard to all relevant considerations and
           must not be influenced by irrelevant considerations,
           must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter
           or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to
           act, and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. These
           several principles can conveniently be grouped in two
           main categories: (I) failure to exercise a discretion, and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_680">           (ii) excess or abuse of discretionary power. The two
           classes are not, however, mutually exclusive. Thus,
           discretion may be improperly fettered because
           irrelevant considerations have been taken into account,
           and where an authority hands over its discretion to
           another body it acts ultra vires."

           When the power of judicial review is invoked in matters
           relating to tenders or award of contracts, certain
           special features should be borne in mind. A contract is
           a commercial transaction. Evaluating tenders and

           functions. Principles of equity and natural justice stay

           even if a procedural aberration or error in assessment
           or prejudice to a tenderer, is made out.
           The power of judicial review will not be permitted to be
           invoked to protect private interest at the cost of public
           interest, or to decide contractual disputes.

           Unions v. Minister of State for Civil Service, (1984) 3 All
           ER 935 the (GCHQ Case) the House of Lords rationalized
           the grounds of judicial review and ruled that the basis of
           judicial review could be highlighted under three principal
           heads, namely, illegality, procedural impropriety and
           irrationality. Illegality as a ground of judicial review means
           that the decision maker must understand correctly the law
           that regulates his decision making powers and must give
           effect to it. Grounds such as acting ultra vires, errors of
           law and/or fact, onerous conditions, improper purpose,
           relevant and irrelevant factors, acting in bad faith, fettering
           discretion, unauthorized delegation, failure to act etc., fall
           under the heading "illegality". Procedural impropriety may
           be due to the failure to comply with the mandatory
           procedures such as breach of natural justice, such as
           audi alteram partem, absence of bias, the duty to act
           fairly, legitimate expectations, failure to give reasons etc.

           demonstrated how the traditional test of Wednesbury
           unreasonableness has moved towards the doctrine of
           necessity and proportionality. Lord Steyn noted that the
           criteria of proportionality are more precise and more
           sophisticated than traditional grounds of review and
           went on to outline three concrete differences between
           the two:--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_694">           (1) Proportionality may require the reviewing Court to
           assess the balance which the decision maker has
           struck, not merely whether it is within the range of
           rational or reasonable decisions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_695">           (2) Proportionality test may go further than the
           traditional grounds of review in as much as it may
           require attention to be directed to the relative weight
           accorded to interests and considerations.
           (3) Even the heightened scrutiny test is not necessarily
           appropriate to the protection of human rights.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_696">           Lord Steyn also felt most cases would be decided in

           conceded for human right cases proportionality is the
           appropriate test.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_697">           26. The question arose as to whether doctrine of
           proportionality applies only where fundamental human

                come to recognize that this principle
                (proportionality)  is    part  of   English
                administrative law not only when Judges are
                dealing with Community acts but also when
                they are dealing with acts subject to

           rules to consider whether the refusal of asylum status
           was unlawful on the ground that it violated the
           individual's right to family life. A structured

<blockquote id="blockquote_716">           36. Wednesbury and Proportionality-Wednesbury
           applies to a decision which is so reprehensible in its
           defiance of logic or of accepted moral or ethical
           standards that no sensible person who had applied his
           mind to the issue to be decided could have arrived at it.
           Proportionality as a legal test is capable of being more
           precise and fastidious than a reasonableness test as
           well as requiring a more intrusive review of a decision
           made by a public authority which requires the courts to
           'assess the balance or equation' struck by the decision
           maker. Proportionality test in some jurisdictions is also
           described as the "least injurious means" or "minimal
           impairment" test so as to safeguard fundamental rights
           of citizens and to ensure a fair balance between
           individual rights and public interest. Suffice to say that
           there has been an overlapping of all these tests in its
           content and structure, it is difficult to compartmentalize
           or lay down a straight jacket formula and to say that
           Wednesbury has met with its death knell is too tall a
           statement. Let us, however, recognize the fact that the
           current trend seems to favour proportionality test but

           Wednesbury has not met with its judicial burial and a
           state burial, with full honours is surely not to happen in
           the near future.

           action taken was really needed as well as whether it
           was within the range of courses of action which could
           reasonably be followed. Proportionality is more
           concerned with the aims and intention of the decision-
           maker and whether the decision-maker has achieved
           more or less the correct balance or equilibrium. Courts
           entrusted with the task of judicial review has to
           examine whether decision taken by the authority is
           proportionate, i.e. well balanced and harmonious, to
           this extent court may indulge in a merit review and if
           the court finds that the decision is proportionate, it
           seldom interferes with the decision taken and if it finds
           that the decision is disproportionate i.e. if the court
           feels that it is not well balanced or harmonious and
           does not stand to reason it may tend to interfere.

           reference to variables or comparison, it enables the

      (2017) 2 SCC 599, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, at paragraph 13,
      while discussing the scope of judicial review, held as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_722">           "13. ........The powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_325">Article 226</a> are wide - wide
           enough to reach out to injustice wherever it may
           originate. These powers have been construed liberally
           and have been applied expansively where human rights
           have been violated. But, the notion of injustice is
           relatable to justice under the law. Justice should not be
           made to depend upon the individual perception of a
           decision maker on where a balance or solution should
           lie. Judges are expected to apply standards which are
           objective and well defined by law and founded upon
           constitutional principle. When they do so, judges walk the
           path on a road well-travelled. When judicial creativity
           leads judges to roads less travelled, in search of justice,
           they have yet to remain firmly rooted in law and the
           Constitution. The distinction between what lies within and
           what lies outside the power of judicial review is
           necessary to preserve the sanctity of judicial power.
           Judicial power is respected and adhered to in a system
           based on the rule of law precisely for its nuanced and
           restrained exercise. If these restraints are not maintained
           the court as an institution would invite a justifiable
           criticism of encroaching upon a terrain on which it
           singularly lacks expertise and which is entrusted for
           governance to the legislative and executive arms of
           government. Judgments are enforced, above all,
           because of the belief which society and arms of
           governance of a democratic society hold in the sanctity
           of the judicial process. This sanctity is based on
           institutional prestige. Institutional authority is established
           over long years, by a steadfast commitment to a
           calibrated exercise of judicial power. Fear of
           consequences is one reason why citizens obey the law
           as well as judicial decisions. But there are far stronger
           reasons why they do so and the foundation for that must
           be carefully preserved. That is the rationale for the
           principle that judicial review is confined to cases where
           there is a breach of law or of the Constitution."

             'Judicial review' is a great weapon in the hands of the
           judges; but the judges must observe the constitutional
           limits set by our parliamentary system upon the
           exercise of this beneficial power." Commenting upon
           this Michael Supperstone and James Goudie in their
           work Judicial Review (1992 Edn.) at p. 16 say:
             "If anyone were prompted to dismiss this sage
           warning as a mere obiter dictum from the most radical
           member of the higher judiciary of recent times, and
           therefore to be treated as an idiosyncratic aberration, it
           has received the endorsement of the Law Lords
           generally. The words of Lord Scarman were echoed by
           Lord Bridge of Harwich, speaking on behalf of the
           Board when reversing an interventionist decision of the
           New Zealand Court of Appeal in Butcher v. Petrocorp
           Exploration Ltd. 18-3-1991." Observance of judicial
           restraint is currently the mood in England. The judicial
           power of review is exercised to rein in any unbridled
           executive functioning. The restraint has two
           contemporary manifestations. One is the ambit of
           judicial intervention; the other covers the scope of the
           court's ability to quash an administrative decision on its
           merits. These restraints bear the hallmarks of judicial
           control over administrative action."

           the manner in which those decisions have been taken.

           proportionality. In all these cases the test to be
           adopted is that the court should, 'consider whether
           something has gone wrong of a nature and degree
           which requires its intervention'.

           review of an administrative action is very limited.
           Unless the Court comes to a conclusion, that the
           decision maker has not understood the law correctly
           that regulates his decision-making power or when it is
           found that the decision of the decision maker is vitiated
           by irrationality and that too on the principle of
           "Wednesbury Unreasonableness" or unless it is found
           that there has been a procedural impropriety in the
           decision-making process, it would not be permissible
           for the High Court to interfere in the decision making
           process. It is also equally well settled, that it is not
           permissible for the Court to examine the validity of the

               Court is to see whether the decision impugned is
               vitiated by an apparent error of law. The test to
               determine whether a decision is vitiated by error
               apparent on the face of the record is whether the
               error is self-evident on the face of the record or
               whether the error requires examination or
               argument to establish it. If an error has to be
               established by a process of reasoning, on points
               where there may reasonably be two opinions, it
               cannot be said to be an error on the face of the

               to interference by the writ Court. It is only an
               obvious misinterpretation of a relevant statutory
               provision, or ignorance or disregard thereof, or a
               decision founded on reasons which are clearly
               wrong in law, which can be corrected by the writ

               wide enough to quash unreasonable orders. If a
               decision is so arbitrary and capricious that no
               reasonable person could have ever arrived at it,
               the same is liable to be struck down by a writ
               Court. If the decision cannot rationally be
               supported by the materials on record, the same
               may be regarded as perverse.

               sufficiency of the grounds in support of a decision
               to examine the merits of the decision, sitting as if
               in appeal over the decision. The test is not what
               the Court considers reasonable or unreasonable
               but a decision which the Court thinks that no
               reasonable person could have taken, which has
